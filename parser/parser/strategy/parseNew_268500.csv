												Aside from optimization issues at launch (then again who doesn't these days?), this game is fantastic.The difficulty is hitting alot of XCOM players in the face, and there seems to be negativity regarding the turn limits. People saying it limits decision making, or forces run and gun. It doesn't. What it does do is remove the old ""victory through overwatch"" strategy that was so popular (read: OP) in XCOM EU & EW. Yeah, I did it too. Did a run through right before XCOM 2 came out and only lost one soldier. Because I decided to (lazy/didn't care at that point). No challenge at all if you really took your time and especially if had two snipers. Given that this is a guerilla operation in XCOM 2, it is true that your team simply does not have all the time in the world. This does not limit options one bit, rather it punishes mistakes brutally. You do NOT have an extra four turns to screw around on the wrong end of the map ""cleaning up"" safely. You have to be accomplishing something at all times. You end up having to put people in harm's way, and make decisions that are based on the situation at hand as opposed to being able to armchair general your way through by-the-book and not lose a soul.If you enjoy challenge and learning from failure as you would in a roguelike, buy this game. If you are looking to have your hand held and succeed without breaking a sweat, look elsewhere.			"

												GAHHHHHH. So many things to like about XCOM 2 but unfortunately it has one crippling flaw that can literally ruin all gameplay. LOS is still totally broken months after release. Almost every mission I'll get instances of randomly getting shot or grabbed through a wall/floor. In a game where cover and positioning is everything, this is utterly gamebreaking. People do complain a lot that the RNG is broken. Whatever, I don't think so, it sucks sometimes but imo that makes the game more intense and interesting (also kinda more realistic). But for Line of Sight to be broken makes the game a literal luck simulator. Taking cover behind a wall? Trying to stay out of an alien's LOS by flanking around behind walls/cover? Too bad, the enemy saw you through two solid walls and killed Johnny Flanker through said walls. It's hard to explain how crippling this is to the gameplay without actually playing the game, but anyone familiar with any strategy games should understand that LOS is a critical element to playing smart. If it can't be relied upon to be consistent, then you never know if you're putting your soldiers in amazing cover or a killzone. Kinda important distinction there. WIth it being broken, it just doesn't make any sense to even call this a strategy/tactical game...			"

												I love this game.  Best XCom yet.  Why the thumbs down you might ask?After the latest patch the game has become highly unstable.  I have spent the at least 20 hours trying to work around the issue but to no avail (crash replicates on clean install with no mods.  Over 32 GBs of VM allocated. Drivers updated, ect ect).  This is an issue with many players (Pure virtual function being called while app was running (GlsRunning==1)) and the developer is playing the 'its your mods' card (even though many users including myself arent using any).  Stay away for now, game will possibly be broken if you buy it.  Will change this review if they fix the problem.			"

Most negative reviews talk about performance: MSAA will slice your FPS, turn it off or enable FXAA. There will be a patch soon to optimise it.XCOM is back! You don't wanna read a long review (as you wanna BUY THIS & GO PLAY!) so I'll bullet point:+ Aliens are tough as ****. First non-tutorial mission is like a smack with a baseball bat compared to previous XCOM. That's a good thing, struggle is real.+ Much more aliens, many more ""species"" to fight.+ You lost the war (right?) so you play on alien ground. If they decide to use other humans against you or call in extra support during battle - they will.+ Maps are auto-generated and there's variety.+ Nice graphics and troop customisation! My army of YouTubers doesn't need to hide their faces in helmets like last time. All of them look authentic. :D+ STORY PULLED ME IN WITHIN FIRST 15 MIN.  My jaw dropped after tutorial. Won't spoil.+ Plenty of references to previous XCOM.+ Tactical global map - build up resistance pockets in different regions to stop aliens from completing their projects against you.+ Nice gun modding (you can add scopes etc. looted from dead aliens).+ You start most missions concealed so you can AMBUSH ALIENS!-/+ A lot of missions are timed. I like it as you've gotta be swift and firm in your decisions but some people find the timer to be too strict.-/+ Unit healing time has been increased.-/+ How will I concentrate on my job for the next two weeks (at least)?-/+ No more air interceptions. Kind of makes sense but I miss it.- Occasional graphical/animation glitches.- Needs a patch to fix the lag when having AA enabled. Even CynicalBrit is getting lag with his Titan SLI.Will update the review if needs be.			"

 ""Never was so much owed by so many to so few. This was their finest hour."" XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy game developed by the company Firaxis Games with emphasis on tactical combat. Atmosphere & presentation: + The game captures the feel of a resistance force opposing an overwhelming alien occupation. + Excellent soundtrack that keeps the player in the game and sets the mood.+ Detail put into level design and environmental effects is impressive.+ Some fighting mechanics are cinematic, intuitive and entertaining.+ It boasts a healthy variety of equipment, firearms and peripherals.+ Partially destructible environments.+ Interface is minimalist and aesthetically pleasing.+ Offers very high replayability.o Game is not optimized for 4K resolution, causing irregular fps drops.- Quite a few bugs and glitches, ranging from minor clipping issues to enemies shooting through obstacles / walls. [Thanks to Volvox Globator for highlighting these points.]- Occasional in-game slowdowns during certain events, e.g. pause between rounds, calculation of burning effects etc. Combat & gameplay: + The game encourages the player to recruit and build a highly specialised army, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and sophisticated.+ Alien AI behaviour is mostly unpredictable, therefore adding to the title's challenge and replayability.+ Some missions offer a stealth system, allowing the player to scout out the land and enemies before engaging. + Reliable cover system and shooting mechanics, supporting offensive and defensive approaches. + Positioning and taking advantage of terrain are the keys to success.+ Base building and economics add another layer of challenge to the game.+ Broad spectrum of weapon customizations enriches the gameplay.+ For the masochistic hardcore gamers among us, the legendary ‘Ironman’ mode is available.o Learning curve is initially a bit steep, and may deter more casual gamers. In comparison with its predecessor the general level of difficulty is higher. o Missions are rng-based (random number generator), which could result in a lot of timed missions or almost no timed missions. [Thanks to Athena for mentioning this point.] Characters & story: + Campaign playthrough is engaging and provides diversified side quests, with different mission goals and winning conditions. + The narrative is well-delivered, with an even pace and solid character development.+ Extensive customization options for the characters and the possibility to export and import the party setup. + The player is likely to develop emotional attachment to some of the soldiers, increasing the immersion into the game. o Solid voice acting of the entire cast. Summary: XCOM 2 offers a superb strategy experience, which manages to improve the original XCOM formula on every level.

												Xcom2 is more Xcom. It isn't classic Xcom. Go play openXcom for that!Keep in mind the time of this writing.The bad:Odd pauses, technical issues that interfere directly with gameplay such as:  >Line of sight issues with visibly solid walls (why did the enemy see me through an entire skyscraper... oh no, now I'm unexpectedly being shot through the walls, too), the hacking gameplay menu information being obscured by in-game objects, the rare instance of enemies getting extra actions.Balance issues >Hacking is poorly weighted in favor of failure: The rewards for hacking are often too temporary and too impotent to roll the dice on when the penalties are so incredibly severe.  >Swords are overall too risky to use either and stand only as a backup that, more often than not, complicates things by overextending and often ending up causing a new ""pod"" to join the battle. >Psionics and Meme Beacons are intensely overpowered. Think ""What if ghost grenades were even easier to deploy?"" >The AI is still shackled, and this isn't more evident than when you get used to how Sectoids' fearsome psionics are used.The good:The script source is supposedly totally open, and the mod pack is as well. Modding for the game couldn't be any more supported and who can live without Hatsune Miku hair or Stop Wasting My Time.Timers are good. Forcing the player to take action and take *some* risks made for a more interesting game. I found myself moving soldiers completely out of cover in order to commit to attacks I would not have taken in Xcom1.The temptation of MELD, in the previous game, wasn't enough because there was no true penalty for ignoring it other than falling slightly behind in the tech race. Now, you stand to lose soldiers, and all the droppable equipment you outfitted them with.The soldiers are given so much value through equipment and visual customization that losing them almost always hurts.Escaping from some mission types makes for interesting choices as well. I found myself seriously considering taking on some missions, weighing the likelihood of losing soldiers, or the advantage it would earn should it be a success. Eventually recognizing when a mission is unwinnable and running away to fight another day helps write interesting personal stories that aren't just ""and we won again easily!"" The struggle gives depth.The eh:The game arc is still the same as before: The early and mid game are the most interesting segments of the game. They're the moments where you make tactical sacrifices so that the whole group can survive. They're the moments where you're rooting for a critical to land.The late game is still a victory lap where your abilities match or exceed all the challenges the game throws at you except in being outnumbered.It's still Xcom, so what else can I say?Update: Some elements of this review have fallen out of date due to the recent patch in March.Mimic Beacons were significantly balanced (Made more expensive and will now only waste 1-2 enemy actions instead of nearly a *full enemy turn*).Framerate/graphical performance was significantly improved.

 XCOM 2is a turn-based strategy game where we play as ""Commander"". As Commander we need to rise resistance and lead rest of XCOM forces to take back our planet from alien occupation. Pros:+ great graphics and animations+ amazing customization options+ steam workshop ( mods )+ random generating levels ( every level/map feels really different )+ almost every sort of enviroments ( forest,swamps,deserts,cities/villages, snow terrains etc. )+ destructable ares ( most of things can be destroyed but not all )+ big variety in enemy units+ high replayability+ great soundtrack+ interesting story+ better soldier classes each with his own unique weapons/items and skill tree+ harder than previous XCOM+ new concealment mechanic ( stealth/ambush )+ more cutscenes+ some interesting and more likeable characters ( compared to previous one ) Cons: - optimization problems- mirror bugs ( examples: shooting through the wall , unbreakable windows/doors etc.)- timed missions/campaign ( there are many mods making it better or just deleting completly so don't worry)- no more interception missions ( interception wasn't  great but new hacking system isn't that good either  ) Overall rating: 9,5/10

												There are a few day 1 issues going on with performance aswell as some quality of life bugs such as turns hanging on for a few seconds more then they should, but if your're willing to put up with that for a day or 2 you will be treated to one of the most compelling and deep turn based strategy game we've gotten in a  good long while and its only set to get better thanks to a HUGE commitment to mod support by the developer. 10/12 would bang agien (however if you dident like EU / EW and preferd the orignal Xcom games then this game isent for you either)EDIT: a day or 2 is starting to look like a week before we get anything more then a ""we are looking into it"" so yea. not changing the recommendation however if you despise frame drops and dealing with bugs then id hold off, i'll update this review as needed			"

												There are a lot of things about this game that bug the crap out of me. The timed missions, the Avatar project which basically puts a timer on the campaign itself, the scarcity of elerium cores which makes outfitting your squad kind of hard, the same old six person squad size, the needless delays that make the game seem to grind to a halt at the worst possible times...the list goes on and on...But there is a mod for every one of those complaints. Every. Single. One.For everything about this game I din't like, someone else didn't like it either and made a mod to fix it. Then all of these truly amazing modders came along and created wonderful content that took an already impressively open game and expanded it even further. I have no idea how many mods I am currently subscribed to at this point, but every complaint I had about the game when I first bought it has been addressed by the community and my games are much more diverse due to all of the options unlocked through user created content. I'd also like to add that despite having an absurd number of mods active the game is VERY stable. This many mods on something like Fallout New Vegas? Forget about it.So if you enjoyed XCOM and were on the fence about this one you should consider giving it a try. If there is something you heard about it that made you hesitant about picking it up, wait for it to go on sale. I am glad I bought it, though, and it is even better than the previous iteration.			"

												XCOM 2 is a turn based tactical strategy game, releasing on PC in February 2016. The game is a direct sequel to XCOM Enemy Unknown which was released in 2012. XCOM 2 was developed by 2K Games and Firaxis Games. Like the first game, game play is separated into two. A management style simulator of controlling your base, and technologies inside it, whether it be through engineering or scientific research – allowing you to advance certain aspects of your base how you choose. Along with the base management side of the game, there is also a map style function which is where you move your ship around the world to different locations, or hubs of activity. Whilst on the map you will see side missions, your main missions, scrap piles to explore for extra money, along with a plethora of other activities to take part in. The main mechanic in XCOM is of course the tactical squad based game play.  This squad of soldiers can consist of five different classes, which again can be specialized even further by using the skills tree which you earn points in through promoting your squad members. To begin with the classes start out very much the same apart from the weapons that they use. After you have gained a few promotions with the characters you will start to differentiate the classes quite a bit with the abilities they will gain. The actual in game mechanics are very much the same as the previous version of XCOM, but just with general improvements. The game’s cover base system works really well, with some handy UI enhancements that make it easier to see how the cover affects you.  What I wasn’t too keen on was the aiming mechanic. On countless occasions I found myself face-to-face with a foe, and still my percentage chance to hit them with my gun would be around 30%. I know there is always going to be a chance anyone will miss a target, but c’mon, these are trained soldiers in point blank range, it shouldn’t be that low. This became increasingly annoying as you progress through the game onto harder enemies which make a habit of getting up close and personal with you.  Overall I found the game play in XCOM to be really intuitive and very addictive with that “oh one more turn” feel to it. Graphically, XCOM 2 is a really stellar looking title. Absolutely crisp animations of anything that moves, right the way down to the rag doll effect of bodies when they get shot (or blown apart). It just looks so fluid that it feels real. The textures and character models are also really high quality too. Normally in tactical games like this the graphical element is more skinned down on to allow for more focus on the game play but not XCOM 2. It is one of the best looking games to come out in the past 12 months and one that will really challenge your rig if you want to push out max settings.  The voice acting is top notch too; I was a little disappointed that all of the enemies have the same kind of voice, but given that there is plenty of different enemies in the game to begin with, this can be forgiven a bit. I would have liked to have seen a little extra depth used with sound in the game mechanics; there is an element of stealth to the game play, at least at the start of missions. It would have been nice to have some sort of sound meter that would trigger alarms for the enemies if you made too much sound – again just a small improvement which would of made the immersion all that more deeper. The game has varying levels of difficulty for the overall campaign – this of course is down to how hard you want the game to be.  After you have finished one play through of the game you will unlock “Ironman” mode which essentially saves your game after every action you take, meaning you cannot jump back a few saves if you messed something up. You have one chance to succeed and that is it. Given that the side missions in the campaign can make a real impact on how the rest of the game pans out, I see this as a really interesting game mode that has the potential to have endless amounts of replay ability. I have been playing for roughly 15 hours so far and I have just about finished my first play through. I will for sure be trying out the Ironman mode personally to see how hard it really can be. Where you start on the world map, and the in game maps are all randomly generated, so whilst the actual objectives of missions may stay the same, where you carry out those objectives will differ from play through to play through. Technically, I had a couple of issues. The main one being I did get random crashes. A few of these caused my graphics drivers to crash. This stopped when I configured an SLI profile for my two 970s and helped with the overall performance of the game too thankfully.  I was happy enough playing on 1080p given the high quality of the graphics on show to begin with. My rig was not capable of playing at 4k, and to be honest I think you would struggle to find a rig to play any of today’s recent releases on 4k.  Whack you’re AA up to max and you won’t really notice a difference though. XCOM 2 is by far the best game in the series so far; the graphical enhancement of the game, as well as the improvements made on the already core game play mechanics makes this a tactical turn based player’s wet dream. Apart from the technical issues I had, I have struggled to find anything major wrong with this release.  The game’s regular price tag of £34, 99 is the mark of this being a AAA release; the sceptics amongst us will want to wait for this to drop into the sales market but if you are keen to pick up where Enemy Unknown left off, XCOM 2 will definitely keep you entertained for plenty more hours with a greater gaming experience.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Changed review to postive review because I found settings that run the game flawlessly without much sacrifice in visual quality.The fast-paced nature if the game no longer bothers me.I recommend using FXAA, turning Ambient Occlusion and Depth of Field off entirely and putting the Shadows on ""Directional Only"".  With these settings and everything else turned up to Max, I'm running the game at 1440p with 62-64fps in game constantly, and 120+fps in other areas of the game.EDIT: After the patch, I can now run FXAA, SSAO, Bokeh Depth of Field, and All Shadows and am getting 70-90 fps in game and 120fps on the loading screens!  Could not be happier!!  However, I still prefer to keep AO and DoF off and Shadows on Directional Only as I get over 100fps in game consistently and it never dips below 60fps at any time.  It's worth noting that there seems to also be a bug now where SLI users no longer have cover icons (I use SLI and the game runs about 100% better with it, so it's staying on regardless).  For NVIDIA users, I recommend also going into the NVIDIA Control Panel and turning on Anisotropic Optimization; it gives me about a 25-30 fps boost with little, if any, noticeable drop in visual quality.The gameplay is good, the visuals are superb, and the music and sounds are very well done and sound amazing on surround sound.  I recommend it if you enjoy fast-paced tactics games and killing alien scum.			"

												I have 400 hours on this game and I love it.I do not recommend it. Don't support a company that takes giant backwards leaps in performance and features. The bugs, crashes, core technical faults, and issues won't be fixed because they can't be fixed. Seeing units through walls as you pass by, a character being unusable until reloading (bad luck if you're not smart enough to make manual ironman backups this far in) because they fell through a roof onto a prop, the objectives being destroyed instantly by fire and environmental-destructive enemies (Andromedon's natural walking behaviour will destroy it if it comes into contact), as well as a myriad of other issues; almost all are inherently part of the games creation and will not be ""fixed"".I am under the assumption Firaxis's publishers rushed the game out of the door to meet deadlines, because I struggle to believe the developers and entire team(s) thought the game was in a ""version ready"" state, and not late-beta.

												The barrel of the soldier's gun is IN the Sectoid's MOUTH.65% chance to hit.Your hit-chance is above 75%.Guaranteed miss.The Stun Lancer is 30 tiles away.It sprints to your squad, incapacitates one soldier, nearly killing them in the process, and panics two others. Both panicked soldiers throw grenades at their own feet.A Viper is 15 tiles away. Will it use its long-range grab or will it use its long-range poison AoE?Trick question. There are two Vipers. They use both.Is there a sectoid anywhere?No?Wrong. Your best soldier just got mind-controlled. The sectoid fled before you could kill it.You actually made it back from an engagement. Nobody died and the worst damage anyone took was about 5 points of health.Five of the six soldiers you brought are now shaken, reducing their willpower to 0.This game isn't about strategizing a victory. It's about strategizing the most spectacular loss you can, because♥♥♥♥♥♥ain't gonna work out in your favor, even if the percentages seem to.10/10 would hang myself again			"

												I've just looked at a whole selection of 2K games here on Steam. The majority of 2K games seem to be full of bugs. I honestly think we, the gamers share some of the blame. Here's what we do guys (and this applies for a lot of other games):1) NEVER pre-order anything. Dumb dumb dumb. This is giving a blank cheque to the devs to do what they like. 2) Don't buy DLC. Especially for games where the DLC represents a lot of stuff that should just be there in the game anyway. They're playing you for fools (and you're giving them your money!) Oh, and while I'm at it, don't pay real money for computer money so you can have a fancy colour gun or new car or new clothes for your character. It's like dressing up little girls' dollies. Dumb Dumb Dumb. Developers are laughing all the way to the bank on that one. 3) Wait a couple of weeks before buying any game. Check out the reviews. Hold out. If everyone rushes in believing the hype (No Man's Sky, anyone?) - then once they've got your money, there's little incentive to improve. No one will listen to me though! lol ;)by the way, I did buy XCom2 and I really liked it. Tiny bit buggy, but I forgave it because I like the franchise. There's lots to like about it. I recommend it :)			"

												Short Version - XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within are vastly superior to this game. Go buy them instead, or if you have them and want more Firaxis XCOM, install and play the Long War mod.I wanted to like this game so bad. Hundreds of hours into Enemy Unknown and I was ready and raring to go for the next step. And there are certainly next steps in XCOM 2, the Starting concealment, the changes to Psionics, different enemy types, those were all really good ideas. On the other hand, there's simply too many things that can make your game go sideways through literally no fault of your own. In EU, I usually knew when I made a mistake. Sometimes things go poorly one turn, and that's the way it is, and it usually doesn't happen too often unless you're just committed to riding the bullet train of bad decisions. XCOM 2 just is the bullet train of failure, and there's no brakes on that train.Barring the DLC, the art is slick and totally on point, a really good iteration of Enemy Unknown's style. Tygen is cool, but lacks the personality and interest of Vahlen. He's 24/7 cool as a cucumber, and is just constantly aloof, where Vahlen had a proper forward face, but there were plenty of hints through dialogue that at any given time she was basically 2 seconds away from dissecting the nearest thing to her, living or dead, while singing opera. Lily Shen's interest basically drops right after her introduction, she never develops even though she's got the most opportunity to do so. On top of that, she looks EXACTLY like Jackie Ma from Sleeping Dogs, right down to the hairdo and freckles, so that's wierd. The soldier base models are all basically flat, they have zero silhouette and really wierd proportions. Even though there's more customization, somehow it feels more constrained, and I think it's due to there just being less interesting faces and hairdos available.And, once again (see: Batman: Arkham Knight), XCOM 2 has massive performance issues by trying to ship a ""next-gen"" game on a decade-old engine. Like Rocksteady, they bolted too many custom tools and rendering software onto Unreal Engine 3, and while Unreal is a fantastic engine, they both were trying to do rendering that the engine was just not meant to do. So, came the litany of ""I have a top-end machine and I get 20 FPS"" and ""Game crashes at launch"" on forums, and while I only had catastrophic issues once or twice, the load times and frame chug just inside the Skyranger are simply unforgivable.The story of XCOM losing was a bitter pill to swallow, but it gave a good start to why there's more aliens in the future. But beyond that, the presentation just lacks the same punch as Enemy Unknown. It lacks tension and a sense of urgency, even though that's what XCOM 2 is supposed to be completely centered around. I'll go watch the intro cinematic to Enemy Unknown just to watch it, because it gets me totally jazzed up to save the world. Michael McCann kills it with the music, and that stutter cut with the Skyranger gets me giddier than a schoolgirl to go shoot some aliens. On the other hand,the intro to XCOM 2 has scenes that should arguably be even more intense, but the lackluster directing, the totally midtone soundwork, it all made it feel so.... ordinary. Like blowing up ADVENT checkpoints is just what you do on a Tuesday afternoon. Though, Bradford jumping through a window was pretty sweet.The sense of tedium never goes away, as you're constantly shifting back and forth across zones because everything takes too long. You'll rarely finish one activity before you have to go do a guerilla op, oh did you happen to notice, ADVENT's  putting the boots to some hippies in a commune that happen to be our friends, hey you should go look at this wierd spot we found, oh by the way, you need to go pick up your monthly cheque from this spot because we couldn't be arsed to mail it to you direct, and there's a 3 day processing wait, did you want to sell stuff, well you gotta go fly there too, because apparently there's only ONE Black Market bazaar on the planet.There's a nice balance that Enemy Unknown struck between the Strategy and Tactical layers of their game, The Tactical portion was an overt stress-fest of playing hide-and-seek with bullets, doing Hail Marys behind the tiny log that is your only available cover, and hoping to Sweet Baby Ray's that the Meld canister you're after isn't just a total pod-fest of X-rays. The Strategy layer was much more subtle, and the contrast makes the game actually playable. The Strategy layer gives you time to think, to manage your resources and marshal your thoughts on your game plan. It can be a good 10 minutes before another mission crops up, which is good downtime for the player so they aren't keyed up for too long.XCOM 2 learned nothing from its predecessor. The constantly running around, the Doom Ticker front and center, everything takes too long, and missions pop up with an annoying frequency to how much you can actually get done in the Strategy layer before ""Hey, you gotta pop half-way round the world to go save those dirty hippies again"" There's really never time to rest in XCOM 2 and it's frankly exhausting even thinking about booting the game up.The last sticking point, and really the final straw for me, is really how screwed the game balance was, and continues to be. Instead of say, fixing the fact that missions play like a round of ""Whose Line is it Anyway?"", where the shot percentages are made up and the aiming angles don't matter, they decide a good idea is to heavily nerf one of the only options for consistent damage, and taking away the biggest reason you pick Volatile Mix (increased grenade radius). Not even mentioning removing the only means of stopping ""Run-n-Gun"" Chrysallids and Stun Lancers. And there was obviously decisions that were made akin to those bouts of insanity throughout its development. Tons of enemies have armour (DR in EU) and Shieldbearers can give anyone in a huge radius armour, fine. But they took out Shredder rounds, so the only ways are, Psyhic attacks on non-robotic enemies (which bypasses armour, so the rest of your squad is still stuck in DR hell), an extremely high-level perk for Rangers, and the aforementioned nerfed grenades. Thin Men made a new appearance as the Vipers, and they can strangle you from a distance, great! But, (up until a patch a couple weeks ago, where they can't dodge 100% shots anymore), they have a high chance to straight-up ignore half of incoming damage from any weapon that rolls to hit. Your squad starts most missions Concealed, which allows you to try and get the jump on your enemy by (potentially) setting up kill zones to obliterate a pod before they can shoot back, Awesome! But why is there a 10, or even better, a FIVE (yes, five) turn timer on the mission? It completely nullifies the concept of Concealment and geurilla warfare if your only option to succeed in the mission is to dash forward non-stop until you reach the objective, because you WILL run into a pod, you WILL lose Concealment, and after that, you can't hope to just keep running and expect to win.There's things to like in XCOM 2, but it's just such an unfun, buggy mess.

			Join Nathan as he reclaims Earth from the forces of Advent in this review of Xcom 2. Despite being one of our favorite genres, there are far too few turn based tactical games being released these...		

In 2012, Firaxis released Xcom Enemy Unknown which helped breathe new life into the genre and successfully rebooted the classic UFO defense franchise. Now, 4 years later, Xcom 2 hopes to improve on all of the elements of its predecessor.Taking place roughly 20 years after where the first game left off, and in an unusual sense for a sequel, Xcom 2 assumes you failed Enemy Unknown as it now takes place in a dystopian future where the aliens have conquered earth. Rather than defending the planet from UFOs, you’re tasked with bolstering resistance cells across the globe with your mobile, flying fortress; the avenger. This functions in the same way as your underground base from the first title, as you can upgrade it, add new facilities, as well as recruit soldiers while managing research and production.The core concepts are similar to Enemy Unknown and you’re faced with a constant race against the clock since the aliens are developing something called the Avatar project. Certain missions will act to delay the progress of the project, but it's game-over upon its completion. There’s also dark events which can provide random modifiers and buffs to the aliens you encounter. Occasionally you’ll be prompted to complete guerilla missions which allow you to prevent a dark event but you’re unable to stop them all, as you’ll typically have to pick and choose which event is most pressing. The world map functions similarly to Enemy Unknown. You’ll set up a base and will be able to scan the map for certain points of interest. Building radio relays in countries will increase your monthly budget, and continental bonuses make a return, adding some elements of strategy and planning. Upon scanning the map, you’ll frequently be interrupted to go on missions, which are all randomly generated with varying objectives. These objectives range from escorting an NPC, saving civilians, eliminating a target or killing every alien in an area.The turn-based combat is what you’d come to expect from an Xcom game, death is permanent and your soldiers can still possibly miss a point-blank shot which otherwise has a 97% success rate. Stealth has been added, which can allow you to strategically place your soldiers and set up ambushes with overwatch, but a lot of the time you’ll feel rushed as there isn’t much time to complete the objectives in most cases. Taking one extra step is sometimes enough to alert enemies to your presence, so you really have to balance between moving cautiously and completing a mission as fast as possible. That element of randomness can be a detriment, as sometimes a civilian could block a ladder and thus seal off the only way up to a rooftop extraction, or a ridiculous amount of enemies could spawn directly on top of a transmitter you’re otherwise supposed to protect. Which leads to one major issue with Xcom 2, it’s extremely luck based and these random factors can cause you to fail a mission with very little control. You can recover from failed missions, but it does feel a little unfair and can be a major downer for ironman playthroughs in which you only have one save file.The soldier classes feel a lot more fleshed out and distinct from one another as they all kind of blurred together in the previous installment. For example the Ranger is equipped with a sword which can absolutely devastate enemies in melee combat while the specialist has a drone that can hack hostile robotic units or support squad mates from anywhere on the map. The scientists and engineers play more of a role now as well. They’re actually named and can be individually assigned to different projects.Xcom 2 also completely expands on the level of customization, giving a lot more appearance options for your soldiers. You’re also able to modify your soldiers’ weapons with various attachments as well as give them performance enhancing implants. While all of these customization options were quite welcomed, this resulted in some completely broken and overpowered combinations. For example, I had given one of my soldiers a superior repeater which gave him a 15% chance to instantly execute whatever target he was shooting at and as a result I was able to one-shot the hardest enemy in the game. The difficulty in general is kind of spiky, while the game initially starts off as challenging; it quickly becomes too easy upon developing certain technologies. Some better pacing would have greatly alleviated this issue because as it stands, it can switch from being so easy that it’s tedious to frustrating with little warning.At first, there seems to be a greater variety of enemies present in Xcom 2. The majority of enemies you face are Advent troopers, human-like soldiers that support the alien regime, while more familiar aliens such-as sectoids function as lieutenants and are actually a greater threat than the previous games. The other aliens have also evolved over the twenty year gap between Enemy Unknown. Unfortunately you hardly fight them in the latter half of the game as you pretty much always face the same enemies over and over again at that point.I also had some issues with the world map. It gives you so many optional areas to scan for additional supplies and personnel but you’re interrupted every two seconds to take part in another randomly generated mission. There are very few actual story missions, and the random stages can really get tedious in the latter half of the game. There’s also very little rhyme or reason going into the appearance of a stage. You could accept a mission in Africa only for there to be pine trees and snow on the ground, making no sense whatsoever. There are a lot of bugs present in the game as well. From graphical glitches, laggy animations and the odd crash.Xcom 2 promised re-playability with its use of random stages but I would’ve honestly preferred handcrafted levels with more of a narrative. There’s also extra mod support this time around but most of the mods available currently are cosmetic or the odd weapon, which doesn’t really add anything significant to the gameplay.The multiplayer from Enemy Unknown makes an appearance again but it’s even more of a throw-away mode this time around. You’re given even less customization options than before as you’re no longer able to choose the rank and loadout of human soldiers. The turns don’t play out simultaneously and can take an extremely long time as there’s quite a bit of additional lag between them. That combined with crashes and random disconnects make this mode barely playable. The soundtrack is well done and changes to match the mood of the battle as well as the enemies you encounter. Unfortunately, there isn't much variety between tracks and it isn't as memorable as Michael Mccann’s soundtrack from Enemy Unknown who was probably too busy working on Deus Ex Mankind Divided.Ultimately, Xcom 2 makes a very strong first impression but it was all downhill from there though, and towards the end of the game, I couldn’t wait to be done with all the randomly generated filler content. That coupled with an overall lack of pacing made it a bit of a disappointment. It’s an improvement over Enemy Unknown in some areas but a step-back in others. Xcom 2 is by no means a bad game, and will most likely improve with time; I was just expecting a lot more. Pros +	Strong Turn Based Tactical Combat+	Increased Customization Options+	Interesting Premise+	Soldier classes and base management are more refined. Cons -	Repetitive Gameplay and Filler Content-	Numerous Bugs-	Lackluster Multiplayer-	Not enough of an improvement over Enemy UnknownIf you enjoyed this review, please check out our curator page: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AnalogReviewsOfficial#curationThanks for reading,			"

												Listen: At its best, XCOM 2 is a great game and if you liked XCOM EU there is a lot you would like here. The good parts are covered in other positive reviews and I mostly agree with them.However, I cannot recommend this game as a $60 release in the state it is in. To be honest, I rarely buy games new at full price because I simply don't make that much money. However, I made an exception for this one because the buzz/preview coverage was very positive and I loved the formula established in EU. They couldn't mess it up THAT much, could they? In my opinion, they didn't and the gameplay experience is mostly great with a few minor quibbles here and there. But even considering that, the technical state this game is in makes me very wary about buying a game at launch ever again. I feel burned.The most noticeable thing is is that the performance is terrible - I SHOULD be able to run it at ultra or high settings at 60fps but am sitting around medium with occasional slowdown. Honestly it's a minor thing because graphics aren't the biggest deal to me, but it is still something that annoys me given everything else. But if it was the only thing? Totally fine.Unfortunately the bugs in this game are terrible. XCOM at it's best is a tight, no nonense strategy game where you make well thought out, in the moment decisions and live with the consequences. Unfortunately, bugs and crashes interrupt game flow and can make going through missions a slog. I currently have had three crashes in the middle of an action where a crash dialog box would pop up but I would be unable to force quit the game or access the task manager, forcing me to force restart my whole computer. Just my luck as every single time that I happened I was in a hectic situation that was going well for me. At that point I would have to go back to the game, load the last autosave and try and recreate the situation I was in before the game crashed. Completely breaks enjoyment of the game. I've gotten past them, but each time it happens make me less excited to return to the game.I've also had instances where I've completely destroyed all of the walls of a lower floor in the hopes it would drop an enemy from above only to have it not happen? My only guess is that if a ladder connects the ground to an upper floor it makes it so I can't destroy that floor, which is not a  bug I guess, but still ridiculous. In that same instance I couldn't target a unit that was behind said ladder despite there being no walls around it and despite the unit not being in any sort of cover. Right now I'm in a mission where I have to neutralize or knock out an advent VIP. There is a sectopod near the VIP, so I send a unit with chain shot up to try and shoot the sectopod. Presumably both the sectopod and the VIP are in my line of sight, but for whatever reason I can't change between targets - even when clicking the yellow (flanked) VIP icon or trying to tab between targets, it targets the sectopod. That would be fine except every times I confirm the shot on the sectopod, my soldier shoots the VIP. Excuse me? I was able to destroy the sectopod in another way, but only after reloading my autosave and trying to puzzle out how to get the game to do what I wanted (and should have) been able to do.In this same mission, I finally kill the enemies, knock out the VIP, and carry him away. However, when I knocked him out he was next to a burning car. NO MATTER HOW FAR I AM AWAY FROM THE CAR, and NO MATTER HOW MANY MORE UNITS ARE CLOSER TO THE VEHICLE, when the car explodes the VIP takes damage and dies. Once again, even my soldiers who are closer to the car than my unit carrying the VIP don't take damage. Only the VIP. There are other bugs and crashes, but none quite as egregious or memorable like the ones above. At this point I would have to reload the mission in a previous state to try and figure out a way to get past this particular bug. I don't want to do that and shouldn't have to, frankly. I'm not into Ironman difficulties but also don't like save scumming to get the outcome I want. In this case I'm savescumming because the game is messing up, which just sucks! At this point I feel like I'm trying to beat the game because I feel obligated, considering how much time I put into it, not because I really want to. And it's a shame because because the gameplay is pretty good and I should WANT to beat it because of how fun it is! But I just never know which mission is going to be the breaking point, where I finally hit a point where my best soldiers die not because of my mishandling but because of the game's mistakes. THAT is problematic and it  makes me not excited to return to this game. And maybe I won't. Who knows. It's been a month now and things aren't really ironed out still. I understand a lot of games ship in various states of disrepair but it shouldn't be like this. Maybe other people can get past these things, and maybe other people won't even come across these issues, but I personally wouldn't recommend buying this game at full retail price until it is patched extensively.EDIT: Since writing this review I have played for about three more hours, finishing the campaing. Despite the last mission being mostly great, my recommendation of this game remains the same. Aside from the regular shoddy performance, there were a few bad spots: once again selected one target only to somehow shoot at another, and two instances of not being able to throw a grenade/other item farther than a few squares away with two different soldiers in different locations. Was able to use other soldiers/skills to give me the result I more or less wanted, but still I am annoyed I wasn't able to do what I WANTED to do. Those things did not invalidate the mission as a whole but still muddied what should have been a great experience.Overall, the game's technical failings are a shame. When firing on all cylinders, this game is fantastic. However, the game's tight flow is too often interrupted by perfomance issues. Given just how IMPORTANT that flow is to making the game enjoyable, it's a damn shame that there are too many instances of you, the player, not being allowed to experience it. You feel like you're hitting a stride, and then all of a sudden a crash or a bug pops up and you stumble through no fault of your own leaving you to deal with the consequences or get back up and try all over again. That just sucks. Whether you just heard of this game in passing and were intrigued or loved Enemy Unknown, I would highly recommend you do NOT buy this game until there is a hefty sale going on or until it is reliably patched. Preferably the latter. This is a game that should be experienced with no technical caveats as the sytems underneath are enjoyable, addicting, and often rewarding. Unfortunately that time is not now. Or who knows? Maybe you won't experience the bugs I have, as some people didn't. Guess you could just roll the dice.			"

												Having bought this recently, nine months after launch, I am stunned by the amount of glitches. XCOM2 does not feel like a finished game. At this point whenever I load it up, I expect to find a new bug or two.From a carried VIP not registering as alive on EVAC (there is a mod to fix this because the devs apparently could not be bothered?) to graphics glitches like the Make Weapons Available button disappearing, or a soldier's arms disappearing, to a save-breaking bug where the keyboard did nothing after reloading, to line of sight bugs (soldier could not see snake, snake tongue pulled him through solid walls), to getting two mind controlled enemies via lamp post hack instead of one, to Psi Zombies from a Dominated Gatekeeper showing up as lost soldiers on mission end screen. And so on and so forth.Only one of the above has been save-breaking so far, but I will not give a thumbs up to something that just doesn't work right half the time.Having said all that, the premise of the game is still good old XCOM.Good:- Concept of customising soldiers is great.- The guerrilla approach is novel and the turn counters make for good fun, though perhaps are a bit too common.- The gameplay is XCOM when it works. Great stuff.- Lots of nifty weapons and special skills. The skills seem to be better balanced than the original (2012) XCOM, in that you often have to consider your two options at the levelup instead of going for the clearly stronger one.- AWC perks are very cool, though they should be retroactive from the get go, or unlock at the final level if the right one has been passed, or something. 2012 XCOM had the same problem where you had to throw away your original A team because their will ended up inferior to new soldiers.- Shen's Last Gift is a good mission. I have not used the SPARK enough to do it justice, but the concept fits in.Bad:- Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs, glitches and annoying things that aren't working right.- Changing armors resets some customisation options, and sometimes they just bug out and change the props around.- Very slow loading times, slow animations and pauses between turns. Why do I need to press caps lock on a loading screen? Why doesn't the damn thing press it for me?Personal preference:- I found the character models and armors from the 2012 game to look better, more human.- Anarchy's children customisation options (For Digital Deluxe) are mostly glam rock and horror movie props that make no sense in the context of the game. There are a select few exceptions.- The strategy screen has no pause or fast forward buttons and the constant interruptions and holo-globe transitions are very jarring.- I would like to say something about Alien Hunters, but I did the scanning part and the Nest never showed up. Going to go ahead and guess this is another bug.- Swords are inferior to the shotgun, except in very rare and specific conditions.The bottom line in all this is - if you do not own XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within, go buy that instead. If you own that and want more, this is a beta version of a good sequel. I wouldn't pay full price for it.			"

												The game has many significant improvements over XCOM: Enemy Unknown, including.- A new Character Pool feature which lets you make characters from the main menu, which then can be used in your campaign.- You can now freely move around on the world map, it is now more than just a ""scan button.""- There are a lot more character customization options, you can now change the color of your weapon, name it, and many more new features.- XCOM 2 provides more of a challenge than XCOM: Enemy Unknown did.- The story is actually pretty good, (in comparison to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.)- The graphics are significantly better.- You can now customize your soldiers names and appearances in multiplayer.- XCOM 2 officially has mod support.Overall, i would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed XCOM: Enemy Unknown.

												I missed my first shot and I'm on normal difficulty with a 89% chance to hit, plus flanking.WELCOME BACK TO XCOM BABY!!--------EDITS&ADDONS----------20hrs of XCOM BABY later, and I've just dismissed my ""Sharpshooter"" for several other ragequit misses, including no less than a 97%. I heard he has since been employed on an Imperial Star Destroyer as a Stormtrooper. To make this review ""more helpful"", I feel I should add that this IS a game worth buying, though missing often (and often you will) can become a real frustration - you find yourself grinning in sweet revenge when the same RNG happens to the Aliens and they miss you from from point blank range.Shooting mechanics aside, the only other issues I've come across since playing are:- *Mission timers (which mods can fix already). Plus, this is a personal preference, it's not a fact that this makes the game worse. I actually enjoyed some of the missions when realising I had 3 turns remaining to act out the impossible. You really think about what skills you have remaining and use every resource possible to inflict the greatest amount of damage while moving forward as fast as you can. All normally works out well... Assuming you hit the target, that is! *ahem**The occasional bug / framerate drop (which will no doubt be patched very soon). Again, this is computer specific and really, I hardly noticed it once I tweaked my settings. I had to lower a few things, but no biggie!That's it. I see no real reason not to buy this game, especially if you liked Enemy Unknown/Within. I'm currently finding myself pinned down at times on Normal. Yes, NORMAL, and I have no Ironman, and I still finish some missions thinking ""Wow... How did I get outta that one?!"" I can't wait to (hopefully) survive this playthrough and crank up the difficulty to make it even more of a challenge.Good luck fellow Commanders! May your aim be true.And if you miss, channel all that anger, know it happens to the best of us, and tell yourself ""That's XCOM BABY!""			"

												Once again steam reviews are plagued by opinionated people who exagerate the ""cons"" to make it sound far worse than it really is, just because there's some aspects in the game they don't like. I hope I got your attention. Good. Now as many reviewers have said I will say as well. Most negative reviews talk about performance: MSAA will slice your FPS, turn it off or enable FXAA. There will be a patch soon to optimise it.Now that we go that out of the way. X-com 2 is based after the events in X-com 1. You've lost the war, and well.. read the store page for more info. The point is, the game plays like this. You're a resistance cell, not a full fledged world army equipped with the best of everything. Apparently people are down voting because it doesn't play like this. (Get gud?) The biggest complaint apart from optimization is the mission timers in the battles. Most reviews exagerate the mother loving heck out of this as they hate missions which are timed. Fair enough. There IS a mod which removes this already, so if turn timers are not your thing, there you go. If a game is going to have timers for missions, then they need to make sense right? Well in X-com they do. They make perfect sense for the missions which have them. You just broke a highly important VIP to the Aliens out of confinement, you're a resistance cell with limited manpower and resources, of course you're going to have to get the hell out of dodge and fast once you break that guy out. It makes sense no? It's REALISTIC. It's IMMERSIVE.. You know.. those things which people apparently hate in games these days. Setting my own butthurt at societies downfall in terms of gaming aside, the time limit, and how often you run into them is changed depending on difficulty, so if you dont' like timed missions to often, but like them for when they make sense, you can adjust the difficulty level of the game and it will throw less at you. Apart from that, I love how it feels like you are actually a resistance cell in a mobile base. Scavanging for equipment on the battlefield when enemies drop them, selling parts, corpses, and other alien artifacts on the Black Market to get Intel, and buying/trading/selling in Intel on the Black Market to gain goods to fill the holes of research and bad RNG rolls in battles in terms of mods you find, make it feel like you are the aggressors against a superior foe. The stealth system in place for most missions is excellent as well, allowing you to scout out the land and enemies before engaging, and setting up ambushes which could wipe the slate in that area entirely before the aliens have time to respond. There is now a better world map as well, This is where you move your mobile base from region to region, unlock new regions by contacting the resistance cells in that area, and take on side missions to gain supplies, Intel, etc. -----------------Over all the game isn't bad by any means. Some performance issues which should be fixed relatively soon, good immersion, great classic game mechanics from X-com 1.-------------------If you're still wondering about the complaints on this game. There are 2 people on the forums are can articulate points far better than me. There is ALOT of debate on the timers in this game. These are 2 great responses. Martial.lore:The timers are essential. Turtling is not a tactic. The squad isn't trying to find a good picnic spot. XCOM is a guerrilla force that has to make lighting strikes before going back into hiding.This theme is reinforced by every mechanic in the game from the short individual timers on the globe to the reinforcement drops that come when you just desperately want to get everyone to the evac point.Sometimes you just have accept that there was not enough time for your ill-equipped soldiers to complete their objective and stay alive, and sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good.Failure is hard to accept but without the timers the potential for disaster during missions would be missing and the game would not be worthy of the XCOM name.If it didn't upset players complacency and make them furious at how unfair life is then where is the fun in that? Sometimes FTL makes me very angry but it's one of my favorite tactical video games and I am generally very good at playing it.Once I have learned how to succeed with XCOM 2 I imagine that even though they will feel familiar and seem easier to deal with, the timers will still screw up a good plan once in a while and get good people killed.Perish the thought that this were a game in which every move, every action and every decision did not have consequences.Jolly:""It mostly IS blind hate against timers. People complaining without really give it a try, or even trying.""Because most of the timers are idiotic, and pretty much all of them are poorly implemented.""Um, no. Idiotic? That's opinion and not one I'd agree with. Poorly implemented? It's a countdown on the screen - what do you want, an hourglass? I dancing girl who removes clothes til the ""time"" is up? WTF.Most of the people complaining can't seem to let go of their old XCOM ways. They want to turtle thru full cover overwatch and lure aliens into easy kills. It's a weak ""tactic"" that takes advantage of poor AI that suicides into that crap.The timers, which only appear in about half the missions if you actually play the game more than you cry about it, aren't even for entire missions, usually just for objectives. The cause you to move a little fast, to tak risks, take you out of your comfort zone, and they obliterate the cheeseball reliance on overwatch luring.What's sad is that if you actually play the game with an open mind, the timers are no big deal. If you just decide you're going to cry about the timers no matter what, which is ignorant, then you desreve the misery you bring upon yourself.XCOM 2 is a glorious game and a triumph of design. Embrace and love it for everything that it offers, which is a megaton.""			"

												I hate to give this game a negative review. I love Firaxis and I think they make a lot of great games. But I loved the first Xcom they made and I just feel like this doesn't even live up to that standard let alone be a better game. The primary reason I dislike this is that pretty much at every point in the game your on a time limit. In a mission, time limit. On the world screen, time limit. I detest time limits, I want to relax and have fun with a video game. Not feel rushed. At least with the first one it was optional (the meld) in the missions. But here, it's mandatory. Also, I just don't feel strong or like I'm doing a good job in this game at all. It feels like your constantly on the edge of losing. Maybe that works with the story they were trying to create in this game, but it's just not fun. Not for me at least. Not to mention after months of this game being out, there are still performance issues that have yet to be resolved. I'm running on a 970 and I still have bad performance issues. In the end I just think this is worse than Enemy Unknown in just about every way. And I'm really sorry to say that.			"

												Get the game if it is on sale, otherwise it's not worth the $60 USD asking price (Australian store).The game is still broken months after release:-Frame drops at the start of every mission (and loading main menu).-Buggy animations, such as characters shooting through walls or breaking already broken windows to shoot.-Load times to return to base are still stupidly long, which can be reduced to a few seconds if you hit ""caps lock""... no joke just google it.-Line of sight is still broken, enemies can see you through some walls, while other times you can't see enemies that are out in the open.Also don't buy the DLC. It's super lazy and not worth the price... the free mods add more to the game than the paid DLC.On one last note, still no word on controller support, even though a console port is coming.			"

												I really love the X-Com series.  I remember spending hundreds of hours on the Enemy Unknown and Terror from the Deep as a kid and loving every second of it, even the long and tedious multipart ship terror missions and the alien base missions with tentaculats and Lobstermen behind every corner.  The 2012 remake was a welcome addition to the series despite it being simpler than the original.And I definitely like X-Com2 for the most part.  Unfortunately, I just can't recommend it.To begin with, there are the performance issues.  Random frame drops and stutters should NOT be happening with a GTX 1080, especially during in game cinematics.  Then there's the occasional hang ups on enemy turns.  The AI that usually takes no time to perform actions suddenly takes forever to decide what it wants to do for a turn, and then goes back to normal the next turn.  I still have no idea what causes this as it seems to happen at random times.  Also, there are weirdly long (relatively) load times when you're heading back to your main ship.  It really shouldn't take longer to load the base than it does to load a procedurally generated map but... it does.The RNG is still, and will always be there.  Miss a million shots at 95% chance to hit, fail an 81% hack, get no engineers for the first two months but get 5 scientists, need an acid bomb/grenade but get everything but acid, get a useless (for your build) random skill from AWC, the list goes on and on.  You either deal with it by crying or savescumming.  But it's not part of why I don't recommend the game.The main reason why I don't recommend the game?  The pacing.  I get it.  Timed missions make things more difficult since you have less opportunities, so you gotta make the best choice with what you got.  My problem with it isn't the difficulty as I've been able to consistently finish all the timed missions (without DLC bosses randomly showing up that is).  My problem with it is that it takes away most of your choices on how you want to play the game.  You have a myriad of options on how to bumrush to the objective (relatively) safely, such as smoke bombs, mimic beacons, etc but the fact remains is that you have no choice but to bumrush the objective.  In Enemy Unknown, there was some risk vs reward element there.  You can choose to take the additional risk of rushing to get meld, the reward.  Here, you have no choice but to rush and the worst part is that 80% of the missions have some sort of timer (whether it's a real timer or one civilian dies every turn timer).  Majority of my missions consists of kill first enemy pod asap, destroy wall, and either put specialist behind cover with LoS to objective and hack objective or destroy relay.  Timed missions get a bit harder, as they introduce enemies with more health/armor/abilities, and then significantly easier as your specialist improves to reliably control mechanical units and when you can bring in Psi Ops who can dominate the tougher biological enemies, but it doesn't make the repetitiveness less tedious.The next offensive part about pacing lies in the strategic part of the game.  Want to make contact with a new region?  No problem, just 5 days of scanning.  Except you scan half a day and ALERT, gotta fly off to save an ally VIP.  Spend half a day flying to the mission, do the mission, get that engineer drop that you desperately need, but it unfortunately requires 7 days of scanning. So you scan half a day of that before getting dragged into another mission that you NEED to do to prevent the dark event from adding more points to the avatar project, come back to scan for the engineer, scan a couple hours and ALERT!, your allies are being attacked, if you don't save them, you'll lose the relay tower you spent so many supplies on, so off to save them, and just when you think it's safe to try to scan for that engineer again, ALERT!  Resistance forces have disabled a train full of supplies so you gotta fly over and raid th- MOTHERF****R JUST LET ME F*****G SCAN IN MOTHERF*****G PEACE!!  It's offensive to the point where instead of getting your monthly pay immediately, you have to scan 3 days for it; 3 days that'll most likely turn into a week or more after all the interruptions.And now you have a doomsday timer too, in the form of the avatar project.  Let the bar fill up and you have a set period of time to reduce the bar or it's game over.  So when you're trying to prioritize a path to reducing the avatar project and you get interruptions after interruptions, it gets assinine really quick.And yes, I understand that there are mods that can change the pacing but from my point of view, mods shouldn't be necessary to make the game enjoyable.  Not to mention, updates can easily render mods obsolete, make your modded campaign unplayable, etcAnyways, XCom2 isn't a bad game.  At its core, once you get past the mission timers, the tactical combat is great, the soldier customization has been significantly improved, weapon customization is nice, and certain things are less tedious (like having to manufacture new primary weapons and armor for each new rookie, you have a simpler upgrade system for the most standard stuff), and they actually made explosives super useful (makes the first couple missions on normal way too easy though).  The storyline also isn't bad (still ridiculous at points though) and leaves room to be interpreted whether it ties into the ending of X-Com Bureau or whether it's foreshadowing Terror from the Deep or Micronoids, etc.tl:drI like this game but overall, I can't recommend the intended (unmodded) version to the majority of people as most of the game feels like there's only one way to play (rush objectives because 80% of the missions are timed and prioritize avatar project stuff) and that shouldn't be the case from a series that gave you so much freedom in your methods in prior games.

												Contains a lot of features that I expected in XCOM EU. Overall gameplay is solid&fun so far and comes with a lot of customization. But performs like garbage and they tried to balance the game by adding timers to both missions and the overworld map (can be modded out) and some bugs are literally copied 1:1 from XCOM:EU to XCOM2.  Concept Pros Cons   Graphics Are very slick. Performs horribly compared to what you get. Also it lacks 'pre-generated scenes'. Example returning to the base after a mission has a long loading time which should not be necesary   Relocatable base No more 100% pure rng-reliance on wether or not you can get satellites over every country Alien facilities (=bases) may all spawn very far away from your starting location (rng). But there is a counter to this (Lead on Alien Facility)   Saving System  Is as horrible as it was in XCOM:EU. Even the XCOM from 1994 had a better saving system. Not even the autosave feature is working as I would expect it to. Hopefully we get a mod for this soon   Mod support Mod support is great in XCOM2. Also it does NOT prevent you from getting achievements. I'm getting this feeling that they left out some critical game-features and rely on modders to add them.   RNG (random gen) Reliance on RNG is less compared to XCOM:EU. RNG-reliance is still strong. You still have to use tactics to minimize the chances of losing. But if all the odds happen to be against you, you will simly lose. If you are new to the XCOM-series and can't stand rng-based games. Then this game is not for you.   Stability It is way more stable compared to XCOM EU. It's only the first version so we can expect fixes in the near future Still has quite a lot of bugs & glitches and even a reproducable crash for me. But most of them do not impact gameplay. I also found 2 bugs that were also present (and still are) in XCOM1 EU which is a big thumbs down for me.   Soldier customization It is supported right of the bat along with a premade soldier-pool that contains your saved-soldiers for re-use. Also comes with custom colors, voices, and much more Sadly most of this comes from the 2 DLC which add significantly to the total price   Tedious moments  Can't skip some cinematics. There are quite a lot of these early in the game. Also during combat you sometimes get nagged about objectives while stalling gameplay. Also I have to EVAC my soldiers one by one when they all stand in the zone during a VIP mission? No EVAC-all button? No reload-all? No overwatch-all? Some GUI elements are a bit on the slow side   AI A lot better compared to XCOM:EU and especially a lot more stable. Also soldiers on overwatch no longer all fire overkill-damage on the same enemy Civilians stay near burning cars and let themselves explode. They also do not run from aliens and do not seek cover and do not run towards you. They behave like mindless zombies   Missions Good overal design. You now also start cloaked in most battles instead of getting swarmed by like 20 aliens after moving 1 tile as opposed to XCOM1 EU sometimes Most missions are timed. Personally I hate gameplay that has timelimits everywhere. But perhaps this was required to prevent turtling in a safe spot   Theme Being a rebel now after the aliens took over the world is a refreshing change after so many games in the series Early in the game most enemies look like armored humans. It does not feel as if you are fighting aliens   Overworld The scanning and sidemissions are a nice addition Again a timelimit... AGAIN.... Also game progression here feels too linear. I don't have this feeling like I have total freedom to just go wherever I like. I'm still bound to the story just like in XCOM EU. And not truly much choice in what missions you shall take. There is still no freedom like we had in UFO EU (1994). Also sometimes you get like 3 missions in 4 days. You can't even get to a scanning site. But again you can only have 1 skyranger...   Difficulty  There's still a reverse difficulty curve. And some of the difficulty comes purely from the lack of information (no tech tree, some skills not properly explained, etc.) or the enforced timelimits. For players new to the XCOM-seroes, early game can be a total nightmare. Early game is really hard, while lategame you are an untouchable god.   EVAC Call down custom EVAC points Even though all enemies are dead and no new reinforcements are on their way, you simply can't recover the alien artifacts with you during an EVAC. Also you can't carry alien corpses manually into the skyranger. You could in the 1994 game but not in the 2016 one...   Mech Design We have droids (YES) that can remotely hack and jolt enemies The big MECH's look as if they were designed by Apple. They look nowhere near as cool as the ones from XCOM:EU Yes it has bugs. A selection of the bugs that I encountered:May contain minor spoilershttp://steamcommunity.com/app/268500/discussions/0/412446292775581295/Why still the upvote after all those bugs?- Because ~ 9 out 10 of those bugs either have no impact on gameplay, have obvious workarounds or work in your advantage. Just stay away from ironman mode for the time being. I have seen some bugs that could seriously hurt you in ironman mode.- The game just released, so there is still hope.- Gameplay is still pretty solid and beats most other games of it's genre. It has many flaws I admit but it still comes out on top.- Modders are already jumping in, fixing the game and adding critical features.No I have not forgotten how they left XCOM:EUI never managed to beat ironman-impossible in XCOM:EU due to bugs.1. Once an enemy got stuck and my savegame was ruined forever. They 'fixed' this like this: ""if an enemy get's stuck, just skip the entire AI's turn"". You call that a fix?2. Another time it bugged out in the final level (FFS) and it wouldn't let me enter the door. They actually fixed this one.3. And the 3rd time I forgot. But I just gave up after this.Also some of the bugs like the game skipping your turn entirely, save-games not loading correctly in battle, AI that teleports at the start of their turn (in plain sight) and also immediately fire right thereafter including sectopods and the like...XCOM:EU was never (properly) fixed. I hope XCOM2 will be handled better.			"

												Final verdict: Buy it when they've done patching the performance issue, as it's the only main problem I see. Other than that, keep an eye out for this game, the base game is awesome, and there's also a great modding community. I believe this is a game that's already better than EU/EW.Quick review:  Very  awesomeThis sequel improves every aspect of XCOM EU/EW,  I almost forgot I'm not playing a long war. Though, it's true the game need some performance patch.Other than that the performance issue and few random lag, its graphic is great.Sound is great (it manages to catch the atmosphere).Gameplay is very XCOM EU/EW,   though I haven't been playing for a long time, but it's looking good so far. If you've played XCOM EU/EW, I'd reccomend it fully.If you haven't, that depends on your preferable genre, as not everyone prefer a strategy gameA bit of advice for people who haven't played XCOM EU/EW, this game quite relies on RNG, don't expect your 99% hit precentage to hit. Always prepare a strategy in case it misses. Still, that doesn't mean it's 100% pure luck type of game, the strategy layer is deep enough to make up for the RNG.UPDATE: Finished the game.Well, it's kind of confusing now that I've seen all the game has to offer. It's not a bad game by all means, it just really push you to be proactive, which good for most people, not really good for other. The following things is purely my opinion:The good one+The avatar project timer is well timed. Not leaving you too laid back, but not really killing your gameplay.+The timers in missions is sometimes bad, sometimes good, though what really screw me up is the placement of the objective in most mission. (♥♥♥♥ capture mission though). But mostly, it's tight but not too tight.+The enemies are varied, which is good. I don't think it will ever be a bad point.+The costumization is good.+Destructible enviroment. Like, super destructible. This is good.+The mods are awesome already, and we're not even hitting the one week mark.The bad one-Some abilities are useless late game, or at least not as useful as the other one. This is a bad point, as every abilities should be useful until late game, to make a varied gameplay.-The pacing is weird and done too quickly. There should be a few mission with the introduction of new enemies. Instead in early time, I met new enemy in every mission. This is bad for new players who haven't learned anything about the enemies.-♥♥♥♥ codex-The final mission isn't as good as EU/EW. Warning though, this is purely my opinion.-The buying of new weapon and armor is weird. One mission you're underpowered, the next one you're super powered. I don't really like it as there's no transition from one point to another.  The use of experimental stuff is also weird.-The lack of stuff. It's like they only focused on the enemies, instead of the thing we'll be using against it.			"

												I really, really wish Steam had a 'Mixed' review option. In the sequel to the fantastic reboot, it's now canon that you lost the first war and now XCOM is a resistance cell fighting against the ADVENT Coalition, headed by the enigmatic Elders (Ethereals). While the game has tons of potential, I feel like the devs took all the wrong cues from a certain XCOM mod.My first real complaint is the concealment system that allows you to remain hidden until you 'go loud' and begin actual shooting. However, this seems to accomplish very little, especially when the time limit (another gampelay feature I question) is so stringent, and in some cases, literally impossible. Enemies are also broken as hell, and the game seems to have no grasp of when to introduce new enemies. In the first month alone, you start running into one enemy that can literally sprint halfway across the map and kill your guys in one hit. I'm a Classic Ironman veteran of Enemy Unknown, but here it just seems like enemies were straight-up designed to make you take unavoidable losses. There's no sense of parity; either you ambush and kill all the enemies on the first turn or they WILL kill you in three.And for the game's biggest sin: the strategic map. Instead of a ticking doom meter that you can manage by playing well, there's now the Avatar Project to deal with. And here's the problem: not only does the Avatar project show up way too early, but it progresses way, way too fast. Not only that, but there's *specific missions* you have to accomplish to bring it down, and oftentimes those missions will spawn in places beyond your reach. The whole thing just dangles this time limit above the player's head that they have very little control over, and seeing it tick up every month doesn't bring a sense of urgency likes the devs probably thought it would, it's just damn frustrating. With those negative points up in the air, I should mention the positives:* The combat system is as good as EU's, just suffers from the ridiculous enemy progression/unbalance I mentioned* Much better mod support, including some mods to reduce/remove some of the negative points of the game* SO MUCH CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION. If you loved XCOM for customizing your soldiers, you'll probably like 2 for this alone.This is a okay, but very flawed sequel. I didn't like this for the same reason I don't like Long War; what the devs consider challenging I just consider tedious and annoying.			"

												A very good game plagued by questionable design decisions. The most obvious culprit is the mission turn limits. Apparentely this was done because overwatch was too strong and they wanted more fast paced/tense gameplay. Unfortunately it's not well implemented, I don't know if its better on other difficulties but on Ironman/commander you barely have enough time to get from point A to B. This makes lots of abilities and even the sharpshooter class quite useless. Why would I carefuly place my sniper on a roof top to flank the enemy if I know I won't have enough time to get her to the evac point in time? Combine this with some extremely powerful enemies like sectoids that appear early and often and you got yourself a major headache.On the other end of the spectrum the Ranger and Specialist are much stronger for the pace of the game, the specialist being especially crucial in the hacking missions. There are also lots of reports of bad performance, I've been lucky enough not to get any but I also turned down certain performance killing options. But from a game that is supposed to be a pc exclusive and was delayed to make sure it's flawless, it's very dissapointing.On the bright side the graphics and sound are great. Executing a perfect ambush against a group of enemies is extremely satisfying (unfortunately you rarely get the chance to do this because you have to hurry so much.I have no doubt that with a few patches/modding this game will shine and I will have no problem recommending it, but right now (especially with the price tag) I can't do so.TLDR version :+ Great sound and graphics+ Ambushes are very satisfying+ I love the new revamped classes, especially the specialist.+ Still the same heartpumping X-com action.-Mission timers for almost EVERY mission-some very powerful enemies early on with little way to counter them-Performance problemsP.S. I chose the ""not recommended"" option but I would choose a ""neutral"" option if there were one. It is not a bad game by any stretch and I feel I might update this to positive if a performance patch comes out soon.			"

												Xcom 2 is like playing a chess with a really great looking gameboard and chess pieces. Game is slow-paced and you are supposed to lose sometimes. If you are looking for fast action and immediately results this is not the game for you.Core gameplay is solid gold. You can have up to 6 soldiers under your command per mission. Missions have different kind of goals and some require to be completed within 8 - 12 turns. Something like 3/5 missions have a turn timer but I didn't find it problematic as I nearly always had 2-3 turn ""spare time"" when I completed the mission goal. When people start dying it is often your own fault. There are total of 6 soldier classes, all with unique abilities and skills. Classes feels different with many combinations available how to assemble your squad. If you have played Xcom:EU you learn the new game mechanics within first few hours. All the enemies are new or atleast altered so you don't feel like playing Xcom: EU with a new plot.Story is interesting and revealed by tiny pieces after completing missions and specific researches. There is a nice pacing with cutscenes and reading when moving forward the main plot. There ain't that many character in the game but they are all well written, besides that annoying little Shen.In campaign map you make the big decisions: what recourses to get, what region to help, which missions to accept, where to build facilities, how to utilize your staff... You can't get everything, you usually choose what you need most at the time. Making these decions is the most rewarding part of the game. Xcom 2 is still plagued by performance and optimize issues even the game was launched more thanhalf year ago. Animations lags sometimes even with no action on the screen and they lag like hell when there are multiple fire/acid burning animations going on. Loading a mission can take up to a minute to load and returning to base takes the same. Pretty often there are 10 to 20 seconds ""pauses"" during alien turns when the game clearly think what it should do. It is also a pain to board the skyranger as in some missions you have to invidially move all units to extraction area and watch the painfully slow animation about your soldiers getting aboard. Sure this is a minor thing as almost every con in this game but when there are too many of these  annoying little things they really begin to affect your game experience. When game is turn-based = pretty slow going  you really don't like any additional issues to slow the game down.There is also one extremely frustrating bug that I have to mention here. Sometimes your soldiers and aliens can shoot through floors/roof when there is accessible multiple-floor building in the map. This line of sight bug has been in Xcom 2 since launch. Some people even argue that it is a feature because ""aliens have supernatural powers and roof has holes for you to shoot through"". No this is not the case, building can be in perfect condition and no one is outside the building to give you vision on enemies but magically you see them loud and clear.Overall game experience was not as satisfying as Xcom: EU was, still I strongly recomend to try this if you liked the predecessor. It took 30 hours to beat the game on veteran diffulty and game was enternaining right to the end. There are amazing variety of mods available so you can tweak the game to suit better your playstyle/taste. Played with no mods, Anarchy's child and Shen's last gift DLCs enabled and Alien hunter DLC disabled as I had read some horrible feedback about the second DLC.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												After some consideration, I've opted to re-review this game with the new content added.  For reference, my original review did recommend this game.  However, I have changed my mind because the DLC has actually made things worse, not better.  I will also attempt to avoid spoilers as much as possible.CORE GAME:In this game, you are once again the Commander....however, in this game's universe, XCOM lost the war, and humanity gave in to the aliens.  The aliens have taken over and have convinced humanity that they're looking out for the human race.  Obviously, this is not the case, as people still seem to be going missing and there's word of an ""Avatar Project"" under developement by the aliens.  Thus, you must once again lead XCOM to victory against the alien menace.  You now manage a rag-tag group of rebels with limited supplies and troops at your disposal.  The theory behind this is simple: because of your limited resources, you must pick and choose your battles, deciding what to focus on and what to leave behind.  In theory, it's a great idea, and the core game itself is an enjoyable experience.Unfortunately, it's marred by several design decisions that were clearly intended to help it better resemble the ""Long War"" mod from the previous game, to the game's overall detriment.The game has done away with satellites and replaced them with a new mechanic.  You instead fly around the world uniting local resistance groups to obtain your monthly funds.  While this mechanic is preferable in my mind to the satellite system, it still requires you to build unique buildings in order to collect all the sectors and their bonuses.  Further, as the enemy works towards its secretive ""Avatar Project"", many of its facilities will be planted in regions you haven't reached yet, forcing you to dump resources into expansion instead of making your troops better, which could hurt you in the long run.Resource generation is extremely random, often to the point of frustration.  This will often happen even if you're not really mismanaging your resources at all.  As a result, you'll be scrounging for everything in the early game and may even find it hard to keep your troops properly equipped against your enemy's increasingly stronger armies.  Finding resources on enemies can help matters, but you have to move in range to pick them up, and you only get a limited number of turns to do so.  This also holds true of your own gear: if a soldier goes down (unconscious), you must retrieve them in order to save them.  Otherwise, they and their gear will be lost forever.But perhaps the biggest problem that most people have with the game is the very strong emphasis on timers.  I think they make sense in many cases, but there are serious issues with the way some of these missions are timed, and the timers are often extremely unforgiving.  I have had missions where I was simply unable to complete the mission due to a combination of any number of factors: the number of enemies thrown at me, the way the map had been laid out, the number of turns I'd been given, as well as DLC factors (more on that later).  And the Avatar Project itself loves to play unfairly, building facilities much too far away from you to reach quickly.  I once had a facility constructed several regions away from any of my existing ones, and I had to watch helplessly as the project ticked down to my doom because I lacked the resources to reach it and it was rapidly speeding up the project's progress.  So many elements in this game are random that it's entirely possible to fail, with no recourse to save yourself, through no fault of your own.DLC CONTENT:The DLC adds interesting story elements that could have been quite wonderful.  Unfortunately, the design of the DLC will often give you these new quests very early into your game....which is typically well before you've got the firepower to deal with these threats.I remember finding myself staring down a Sectopod in one of these missions, with my squad of five solders armed with conventional weapons and not one of them high enough to have a lot of reliable means of armor-shredding.  I was fortunate that the Spark soldier provided to me had armor-shredding of his own, and that my troops all carried grenades, or I probably would have lost at least one soldier in that mission.  Instead, I limped through with multiple injuries which crippled my roster for the weeks to come.  Similarly, in another story mission, I was facing a monstrosity with two separate health bars (yes, two) that apparently received a free turn every time I made any sort of move.  Naturally, he decided to show up during an extraction mission with a limited timer, knocked one of my men unconscious, and through his distractions made the mission impossible to complete in the time alloted, resulting in a loss of over half my men and a failure to save the VIP.And that's what I meant earlier when I said ""the DLC made the game worse, not better"".  Shen's Gift is perhaps the least offensive DLC because it's over in short order and provides useful benefits for the long term in the form of Spark soldiers (XCOM 2's version of the MEC), but its ""boss"" is ridiculous for such an early level encounter, and unless you've got lots of armor shredding handy, the generic MECs and turrets could end up turning this mission into a meatgrinder for you.  The three ""rulers"" from the Alien Hunters DLC, on the other hand, refuse to stay in their own missions and will make a habit of showing up in missions they don't belong.  They will even show up in limited time missions, which can often ruin your entire day.  It is truly infuriating to be playing a mission well, only to have your mission spoiled through no fault of your own by the sudden appearance of a boss monster that doesn't belong in the mission in the first place.  Anarchy's Children is barely worth mentioning as it only really adds a lot of Mad Max-esque gear which you'll use on a few toons, maybe, and then never again.CONCLUSION (TL;DR):All in all, XCOM 2 has the core of a great game, but is ultimately ruined by its attempts to appeal more to the minority ""hardcore"" crowd that loves Long War than to its original XCOM 1 audience.  The only means by which I can recommend this game is if you install a number of mods through the Workshop to decrease the game's reliance on randomized nonsense.  Otherwise, you will find yourself very frustrated, very fast.			"

												Honestly my biggest beef with this game is the step back it took from Enemy Within. No gene mods, no MECs (the new SPARK units from Shen's Last Gift are a very poor replacement), no alternate mission types (covert Ops), no third faction (EXALT).The biggest problem is just how boring the strategic layer is. Not saying XCOM:EW was massivly interesting in that deparment, but at least with EXALT & controlling terror, it felt like you had more choices. Here it's just ""fly to scan site, get interrupted by a mission, fly back to scan site"".			"

												So I picked up this game from a bundle, and here are my thoughts on it.In the beginning, like any other game, progress scales as you make your way through the story. That's great... if you're a perfectionist who loses absolutely NONE of his troops in any playthrough. Thinking of saving before taking an action so you can have your free ""redos""? Yeah, don't think about it you're just setting yourself up to ♥♥♥♥ up in a different way. XCOM 2's combat is BRUTAL. Not in the beginning, but in every battle afterwards. If you've never played XCOM 2 before like me, you WILL be grasping at straws. I've had so many moments where I've shouted (whether inside my head or for all around me in a mile radius to hear) aloud: ""What the fu- IT CAN DO THAT?"", ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's not fair!"", ""STOP ♥♥♥♥ING PANICKING!"" or ""THE ♥♥♥♥ING CARS EXPLODE?!"" ... and so on.Combat in XCOM 2, like I said, is BRUTAL for newbies that have never seen any action in any XCOM franchise. You WILL suffer. You WILL lose someone, hell, maybe even a whole squad. For newbies that are deluding yourself into thinking that I'm just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gamer/strategist or things like ""No way, I'm a god at these types of games."" ... lose that mindset right now. I'm trying to help you suffer less.This game, if I can even call it that at this point, can be likened to a carrot and a stick: Success is seemingly always in your reach, yet you can never get it. Of course you can win... but at what cost? One man? Half your squad? Everybody but one person? Ask yourself: ""Was victory really worth it?"" ...I'm going to try again. Wish me luck.			"

												XCOM 2 is essentially XCOM 1 with everything dialed up a notch. The short of it is that if you liked and played XCOM 1 for any significant amount of time then you are almost guaranteed to enjoy XCOM 2.Great new additions or significant improvements:RNG: The huge role random chance played in the core mechanics of XCOM 1 was something that really bothered me and many other players. Thankfully, in this iteration, there are so many more ways of dealing guaranteeing damage that it is relatively simple to mitigate RNG almost completely with the appropriate style of play. A few things allow this: first off more abilities that are guaranteed to deal damage including combat protocol on the specialist and weapon upgrades that deal dmg on missed shots, cover is more destructible this time around which allows you to easily expose enemies for reliable shots and most importantly the way the game works now allows and even encourages aggressive flanking. It is not uncommon to get 90-100% shot success on most missions mid way through the campaign now as a result.Aggression and overwatch spam: Due to the way the maps were configured and the constant threat of activating additional groups of enemies, a very defense oriented and overwatch centered tactical play style was considered optimal in XCOM 1. This is entirely not the case in XCOM 2. The way the maps are setup now, it feels like you have much more room to maneuver around the map without fatally exposing your squad. With the concealment mechanic which lets you sneak up on the aliens and with the presence of turn limits on many more missions this time around, the game actually encourages an aggressive playstyle where you take out enemy groups with 1-2 turns of activating them through aggressive flanking and, as is my preference, heavy use of explosives. Another important aspect of this is that using explosives no longer equates to losing the loot you desperately need to fund your operations. It’s a little bit more complicated than that but generally speaking you don’t have to stress so much about not blowing up the aliens this time around.Additional customization options: I really wasn’t into tweaking the appearance of my soldiers in XCOM 1 that much but with the mind blowing amount of customization options available now, I’m really getting attached to some of my soldiers that I’ve decked out to look badass. The character pool system which lets saved soldiers randomly appear in your campaign as recruits or VIPs or scientists and engineers is also quite brilliant and unexpected allowing for favorite soldiers to effortlessly reappear in a new campaign. With the out of the box support for mods through steam workshop, the already staggering number of options will only grow.Things which are problematic:Unresponsiveness: I had this complaint with XCOM 1 as well. What I’m talking about is how the game loves to take control away from you in the middle of the action, locking the camera and disabling input while it makes you stare at a “new” enemy that you’ve already seen before accompanied by Central or the Doctor essentially telling you what you most likely already know. There is seemingly more of that this time around and some abilities, in particular gremlin abilities on the specialist have unnecessarily long animations for you to endure. Some of this also applies to the UI in the macro game (the avenger and geoscape). Transferring from the geoscape to the armory menu for instance, take entirely too long and clicking while the animation is in progress may end up sending you to another menu accidentally which only serves to frustrate the matter more.UI streamlining: In the course of trying to make the UI less dense, a lot of useful information has been buried further down in menus. This leads to a lot of unnecessary clicking to find important bits of information and makes comparing some stats across soldiers unjustifiably painful. The biggest culprit of course, is not being able to see vital soldier stats side by side across soldiers, including their hp and what upgrades they have installed on themselves and their gear. There are several other places where the streamlined approach makes information difficult to discern or understand due to ambiguity, but all this one can get used to eventually, even though some frustration will be encountered along the way. I suspect this is once again a symptom of PC games being constrained by a UI designed for a controller. It’s not a major gripe, but it is something which should have been improved in this iteration and not the other way around as it stands now. "

 Target Audience:  Tactical Combat Fans that want a challenge, and don't have beefs with the RNG gods.  Review Video: 


YouTube™ Video: XCOM 2 (Review): Snake Waifus and Math Problems 

			Views: 2,072		

			One of the biggest releases of the year: and it's right up my alley. XCOM2 brings the tactical combat and tries to take it to another level.		

  Summary: The game that has everything going for it as a sequel to one of the best reborn franchises of the last 5 years.....with one huge exception. The tactical combat from the original returns with some additional units and mechanics that takes it to the next level. The small changes like additional focus on timed missions helped the game in the big picture a lot, and the improved balance/skill trees made every class a great boon in the right situation. The simulation portion of the game may have been streamlined....but it was for the better in my opinion, as it makes an impact on your combat performance directly. The visuals for the most part are nice, although it will take you out the experience as well with some bad glitches. The story makes a bit more sense this time around and while its filled with scifi tropes, it does the job. This would be a shoe-in purchase if the performance issues, load times, and glitches are taken care of, because they REALLY create a major problem in the end, as I would have stopped playing if I wasn't formal reviewing the game. If you've got a backlog: play through it first, and wait for some of the issues to be fixed.  Lists: My Positives: The well known combat is still as good as ever, with incremental improvements. Difficult but smartly put together. Class balance seems to be there a bit more this time around..Psy operatives were useful and still strong, but a great grenadier or ranger could give them a run for their money. Simulation elements wisely refined, and seemed to make the difference in the battle in the long run. Like the addition of more timed missions: it forces  less conservative play, and put your units more in danger, but not to the point where it was unwinnable.   Great character customization added that makes the sting of losing a soldier that much harder, when you've put the effort in crafting them from the bottom up. Your soldiers also can have a nice in-game personality that actually shows up in the lines.  Great move on Firaxis part to put in mod support on day one. I expect a lot to be done, as there's a lot of potential in the various weapons/units/etc.  The secondary equipment makes a huge difference this time around, and there was actually huge reasons to take it along as opposed to another med pack.  Improved visuals, in particular with character designs. Like the simple yet effective designs of the Viper and the Gatekeeper. For those who really want it, Firaxis put several autosaves in there at the start of a mission and last turn. If you're a cheater. Cause it's cheating.  My Negatives: Hate, hate the new graze system. It adds an element to combat that you don't know what it directly does in terms of percent probability for it to happen, and is generally an unknown factor. It's the one thing you don't know, and it will REALLY get on your nerves. Panic system seems to mean less then before. Held together by glue and string, it seems. The game can run great at times, but when something goes wrong, bad things happen to not only the performance, but the in game mechanics get messed with as well. It's unstable.  The loading times. My god the loading times. At one point, it took 3 minutes,  27 seconds to load into the next portion of the game. Unoptimized, the game is not.  Glitch Fest 2000. Hits a wide spectrum of issues, from graphical, to camera, to in-game affecting. Takes you right of the experience. It's funny at times....but really annoying at others. Especially when the camera decides to show you a wall because it can't figure out jack♥♥♥♥♥♥  The music doesn't do the job like the original. It just doesn't have the punch, it's good....but compared to the original, it just doesn't work at ALL.  "

You've gotta ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?""So I know this is a mixed bag for everyone, to me though XCOM 2 has defnitely been a nice addition to the XCOM story, despite that the canon ending to XCOM:EU is you lost the alien invasion and XCOM HQ has been destroyed.As far as optimization, I run an NVIDIA GTX 970, 8 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7-4790K, and Windows 10 as my Operating system, and I can run everything on max settings just fine.I liked the artwork and the graphical improvements, the gameplay still has that cringy RNG that either favors you or wants you dead, and can make funny moments if you're not playing in ironman mode. The bugs and glitches I am aware of are too little to be too bothersome, and when they do happen, it isn't gamebreaking, it may be just flat out funny, I thought it was funny when I shot a sectoid in the face with a guass rifle and the corpse flew up into the sky never to be seen again, camera was locked right on it too, so it was like watching someone get hit with Ness' homerun bat.Now I'm gonna list the pros and cons of this game in my eyes;+ Variety of customization of your soldiers*+ The feeling of playing an advanced game of chess is still there, though now I notice that unlike XCOM:EU, all aliens have different priorities due to their behavior, can't just shoot the closest one anymore, so a plus for additional strategy adjustments.+ Concealment is an interesting addition to this gurrellia-focused campaign, you have the option of sneaking, ambushing, or flat out just doing a stealth mission, though the only problem with this is that once you attack, that's it. They should've at least made melee a silent instant kill option, so you can ""backstab"" enemies that have no idea you're there, it would have to be a soldier upgrade for the ranger, luckily there's a way to do such thing, and thats...+ Workshop mod support, this is a nice way to make the game more interesting and to adjust the more annoying aspects of the game that you couldn't have done in XCOM:EU. Makes for great cosmetic additions to further personalize your soldier, this including voice packs, hats and helmets, armor peices, and even custom classes.  Though the only minus to this would be that DLC becomes completely obsolete in some parts such AS cosmetics (I'm looking at you Anarchy's Children). Why buy cosmetics when you can get them for free on the workshop? (Now, I bought the digital deluxe edition when it was on a nice sale, so I got everything for a nice buck). You can also adjust gameplay such as how fast the avatar project builds up. +- RNG, now that's the mixed bag of XCOM, despite how close you are, despite the chance percentage, you will always have a chance of missing, even at 100%, That's XCOM for you. It's either you hit, or you don't. Sometimes you will get a nice kill on a 32%, it's all a matter of gambling and risk sometimes. This has been in Enemy Unknown as well, but I feel it's much more ""unforgiving"" on this particular title. ""Sir! I had my gun pointed right up at their face, my muscle spazzed!""+- You feel rushed constantly. As you progress through the game, a doom counter slowly builds up progress towards the alien's goal objective, and if they get to the final stage, you have 20 days depending on difficulty to try to bring down the progress or else it's game over. In missions, most of them are on a turn clock, which means you have only so many turns to complete the objective, or else it's a fail, or all of your troops get captured, it depends on the mission type. You can use the workshop mods to slow down the progress of this doom counter, which could bring some relief to you.- DLC is not worthy of purchasing except Shen's Last Gift, which adds a new class and a little more story, the other DLCs are Anarchy's Children, which you guessed from the title, adds childish cosmetics to make your soldiers look like punks. Though, only a few cosmetics from that DLC are ok, most of them aren't and not worth the price when it's not on sale. As for Alien Hunters, it adds 3 new weapons, a couple sadistic alien kings, and alien cosmetics, which looks pretty nice. The thing that ruins it for me is ""Ruler Reaction"", which garuntees a free action for the ruler whenever you make an action on your turn. That's not fair. LUCKILY, you're able to remove that entirely using the workshop mods.So in conclusion so far this game is pretty alright, it's definitely not perfect but I like it, and I'd recommend giving it a try if you are wanting a lot of playtime. It does have a lot of bang for it's buck. The learning curve IS a little bit tougher and your comerades will die a lot from your error (and RNG), so buckle up and hope you got a loooot of luck.(I have not completed the story yet, more might be added later.)

												You remember XCOM:EU? That game of the year 2012 and still ever since in it's genre? XCOM2 not only manages to be a worthy successor to it, but far overwhelmingly surpasses the first's game to take it's throne and be ""The"" turn based strategy for the years to come.Firaxis took everything that was good in the first game, implemented it to the second one almost unchanged (don't fix what isn't broken as they say), and vastly expanded on it.Combat System: Unchanged cover system, completely randomly generated maps for each mission (important story missions are of course exceptions), new type of soldier classes with many more strategies and tactical options. You often start the mission concealed, meaning the tables are turned and you can set up ambuses. More type of weapons and abilities.Map design More interactable objects: risky hackable towers, explosives, new types of doors and windows (some you can see through, some are laser and cannot be run through), great new sci-fi cities and other various biomes (such as forests, deserts, snowy tundra, small towns in all of them, ADVENT fortresses and more!), the maps often include holographic advertisements such as ADVENT propaganda, scrolling news of our customized characters being labelled as terrorists. The graffities of resistance and logos of the Elders are always representing the global status of the area you landed in.World map A new type of turn based ""adventure"" where you free regions from the occupying power. A vast amount of randomly generated missions, new mechanims that based on your choices take serious effects on upcoming combat scerianos. Finally no more permanent nonsense loss of support, UFO encounters has been reworked and overall the whole world map part of the game is much more important, strategic and enjoyable to play.Customization Everything you loved before, just more of that and more on top of that! You have about a dozen layers to customize your characters' faces only, customizeable hand, chest and leg armor for each different armor type, voices of a few languages, armor and weapon patterns, helmets, hoods, face accessories, everything can be recolored, renamed, whatever you want.Story Huge improvements here aswell. Being honest, nobody ever bought XCOM:EU for the story, and nobody will buy XCOM2 for the story. Still, there are more cutscenes, more likeable and recognizable characters. XCOM: The Bureau tried to drag down the perspective to a more personal level but doesn't come even close to XCOM2 that also remains to be the good old XCOM:EU gameplay, while the overall playtime is increased from 20-25 hours to a healthy 27-30, filled up with more engaging scenes, more type of mission objectives and more varied gameplay in general.But there are some negatives, really minor things but worth to mention. Loading screens are mostly hidden behind cutscenes that is a common thing nowadays, but sadly there are performance / stuttering issues of the engine rendered cutscenes (pre-recorded videos are fine though), and very-very rarely it can couse an exe crash. Customization while being a massive improvement over XCOM:EU, could have used more hairstyles, face paints and some things here and there. The last thing is entirely a subjective topic, but most of the game is attached to various type of timers during missions and outside missions (pretty much a doom timer that you can roll back if you play well), that puts constant pressure of the wrong type on those who don't like being time restricted, and it also kind of works against the new ambush setup allowing concealment mechanism too. The engine in general could be better optimized, which was an unpleasant surprise given XCOM2 is PC exclusive, though Firaxis is actively working on improvements. Don't worry, it's nothing like the sadly widespread terribly optimized unstable garbages, it's a decent game that could be better on some points.However, there is steam workshop perfectly integrated to the game (Skyrim-level of integration), and the modding community is already making oceans of additional customization content, voiceovers, and even gameplay changing mods such as new enemies, new balance, new weapons, different or disabled timers, whatever you are looking for is either already made or is likely under development already. Add this to the randomly generated maps and even after the first ""pure"" / ""vanilla"" playthrough you have a MASSIVELY replayable game that always has new surprises to kill you with.			"

												After battling all of the bugs I have finished the game. I was back and forth on whether or not I wanted to recommend this game to friends. I have played through XCOM three times now. There were some interesting additions to the game like destructible environments, new soldier abilities, and new units. I like the idea of being on the offensive and sometimes having the element of surprise. Having said all that, I would recommend anyone reading this just play XCOM and skip this one. The constant crashes and bizarre bugs make the experience tedious and unpleasant. I had one bug that caused the game to freeze every time I completed a mission. The only way I could get around it was enable the developer console and allow myself to restart the mission. The DLC breaks the game with overpowered bosses that appear early on. I am not sure if it was a scripting error or if I accidentally triggered the DLC, but once I did all bets were off. The ""bosses"" that randomly showed up in battle got to move/attack after every action a character on my team took. Not every TURN, but ever ACTION. So if I put a soldier in a location the boss would get a move and an attack. If I then shoot with that soldier the boss gets another move. In one turn these over powered jerks get 8-12 moves/actions before they get their actual turn. "

												Really good game. Lots of action. The timer is mostly not a problem and adds to the frantic battles. Lots of cool upgrades for the units, and neat weapons. Plays a little shorter than the previous game Enemy Unknown. Wounds hurt! as there is a lot of recovery time when wounded ... makes having backups useful.The new map design randomness is nice. The enemies are a good mix of weapons fire and melee. Winning is rough but oh so satisfying. I also like the new way the geoscape has things to do on it. Very cool.XCOM 2 is one of my favorite games. Of course, I played the original way back when and others. Great Game.			"

												XCOM2 is one of those games that i will play for years. XCOM was a great game and the second part improves on pretty much everything. The mod support is a huge plus as well, hopefully other game companies will go ahead and copy the approach of giving the players an SDK to play with.XCOM2 is one of my Top5 all-time favorite games - recommended for everyone who likes a bit of a challenge and doesn't get frustrated easily. The only reason i don't have more playtime with this game is that i am currently spend most of my time in the SDK, making the A Better ADVENT mod.			"

												Updated Review (11 JAN 2017):NOTE: To be clear, the majority of my gameplay time on this game falls between initial release and the last patch, when I encountered no problems other than mod conflicts. As with most of my Steam games, I didn't bother with a review. Plenty of others were raving about the game so why should I say the same things? Lazy? Yeah. That said I'm going to start this update by clearly stating that XCOM2 is one of my favourite games EVER. Its not the kind of game to give up on easily. Even though I was pretty angry when the last patch broke my install, and posted my initial review (below) as a result, I just couldn't let it go. It may be worth noting I didn't discover this right away as I'd been neck deep in other games prior to and after the patch. Stupid Orcs. Found out when game tanked while I was showing it off to a mate. Murphy's Law I guess.This update is posted about a week into my latest clean install. And by clean, this time I mean both the Steam folder and the OS drive ""My Games"" folder - only my character pool was spared the axe. I then verified my game cache via Steam, and once the entire 29gb reinstall was done, I used steam to create a desktop icon. As of right now, still getting red screen error on launch, but a simple tweak of launch options made that go away - seems to be for a multiplayer file or some such, so don't care. Tweaked graphics settings and then ran game. So far, it's running moderately well, but still a few crashes. Having sifted through several very long forum posts (one of which was 30 pages long) trying to get a handle on what causes the crashes I pretty much gave up. There seem to be multiple possibilities. Still, frustrating. So... where does that leave this review? Hmmm... Well, I'm still leaving it as a thumbs down for the simple reason that I really prefer not to have to stuff around this much to get a great game running again after a patch. Nor can I ignore the fact it's still crashing sporadically for me. My comments re optimisation still stand. Frame rate is all over the place. It is just my opinion but I feel that a game this good should be able to reach as many players as possible - not everyone has a high end PC so a little more work to iron out performance on mid / upper-mid range machines would be in everyone's best interest. I cannot review this any other way as this is my experience and also that of others.HOWEVER!!!! It would be unfair not to also add that this game is pretty frickin' awesome when it runs without crashing. The level of customisation of your characters is a 10/10 as are many  aspects of tactical gameplay. It is not an easy game to master, but rewarding as you slowly learn how to. Odds can feel like they're stacked against you and at times they are. Your grunts are going to miss a 90% shot chance on an enemy standing a tile away - that I think is a little overboard but your memorial wall is fairly large so... yeah. Enemy numbers and stats level with you - well, they can out-level you at times in fact - so you're never really going to rest easy. And just when you think things can’t get worse... they will. Also not a huge fan of the timed missions (not all are timed however), mostly because I'm a turtle at heart and like to take my time - rushing to beat a timer detracts from the tactical aspect of the game for me. To a degree, this also holds true for the campaign map - there is a definite gearing towards pushing you ever onwards - a game design decision some will like and some will not. It certainly ramps up the tension and fits with the narrative. This is personal choice IMO, and as I say, I'm a slow poke. I don't see this aspect of the game as a negative as such, but perhaps an option to extend play time might be an idea. Oh, for days gone by and the Longwar mod...Without Longwar Studios Toolbox, or another mod, your camera angles are only adjustable by 90 degrees - one of the few things I really didn't like control wise. There can also be some quirks with moving characters - one wrong click and a grunt can be toast. Not a game breaker, just need to be super careful. Mod support is good but you do need to be careful as mod conflicts can cause issues and I found (regretfully) that the ""more map"" style mods may cause problems so I haven't used any of those in some time just to be safe. IMO, there are some mods that are must haves but I'd recommend playing vanilla at least once to get a feel for what you might want to tweak or improve. I'd also note here that if you're using certain combinations of mods, and with the way the XComEngine.ini file works, you may need to delete it (easier than editing) before starting the game to purge mod overwrite data - especially if you're using Longwar Toolbox in combination with certain other mods. Meh. Conclusion: Great game with a few optimisation issues IMO - enough to keep it from a thumbs up. On sale, it is definitely worth buying. I pre-ordered my copy BTW - and ultimately I don't regret it but am frustrated with it at times. Could just do without the crashes. Can live with the rest. Despite issues, I'm not going to stop playing the game. That might not make sense to some people, but that's the way it is. I just can't give a thumbs up in it's current state. TL:DR ...* Gameplay / Features: 7/10* Mods / Steam Workshop: 9/10* Optimisation / Performance: 6/10 (on an pretty good but not super-beast PC); needs   work in that regard IMO* Stability: 5/10 (harrumph!)* Replayability / Map variety:  7/10 (map layout, while procedurally generated, does  feel limited and over time, repetitive).* DLC: 5/10 - OK with what there is, but would like to see more content please* Overall: 7/10 (pretty much excluding crashing issues) Have a nice day...===============================================================Original Review:As you can see by the hours I've put into this game, it's one of my favourites. However, at this time I feel compelled to write a review, and it is going to be a negative one. Why? Because of the following:* Poor optimisation: I can run this OK with a few tweaks to graphics settings, but it feels as if the devs could do some more work on this. * As of late DEC 2016, cannot play without continual crashes and freezes -  a problem that was common at game release and then seemed to be fixed by devs before making a big comeback with latest patch. Game has become most temperamental and frankly I'm over spending time trying to ""fix"" the problems.Therefore, I couldn't recommend purchase at this time - essentially playing russian roulete as to whether the game will run OK for you or not - regardless of whether you run a clean install or modded. Don't be fooled by devs blaming mods for instability and crashes.			"

												Twenty years have passed since the conclusion of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and we lost. The alien menace has convinced the XCOM council to join them, now calling themselves Advent. Advent has completely taken over the world promising advanced tech, medicine and world peace. The biggest problem is they rule with an iron fist. The XCOM program lives on in the form of a resistance. Welcome back to the world of XCOM. Enemy Unknown was released in 2012, and a lot has changed and a lot has stayed the same. XCOM, for those unfamiliar with the series, are military strategy games that have always been about decision making. Whether the decision is one about what equipment to build, what tech to research, or giving orders to soldiers in the field; your decisions make the game. This series was one of the first to use permanent death for squad mates.If one dies, they do not come back. This made players very cautious on how to use their squad, or even which squad mates to send in. Do you send in your most experienced? Or do you take a chance and send in a couple veterans and a couple of rookies? Keeping in mind that, of course, the veterans are better and have more skills, unfortunately, if they die you lose access to all their training and skills. It was also one of the first series to introduce recovery time for injured characters. If a soldier got injured in the field, they need time to recover. Hope you have some reserves.Where XCOM 2 really shines are with the improvements they made over the last game. In the previous game, players picked where they wanted their base to be. Different locations gave different bonuses. In this game your base is mobile, making you harder to detect and capture. In the command room is a holographic map of the world, and when looking at the it several choices are available at any given time. Should you make contact with a resistance cell in another part of the world? Go steal the supplies from Advent forces nearby? Or should you take out that black site in hopes of securing more soldiers, scientists or engineers? This is a massive switch from the previous game where players really couldn’t move around and all they could do is scan the world for trouble until trouble presented itself.The alien invasion story has been one of the biggest areas of improvement since Enemy Within. Its characters talk more, fleshing out a story and creating a sense of companionship despite the fact they’re clearly just a cipher for each part of your mobile base’s inner workings. There’s more mystery here, and great cutscenes go a long way to layering on more and more intrigue as you discover bigger,more sinister revelations about the alien’s intentions. To say much more would be a disservice to the great surprises, but the game’s narrative setup - an oppressive occupying force vs a struggling resistance - doesn’t just allow for a greater storytelling: it makes for a much stronger marriage between story and gameplay.XCOM 2 introduces plenty of new gameplay elements that fit this new style, like player-placed extraction zones, ambushes, and a complete restructuring of character classes to reflect the focus on guerrilla combat. Players will find themselves thinking hard about which classes to bring into a particular firefight, and finding the right combination of soldier types will be a hard-fought trial-and-error process. Likewise, when players start in concealment – a new stealth aspect that is brand new to the franchise – they’ll find themselves tediously organizing ambushes to maximize their overwatch impact.XCOM 2 is a serious strategy game, even on normal difficulty. The AI rarely makes stupid moves, and will respond to your mistakes with absolutely brutal efficiency. My most common mistake in the first few hours was advancing too far forward with one trooper, spotting a group of enemies, and watching the pioneer get slaughtered with their companions too far away to help. This is a crucial part of how XCOM 2 works – allow your troops to get isolated from each other, or leave a flank exposed, and you’ll be punished.You’ll need to use every trick at your disposal in XCOM 2, as the ADVENT aren't here to play around. The aliens from the Enemy Unknown have been settled on Earth for some time and are more powerful for it. Sectoids - once the lowest ranking enemy in the game - are now powerful mid-game units that can disorientate and debuff your units while ADVENT troops (humans modified by the aliens) flank and close the distance.The ADVENT forces are varied and require a considerable amount of tactical thought. Even amongst its foot soldiers there are officers, grunts, sword-wielding assault troopers and heavily armoured damage-soakers. The aliens also bring mechs and robots to the party, as well as more grotesque creatures like the gooey ‘Faceless’ and reptilian ‘Venom’ units. XCOM 2 has gone a long way to make the ADVENT seem both human and alien. Facilities and surroundings will bear all the hallmarks of Earth’s near-future yet be defended by snake-men and dimension-hopping guardians.As expected your trusty soldiers will gain promotions as they complete missions and kill aliens and like in the XCOM: EU you get to choose one of two skills to unlock. These skills are mostly a new type of attack, but can sometimes be a passive ability like returning fire when attacked or being unable to be hit after killing an enemy the turn before. If you do happen to change your mind, you are now able to retrain abilities using one of the new buildings, the Advanced War Centre, which can also increase the healing down time of injured soldiers,Combat in XCOM 2 is very similar to the combat from the previous games, each soldier is permitted two actions per turn. These actions can be made up of movements, firing at the enemy, using a grenades, healing or reloading. When you do lay down some sweet guerrilla justice on the alien overlords, there is a chance for loot drops, these can be either weapon upgrades or materials for advanced research. Weapon upgrades are a great addition to XCOM 2, they can add things like increased critical chance, reloads that don’t cost an action or larger ammo clip size and many more. XCOM 2 has given pretty much every graphical feature in the previous game a polish to update it to modern standards and it goes without saying that the game is flawless in its design and looks. Every battlefield oozes style and really set the scene for your operations against the ADVENT. Soldiers grimace, wince and shout as they fight, while hair, toolkits and weapons sway in convincing ways. Enemy and friendly animations are smooth and detailed - from leaping over barriers to climbing ladders - and I can’t recall any time where my immersion was jarred by clunky movement.Similarly, composer Tim Wynn has done a fabulous job in creating an epic action-movie feel that accompanies the game. The game’s soundtrack is cinematic in its crescendos and swells and palpably tense when things are going awry. The sound effects are also spot-on: guns crack, rattle and boom while alien mag-weapons make suitably science-fiction pops, zaps and fizzes.Despite being a fan of the XCOM series as a whole I never expected this new entry to be as polished, intricate, immersive, beautiful and exciting as it is. I’ve had to tear myself away from the screen multiple times because I’d got so invested I’d forgotten to eat. XCOM 2 is one of those titles that appear once in a blue moon and set the benchmark for gaming; from start to finish there wasn’t a moment I did not completely enjoy playing it. XCOM 2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time.			"

												XCOM 2 provided me with an exhilarating experience. It really found that sweet-spot where my mistakes were punished, but I was also given the chances to recover. I genuinely felt my defeat was imminent on approximately four different occasions, however, I managed to crawl my way back to the point where I felt victory was once again obtainable; and for that reason, I am now about to start my second life at multiplayer battles. Wish me luck fellow Commanders.			"

												I really do enjoy XCOM 2 but the bugs and technical glitches are just too much to overlook. I have a 980 Ti and I constantly see frame drops. Kill cams are constantly broken. Aliens are suspended in mid air or teleporting around. But the worst of it all is the game breaking bugs.After playing Commander/Ironman for 15 hours and constantly getting my butt kicked because I just wasn't good enough I dropped down to Veteran/Ironman. 7 hours in and I'm doing great. No deaths, mag and gauss weapons, predator armor. I'm feeling pretty confident. And then I go on a dark VIP extraction mission and it all goes to hell. A bug treats the mission as failed after I destroyed the VIP's car even though I have him over my shoulder 30 squares away. Then the game calls in reinforcements right on the evac zone in back to back turns. Even though I could have killed them the game treats the zone as overrun and moves it to a place that I can't physically get to in the time left. So that's it. My squad is captured and there is nothing I can do. So my best run is now over and I'm questioning why do I even want to try again when next time something worse could happen 20 hours in.I'm sure Firaxis is trying to fix these bugs but it is just really disappointing to see a game that was in development for so long and even delayed multiple times is still released in this state. Then again, I guess that is just the norm for video games nowadays.** UPDATE on February 27th, 2016 **So I have beaten XCOM 2 on Veteran/Ironman difficulty and it took about 28 hours. I went through the game being much more cautious then in my previous attempts. Sometimes I did not attempt a gorilla ops mission that would have given me the best reward because it had something to do with evac and I just didn't want to risk the game bugging out and me losing a squad again.While there were a few bugs here and there (enemies suspended in mid air after I destroyed the floor beneath them, somehow triggering pods when I couldn't see the aliens but they could magically see me, kill zone not triggering on enemies that clearly moved, mutons seeing me through a door and throwing a grenade at me) the game was rather uneventful.The problem I now have with the game is that its difficulty snowballed and didn't push me to experiment with my tactics. Once my soldiers levelled up it was hard not taking them on missions and levelling up replacements because the aliens simply did too much damage. Also my tactic of bring at least two grenadiers (and some soldiers in amor suits with rocket launchers) got boring pretty quick. The problem was whenever I tried to deviate from it by not using my grenadiers or holding them back to the end of the turn I found that I just didn't have the fire power. The game seems really balanced around AoE/shredding damage and killing the aliens before they get any shots on you especially because of the aggressive timers which force you into combat.The missions also felt more repetitive than XCOM 1. The procedurally generated maps were great. I never really felt that I knew exactly was coming next but the missions were always the same. The guerrilla ops barely changed. The retaliation missions were always the same and you knew exactly when they were coming. The alien facilities were almost identical. The exact same tactics worked on every single one. I was bored my alien facilities by the third one and only did them to lower the avatar project to stall for more time to get supplies. In XCOM 1, looking back with my rose coloured glasses, the randomness of the alien attacks I feel like I enjoyed more. The different types of alien crafts, the landings versus shoot downs, the terror missions which you sometimes didn't see coming.Also story missions felt better spaced out in XCOM 1. In XCOM 2 I probably went 12 hours between story missions because after the black site there was nothing pushing me on. I literally had taken out every single alien facility on the planet before I attempted a story mission. There was no tech or advancements behind those missions on then the next story mission to eventually get you the final mission.All of this sounds really negative but I did enjoy a lot of the game.- The geoscape was great. Tough choices all around. I felt it dragged the game on a little bit because it was hard to get the supplies needed to upgrade everything to tier 3 so I definitely killed time for a month just waiting for attacks because I didn't want to attempt any story missions.- There definitely were some missions where even with what I feel are my OP tactics of never-ending explosives and mimic bacons I did feel like I was just walking over the aliens.- The character customization really drew me in. There were so many storylines of all my soldiers and their amazing exploits that are all just inside my head. The ability to customize every character ahead of time and just have them randomly showed up really pulled me in.On the whole as a die-hard XCOM fan I did enjoy it and I'll probably come back in 2-3 months when some DLC and patches have come out and make my Commander/Ironman attempt. But I am very afraid that I'm just going to have to resort to my same boring tactics again. I'll probably make a couple of attempts at different tactics, maybe rush psionics instead of mag weapons or something but I'm just a bit worried that the game at higher difficulties just isn't balanced for that.

												I hate to give this game a negative review, because I really love Xcom the series and there is potentially a great game here, but it's a complete and utter mess of a game because of the bugs. Playing Ironman is a joke and near impossible, because bugs will ruin your run. I lost a whole squad because enemies suddenly gained the ability to target me through walls/roofs, Vipers grabbing my character through a god damn wall... as in the Viper's tongue literally travels through the wall and pulls my character THROUGH it, wall remains in tact. Absolute mess of a game. I had an enjoyable enough first playthrough with it, but I had to reload countless times due to this absolute unfair crap. 'Git gud' does not apply to this nonsense, it's impossible to predict whether the enemy will be able to see you through the wall/roof and target you.I can't recommend this game, it's nowhere near finished.

												I played the game 6 months after release and was hit by gamebreaking bugs. Missions getting stuck without any kind of warning and buttons simply not working. Aliens and x-com operatives being able to shoot through roofs/floors. If you take a look at the last 48 hours posts it's filled with bugs making it seem like the game breaks as many bugs as they fix with each patch.It's an awesome game! Love the new mechanics. But if bugs are literally preventing gameplay and as such the game isn't worth my money. It's not early acces. Its a full priced release. Stay away from it if you want the devs to learn to finish their games before release...			"

												This game. This game is the best game I ever played. It's a well deserved sequel to XCOM: EU/EW. The story is better, actually explaining  why the aliens came to earth. I still has the same feel of EU/EW if you have the right mods. I will get to that later.Look at my hours.  Look at them! It's a testament to how entertained I am by this game. I'm  still  playing it. I pre-ordered it, and thus played it right from the start.The customization. Oh man, the customization. Compared to EU/EW's, it's like comparing a bow to a sub machine gun. You can create bios, give their armor and weapons colors and pattern, and change their attitude, which affects how the soldiers say lines in the game, something which I found really cool. Mods add even more stuff.The mods. Mother of God, the mods. If there is any reason to buy this game, it's because of the mods. It increases the overall score of the game from 5 stars to ten stars. There are voicepacks, mods with custom voices for your characters. There are alien mods, adding more diverse aliens to the game. Cosmetic mods give your characters serious, realistic items to choose from when designing them. Like the old armors from EU/EW? There's a mod for that. Want Halo SPARTANS in your roster? There's a mod for that. Want more weapons? Multiple mods add more choices for your arsenal. want a weird, funny one? There's a mod that adds the horse mask.  The  horse mask, the one from all the memes. There are a numerous of gameplay mods that improve the base game, eliminating its faults.On the subject of faults, there are some cons:Timers: In the vanilla missions, most of the time you have to complete your objective within a certain amount of turns. There is also the Avatar Project. That's basically a bar that fills up as the aliens progress, and when it reaches its fullness, it usually means game over. If you're like me, you like to take your sweet♥♥♥♥♥time playing this game, and don't like to rush. Well, there's a mod for that too. Some eliminate the Avatar Project and timers altogether, or ones that extend them. Problem solved.So, if you're a big fan of XCOM and turn based strategy games, buy this. You won't regret it. Good luck, Commander.			"

												XCOM Enemy Unknown was a game I beat the first try, but with heavy casualties.X-COM: UFO Defense had me only barely winning the war for Earth with over 70 casualties.XCOM 2 destroyed my squad one by one then killed Shen in a derelict lab, only 4 hours in.XCOM EU had me taking all high cover, setting up flanking positions for every battle.X-COM UFOD had me staggering the position of my soldiers to minimize explosive impact and get ready to auto-shot at any incoming Snakemen that could come from the barn door before sending in Rk. Expendable to open it up and trigger any reaction shots.XCOM 2 had me breaking out a sweat as my whole strategy, hinging on my Sniper shooting an ADVENT Officer to break supression, missed and left my Demolitionist for certain death in the next turn by the hands of a Faceless he couldn't run from.XCOM EU sent countries into panic but with the right strategy and a bit of luck, I managed to hold the world together.X-COM UFO D was something I made it out of with a wing and a prayer, as countries formed secretive pacts with the aliens and gave up on X-COM one by one.  I mortgaged half my base to afford the trip to Cydonia.XCOM 2 had the world doomed before the game even began, and the aliens can shut you down with a single command.  And they will.  And they have.  Twice.XCOM 2 is everything EU was, but even better.  You're now the Guerilla side, but with aliens far superior in technology.  They have the upper hand, and you don't even have a chance.  While your soldiers are much more powerful than before with slightly improved technology and brand new classes, along with powerful new skill trees and passive bonuses per class, the aliens counter this with reinforcements, armies, and advantages you can't compare with-- but you can certainly dent them and make a mark.  This is a game I'll spend 400 hours or more in without succeeding once.Everything from the aesthetic, the soundtrack that puts a new twist on the original game (you can clearly hear the influence of GMGEO1.mid and TACTICAL on some of the songs), and the behavior of AI makes the game feel oppressive and brutal, making it all the more amazing when-- sorry, if-- you pull off a perfect operation.I'd talk about the ending, but I can't-- mostly because I haven't made it anywhere in the game.Good luck, 'commander.'  You're going to need it, but you certainly won't get it.9/10==UPDATE==I figured that, given the kind of game this is, I'd use this review to keep track of my current W/L ratio for this game.  I know, six hours, a bit early, but I need to do this or I'll lose track fast.WIN: 0LOSE: 2			"

												I wanted to like new-XCOM2.  I really did.  But here's how it is.  New- XCOM 2 is sufficiently buggy that I can't tolerate playing it any more.New-XCOM1 was a worthy successor - in terms of gameplay - and reboot - in terms of story - of the original Enemy Unknown. It reintroduced everyone to the story, provided a feel that was similar without being identical, and put its own, slightly new twist on things.New-XCOM2 was just new-XCOM1 in a new skin. Except it was supposed to take place 20 years after new-XCOM1... only, in those 20 years, apparently all technology, information, and equipment from the first game was... lost. Disappeared. Who knows?  The story line doesn't make any sense, and the writing isn't a whole lot better. The difficulties levels are ridiculous (Toddler, Unforgiving, and Don't Even Bother) and the actual game mechanics and interactions are woefully unexplained which can lead someone down an in-game-month-long rabbit hole, only to realize you screwed up something up all that time ago and now can't fix it.Worse, and fatally, the program itself is a buggy nightmare.  It has bugs both inside the game - you can destroy crates and trees and other things, and there is still ghost ""cover"" that your units can hide behind, despite nothing actually being there - and in the program itself - I've been playing the game for a little over two weeks, and not a day has gone by when the program hasn't fatally crashed and had to send a report back to the mothership. I've had to do the whole ""verify integrity of game files"" thing seven times alone.Today was the last straw, though. Just wrapped up a mission to destroy an alien base, and it fatally crashes /every/ time I exfil my troops. Reload the game, crashes again. Reboot the computer, crashes again. So basically I can't progress in the game any more.I hate to say it, but it appears as though Firaxis Games and 2K are trading on the name they inherited and the good will of folks who played the original, and both are only going to last so long.My recommendation is to load up a Long War instance of new-XCOM1 and save yourself the money.

												If you planning to buy; Don’t do it until it has 2-3 hot fix/patch (usually 1-2 month).If you are an UFO (XCOM) fan i recommend you to buy it, but keep an eye in the 2 hour refund period.It seems the game was not QA-d or programmers checked it and some bugs got lower priority than is should be and you will encounter them at beginning and in core places. Also feels like marketing pushed the game to hard and let many annoying bug in just to keep release date. Shame for AAA game exclusive for PC.What need to be worked on:- Game crashes in various places (example: when you switches area in your ship while someone is talking to you) - Animation sometime freezes or laggy- Frame rate drops for no reason multiple times- Mostly the mission objective needs to be reached under a turn limit which eliminates ""safe"" or ""go around/behind enemy"" tactic. You need to rush cover from cover in straight line. - You get mind controlling enemy in first mission while you have just your beginner equipment. - The grenade is your best friend in early game- The melee unit is the only unit you need the rest is just nuisance (i hope it will be balanced soon)- If enemy is in cover you have 32-38-42% hit chance even if you stand next to him behind the cover (like if enemy stand near a wall)- You can search dead bodies but you wont have time to do it if its died outside of your main path due to turn limit- At the end of each mission you need to ""clear all remaining enemy""			"

												Unfortunately, I have to echo the sentiments of a lot of other reviewers here. XCom2 delivers a great core game, playing off of the strengths of its predecessors, but a few design flaws (and a LOT of bugs and graphical issues) have sunk the game experience for me.People have already outlined those issues in detail, but a short list:EVERYTHING IS ON A TIMER (EVEN THE WORLD MAP). The aliens are working on  the ""Avatar Project"" (which might as well be named the Deus Ex Machina project), which ticks forward, often out of your control. God help you if you want to try to get anything done, because you'll be spending all your time on...RESOURCE DROPS. Yes, to get any supplies, you'll now have to sit over them, like a hen laying on an egg, to get any resources. However, you won't be able to do this, because...EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS ALARMING ALL THE TIME. Missions pop up all the time and while you're sometimes given a choice as to which one to do, you damned sure better do ONE of them, and best of luck because...YOU'RE S.O.L. IF YOUR A-TEAM DIES. I don't mind difficult games. In fact, I like the permadeath nature of XCom; it gives your missions and decisions weight and I'll admit having to fight the urge to save-scum when one of my favorite soldiers died. However, the random nature of your missions means that it's entirely possible to get three of those ""not mandatory but actually pretty mandatory"" missions outlined above, and if you take any damage at all, you'll have to bring in fresh recruits. Even by mid-campaign, Squaddies and Corporals are effectively useless because...THE COVER MECHANICS AND TO HIT NUMBERS MAKE NO SENSE. I take a reasonably seasoned corporal with a Tier 2 railgun, put him directly next to a muton with no cover at all under the effects of suppression, and my to hit is... 18%. What? Are XCom soldiers half-stormtrooper? A big giant unit with big giant HP and armor is apparently faster than a speeding bullet. You'll be surprised when a stun lancer hits you literally through a wall because...THE COVER MECHANICS MAKE LITERALLY NO SENSE. Hitting through walls? a 20% to hit percentage difference on two of the same creatures literally right next to each other? Sure, why not. I don't care anymore.I almost never buy anything on launch day, and like I said, I loved XCom EU/EW, and I was excited for this game. But there's a difference between difficulty and gimmick, and the challenge here is not winning the game by playing it; it's winning the game in spite of the game itself.For now, I'm waiting on a patch to resolve the glitches and bugs (of which there are many), and to fine-tune the numbers, before I download some of the (excellent) mods and go back for another playthrough. There IS an excellent game here, I just hope Firaxis is able to squash enough of the bugs to create the game that should have been there at launch. "

												Okay. So i played the crap out of this game. As you can see at my play hours.I understood and learned a bunch of things about it, so let's get started:The game takes place 20 years after the Defeat of XCOM in the original game, going from a timeline where they lost their base at the hands on the alien Invasion. From there, they now work at a salvaged Alien Ship, from the looks of it seems to be one of the Heavy class ship of old. Earth is now subjugated and you are the leader of the resistance forces who fight against their rule. You, the Commander, must fight back against a new and sinister enemy know as ADVENT, an governemnt organization created by the Coalition between humans and the Alien Elders, while trying to stop a secret project that could be the end of mankind.GAMEPLAY ASPECTS and thoughts on it:> The RNG and POSITIONING-Tactical based gameplay similar to the original game, but improved. More organized than the previous titles.It requires not only strategic thinking to turn odds to your favor, but also a little bit of luck in a RNG dice roll. That said, the RNG is heavily influenced by how you are positioned and protected. You will not hit every shot, and the aliens can hit you with some lucky shots, however both of you are governed by the same rules, with the veteran difficulty balancing the tip towards your favor with ""Miss Streaks"" and ""Aim Assists"" for your soldiers. At higher difficulties, those differences cease, you and the aliens obey the same odds.A bad positioning effectively means your defeat, and a strong positioning can lead you to victory. Keep that in mind while playing and you will find yourself depending less on luck and more in how you place your troops. (It may happen the hilarious 95% chance miss, it's not frequent and quite rare, unless the game really decided to hate you all of a sudden).> SKILLS and ABILITIES-Abilities are important, as they can bless you with guaranteed hits you will definetly need in some situations. It can turn the tide of battles very quickly to your favor. That said, the enemy can do the very same things with their abilities should the circunstances present themselves. Two units close to each may result in a grenade flying towards you. Or one of the powerful abilities the aliens have may be used against you.With that in mind you will understand that some aliens must be taken out first, or that will result in one of your troopers being dragged across the map or half of your squad poisoned.Different Aliens mean different aproach and different strategies, learn your enemy in order to defeat them.> CLASSES and PROGRESS- There are effectively 4 default classes for your troops with 1 special class divided in two ability trees that give them different roles in combat, the abilities can be mixed, so you are not stuck with just one role or the other, and given the proper infrastructure, you can retrain them (although you cannot change their class)- The Aliens do have different types of enemies with different abilities, however their upgrades are based around the progression know as ""force level"" and ""Dark Events"". -> The force level effectively defines the type of alien you will face, as well as the upgrades towards aliens you already encounter. A common trooper will become and Advanced trooper as the time moves forward, and later in the game you will be facing Elite level troopers and more powerful Aliens.-> Dark Events are strategic elements that rule over your campaign, they can last 1 to 2 months depending on the Event, or add points to their secret project. They can range from adding poison coated ammo to your enemies, or sent a UFO to hunt your SHIP.>RESEARCH:The research element is straight to the point, have a material, research it. Have a corpse, autopsy it. Have a thing, do this thing. You can improve your research time with more scientists.>ENGINEERING:Also straight to the point. You research a thing, you acquired a blueprint on that thing, you build that thing.With the exception on the proving grounds, where takes time to construct an armor or make said blueprint. Experimental item blueprints give you a random item that can make a hell of a difference in your performance. Or building an more advanced armor that is not the default medium choice.-TIP-Research and Engineering can save you if you had your star squad wiped by a couple of bad decisions, however, losing missions over and over may result in campaign victory for the aliens, and you falling behind in force level category, where there's simply no way for you to face them anymore without you effectively turning a simple encounter into an epic struggle between untrained troops and powerful alien overlords. Which most of the time will result in Death if you are not of the most experienced XCOM player.That said, these elements make an realistic representation in technology gap, if you don't keep up with your enemy, you will get steam rolled across the battlefield. It also means that if you manage to get the Early advantage in boosting your crew Engineers and Scientist staff, you will effectively do the same thing to them, although it all comes down in how you manage your squad into battle. Once you get the hang of it, you will rarely lose a mission, maybe a soldier or two.>STORYLINE MISSIONS and OBJECTIVES:- There are a couple of missions that represent the Storyline progression, which are required to complete in order to reach the end and win the game. Some have the term of ""catasthropical failure"", which results in instant victory for the aliens should you lose it. Missions with that term allow you to restart it and try again, or restart the game with a new campaign. One of the two.--------- In regards to DLC -----------Alien Hunters:- This DLC adds four new powerful itens and three new powerful aliens for you to face along your campaign. With a story element should you decide to have the complete.-> Having the story mode selected you will have a mission that starts the scenario, the enemies will not appear until you decide to.-> Not having the story mode selected results in the enemies appearing normaly in the campaign and the weapons appearing in the engineering section for you to build them.Shen's last gift:- This DLC adds a MEC to your squad. An early game useless unit but a late game monster with the technological improvements. Like the Alien Hunters, it does have an story element that allows you to start the DLC. If not selected, you will be able to build it as soon as you get the Proving grounds.Anarchy's Children:- A cosmetic DLC, it adds anarchy themed cosmetics to the game for you soldiers customization. The flavour is not for everyone and honestly, you can find better mods for your cosmetics. Although it has a cool piece here and there, it doesn't justify a DLC.Resistance warrior pack:- Another cosmetic DLC, that in it's size, doesn't justify a DLC. And for some reason is not included in the reinforcement pack.------- Personal suggestion for developers --------If you are planning on making a DLC for the game, i would suggest one where we could play as the Aliens in their Storyline, it seems that it has a room for expansion and will allow for a different perspective. It would introduce an different aspect to the game since the we would be playing on the Aliens Side. and will allow for some player to have a choice to subjugate humanity, or not, depending what the aliens are really thinking.It seems like a silly suggestion but it has room for potential if done correctly.------- Overall ---------It's a game that is supposed to be Brutal and unforgiving on combat side, any early mistake can lead to a defeat. It does get easier over time as you progress, but even so, it's not for casual or newbies that can't learn from their mistakes. Although Veterans can have a very casual experience.Overall.8 / 10 for Gameplay. 7 / 10 for Strategy. 4 / 10 for DLC. 7 / 10 for Story.			"

												It's better than 1, it has Armor, it has new units, the graphics are extremely good and everything is nice and dandy, except for that one thing that keeps this game from being actually great:The Spawn and Engagemechanics for the aliens is broken. The way it works is you ""activate"" a squad of aliens as soon as you see them. Depending on how far you are in your turn this deems your squadron either to doom or to an unfair advantage for you. It's hard to explain, contrary to the old originals the enemies don't really roam on the map independently. They have their attention radius and they attack all XCOM operatives in that radius but they don't care if their mates are fighting or dieing, as long as they don't see an XCOM operative they don't care.This leads to several weird, stupid situations:- If you go in closecombat with an alien to finish it off it can be that because you moved close to it you just triggered an alien group behind that alien that now will position itself. Because you probably just finished your activation this group gets a full turn of actions.- Oftentimes you have concealment at the start of a mission, let's say you see 2 alien squads relatively close to each other just move in a way where you don't see the other anymore barely and then attack. That squad won't lift a finger even if they are an arms length from their dieing comrades. It makes absolutely no sense.Lets say it's the other way around,  you didn't finish the alien in Melee but with ranged weapons, now this alien patrol accidentally walks into YOUR attention radius. They position themselves but in their turn and you get a full turn to react to them giving you a relatively unfair advantage. Just like in XCOM1 it discourages you from splitting up your squadron and truly flanking your enemy because normally you just active another Alien Squad which completely negates the aspect of flanking.I'm pretty sure they tried to fix this weird gamedesign with the introduction of constant timepressure in missions to avoid the constant baiting one tile at a time gameplay. Doesnt really work, tactical games like this shouldnt have 90% of these types of missions just to cover up this glaring issue of gameplay. It feels like you're gaming the system, encouraging you to either safescum or losing all your soldiers to stupid mechanics that you cannot influence no matter how skilled you are. You have to cheese the system and then you are fine, it doesnt feel like you master tactical combat, it feels like you abuse the spawning mechanics and that's it.Before you jump on my neck, i finished the first one in classic ironman and i'm doing relatively well in this one but i just can't get past this very important gameplay aspect. It feels out of place, it swings the favour way to much either in your or against your enemies way and it strips the game unfortunately alot from many tactical decisions.This is, like Xcom 1, a ""good"" game but ultimately missed the mark in how combat works. It's definitely not holding a candle to the old titles that got this just right, but suffer from old gameplay. It's a shame as they fixed and introduced armor to the game that works really well for instance.Hence i cannot recommend XCOM2, i'm not sure i keep playing but i feel underwhelmed by what it is even though the production value is very high across the board.

												Not happy with this game at all,Choppy and stuttering in missions during action and before and after.Bugs and bugs, game has crashed at cut scene, crashed after missions.And then my biggest let down in game:Every mission so far after the tutorial is a rush mission, you have x amount of turn to do something. This kills the game for me as well as take away the strategy part completely. I have to rush and shoot, thats the only tactic because i have no time. I hate these missions. What i do not understand is why all missions i have done so far is those timed missions. This killed the game for me and last XCOM game from these guys for me. The first XCOM game had some missions like that but was not a lot but this GAME, every damn mission so far just ONE damn tactic, RUSH, because there is no time.Where is the tactics and strategy in this game?Maybe they patch this to take out the timers in some of the missions but my vote is NO for now.And of course the stuttering and crashing, hope to see a patch soon.Edit:Some more bugs:Esc key does not work in base all the time, so no way to exit game or bring up menu. Only way is to kill the task.Buttons not working on map, you cannot click them, also buttons (not all) inside base does not work, this goes hand in hand with when the Esc key does not work.I have to go in several times before i am lucky and all buttons working.Save games does not want to load, especially the autosaves, they are corrupt and game just stuck at load screen.

												By virtue of its insane modding accessibility this game is a shoein for a recommendation on that alone, which is fortunate given a number of technical problems it had at launch. Since then it's improved stability substantially, and the added official content compliments the experience well (and is entirely optional and easily toggled for those not interested).Tentative buy at full price for fans of the genre, and easily recommended at discount. Now, if only Firaxis can figure out how to do co-op...			"

												Yes.  This is gaming.High stakes, dare-to-be-great situations, customizable soldiers, and plenty of explosions and pewpewpew!  The sequel and most recent iteration of the Xcom franchise is not PERFECT, but is a worthy edition and worthy of a playthrough.As the game opens, it is revealed that all the struggle to boot the alien menace off planet was for naught, and the invasion force has insinuated themselves as a mildly sinister ""first among equals"".Yes, all those hours playing the first game are not part of this narrative.  Get over it.Similar to the formula of the series, you are the direction and driving force of the resistance movement, allocating resources of various types in order to create an irresistable tide of cash, supplies, sentiment, and artillery to send them bug-eyed aliens back where the come from.  The planetwide metagame is familiar, as is the squad-based encounter maps, as you equip your troop carrier with strike teams for defense, or targets of opportunity.Part of the fun of this game was the customization of the individual soldiers as they increase in their individual class-based proficiencies and as your rag-tag resistance movement comes into more potent technology.  Over the course of the game, an individual soldier can go from the equivalent of hitting oogga-boogas on the head with a stick to ""Over 9,000"" cyberwarriors laying waste to the countryside.   The game fights back by introducing aliens of different strains with different strengths to force changes in squad tactics.The limitations of the game become evident on the first playthrough as the technobabble from your chief science officer can be omitted from the story with a mouse-click and a ""Yeah, whatever. What can I blow up now?"", and the mission objectives don't have a lot of variety. Overlooking these glaring flaws, the rest of the game is straight-up fun strategy.  Now that the game is no longer a new release, the expansion packs will be added, giving new life to new baddies, and further customization options.  As of this date, I have only played the core, game, but I recommend it VERY highly.XCOM 2: The people of Earth need you, WILL YOU HEED THE CALL? "

												An incredible game worthy of full price, something I have not been able to say about the overwhelming majority of AAA (and otherwise) titles these days.  If you are a fan of turn based strategy combat, and a minor basebuilding overworld that involves an early-mid game frantic pace where you juggle resources and make key decisions, Xcom 2 should be right up your alley.It improves on almost every facet of the original, though the base building is a little bare bones in comparison, since the nature of this game is quite different and your mothership is your home base so naturally, there are a lot fewer choices to make.  If you played the first one, you will be right at home, nothing is so vastly different that you won't be able to infer what its role or function is.The story is pretty well done, albeit a little sparse, and towards the end it does feel a little anti-climatic but really Xcom is about having a badass group of marines and the amazing combat.  A gripe many people will have (myself included) will be in regards to the some what questionable RNG that determines the success or failure of your tactics within the game.  When I think of 80-95% chance of success, I think of it as an almost sure thing.  When you miss 4 of those in a row, you begin to really question how accurate the numbers depicted upon the screen are.... but as everyone says Xcom is Xcom, and this is just part of the experience.  You can miss a 95% and you can hit a 20%.  The game isn't without its moments where you'd like to put an axe through your monitor.Unfortunately, there are definitely some performance issues and bugs/glitches with the current game.  The game, as impressive as it looks, is certainly not what you'd expect to push your gaming rig to its limits, yet your frames will drop inexplicably, mini cutscenes will stutter, and overall you will notice some choppiness.  Where as it's not aggregious for me (GTX980 TI, 16 gb RAM, SSD, I74790k), it still is bothersome that this game isn't running flawlessly.There is quite a bit of graphical clipping issues, it seems the engine has trouble dealing with structures, walls, doors, windows, and multi-level buildings.  Often your character will stick his gun through a seemingly solid object, or try to smash out a window that is already smashed, walk through a door, be pulled through a building, shot through solid cover, etc.   Where as it is annoying and takes away from immersion, the game is still so robust, deep, and rewarding that I found myself looking past it.  It's just too damn enjoyable to let those things drag down the experience.One would hope Firaxis is aware and addressing these issues, because once they are fixed, this game is a VERY strong contender for GOTY.   Certainly, this is the best tactical strategy game I've played, and the extensive modding capabilities the game has only means great things when you get guys like the creators of the Long War  working on all manners of new content - for free.All in all, despite the somewhat unforgivable performance issues of a PC-Exclusive, this game is definitely what I would consider a must-buy for anyone who is a fan of the genre.9.5/10			"

												I was excited for this game. The bugs, performance issues and turn limits are disappointing though.  It's bad enough that the aiming system seems mostly unchanged from EU/EW, but combined with the turn limits it is a very frustrating game to play at times. Rushing across maps while your own soldiers can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥literally next to them at times makes for a worse experience than EU/EW, because at least you had time to try again in that game. I'm hoping someone does something about the turn limit. The story seems good though, and there's more customization options.			"

												If you enjoyed any of the previous XCOM games, don't read any further - just play this game!Amazing turn based gameplay. Complex and deep customisation/progression of your squad and base.Graphics are lush. I had it all the way up on ultra on my GTX970 and it played well until there were a lot of characters on screen at once and that's when the close up view of shots/reaction fire slowed down. I used the NVidia recommended settings which dropped a few things down slightly like the anti aliasing and to be honest I can't tell the difference and it runs smooth as f*** now.Some people don't like that some maps have a timer (not always a turn countdown). I didn't like the sound of it before in played and now after 40+ hours I can say it actually makes the game better. It changes up your approach and the gameplay and keeps the game fresh after and makes you the better tactician as you have to fully understand your squad and the battlefield. There is an overarching 'countdown' but it hasn't been a problem, again just adds to the overall game. I haven't completed this game yet but I still give it a 10/10 and name it as my PC game of 2016 so far!Seriously sweet.			"

												This game has only just begun and I already stopped counting how often it tripped over its own procedural generation of content. Your squad can only carry so much firepower. Even if a 100 % of your shots hit, sometimes a squad simply does not have the firepower (leave alone the staying power) to move from point A to B to C and dispatch everything that happens to spawn along the way within the turn limit set by the game. Further into the game, the glaring line of sight bugs also become very annoying. I don't know how often my sniper shot someoe through walls, floors or ceilings on overwatch. Or how often an alien did it on me. I've had entire firefights with all units on both teams exchanging gunfire right through (yet) intact walls. At this point, the game comes down to save-scumming until you get lucky. Recommendation: hands off for now, XCOM2 is simply broken in its current state.			"

												Meh, With the combination of Vipers grabing through walls, the enemy still getting free turns, arbitrarily reduced accuracy and arbitrarily increased recovery time. Enemy Unknown was simply a better gameEdit: Doubled my play time, Vipers are slightly less BS but can still grab through walls. Turns out Sectoids can mindcontrol and run away which is.... fun... Timed missions are too common, game is more fun without a time window. Free turns are still super annoying. Concealment is not as common as I'd like it to be. Shaken takes far too long to drop off without doing a mission and with doing a mission it's pretty luck based if they get hit or notSome good points, Greivous wounds cause scars which is pretty cool, Getting a 5 squad is easy and a 6 squad about the same, PCM (PCS?) can give you a nice bit of specialization or plug some holes. Autopsies actually do something. Random loot drops are pretty interesting but losing them when you replace them is a bit BSI would give it a middle thumb rather than a down thumb but Steam is straight black and white, I'd say wait a bit unless you really like XCOMEdit 2: Did a mission 100% stealth grabbed the package and EVAC in the same turn, was detected on the turn I left. Failed mission... kdenEdit 3: Mods can really fix a few things. Such as increased Rookie aim (From 60 to 70%) True Concealment (Timers dont tick unless revealed) and Squad Size Increase (Allows the purchase of a 7th and 8th slot for 175/200 supplies at ranks Major/Captain  respectively)A story of BS: Faceless spawned behind my heavy on the 2nd floor, swiped for 4 damage, destroyed the floor making him fall for 4 damage to which he paniced and run, triggering suppression reaction fire criting for 7 damage killing him from full HP and 1 armour			"

XCOM 2 XCOM 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Enemy Unknown. Does it surpass its predecessor with flying spaceships or misses with near perfect aim, let's find out:Gameplay:XCOM 2 starts with a story which starts by telling you that you lost the war you waged against the aliens and now it's time to avenge humanity. I personally did not find the story of Enemy Unknown too thrilling, its pacing was abrupt and there were some logic gaps. XCOM 2 has a much better story with brilliant pacing and a very satisfying conclusion. Nearly each battle of XCOM 2 starts off with you planning an ambush for the aliens. The previous hunters are now the hunted. There is a specific turn limit in which you must finish your battles. While I don't like these things in any game, XCOM 2 handles it very well. This turn limit makes you really think out your strategies in advance and instead of just hiding behind some containers, you actually try to fight your enemies, which is a very good thing. The thrill which you achieve when an alien group is trapped completely by your squad and seeing that your plan worked is an tremendous achievement. XCOM 2 is still more of the XCOM you know of, you lead a party which are insanely customizable. You grow a bond with the squad mates you play with and it breaks your heart when one of these squad members die on the battle field. This guerrila warfare can easily go wrong in this game and sometimes you have to withdraw your soldiers from the battlefield to save their lives and in turn lose the battle. XCOM 2 is an improvement upon Enemy Unknown in every regard. There are a number of weapons available on your disposable and the game rewards the player's thinking. The game plays faster and there is a key tactical element called Overwatch introduced in the game which makes things easier to examine and play but it also is a thing that is quite expensive at times. There are your usual things like upgrading and managing you base, your soldier's equipment and such. As I said, there is a huge amount of customization available here.  Each map is a little random every time you play it which makes it much more replayable than the previous one. The randomness also means you can't remember each tactical place and that makes it that much more thrilling. XCOM 2 doesn't stray too much from the familiar formula and you can still miss shots at 95% chance, though it never feels familiar as those cases are really rare. The single player campaign is lengthy and will last you a minimum of 20-25 on hard difficulty. Aside from this, there is a multiplayer mode which lets you play as the aliens. While playing as the aliens is exciting, the multiplayer feature is pretty bare bones. I would recommend playing the multiplayer version against friends to get the most fun out of it. The UI is simple and easy to browse through. The tutorial also does a good job in easing a new player in the game. When it initially launched, XCOM 2 was marred by a multitude of bugs. Now, nearly 10 months later, the game is pretty much fixed. Sure, you may find a couple of glitches here and there but nothing game breaking. On the plus side, the modding community for the game is thriving and it has already produced some really nice ones.VisualsVisually, XCOM 2 looks excellent. While it does not sport photo realistic graphics, it does have gorgeous looking maps and excellent character models. The cutscenes are done brilliantly and the texture is simply amazing. The alien models especially look far much superior to the ones in the original and now look far more diverse now. The maps have a good amount of detail and they look gorgeous especially when the sun is shining. The characters look superb and it's a blast customizing them and seeing them in battle field. Overall, XCOM features striking visuals which are a pleasure to view at.SoundThe sound design of XCOM 2 is done very well. The voices are very well acted and the usual random sounds are heightened to a new level. When you are waiting for a new turn, the slow build up makes it all the more tense. The main soundtrack itself is very good to listen at and helps in building the environment.OverallXCOM 2 is an improvement over Enemy Unknown in every single way. It features excellent combat and a fast paced story. The randomized maps makes it more replayable and there a ton of customization options available to the player. The modding community for this game also looks promising and gives it a bright future. It looks good, plays good and has taken tons of hours of my life. I can't ask more from a game. It is, by far, one of the best strategy games I have ever played.Rating : 95/100 "

												I'll start by saying I'm really enjoying this game and don't regret getting it, however I don't reccomend buying it at full price in the state that it's in. If you can get it cheaper then go for it, provided you're a fan of EU/EW. XCOM 2 is more of the same, with a bit of different. There's a lot of good here and a lot of bad, but the bad is fixable, it's just that it shouldn't have been there to begin with.Pros:-The new base management and overworld stuff is pretty fun and in my opinion makes it feel like you're not just sitting and waiting for something to happen. Instead of having to try to manage a bunch of ""feal levels"", but only being able to affect one at a time, there's only one meter to worry about, and there are multiple ways to manage it. Having to make contact with different countries instead of having to prevent losing them gives you a bit more option as to how you approach things.-The new/updated classes feel a lot more balanced and interesting. Each one having two distinct specializations makes your squad more diverse, however a couple of them do feel underpowered, specifically the scout and combat hacker trees.-The weapon changes make things a lot less tedious in some aspects, but moreso in others. Pistols on the sharpshooter class are fantastic, they're decently powerful and give your sniper a way to fight in close quarters and able to attack/overwatch after moving. Being able to attack or move after reloading is just great, so taking away secondaries on all the other classes doesn't really hurt.Meh:-Turn timers, I know people are so divided on these which is why I put them in meh instead of cons, but I dislike them. I feel that they force you to play a certain way, even if you don't want to. I've had missions where I had to rush through enemies or else I wouldn't make it in time, causing me to risk my soldiers. There are already lots of mods to change how they work, whether it be increasing turns, reducing the amount of missions that use them, or outright getting rid of them.-concealment adds a nice way to setup ambushes, however in most cases it doesn't work out like you think it would. This ties in to turn timers, in that the timers are counting down even while you're trying to set up your ambush. It's just not viable to try to tactically ambush the enemy when you have to get to the evac zone in 8 turns. Also having all enemies suddenly just know where you are when you break concealment can easily lead to you being surrounded if you're not careful.Cons:-Performance issues out the♥♥♥♥♥ Supposed to be patched.-Glitches out the♥♥♥♥♥ Supposed to be patched.-I don't know if it's a glitch or just poor design, but line of sight is just super wonky. I've had enemies attacking me through walls, stun lancers meleeing people through the floor above them, and worst of all, snakes pulling my guys through as many as three walls with no holes or windows in any of them, effectively dooming them.-The difficulty curve is steep. Really steep. Within 5 missions I was fighting against armored enemies that could destroy my cover, incapacitate my troops, and almost kill them in one attack, while I was still researching t2 weapons and armor. Enemies pop up randomly one after another, giving you almost no time to adjust your strategy.-Dodge. If that's not specific enough, most enemies have a chance to dodge, causing you to do greatly reduced damage. I know the discussion of rng has been done to death, but sometimes it feels like they just always dodge.-Your soldiers' wounded level seems to be completely arbitrary. Soldiers that take 10% damage get gravely wounded and are out of the fight for a month to recover 2 hp. I've read of people having soldiers take over 50% damage and only being lightly wounded, but take 2 fall damage and be gravely wounded. Hopefully they can patch the performance and glitches, with that I'd say it's worth it, but until then no. Other than that it's up to you whether these things bother you or not.			"

												""We are extremely impressed with XCOM 2 project thus far, Firaxis. Your recent results were beyond my expectations... And that is not a statement i make lightly.""While i have a small number of grievances here and there, they are fairly minor in comparison. With the recent games Starships and Beyond Earth, i was afraid Firaxis might've lost their touch. Though Beyond Earth was pretty decent, it was no near as fun, deep or satisfying as CiV5. XCOM 2 however restored my faith.Truly, XCOM 2 cranks its predecessor up to 11. As your opponents have grown in power and unpredictability, there's an even stronger reason to fear what potential weapon they might unleash upon you next. However, so have you. Everything feels powerful, dangerous and there's few things as satisfying as scoring a critical hit and watching a 3 meters tall monstrosity get blown away from a shotgun round. Though performance seems to be a littly wonky at times (framerate drops when in the Avenger or when deploying a flashbang grenade), it's been fairly stable for me with no bugs aside from the AI suddenly going idle once. For 16 hours of playtime on a newly released game, that's a pretty good thing in my book.Excellent production values shine everywhere. This is apparent in the smaller details as well, such as the great soundtrack and voice acting, soldier customization and the excellent atmosphere in map design that truly gives you a dystopian feel. Not to mention that XCOM2 has an amazingly badass Workshop. Where The Long War was pretty much the best alternative for the original, there's already a bunch of sweet stuff for you to go on, the game is really built to last on a strong mod community - while still providing a base game that's filled to the brim with content.The only thing, gameplay wise that bothers me is that they've added a turn limit. You must complete the objective before the timer runs out, which is usually pretty tight. Though it gives off a feeling of hurry, anxiety and fear - for a game that's partially built on chance and tactics, it's frustrating and doesn't fit well. Thankfully there are mods in the Workshop that remove or increase the turn limit, of which the latter one i highly recommend using. While this is the biggest issue i have, it can be avoided entirely, so i guess it's not much to bother with.In conclusion, any fan of XCOM or TBS will love it. Hell, i think anyone will enjoy it. And i have some very high hopes for the expansion and modding community. Possible GOTY!Edit: Seems performance issues are something some people are running into. None here, surprisingly, since nearly every game that's currently being released is full of bugs and performance issues. However, in my experience, XCOM 2 runs smoothly and without problems. Still, i would highly recommend taking proper precautions, such as giving the game's bug forum a read before picking up the game.			"

												I do recommend the game, but what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the producers. Its been out for a year and still is full of bugs. I have 5 hours of play time so far and have found NUMEROUS visual bugs, 2 programming bugs (button doesnt do what it says it does), and 1 game crash. Because of these problems I changed my vote to 'not reccomend.' Legit only bought this game for the Long War mod, but decided to play vanilla just to learn the game. That was a mistake. 60$ for a broken game. What a pile of garbage. Thank god Long War fixes some of the issues, as well as makes the game what it should have been in the first place.			"

												This game has a lot of potential but the performance and optimisation issues would need to be addressed before I could recommend it to anybody. An isometric turn-based strategy game should not perform worse on a modern gaming PC than The Witcher 3 or Rise of the Tomb Raider. 2K have made a big deal about this being a PC exclusive but something tells me that the reason behind that has less to do with loyalty to their hardcore fanbase and more to do with the fact that they probably don't have the software engineering talent to get it running on anything else right now.

												I loved XCOM.I wanted to love XCOM2 - pre-ordered welll before any reviews.  Nearly sobbed when I found out they'd widely implemented a design choice I intensley dislike in this type of game - time/turn limits.  OK if done sparingly, but not to the extent taken here.  From what I've heard/seen, this is simply an artificial attempt to increase difficulty by enforcing a rushed style of play, which inevitably leads to mistakes and false impression of ""difficulty"".Basically - v poor game designHave refunded - will happily pick up again if/when someone manages mod time limits out.So sadly - for me a not recommend due to this limitation - UNLESS you're OK with them, in which case - fill your boots!!!

												If you took XCOM and added a couple of minor bugs, one or two game-breaking bugs, broke some functionality and made interface worse and less user friendly, you would get exactly XCOM2. Another large well-known studio which sells their sh** ""AAA"" game for very high price (£35). Such things should be classified as fraud.Bad performance and poor stability random FPS drops occasional crashes cut-scenes are playing before graphics are loaded, making first few seconds of it either very ugly or just black screen with sounds after one mission, whenever I open geosphere the game freezes - I had to start the campaign over (with disabled mods and tutorial) in later stages of the campaign, the game occasionally gets stuck while loading a saveBroken and user-unfriendly interface most of the interface pretends to be in-game poor quality hologram device and it is blinking, misaligning etc. Very annoying when e.g. reading research report and the text is moving every few seconds... on some screens there are no back/close buttons, making it impossible to navigate with mouse, you have to use keyboard sometimes you have to click the same button multiple times sometimes when you hover over the button to expand a list and then move mouse pointer onto item on the list, the list disappears so you have to hover over the button again, etc. sometimes in the top right corner the video of the talking chief engineer/scientist is shown... all the time... with no sound/text... there is no indication whether quick save was actually made game save doesn't save the camera position and facing direction, neither soldier selection many of the cutscenes and videos are not shown if tutorial is enabled... or maybe that was due to 3 Long War Studios' mods...? sometimes camera is not following the action - is it enemy's turn and you just hear shots and your soldiers being killed? Sorry, all you will see is a wall (or ceiling or undiscovered part of map)Long loading times and a lot of waiting loading a save (even quick load) takes about 20 seconds returning from mission (""flying back"" loading screen) takes a few minutes, a bit shorter when flying to mission with over 100 saved games, it takes over 10 seconds to open the list of saves weird long pauses between soldiers' actions on missions - you soldier has just killed an alien? you have to look at its body for 5 seconds before you can give another order it is impossible to skip soldiers' annimationsFlawed and unpolished gameplay soldiers shooting through walls, without line of sight generally what you see and what actually happens are two different things - so get used to seeing entire burst hitting the enemy accompanied by a popup ""missed"" items drops? The way it works just su***. Enemies occasionally (like 1 every 10) will drop an item, that you have to pick up within 3 turns because otherwise it will disappear. Soldiers don't need any inventory slots for them, picked up items will be just visible as loot on the summary screen weapons upgrades and soldiers' implants? Cannot be produced, can be acquired only via items drops. And the upgrades once placed in, cannot be taken out, only destroyed items manufacturing is extremely confusing and lacks any explanation about how it actually works. I can manufacture two armors - one of them is a single utility item that I can put in soldier's inventory, the other unlocks entirely new armor (new apperance, 2 utility slots, HP bonus) and is available for every soldier. There is nothing indicating whether what you are working on is a single item, unlocking item (i.e. infinite amount of this item) or a research that will let you manufacture an item if you finish a mission while controlling enemy soldier, its body is not retrieved the same if a controlled enemy is killed - it's body just magically disappears ""evasive manoeuvres"" in case of imminent UFO interception mean “fly around entire Earth” or “fly to a nearby location and wait for the UFO until it flies around entire Earth and attacks you”And many, many more various bugs...

												Everyone who knows me well enough knows that I had a ton of hype for this game, and oh boy was it worth it. However, I'm going full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ critic here, leaving my love for the franchise aside and will do my best to give a fair review. And as usual, I'll start with the stuff the game doesn't do right. Luckily, there's only three things:First and most important, the difficulty spikes. I'm not sure who tested the game, but he was high as f#cking f#ck. I know XCOM is not known for being easy and forgibing but COME ON, THE EARLY GAME HAS A BIGGER DIFFICULTY SPIKE THAN CORRUPTED PEOPLE ON THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT! Since the second mission (the first one being the tutorial, unless you disabled it), you'll be usually facing with normal and fair enemies like the ADVENT troops AND THEN THE SECTOIDS COME ARROUND. This early on, the Sectoids have MORE HP than your soldiers, have three powerful PSI attacks, and also a Bracelet-Gun they never seem to f#cking use for some reason. And it's not like in XCOM 1 when they could waste their turn to make another Sectoid better or at times cause panic. Here they still have the panic skill, and can also Mind-control AND reanimate dead people into zombies. ON THE SECOND MISSION. If that ain't enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, wait until the game tasks you to ""hack"" an ADVENT Officer. It's similar to capturing aliens in XCOM 1, but with a LITTLE SURPRISE the game forgot to tell you about: hacking an ADVENT Officer spawns a MID-GAME enemy, which early on will feel like out-right cheating and artificial difficulty. This enemy can TELEPORT AND INSTANTLY FLANK YOU, can cause some sort of Black-Hole which will instantly unload your weapons AND explode for too much damage on the early game on the next turn, has double the HP than any of your soldiers by that moment, AAAAAAAAAAAND will split in half when you injure it. Now you'd think that splitting in half makes it easier to defeat, but no. It doesn't. His clone will usually spawn in the completely direction, and they share no cool-downs. If you're not careful, you'll go from facing one Codex to facing TWO, THREE OR EVEN FOUR CODEX. Sure turning a hard battle into f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The second people is one I don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about, but a ton of people do; Performance. This game is not well optimized. I usually blame games for it, but I must admit it looks good and it's a turn-based game, so playing in low FPS ain't that much of an issue... But I must admit that it got old pretty fast, and the devs yet have to fix most of that, as it took them nearly two weeks to release ONE update. No idea what's going on with that.The third and last problem are the bugs. I haven't played since last week but Oh God I was finding some weird crap. Most of them are LUCKILY only animation errors, but still there's some weird crap out there that will make you either mad or lose it completely. Things like rooms on the ship not loading and literally being see-through as there's LITERALLY NOTHING IN THERE. Things like characters stuck on the wrong animations, now being forced to teleport arround the map and for some reason take 30 seconds to do each action. Things like your character showing as he's on the completely wrong place where he should be. Those are fun. However, thing as having one of your soldiers stuck in mid-air while enemies fire at him, and forced to use EXPLOSIVES to take him down, literally bleeding out, IS NOT FUN AT ALL. There's also weird crap such as pieces of buildings floating all over the places, sh#tting all over gravity, or both XCOM soldiers and aliens dropping through the floor. Things like that make you even wonder if the game was properly beta-tested.That being said though, what do we got left? A seriously good sequel for a seriously good game.Gameplay, ignoring the early game insane spikes, is enjoyable, fun and adds more flavour to a really enjoyable XCOM 1 experience. There's a bigger focus on explosives on this game (as they weren't really that good on the first one), and that goes hand to hand with the mostly completely destructible escenarios.And talking about maps, they're randomized. One time or two they looked similar, but they're always different and that's something I totally love.Customization is not only back, it went Super Saiyan: there are AN INSANE TON of options, and it trully feels amazing.Even better than that though, proper Mod support. And the workshop of Steam already has some fun things on it. Personally I only went so far with customization mods but OH GOD, IS IT FUN TO KILL ALIENS WITH CLASSY TOP HATS AND OVER-SIZED MARIACHI HATS.I haven't played multiplayer yet, so I'll avoid that, but ♥♥♥♥ing hell it was worth the money. And it already has DLC's coming, which I decided to pre-order as I do trust there guys. However, the price tag will scare people off. WAIT for a sale. 50€ ain't cheap at all.Just get ready to miss point-blank shotgun shots. It will happen. That's XCOM, baby! "

												The game in itself is fun. However it keeps crashing and it spoils all the fun for me. I finished it the first time; and excused the bug on the youth of the game at the time. I even bought one of the DLC thinking that the bugs would be patched after all that time. There is less slowdown however the game stills crashes. Savegames are corrupted too, they load but the game will still end up crashing for example when you complete a mission.			"

												If, like me, you played Xcom Enemy Unknown (or its expansion, Enemy Within), you probably remember defeating the aliens who were trying to invade Earth. Unfortunately Commander, there's some bad news.  It turns out that was actually some kind of simulation that the aliens used to understand our tactics, so they could figure out how to beat us.  Earth's citizens have been living under a ""peaceful"" alien rule for 20 years, and you're now part of an underground resistance force, trying to stop the aliens' secret, sinister plan, before its too late.Just like the previous game, Xcom2 is divided into two distinct areas of gameplay: the base, and the missions. During the base phase you can research new technologies, build better weapons, armours and equipment, recruit and train your soldiers and manage your economy. Missions involve taking a squad of upto 6 soldiers to achieve objectives such as protecting some civilians, stealing some intel, recovering an item or destroying an alien base. Combat is the same turn based style as before.Although Xcom 2 is a good game, it didn't quite excite me as much as the previous game did, and I can't quite put my finger on why. I think it might just be because I've played Enemy Unknown/Within for a combined 122 hours across 5 successful campaigns, so although Xcom 2 is bigger and better, there's also an element of ""more of the same"".The Good•	Your soldiers have a fantastic range of abilities. I found every class of soldier to be extremely useful.•	Large variety of aliens with unique abilities including mind control, stun, poison, disable weapons, area of effect attacks, shield allies, teleport, clone, shapeshift ... and probably more that I'm forgetting.•	The combination of above two points results in lots of tactical depth. I often spent a few minutes on my turn just analysing the situation and considering all my options.•	You can upgrade your soldiers' weapons with mods recovered during missions that give special abilities, including reloading the weapon without it costing a turn, bigger clip size, a percentage chance to attack multiple times on your turn, and a percentage chance to get an instant kill no matter how much health the alien has (I actually killed the most powerful robotic enemy in one shot thanks to this, which was a really cool moment).•	The campaign is longer than the previous game. It took me 40 hours to finish, compared to 25 for EU/EW.•	More visual customisation options for your soldiers.The Bad•	The story is fairly generic and none of the characters are particularly interesting. It doesn't help that the player character never speaks. If there's another sequel, I'd like to see a bit of Mass Effect style banter in between missions with the guys back at your base, to add a bit of personality.•	Poor technical performance. I saw several examples of the action camera not actually showing me the action because my view was obscured by scenery (walls, trees, etc). I saw countless occasions of both the aliens and my soldiers attacking through solid walls (both shooting and melee). And the framerate stutters horrendously when loading into and out of a mission.•	Frustratingly high number of missions where there is an extremely tight turn limit to achieve the objective. For example, hack a data relay before it shuts down in 8 turns. The data relay is so far away from your starting point that it takes 3 turns to get there moving full distance each turn. And of course there are 2 groups of aliens between you and the objective, which will probably take 2 turns each to kill if you do everything perfectly. These kind of missions feel like there's zero room for error, but at the same time, you just have to rush forward, abandoning any kind of intelligent tactics. The absolute worst missions are when you have to stop the aliens from destroying a data relay, which is on the other side of the map, and the aliens are already shooting it on turn 1.•	""Concealment"" is a wasted mechanic. Your squad starts most missions in stealth mode, and the aliens don't attack you until you are ""revealed"", which happens if you open fire, or enter their line of sight. But its pretty much impossible to stealth an entire mission because there are always aliens next to the objective, and so the few times I tried to sneak past a group of aliens, I actually ended up in a bad situation because when I was inevitably seen, I'd find myself surrounded. I quickly figured out that it was safer to ignore concealment, and just attack immediately.•	There are occasions where you have to choose between 3 missions that have different rewards (and penalties for the ones you ignore), and just like EU/EW, you can still only do 1 mission, even if you have enough healthy soldiers for 2 or more full squads. All those resources, all that fancy tech, and we still can't build a second dropship, or at least capture one of the aliens' dropships?The RecommendationWhilst its not quite as amazing as I hoped, Xcom 2 is still a good game that is worth playing. You'll get good value for money from a full price purchase. If you've never played Xcom before, you don't need to play the previous games first because the story has essentially been reset, so you could start with Xcom 2 without a problem.			"

												For starters, it is really sad that people are giving Firaxis a free pass with this. I'm a big fan of the XCOM franchise, and I've been hyped for a long time to finally get my hands on XCOM 2.Unfortunately, it seems like Firaxis just tricked us into buying the game with the whole ""built with PCs in mind"" thing. I'm running the game with a GTX 970, 8gb RAM and an i5 3570. This trio is capable of maxing almost all games released these days, and XCOM 2 is the first game to launch the ""completely unplayable games"" list.Vsync is locking the game at 30fps, but even disabled it is hard to get past the now removed cap. People can argue that you can turn your settings down to make it ""playable"", however I cannot find a reason to do that when you spend so much money with a good graphics card. Another big bummer is that the cutscenes are rendered in 30fps. I thought we were way past that when the devs said the game was going to launch exclusively for PC, a platform well known for superior performance in games. For what reason would you lock the cutscenes in 30fps when most gamers want to experience the whole game in 60fps?I will refrain from talking about the gameplay for a while, but from what I could play, it just looks like good old XCOM. I'm going to keep this review updated, I just couldn't give it a thumbs up or let people give their thumbs up and say the game is almost unplayable. The newest Naruto game was released today and people aren't giving Bandai the same free pass for delivering a subpar experience.It feels good to be the commander again, but it definitely doesn't feel good to see the game running in slow motion.

												Amazingly enough ended up being my favorite Xcom/X-com game. Maintained the boardgamey nature of Xcom EU while dramatically improving the choices available (Very few automatic picks when leveling soldiers now, more important choices for equipment loadouts, better interaction with the geoscape, etc) at any given moment. Replayability is also quite nice due to the partially randomized research (Namely, the experimental items) and the great random map generator.			"

												""I feel that this game is as complete as it can be. Sure some things could be better, but I don't think this needs anything added. This is the reason I think that there's no point for waiting a next installement.""This is a quote from my short review of Xcom: Enemy Unknown+Enemy Within about 2 years ago. And after playing XCOM 2 it still seems very relevant. XCOM 2 in it's own right is an excellent game, but if you've played EU/EW there's the slight problem of the games being too similar to each other. I for one wanted to revisit EU/EW but instead bought this to satisfy my craving. It ended up being a perfect answer yet it made me wonder constantly that was the upgrade worth the money.I have not played other XCOM games than EU/EW and XCOM2, and therefore my review only concentrates on those two. Played both on veteran difficulty(saving allowed). Played XCOM2 only once, 48 hours on the clock at the time of completion.If you haven't played XCOM at all, the basic idea of the game is that you have two game modes. You build your base and control your resources, that allow you to get better equipment for your soldiers. With those soldiers you go on missions, and those missions gives you different kinds of resrouces. If you fail on either part of the game, it gets more difficult on the other part too. So it's basically very similar to Total War series, in a sense that you have to do Campaign properly to survive battles and do battles properly to survive in the campaign. Although in this game the campaign is real time and the battles are turn-based and you cannot autoplay or skip either. More about the actual gameplay can be found from youtube.I so much want to review this as a recommended game. Yet I cannot recite the major differences of the two since I cannot really remember anymore some of the features in the first one. Most of the features I praised in EU/EW I could praise them here too. The graphics are stylized and fit very well, the atmosphere is still there, the music there to support it, the gameplay is stellar with only few hicups here and there. But essentially you're paying premium for a slightly better game. I could still go and play EU/EW and enjoy it without feeling that I'm playing a much more inferior game. I couldn't think of any downgrades from the previous game so XCOM 2 is a better game than it's predecessor but it also costs more and demands more from hardware.For me the biggest upgrade was the level design and how the new features helped playing the game. The biggest new features are the stealth ability, evacing and the increased amount of timed missions. The first leaves more windows open for better tactics while the latter two forces player to make suboptimal moves. The player is now more in control how he faces his enemies yet having a timer means that there is a constant pressure to do suboptimal moves to avoid problems in the later part of the mission. Evacing forces player to think other than just clearing the map. The endless amount of enemy soldiers mean that one might get overwhelmed if one stays too long in the mission area.Thought I think the game is outstanding I must say one word of criticism that is completely a problem in my personal taste. The game is quite difficult. There is a possibility for losing the campaign, unlike in any other tactical game I have played. You might lose a mission so bad that you cannot recover in campaign screen let a lone in the following missions. This is a feature XCOM is famous of, very similar to quite many roguelikes. The difference here is that the campaign can last really long, took me 48 hours when trying to do(or see) everything. So essentially if you lose, it might be after 20-30 hours of gameplay. I loved playing FTL:Faster Than Light and trying again and again to complete it, ending up 23 hours and maybe 50 runs. But I cannot think of myself actually playing this on harder difficulties so that I would end up playing multiple campaigns and losing most of them. I know the reward is just the greater when there's victory after multiple defeats, but the time consumed is just too much. I must emphasize, this is not something I think as a design flaw but as a feature that doesn't please my personal taste. The campaigns don't vary enough for me to make me want to replay again and again.The game offers 4 difficulties, but since those difficulties affect all aspects of the game, it's usually quite a step to up the ante. The game could really use more options in difficulties, so that players that enjoy challenge in missions could only crank up it in those rather than making everything harder. But essentially it boils to the already mentioned features. The game is an excellent game, with quite unique setting and gameplay. Yet it is very similar to it's predecessor XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within. If you have already played the first one and crave no more similar XCOM, don't buy this. If you want more XCOM, you have to think if the minor, yet great, upgrades are worth the money.			"

												I Can't reccommend this for anyone except die hard Xcom fans desperate for more xcom action. If you're interested in Xcom and havent played the originals, and the reboot, AND long war, don't buy. They bumbled this one.The bad:- Baffling gameplay design choices- A huge system hog for seemingly simple graphics- A crappy interface, especially for PC (worse than the last xcom!)The good:- Combat is still very satisfying. But way more bullet spongey     I don't understand the direction they are taking this series. It truely baffles and confuses me. The last game stripped xcom of all of its deepest (some may say complicated) elements, like soldier stats (which made them individually unique), action points, etc. This one continues to remove the things we love, like the (granted, dumbed down) UFO interception system, but on top of that ADDS a ridiculously convoluted geoscape and base system. What the hell were they THINKING?    There are 400 differnt resources. Its like an Iphone game where you get wood and ore and gold, but you gotta pay 5 dollars for the super special pink crystals! Unless of course you want to wait around with your thumb up your♥♥♥♥♥for 48 hours.   You run around the map playing a persistant game of wack a mole. But there is always an obvious choice. There is no STRATEGY in this strategy game.    You get to maticulesly place every scientist and engineer, assigning them to various tasks. Cuz why not add some needless, unfullfilling micromanagement to the game?!  You're never really sure what youre acomplishing and why! I need some intel for this, then gotta reseach that, then make contect with this guy then fly over here and pat my head and rub my belly and WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥! How could you make this such a convoluted MESS, yet still say, ""Players are too stupid for action points! Thats too complicated! No more interceptors, its too involved! It needs to be accessable!"" Are you KIDDING me?!   Besides the gameplay choices being incomprehensible, I'd like to adress the graphics and interface. Can we please stop with this trend of making everything smaller and smaller, and calling that ""graphical improvement?!"" Please! The buttons in this game are 2x2 pixels. You need a microscope AND a gyroscope to read the text. Because not only is it impossibly small, they thought it would be a silly goof to add a scrambling effect every 3 seconds while you're trying to read 4 paragraphs of text for every research project!  You can only rotate the map in 90 degree incriments instead of 45 now. Which makes it enranging when you're tring to click the single pixel that lets you move to the spot behind cover instead of the one where your genitals are perfectly lined up with the aliens gun barrel.   WHY can I play fallout 4 without issue and this game drops to 3 FPS on the lowest settings? The graphics look like 2006's Sam and Max, so why does this game require a monster PC?  Speaking of which, the graphical design of this game (and to a lesser extent, the previous one) is lame. Its designed for children. I feel like a dork when I play, because I'm looking at guys with cartoonishly large guns and guile haircuts run around in Anime armor. If thats your thing, thats cool. One day you'll be a grown up too and feel some shame!  All that being said, it feels a lot like the last game, and the combat is satisfying. However, they really upped the bullet spongeyness of enimies and added more needless, pointless, convoluted elements to combat as well, in the form of hacking. Which is COMPLETELY RNG. Thats fun too right? Thats what people love about strategy games. The RNG....  So get it if you've exhasted the previous games. Do not support this kind of decision making otherwise.			"

												I don't know, something about the game feels wrong. Maybe it's the performance issues, maybe it's the 'slower paced' gameplay, or maybe it's the lack of Micheal McCann. I just don't get the same feeling like I do with EU/EW.Even Long War feels more satisfying, and that♥♥♥♥♥♥is brutal.I wanted to be excited for this sequel, and I was for sometime... It feels like it was partially for nothing.--- Pros so far ---- Customization is great. Customize guns/people to a higher extent versus EU/EW.- Graphics are nice. I care more for gameplay though.- Mod support right outta the box.- New terrain/landscapes are nice.- New enemies.--- Cons so far ---- No Micheal McCann. His music was the one thing that made me excited going on missions, made me care for Earth's survival, and made me care even more about the soldiers under my command.

- Gameplay feels slower versus EU/EW. It feels like I'm forced to watch a soldier finish his/her 3 second animation before I can call my next move. Makes the game feel slower to me. Or maybe that's the performance issues? We'll see by next patch.- Story is pretty lame. I won't go into it, do to spoilers.... Hopefully it gets better.- Performance issues. Random stuttering, even on high-end rigs.- Base building is overally simplified.- Get to this ♥♥♥♥ing spot in x amount of turns. It's like you don't want me to plan things.- Some enemies need balancing.I will never thumbs this up, even if they fixed the performance issues. This is not the xcom I wanted, nor is it the xcom I was told it was.--- Edit ---I'm happy there were people who shared my concerns and have decided to 'fix' some of the problem areas of the game. Reminds me of the Skyrim/Fallout modders. At least with mods, I think this game is a bit more playable.			"

												Here comes my opinion of XCom2.In Short. Can I recommend it?No. Not at its current state.Iam kind of sad to say this, but this game should have never been release in its state.So, whats wrong with it?I will start with what is right instead.The Good:Since the XCom:EU remake, some changes in compare to the originals from the 90's are realy good.First of, it plays fast, action packed, and is nice to look at.The ""just one more turn"" feeling is still there, and you never get bored during the missions.The story is ok'ish, not that great but you want to know more and why things happen.Reduction of action points to simple 2 actions per turn leads to a fast paced tactical play, skill and soldier class system feels at the right deep for this fast gameplay.Sadly thats almost all about it.The Bad:-worldmapThe stratetic map has been stripped down even more since XCom:EU. You have almost no choices or alternatives, no options. Without spoilers of some sort, every thing you can do is kind of mandatory. If you dont do the right things, you dont advance...but...you will do it because there isnt anything else to do.In fact, you wouldnt even notice if the worldmap where not existent and this things would be done by the AI for you.-basebuildingIts almost the same here. You have some options of buildings, but they are not optional. You can and must build exactly 1 of the key buildings (you cant build more)Then there are 4 facilities left you can choose to build. 2 are almost irrelevant (did complete it without even building them) and the others are also mandatory to support your base.No real choices, no alternative approaches.-UIHorrible. For a PC exclusive game I was hoping for a very good and fluent UI. Insteat we got a cumbersome bunch of menus, where everytime you want to go to another menu you have to watch animations of zooming in and out for seconds. Soldier customizing is unintuitiv at best, and burred in lots of different layers till you get your dude equiped and colored.Also there is a constant feel of lack of information. To check your current weapon, upgrades and personal stims etc. on one soldier you need to zoom in and out through a bunch of menus. In your squad overview you see fancy 3D models but almost nothing else.Gameplay flow comes to a crawl here.Overall presentation of information is realy bad in almost every part of the game.-missionsThe maps are now random generated, which is cool. The battles have not changed to much from :EU. But the maps are ridiculous bugged regarding line of sight, cover etc. (shooting through walls, meele through roofs etc.)The new stealth mode in some missions is just a nice ice on the cake, but its not well thought out. After the initial stealth the enemies still getting their free movement, autospot you if you spot them etc.Cover is now destructible, which is a good thing, except its to easy and to unpredictable to destroy. I had whole housefronts collapse to dust from swordblows, or fires expand through thin air.-AIThe AI feels implausible. Suicide troops left and right, which you cant take out fast enough in early game, and are too easy later on. Most of the difficult comes from the unpredictable random generator and absurd skills some enmies have. In contrast the lategame feels just like a walk in the park, because your soldiers become also absurd overpowered.So it is a very deadly beatup where you hardly can predict the exact outcome. Luck is a factor here. (even very good players are at times just had more luck then others)Then the enemy behavior is sometimes very predictable, even in unlogic situations. If you study this you can abuse it to cancel some threats completely.-performanceOh my God. I dont even know what causes a turn based game to suck this much at performance at almost every aspect. Loading times, movie frame rate, animations, delay and hickups here and there. Very often complete animation sequences are skipped for no obvious reason so you have to guess what just happened. (talking about you snakeman)The aftermission reportscreen sometimes needs longer to load then the mission itself, at least it feels like this.You can watch how textures get loaded etc. etc. And no, I didnt play it on Max Settings, even with my very good rig.-supportLame. We got 1 patch till today which caused more problems then it solved. Critical flaws are still unadressed.So in conclusion, I had my fun with one playthrough, and i had my frustration. But I cant stand to play another campaign because of the numerous flaws, bugs and the horrendous slow UI animations, constant anoying voice chat from your central and lots of other minor things.XCom 2 could have been a precious gem, but someone forgot to polish it.

												LIke its predecessor, XCOM 2 maintains a feeling of constant pressure -- every decision at every level seems weighty. Each time you move a soldier, every shot taken, each upgrade chosen, every choice at both the tactical and strategic level feels important. Every moment in the game is tense and exciting.Sometimes the random elements of the game can feel unforgiving -- missing a shot that has a 95% chance to hit always feels like you've been robbed, even though you're told explictly that the shot has a 1 in 20 chance of failing -- but sometimes the RNG also blesses you with a squad-saving bit of luck just when you need it.The story doesn't contain any surprises, but is well done. I especially enjoyed the little bits of banter in the Avenger view, especially Shen's quip about the Advent burgers. Art and sound design are both high quality; there's an occasional glitch in animation, but that's something forgivable considering that levels are procedurally generated and contain destructive elements -- every so often, you'll have a camera angle on a character that just looks odd. I mention it only out of completeness; it is rare, and never took away from the enjoyment of the game.Finally, the mod support is excellent -- many people have expanded the interface (everyone should get Overwatch All and Evac All), weapon options, new map options, and of course the Long War 2 project might as well be a completely new game by itself.Between the supurb base game and the excellent mod community, XCOM 2 will give fans of tactical games many hours of enormous fun.

												The core game here is very promising, but the bugs and performance are absolutely unaccepable for a modern big budget game. I easily exceed the recommended requirements yet i cant even maintain 30 fps, and cutscenes lock you to maximum of 30--not that it matters because youll never actually hit 30.The bugs are also very aggravating. You really shouldnt play this on ironman, as the amount of shooting through walls, aliens warping on top of you between turn etc etc is REDICULOUS.This will probaly end up being a good game, just DONT BUY IT YET!

												Developers missed the balance between fun and frustrating by adding timers to missions. That one simple decision is what turned this game from fun to frustratingly unfun. Outside of the missions with timers, the difficulty is ramped up to a very fun pace due to mind control, swords, and unkown enemies everywhere making the game great. To put the cherry on this horrible decision sunday, every soldier that is not at the designated point by the time the turn limit is up is permanently lost.  Unfortunately, the timer turns the mission away from strategy and into a just sprint mode.Some people may like the added pressure of a turn limit, but I do not. I cannot stand it at all, and there is no way to turn it off by default.			"

												TLDR;Addicting, fun, but horribly optimized.After upgrading to the recent 6700k and 980 TI I thought I would pick up Xcom 2 since I loved Xcom EU and EW. It's a lot of fun, and for new players the learning curve will be really steep. You build a personal camaraderie with your best soldiers and really feel their loss on the field and meta-game. I would recommend this, but at this state of the game. I just can't. The framerate loss during combat cinematics, transitions between transport hubs, and shifting from menu to menu is just inexcusable. There are often long freezes and stutters towards the end game. Until Firaxis and Nvidia/AMD get their business together and make this more optimized, I will have to set my recommendation to NO.			"

												I loved the first one - played through on hard and enjoyed it. This, however, on easy on the first level, I am struggling. 5 attempts so far and no where close to winning.The aliens seem to have a preternatural ability to hit my soldiers in cover despite when it's my turn they show as having a very low hit point percentage.One of my soldiers has a mele attack, which, when you use unless you kill your foe in one hit, it leaves them standing next to the alien, which then obviously kills you.The very first level has a 'grey' which can raise the dead. This would be fine but it takes at least two full barrages from your soldiers, which means you have to put them into harms to way to kill it before the zombie - which also require two kits to kill - can kill your soldiers. And by the way once you fire, that is that's soldiers turn over.And all this is set against the clock, which means you have to take a lot of risks to get to your objective.I would not recommend this.  I bloody loved the original, but this is terrible IMO. God knows how it got such good reviews.  Games are supposed to be fun and this just isn't.  Oh and the graphics are distinctly average when compared to the previous game.My only hope is that I'm rusty at playing xcom, but on easy, 5 attempts in without getting close, come on!			"

Posted: February 10, 2016
Firaxis strikes again, with a mostly excellent sequel that hits every note bar one.XCOM 2 is one of those games that gets under your skin. You'll be playing it mentally long after you've finished your session for the evening, you'll be thinking about various strategies long after your first campaign completion too. The fact that this time Firaxis has built modding right into the game client is a real testament to the fact that this XCOM will almost certainly be the one to beat for some time to come, and with it they've made some major steps forward, and a few steps sideways, along with one step backwards. I'll come to that one at the end of the review.Firstly, let's go over the synopsis. The game assumes that most people failed their first campaign in XCOM:EU (or EW), which is probably correct, and thusly, the governments of the world, having lost faith in XCOM decided to go the route of negotiating for peace with the aliens. On the face of it, this approach worked. The ""elders"" as they're now called, have on the surface - uplifted humanity - by providing improved technology, health and civic benefits that have improved the race as a whole, but it's very much a vision of humanity that's ruled with a velvet glove belying an iron fist. Any dissent results in the said voice taking a quick trip to ""re-education"" and never being seen again. A good way to imagine it is China circa 2015 but with an even more hawkish stance concerning human rights and you'd not be far off.Humanity that wishes to remain free, lives in isolated clusters at the fringes of society, deprived of any real contact with the world. and resists, albeit ineffectually. XCOM, having gone into hibernation, is suddenly awoken as intelligence brings the commander (you) back into play.Firaxis gets a lot rightSo XCOM is now a resistance movement. This rather neatly solves a lot of the story contrivances of the first game, you have limited resources, your base is a very small, but mobile command HQ that can only deal with a subset of what is going on in the larger world. Your options are now reactive, rather than proactive. The enemy is no longer a passive one either, having an active project that it persues. There's no longer a simple ""You lose"" condition, now the enemy has a ""They win"" condition that they're going after. This puts active pressure on the player to keep advancing and expanding all the while.Meanwhile, the tactical layer has had an awful lot of quality of life improvements, with classes now feeling a lot more distinct, and offering a lot more ""play"" in the 2-AP system that has become a hallmark of the XCOM series reboot. There's now ways to bend, and in some cases, thoroughly break the rules in your favour. The same goes for the aliens, who pretty much right away get the ability to mind control your soldiers, which makes for fun times.It's not always sweetness and light though...The game isn't -entirely- without faults, there's still numerous bugs and camera glitches (though they're a lot less than the previous game), and unless you have a real monster of a rig, be prepared to scale the graphics back a bit, because whilst the game looks a fair bit prettier, it seems that Firaxis didn't do that great a job of optimising the code, so the game munches resources at a fairly terrifying clip. If you CAN max out the settings mind, it does look awfully pretty, and you can end up with a great looking game when you're fighting the aliens, so it does reward with the eye candy.Other glitches I've seen include melee attacks through solid walls and closed doors (really -.-) and some pretty amazing instances where the camera decides the one place to be is inside an object, thus clipping everything and rendering the screen opaque for a fair while.The random elephant in the room...However, the big issue is as ever, the RNG. XCOM 2 uses a ""pre-generated"" set of rolls over the course of a fight, so imagine a long list of dice rolls prepared at the beginning, as each shot is taken, it checks against the list, ticks off a number, and moves to the next. I've tested extensively against multiple scenarios to isolate this, and have managed to confirm that the current system does not roll independently nor does the seed regenerate with a save reload. This is likely done to prevent save scumming, but unfortunately it also means that the game is robbed of a lot of the actual strategic improvisation that is actually supposed to exist, because it reduces the game to something of a puzzle game, once you understand HOW the pre-RNG system works, you can essentially reload saves to maneuver around it.It's a design choice, and it's a bad one. Again, likely to prevent save-scumming, which is a legitimate tactic in and of itself, but it essentially makes a game based on making estimates and percentage shots less about good judgment and more about working out what number is on the list. An option to have the game actively re-randomise rolls on -each- shot would be extremely welcome, and currently the only mod available simply forces the game to move to the next tickbox on the list.Closing thoughtsXCOM 2 is a great game. It could be legitimately excellent, were it not for the terrible issues with the pseudo RNG that is as far from actual randomness as one could get. When someone actually figures out a mod that corrects this, it'll be the first thing I recommend everyone downloads so we get the XCOM experience we deserve, that said, the rest of the package is so complete and tightly tuned that this game still warrants my highest rating even in spite of this issue.Firaxis, if you're listening - Regenerate the seed on each roll check, make this an option as a priority yo. Strategy gamers deserve this.Verdict : Essential "

												XCOM 2 proves why the series is the best of its genre, although the fans have mixed feelings about it the truth is this game has been far improved compared to XCOM EU. As there is no perfect game, this one also has its flaws but in my humble opinion they are more at technical area, more explanations below.Pros:-Greatly improved inventory with many new gears = much more possibilities in the battlefield-More detailed environment and more destructible-Epic songs-Many new enemies forcing different means to kill them-""Timed"" missions making real the feel of urgency of the setting of the game (controversial for many but for me it was a good decision)-New mechanics such as ""concealment"" where in some missions you have the possibility to set up ambushes to unaware enemies-Improved Headquarters gameplay, contact finding etc-Good variety of skills and its actually useful to lean to one side or another when training soldiers to a class-Story so far is keeping me very interested, totally fits in the setting and makes me want to kick aliens♥♥♥♥♥br>Cons:-The game runs fine, until certain point (some specific missions) where FPS goes down to 20 or so and you need to restart it, as if it is not managing memory well, loading everything and not unloading as you've done (for reference: max settings @ GTX970, I7 4790k, 32gb ram)-On Alien actions, sometimes it takes too long to catch up that you need to wait 5 seconds + for actions to take place, doesn't affect gameplay at all, just annoys-some minor bugs on enemy actions display, doesn't break the game againwell, that's it if you have any questions send me, I strongly recommend this game for fans and for those who like the genre			"

												I'm done.While I was looking forward to the sequal this game apparantly is designed to break you before you even get out of the tutorial stage. It was clearly designed for those who have played Enemy Unknown on Classic and have their game down to a science. It is VERY newcomer unfriendly.I was happily enjoying the game until it started hitting me with missions while was in the VERY LONG process of trying to accomplish any of the supply pickups. I hadn't even made contact with my first new outpost when the game started hitting me with different alien types that started shredding me apart with myself unable to counter attack with nothing but a squad of nothing but rookies, and very low ranking specialists.Almost ALL the missions are on timers requiring you to play VERY AGGRESSILY in order to feel as though you're accomplishing anything. Anyone who's played XCOM will tell you that playing with that level of aggression with low level specialists and rookies is pure suicide. Failing the objectives will cause a swift decline in your ability to fight back effectively ending your game before you even make it out of the tutorial stage.Speaking of the Tutorial Stage. I feel as though Firaxes was trying to push too much too quickly. I was quickly beaten and destroyed on my very first mission when they brought in a Sectoid. My rookies were unprepared to combat such a high level enemy (on the very first mission no less) with their woefully underdeveloped weapons and armor. If anything the aliens represent a mid-game threat and their number rapidly increase to the point where you're facing down packs of mid-game enemies and you haven't even completed your first major objective when the game gets done hand holding you.A lot of the missions I tried to ignore in favor of picking up more supplies but the game kept telling me ""No. This is a high priority mission. You shouldn't skip this."" With each one throwing a new objective at me. I hadn't even had time to catch my breath and consider how to accomplish the last objective better before I had a new feature to contend with. Again I feel that Firaxes is rushing the progressing trying to show me all the cool new stuff they've done. ""Oh look at this new alien! See what it can do! Look at this new objective! You've never done this before have you? Look a new way to play!"" Dear god can I just catch my breath and consider how my last mission went first?Enemy Unknown (and Enemy Within) were much better at letting you get comfortable before throwing something new at you. You were just uncomfortable enough until you got toward the endgame and you were a much more equal footting. XCOM 2 is dedicated to smashing you flat until a mountain of new feature after new feature until you finally lose or just give up out of sheer frustration.I get they wanted to make it like a resistance game where you were hounded at every turn but this game dooms you from the start. And I was playing on Normal Mode. It felt like playing on Classic from Enemy Unknown.It's fun for all of about 3 hours. Then the inability to pick up resources because of constantly running missions demanding your attention because they have some new feature to show you cause you to hit a brick wall very quickly.""Oh but Adhock that the point of the game! You have to make the hard choices!""What hard choices? The choice of ether losing the game because of the inability to stop alien progression while I'm trying to ensure I'm relatively stocked up enough to advance my gear or let myself get smashed flat trying to keep the aliens from advancing their endgame causing me to loose all my soldier with the inability to gear them or get more because I'm too poor?It's a lose-lose situation ether way. It takes too long to get supplies and they hit with higher tier enemies that should be saved for further in the game. I was expecting to clash with Advent Basic soldiers much like EU Sectoid until I made myself enough of a pain the aliens would respond in force with their bigger and badder units.Apparantly ADVENT doesn't have enough troops that the aliens feel the need to come out swinging harder then they should instead of letting ADVENT troops do their jobs before taking matters into their own hands when you prove too tough for them. Look at a lot of the gameplay videos. Most of the spawns are basic ADVENT soldiers and their counterparts with perhaps one to two aliens per map. I'm getting hammered with four or five aliens right out the starting gate. And don't even get me started on concealment. The mission that finally broke me my soldiers were boxed in by civilans and the act of trying to get past them cause me to drop concealment on my first move and there were too many aliens to punch through. I lost the mission entirely as the overaggressive push required to reach the objective in time caused me to lose half my squad. When the time ran out the aliens finished off the other bedragged half.Which effectively dropped me to only two or three soldiers left unable to field another unit. Because the timers to gain supplies were too long and I kept taking missions I was unable to get more soldiers. Game over.Save your money. Wait until the modders even the playing field for the early game. Right now it's clear that you have to mod to even survive the tutorial. Because it sure as hell isn't balanced in the early game to where it feels unbalanced but you have a chance.This is unbalanced with intent to break you before you even hit the play button.Do not buy the game.

												Edited - 14 July 2016Xcom 2 is awsome but i like Xcom more.This is pretty much how I felt the last time I started playing XCOM, way back in 2012, but I’d liken the game more to XCOM’s “Enemy Within” expansion in 2013. A comprehensive update to the gameplay, customization, and flow of the original, “Enemy Within” made XCOM the game it should have been at launch.XCOM 2 is better. Not only are customization options far more varied even than the expanded XCOM, the game is simply deeper, more challenging, and more fun in almost every way. Still, it’s not without its problems. Lets take a look at the Good, The Bad, and The Insulting of Firaxis’ ambitious sequel.The Good-Customization- I have way too much fun customizing my soldiers. This was severely lacking in XCOM, massively expanded in “Enemy Within” and has reached critical mass in XCOM 2. If you like customization options, they are here in abundance, from language and voice options, to props like sunglasses and baseball caps, to facial hair and scars. When a soldier reaches a certain rank, even more options are opened upEnemy Variety- Enemy variety is almost overwhelming at times. You learn to tread carefully and start making a kill-priority list very early onMore Tactical- Alongside the increased enemy variety is an increased sense of panic at the rest of the challenges. Whether that’s rescuing civilians, blowing up an enemy base, or getting to an enemy data bank before it self-destructs, there’s often some sort of primary or secondary objective that makes your life even harderFeatures- Adding to the tactical flavor are some new game features. Often you start the map out in Concealment mode, and can move through the map unseen by the aliens. This allows you to set up masterful ambushes and take out multiple bogies in one fell swoop.Swords - Using swords is awesome. Every game should have swords.The Scenario Makes Way More Sense- Here we had a global effort to fight back against an alien horde, and we were barely able to fund it. And why were so few soldiers taking on these missions? This time around you lead an underground resistance to the aliens and their global domination organization ADVENT. Having limited resources and a small, elite squad makes way more sense.More Strategic Depth- Alongside more tactical missions, your base of operations and world-map are now way more complex. There’s a consequence for every action, too, which means you’ll probably screw up a lot. Or at least, I screw up a lot, or I think I do.The Bad- It’s All A Bit Too Much - You can barely get one thing done without being interrupted a bazillion times by all the various projects you have going, by new missions popping up, or new resource collecting timers going off. Even when you get through a month and the powers-that-be send you your supplies, you have to go spend a few days picking them up. During that time any number of horrible things can happen, and all the while the ADVENT clock is ticking, leading toward some new calamity.Frankly, it’s just too much going on at once to be enjoyable at times. There’s almost no breathing room, even in the very beginning, and it’s very easy to slid into chaos.Mental Distress- Let me give example for you: I’ve got my four squad mates lined up just right to take out some bad guys. A dudes is in Overwatch, and the girl I have shooting has an 87% chance of success. Then she misses. My Overwatch dudes miss. Everyone misses and the enemies flank me. One of my squad mates gets hit by an alien with a sword, knocks them unconscious, so they’re out of the game. Then two of my squaddies panic and shoot wildly at nothing. Then a Sectoid takes over the mind of my fourth soldier and I’m out. I can’t do anything. There was nothing I could have done any better, either. I set it all up perfectly. I had a good chance of landing a shot and then taking out at least a couple of the aliens with Overwatch. But because half my squad panicked, one was knocked out, and the other got mind-controlled, I had no options left.(After this incidence i took a 3 hours nap)The Insulting-Repetition- In missions where you have to save civilians, you’re going to lose a bunch of them no matter how good you are. Aliens start picking them off instantly, and it’s a race just to grab the bare minimum. But each time the aliens kill someone, your right-hand man “Central” pops up on the screen to chastise you. “We cant afford to loose too many civilians, Commander!” he intones, or something like that. Many times over. The game pauses while he says his bit, which is really irritating. Stuff like this happens throughout the game. It’s repetitive, slow, and annoying. You should at least be able to play while the NPC’s are dressing you down for being a pathetic loser.(Whenever Central pops in, I AM LIKE, DUDE STOP IT, I AM YOUR ****ING COMMANDER)Bugs And GlitchesMy character fall of a building and KIA. One time the game just went black. Sometimes animation freezes for an agonizingly long time when Overwatch is triggered, ETCs.It’s top of the class when it comes to turn-based tactical gameplay, and I honestly can’t get enough.			"

												XCOM 2 improves on EU in almost every way. The core gameplay is of course very simmilar but all of the changes lead to a much fresher feeling game. The classes each feel uniquely powerful and, for better or for worse, almost all of the enemies from EU have been buffed. Things like the buffs from hacking (speed boosts, invulnerability, etc.) add an enjoyable amount of manuverability in basic combat.However,This game runs like utter trash. It's an absolute slideshow while navigating between the ship and the map. Load times are sluggish and painful. Bugs are very frequent and as a result anyone who wants to play iron man with the chance that their campaign could break at any moment is a crazy person. When they finally whip out the carnuba wax and finish polishing their game I can reccomend it. Until then hands off.EDIT-Specs-OS:       Win 10CPU:     i5 4570 3.2 GHzRam:     8 GB DDR3GPU:     GTX 770The in game settings were a custom set somewhere below medium. Ambient Occlusion, AA and the extras were all disabled. From that alone transitions would occasionally slow to <1FPS while generally being <7FPS.For anyone still interested I would highly reccomend following this guide. 


Essential improvements (Skip intros, fix stuttering, multi monitor support, resolutions past 1080p)

												Yes, I know, I know I haven't played the game for two centuries, so I'm not allowed to talk about it in public yet. Much less write a review.I'm giving it a negative review, because all the issues that were raised in reviews haven't been addressed for the launch copy:* The frame rates drops constantly (my pc is more than good enough to run it) almost constantly from the start of a mission to the end. So much so that it is sometimes impossible to keep up with.* The camera angles are awful at times, grenades explode off screen before they are due to, walls block the sight entirely, sometimes the alien's move is just a black screen so you have no idea what is going on. You can literally lose a soldier and have no way of knowing how.* There are excessive short pauses for no reason after actions and during some actions (seemingly at random). * Sometimes a person's body will be facing the exact opposite direction to where they are shooting.As well as that, a large number of missions have arbitrary turn limits, which are punishingly short. They only give you enough time to complete a mission comfortably if you rush most of the time. And rely on purely run and gun tactics. It removes any chance or opportunity to actually use strategy and tactics. Most of these issues will hopefully be addressed with hotfix patches, and working with the graphics card companies to get out some optimised drivers ASAP. But that doesn't excuse the game being released in this state. If this is the standard quality of a game at launch then this is the last game I'll ever pre-order.We need to make sure companies know this isn't acceptable or tolerated, or it will just keep happening *Looks at Bethesda*.I HIGHLY recommend waiting until the performance issues and bugs have been patched before purchasing. Once all the performance problems and bugs have been resolved, and there are plenty of mods to allow people to tweat the turn limit system, this will be an absolutely superb and very worthy sequel to X-Com.P.S. Fan(atic) boys please get your tongues out of the♥♥♥♥♥♥of Firaxis Games (more like Fixathis Game). Having it in there makes it harder for the aliens to probe them!P.P.S. the bug testing and QA for this game must have been hilarious: ""Are the snakes supposed to be able to grab people through walls?""""Why do my soldiers keep dropping through the floor as they move?""  ""Is it normal for everyone to be shooting through walls with bullets, when the wall is right in front of them?""  ""Why did my character appear on a different part of the map when the snake grabbed me?""  ""Are there supposed to be constant pauses before and after every action?""""Why does this game run like Crysis 2 on a Gameboy?""  ""Is it normal for the screen to go black during the enemy moves time?""""Why are the voices telling me important things constantly cut off?""""Is it normal for a soldier to have their body face the opposite direction when they shoot?""""Why are there such long pauses when the enemy does something?""""Is it normal for a soldier who has been knocked unconscious to die instantly for no reason?""""Are units supposed to have melee combat against each other from two different floors of a building?""""Why are you releasing the game when it clearly needs at least another month of work?""""What are you doing!? Where are you taking me!? no, No, NOOOOO""P.P.P.S The one thing I do have to give them credit for is creating a game that has both an 'anti-addiction' and 'anti-piracy' mechanism built into the game.The 'anti-addiction' works by having levels that are so hilariously impossible - due to objectives being destroyed before you can secure the area, or having to take on a whole army whilst getting from A to B in 12 moves' that you'll find yourself literally saying ""oh f*** this s***"" or ""oh f*** off"" or my current favourite ""stupid f***ing game!"" that you'll rage quit from a single player game, and not want to go anywhere near it for at least a day. It's impossible for even the most perverse and self hating sadist to be addicted to.As for the 'anti-piracy', all it takes is for a would-be pirate to read just a few honest reviews of this game (so none of the mainsteam ones then), or to watch someone play it for five minutes, and they'll realise they don't want anything to do with it, and wouldn't even take it for free.

												XCOM2 is just as enjoyable as 1 was a few years ago. There are multiple things which I feel are missing or not as polished as I have wished, considering the success of these releases, however, if the game remained as it is at the time of the review (Shen's gift DLC released), it will still offer a compelling experience. In the end, the pacing of the action and the improvements to the tactical battles, plus wanting to get more of the story it's what gives me confidence to recommend it. I've played so far on Veteran (completed the game surprisingly fast, 30 battles after starting, with the highest soldier rank Captain), on Legendary (plus some mods for extra content, which is badly needed and this will take me a lot of time to finish). There are multiple issues that are worth discussing, but others did a good job at explaining them (story, silly animation issues similar to those of the previous release, DLC stuff, performance, many others). But they don't make a significant dent into the experience, overall. At least not for me.			"

												Performance can be an issue but everything else in the game is an improvement [imo] on the original it is easily recommended; blood, sweat and tears- and i'm only 9hrs into the game- aplenty as you attempt to nurture a fledgling guerrilla force into a truly global resistance network. XCOM2 perfectly captures that feel of 'hit-and-run' partisan style warfare you would expect after twenty years of alien occupation and it is a refreshing change of style and pace over the slow 'overwatch' creep of the first in the series. Blood: your's or their's, the combat is a mix of satisfying ambushes (thanks to the excellent 'concealment' mechanic), frantic tactical movement and complete RNG failure [see Tears].Sweat: as the turn counter ticks down, you'll attempt to navigate the quickest and most effective route to the primary objective engaging in tense and at times frustrating [see Blood] firefights against alien pods after an initial ambush seeking every tactical advantage you can.Tears: your soldiers, veterans and rookies alike, lovingly crafted and kitted out in the excellent customisation/loudout screens, will die. Retirement isn't an option.			"

												Well, what can I say? This game is amazing. But the performance is INEXCUSABLE! Low frame rates, crashes, terrible optimization, long load times... I'm writing this after my second hard crash, both of which required a full PC shutdown and restart. Now, before the fanboys downvote this review, I LOVE XCOM! I've been playing since the original and I love everything Firaxis has done up until this point. The game is a massive improvement over XCOM: EU/EW, but it DOESN'T ♥♥♥♥ING WORK! Once this game is patched and can run decently I'll give a positive, full length review, but until then I cannot recommend this game.			"

												This is not XCOM 1. If you try to play XCOM 2 like XCOM 1, you will fail. The game JUST came out so there will be bugs of course but they will go away in time. The performance issue is annoying but again, will be ironed out. If you do not like a lot of timed missions then thre is a Mod for that. Do not like the AVATAR counter going up too fast? There is a Mod for that. Game too hard? Lower the difficulty, do not tell anyone and just say your playing on Commander level just like everyone else..:)I am having a blast. The story and cut scenes are better. Love the ability to customize your characters. People are hateing this game because the game is not perfect or its too hard. This game is harder and more of a challenge without a dought. As for me it is a fun game and I will be playing it for some time.Put on your adult pants, put away the milk and salt, grab a gun and kill some aliens. Good Luck, Commander			"

												I'll name off the obvious first:-horrible performance, I have to turn almost everything off or low to medium settings on a GTX970, still get frame drops below 30-very long load times, on a freaking 4x PCI-E SSD-frequent crashes-timers on missions makes the whole concealment aspect hard to pull off since you have to haul butt with Central Command constantly yelling at you that your time is running outNow for an awesome game, I can put up with most of this stuff, but it wasn't until reading some additional reviews that I could really pinpoint my main gripe with the game.It is way to busy.  In EU/EW, you had 10 days roughly to get stuff done at home base.  Not only did this give you a mental break from what (towards the end game) can be intense battles, but more importantly it gave you time to do stuff.There is an extreme tedium with XCOM 2 where you have a mission every 3-4 days and it takes forever to get anything accomplished, which means you're basically playing the same 3 flavors of a mission over and over again without any kind of new, exciting aspect other than upgrading your squad.Maybe I am just playing it wrong, but I kinda wanted some form of advanced technology after 27 hours of gameplay.I love XCOM EU/EW, best TBS game in the last decade at least.  XCOM 2 has a lot of promise, but bad performance, crashes, ridiculous load times, and the overarching feeling of tedium to get anything done kills it for me.			"

												The game looks like a lot of fun. Sadly, I can't play it, and I can't recommend that you purchase it in its current state. After playing through the first part of the tutorial, I am currently incapable of visiting the base due to a bug. Restarting the game and reloading the save have not fixed this. Attempting to start a new game (because redoing 15 minutes of tutorial isn't going to kill me) results in a complete game freeze. Uninstalling and reinstalling have not fixed this issue.Performance-wise, the game runs at about 30 fps on my rig, which is comprised of a GTX 980 Ti, an i7-4749k, and 32 Gb of RAM, unless I lower a bunch of settings. This is simply unacceptable from an optimization standpoint.Also, a small PSA for you fellow Nvidia users: When Steam installs this game, there's a small chance that it decides to activate the 3D settings on your card. If you're suddenly getting your games in 3D, check your 3D settings in the Nvidia control panel to disable it.As it stands, I'd stay clear of this game until it gets patched.UPDATE: After spending 3 hours ""in-game"", I've managed to fix my game (don't ask me how though, I'm still not sure what fixed it...) I've put a little more than 2 hours into it now. So here are my thoughts on it so far:Performance: It's HORRIBLE! With the specs I have, there is no reason I should be getting ~35 fps in-game on High graphics. I'm sorry, but XCom 2 isn't THAT good looking! The performance cost isn't worth the visuals I'm getting at all, and the visuals really shouldn't be this taxing! I've ran Witcher 3 with everything cranked up to the max (including Nvidia's Gameworks settings), and my fps remained both stable and above 60. This game doesn't even come close to the Witcher 3 graphically, and I can't see why these settings result in such a bad framerate!Not only am I getting low fps, but I also occasionally get insane stutter when trying to move units. This has resulted in a few deaths due to missclicks that happened mid-stutter (which makes me glad I'm not playing on Ironman).Gameplay:The RNG can be very infuriating, especially when it doesn't make any sense. Point-blank range is something you'd think would be in th game. Sadly, it isn't the case. I've had a few moments where one of my soldiers is next to an advent, his gun is inches from his head, and he misses his shot! This is something many people have been asking for, yet it isn't in the game. Hopefully mods fix this.The game will have small pop-ups appear next to ennemies' health bar to show you when you can perform specific actions from the position you'r trying to move. Sadly, the game also has a very small ""maximum zoom-out limit"" which means you sometimes won't be able to see the enemies' health bars to begin with. Getting a bigger limit to our zoom-outs would be great.There are some bugs that can be very annoying. I've had 2 characters die while taking cover next to cars because they'd blow up without any indication that they were going to blow up (By this I mean that the car is in perfect condition and explodes the next turn without anyone attacking it). I've also had a Sectoid who couldn't die. His HP bar was at zero, but he was still attacking (that was fun...)Also, why is it that there's a turn timer on every mission? Why are they so low? Like, the second tutorial mission has this device that will explode, you have 8 amounts of turns to disable it. It's in the middle of 3 squads. Walking over there takes 3 turns in itself. See, I can understand timers for things like that bomb, or for rescuing VIPs, but turn timers in elimination missions are so weird! You have to eliminate these 12 enemies in under 6 turns. ""What happens after the 6th turn? Like, what's the reason we have to retreat?"" ""No reason. We just felt like giving you an arbitrary limit, or else you wouldn't be challenged.""Customization:Ok, I have to ask: Why do characters from the character pool get promoted to random classes instead of the ones they've been given in the pool? Is it for balance reasons? If so, that's pretty dumb. People like me, who want to create their own characters and get them into a squad end up having to re-customize them once they get promoted to a completely other class. Because we can change it it isn't really game-breaking, but stil, if they could get promoted to the class you've assigned them, it would be a nice quality of life change.Cutscenes:Honestly, my cutscenes have been less ""rendered videos"", and more ""family slideshows"". Seriously, I thought getting 20 fps while playing was bad, my cutscenes continuously drop to 5 frames and below!The audio and video syncronization is also constantly off. It gets really distracting when you hear an explosion and only see it 5 seconds later.Verdict:I can't understand how this game has been released in its current state! Its performance is horrible, and it has game-breaking bugs! Honestly, it feels like I'm playing a beta. I just can't wrap my mind around how someone could sit down, and say ""Yeah, this is ready for the masses!""As of right now, there are no client updates, and I've yet to hear about plans for one (though I can't wait for one to come out). It does have potential, but I'd recommend you wait until it's on sale, or until they release a few patches before getting this.			"

												Read Full in depth review and my tips on DVS Gaming[dvsgaming.org] that includes a lot more details.Looking at the gameplay a lot of it will seem familiar to XCOM players, especially if you’ve played XCOM Enemy Within. The interface is nearly the same and so are the mission styles and there is so much new stuff added on top of the old. As always you have a squad of soldiers ranging from 4-6 people to clear every mission.Every soldier will have one of 4 classes that then goes into another 2 types of subclasses, so even though that sounds very limited compared to The Long War mod it still provides for a lot of unique and great combos.XCOM 2 brings a lot of uniqueness to the things it had already in the previous game and therefore keeps it fresh and new enough for it to be a sequel instead of a huge upgrade/expansion of Enemy Within.XCOM 2 picks up the story 20 years after the events in Enemy Within. The guys from the former game have been busy trying to rebuild the XCOM project and rebuilding the base. So here you are in the middle of a world where aliens are the masters and humans are the slaves marked as renegades, fighting in the shadows to save the world from the aliens’ newest project codenamed Avatar.You’ve recovered an alien ship that you are using as a mobile base of operations, unlike Enemy Within, and you are flying around the entire world map gathering supplies, building contacts, gathering intel and much more. As the game goes on you can expand the ship with more rooms in the same way you could in the old XCOM base from previous games. You can also build and discover unique things across the world map that can make fighting the aliens a lot easier.You will need to build contacts with the resistance in every country to expand your operational area and to receive more supplies to rebuild your army. This creates a great way of dealing with research, upgrades, buildings and much more in a great flow that can be boosted by completing unique missions and picking up loot drops on missions that can now FINALLY be performed by your soldiers without them having to spend a year researching it.To explain that statement a bit, when you kill an enemy you have a chance that they will drop a loot item that can be anything from a weapon upgrade to PSI implants that will be usable if you collect them during the mission and then complete the mission. Weapon and PSI implants aren’t the only upgrades to be found. There are also ammo upgrades, grenade upgrades, soldier upgrades, armor upgrades and more. The combination of the level of customization available for each character and the number of possible upgrades makes for a level of overall customizability that rivals that of the Sims Universe. (You can’t dress up as Batman yet though, but give it time. Somebody will make a mod for that.)Recruitment in XCOM 2 is different from Enemy Within. In Enemy Within you just recived a group of random recruits and and were cut loose. In XCOM 2 you can pick your own recruits to start with from a long roster and then when you’re unlocked a certain room (trying hard to avoid spoilers) you can train them into certain classes to avoid the dreaded rookie stage. While this is a relatively minor change, it really makes your recruits and soldiers feel very much like your own people.As if all this wasn’t enough, Firaxis has brought out some truly scary aliens to woop our asses this time around. Everything from small creepy things to insanely huge monstrosities that make you wanna run home and cry. You get a great feeling for the difference between every alien and you will be able to tell them apart easily to know which you can shoot at and which you should just blow up with the biggest weapon you have.All in all a great experience that will make you scream, cry and laugh as you slaughter your way through aliens to save the planet.

Posted: February 10, 2016
 Summary: All in all, I'd love to have given the game a recommendation, but in it's current state, I'd rather recommend any reader to rather go play XCOM EW with long war mod or X-COM Apocalypse.Edit: It should be mentioned that XCOM 2 is far from a bad game. Also, some of the drawbacks of the game can be altered with mods like ""Stop wasting my time"", ""True concealment"" and ""Shut up Bradford"".  Review:  I've been looking forward to XCOM 2, while also dropping most of the PR about the game in it's developmentphase. The game adds an interesting continuation of the story from XCOM EU/EW and while the premises of the game is different from the endring of XCOM EU/EW, this is allowed for by events in the game. In XCOM 2, the aliens are in control and the remnants of the XCOM organization is in shambles and beeing hunted. Your task is to build up a strikeforce and connections around the world, work against the alien propaganda, discover what the aliens are up to and sabotage said plans.  Positives:  The premise of the game is positive. The aliens have conquered earth using overwhelming force, XCOM is shattered and the population is under strict control and anti-freedomfighter propaganda.Destructible terrain. I loved playing X-COM Apocalypse and beeing able to destroy pretty much anything, if needed or wanted. This is also the case in XCOM 2, where most terrain can be destroyed with either liberal use of ammunition or explosives.Use of explosives is slightly less punishing, as most enemies do not drop anything lootable. Research, base construction, gathering intel and research is quite intuitive with few quirks. It can be somewhat annoying having just starting checking out (scanning) a rumour, then having to fly to the other side of earth to do a mission, but that's part of the game.The game is mostly enjoyable and can become a decent addition to the XCOM / X-COM games, given proper mods or patches.   Negatives:  Insufficient quality assurance. a) Watching twitch streams and playing the final mission myself, the game may suddenly 'corrupt' in the last room, 		with visual artifacts and colors blooming and flickering. This bug makes it hard to concentrate on the (acid trip-looking) gameplay.b) The game may crash to desktop after killing the last required enemy on the final mission, in one instance causing a corrupt save.c) Overwatch shots may go through solid walls and hit.d) Melee attacks may occour through solid roofs or floors (vertical).e) Pull mechanics may go through multiple covers, visibly dragging the unfortunate soldier through.Constant nagging from Central, combined with loss of cameracontrol. This remains an issue even with the reduced v/o option.Constant delays after completing actions, e.g. heal a unit with a gremlin (drone) from far off, then watch as the gremlin slowly flies back to the operator. The loss of cameracontrol cannot be cancelled.Mods are great, but removing or adding mods can (or will) ruin your savegames. Considering mods can be withdrawn from the workshop, this can be an issue for ironman playthroughs.Accuracy. For some reason, standing in the tile next to a flanked muton gives less than a 100 % accuracy when using a shotgun.  In-betweens:  The player is limited to four classes, each consisting of skills divided into two subclasses. Stats like health, movement, aim, etc. are standardized and a soldier is simply given a class on promotion from rookie. Personalizing soldiers based on stats, e.g. making a high mobility assault/scout type soldier, is no longer an option. Personally, I found it giving to be able to select gear, classes and skills with stats and end results in the field in mind.The Psi-operative is nigh overpowered compared to the other classes.The concealment mechanic is interesting and allows for setting up ambushes or completing exfiltrationmissions almost without combat.Soldier panic can be chaotic. Soldiers can run to new cover and shoot or use items. This can lead to situations where the paniced soldier runs towards the main army of aliens and turns around and lobs a grenade toward an alien standing next to the rest of your soldiers. The result is no cover for your own guys, possible death and more panic, not to mention your paniced soldier possibly beeing exposed (thus dead). Drawing lines back to X-COM Apocalypse, simular actions could happen, as a paniced soldier would either freeze, start shooting at whatever was in front of him (including friendly fire) or run away from enemies. Personally, I find that a paniced soldier is too unpredictable in XCOM 2, as the friendly fire can be a bit over the top in a game where friendly fire is mainly a none-issue. It's a matter of taste.Turn limit. Most missions are limited by a max number of turns to complete the mission. This serves to give the player the feeling that the aliens at any minute may tumble down and create a full lockdown on the area, but in most cases, it makes little sense to activate the timer when the squad is concealed. For some reason, it's OK that it takes maybe 6 hours to fly to the mission, but somehow, you are limited by minutes from the minute your team hits the ground undetected.New mechanics have a tendensy to be stuffed down the player's gullet. Prime example is trying to kill a muton with a melee attack (specialty of the ranger), only to have said muton block and counterattack the ranger. I'm usually a fan of aliens beeing scary in itself, e.g. the popper, multiworm or brainsucker in Apocalypse, but I'm not a fan of counterattacks with no other possible counterplay than not ever using melee on said unit.Restart mission option if you fail the final mission, even with ironman activated. Why...? "

												Dropping the tag of a covert ops group looking to defend Earth, XCOM 2 sees you reinvented as a Guerrilla fighter unit, battling an occupying force of Snake Men and robotic foes.Whereas before you had to enter the battlefield blind, XCOM 2 adds to the formula by providing you the chance of sneaking up on your enemy.Concealment acts as mode where you can avoid enemy fire and set up your own ambushes. It means you can take on a whole wave of foes and enjoy finishing them off in one foul swoop.The battle system remains the same, challenging players to move their fighters across blocks of movement spaces, finding cover to help them survive through the AI’s turn.From the start, it feels like you're against the clock, be it on the ground or in the air. The isometric battlefields throw-up procedurally generated maps and mission objectives, meaning the problem of constant grind has been dealt with quite effectively.XCOM 2 also does a good job of tying its story with real-world events, you must wreck Advent's plans at every turn to pushback the inevitable chaos that will consume humanity.Building the right rooms and facilities will mean reducing healing time, however that will also remove the chance of something else that could provide better weaponry. This gives rise to a multi-layered adventure that follows a different course each time you play. One thing you can never factor in, however, is luck.While the game does seem a little less random than Enemy Unknown, you are still faced with times of joy and frustration.Luckily, XCOM 2 single-player offers a great deal of content for its price tag and can make for quite a thrilling ride.THE GOOD- Great strategy and tactical layers- Command decisions makes each playthrough differentTHE BAD- Enemies sometimes ignore rules- Some performance issuesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Quite simply the game is brilliant. The gameplay is super solid, it looks gorgeous, it plays very well, and it is one hell of a challenge. If you liked Firaxis's original XCOM, then you simply have to play this. They have improved practically on everything. This is just the best turn based game ever, and for me this is the best game of 2016! XCOM 2 is a worthy heir to the franchise and a refreshing script which makes us join the resistance against alien invaders. A very worthy investment indeed.

												I can't recommend this game in good faith in its current state. The performance and bugs really hamper the experience. Luckily, the mod scene is fixing some of it faster than Firaxis can even comment on it, but it shouldn't be that way. A 980 Ti should be able to easily get 60fps@1440p with FXAA, but it jumps around to half that randomly.Also, what is with all the timers in every aspect of the game?			"

												Going to be my first review on Steam, and sadly I can't make it a good one.I absolutely loved XCOM EU across PC and consoles and was really excited for this, but like other reviewers I encountered far too many bugs to fully enjoy the game.Specifically:- Terrible FPS no matter what settings- Game breaking glitches with objectives not allowing me to 'activate' them numerous times (this ruined an iron man run mid-game)- Animations not working (Seems to be triggered by soldiers falling through a ceiling after an explosion)- Important effects not appearing (AOE attacks from enemies especially had no area markers so I had no idea where was safe on my next turn)- Ocasionally had a totally unresponsive game (Not frozen, but not reacting to any commands)- Soldier perk bugs including the game becoming unresponsive when I used combinations of abilities, but was 'fixable' by skipping my turn in that case... I lost a lot of soldiers that way!- Broken/buggy action cam; The game would often zoom to a seemingly random part of the map while a soldier took an overwatch shot, for example- Moves taking up to & around 20 seconds to register as completeIt goes on and on. Definitely avoid this game for some time. I took a chance pre-ordering after promising myself that Arkham knight would be my last, because I loved the previous XCOM.To make matters worse I went away for a week just after the game came out, and was looking forward to a patch when I got back - I came home to a hotfix that made things noticably worse and at the time of writing there is still no patch three weeks after release.Another one for the VERY long list of broken/lazy releases over the last year :((Playing with an OC'd i74770K and a GeForce 980ti)EDIT: I've been playing the game more since the patch and am happy to say that it has resolved almost all of my issues - The game looks, plays and runs SO much better.I'm not going to change this to a positive review, since clearly the game was not ready for release and I'm pretty tired of these non-stop sloppy releases. But, I'd be happy to recommend this to XCOM fans now - minus a few questionable design choices it's a solid game at last!			"

												I can't recommend this game.  It's no longer a strategy game, just a race against XCOM's legendary rage-inducing RNG.There's so much here to build on, and that's part of that makes this so disappointing.  There's a great stealth mechanic...that you can't use because of the turn timer, so you blow it on the opening group of enemies you see.  It's neat, fun to play with for a few (failed) missions, then you leave it alone because the turn timer invalidates a piece of great design.There's awesome classes with neat abilities...except sharpshooters are worthless since using them like the sniper they're supposed to be means that you lose them when the evac timer runs out.  Once again, the turn timer invalidates another piece of some really good class/game design.You could always counter the whims of the RNG in XCOM: EU/EW by playing safe with overwatch and setting up a good sniper position, and you can see the design intent to stop that with the turn timer.  But that turn timer coupled with the whimsical RNG turns the game from a ""series of interesting decisions"" into a series of bad ones and worse ones.It's really close to being the GOTY candidate so many reviewers are making it out to be.  But without a balance pass, it's just an overengineered race against a timer full of nigh-impossible missions.  Any strategy is invalidated by the timer, so you just roll your shots and hope they hit, because if they don't, you're dead.This is XCOM.  They don't hit often enough to stop you from dying.			"

												This game alone is enough to make the year 2016 an awesome PC gaming year. What an amazing turn-based strategy game, with a staggering amount of nice character customization (especially with Steam Workshop mods). If you liked XCOM: Enemy Unknown, you will like this even more. If you never played the first one, you will still like this one. With a full mod support from the moment of release, and with the SDK now available, the game will have an extremely high replay value. We already have tons of great mod content, and its only getting better. Highly recommended to any and all friends of turn-based strategy games! If I believed in numeric ranking, this would be a solid 9/10.Why not 10/10? My personal complaints:- The game has some serious performance problems: with i7-3770k, 16GB RAM, GTX 970 and played from a 250GB Samsung EVO 850 SSD, @1440p or @1080p and medium/high settings (won't matter much), the game will average to about 35-50fps, will constantly drop below 25fps, sometimes even below 15fps(!). Lowering quality and/or resolution won't help much, so the problem is deep in the game. Holding steady 60fps is very rare.  This must be fixed ASAP! In its current condition, I'd say many gamers will lose their freakin' minds over this.- late game content seems a bit unstable. I had 3 crashes during the last 4-5 hours of the game.- EDIT: Stop Wasting My Time mod helps on this. ""SHUT UP CENTRAL!"" mod would be amazing! Im tired of that guy saying the same things over and over again, always cutting me off from my game. Why can't I just keep playing while that guy talks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? Stop cutting my game off!- timed missions are partly great, but they have not been well developed here. A single mod made all the difference: mission timer start only when your team is revealed from concealment. This way you can play much more strategically, and without rushing like an idiot on some missions.			"

												I just thought about writing an overall positive review on XCOM 2, but still mentioning all issues the game has, but I won't because I'm getting tired of constant crashes and so called ""patches"" since the game is still unstable and I have seen multiple crashes during the loading screen. The interesting part is that, the day before I wrote this review, this game worked fine without any major issues (not counting some FPS drops here and there and long loading times) and I have a lot of mods in this game. Say what ever you want, but this game has a weird way of working at sometimes and other times it doesn't for any particular reason. So, I decided to mention some of the most serious issues that are (including the DLC content) in this game to warn everyone what they are going to experience during the playthrough.*Long loading times*Random FPS drops*Multiple crashes during loading screens (I feel sorry for those who play with Ironman on)*Cutscenes with audio playing before the video itself (really??!!!, couldn't you just do a pre-rendered cutscene video and audio at the same file instead of this)*Occasional bulls**t logic in game like: -Enemies dodging fire when stunned or frozen -Time limits even though the enemy doesn't know you are there (can be fixed with mods, thank god....) -Alien ruler reactions; one action = ruler gets one action too (because soldiers can't run from the danger at the same time)*All these performance issues for a PC exclusive (and now they are going to release console versions, thx for the announcement Firaxis, we really appreciate it.....)*Situations where there is invisible cover or no cover at all in the most obvious places, so the game is buggy tooAnd even though some of the issues could be fixed by downloading unofficial patches from the Steam Workshop, it's still possible that some of them could make the game performance even worse and admittedly I'm not an expert on these things, but thats just what I think.(Also apologies if my review has any grammar mistakes)			"

												You can shoot through 3 walls and solid floors/ceilings. You can and will get wallhack ambushed by enemies two floors below you. Just imagine that any solid objects and buildings do not exist, and that anyone on the upper floors are floating in the air.Enjoy 40/30 fps with massive 20-25 fps fluctations every 3 seconds. Also, enjoy savescumming every couple of minutes because the entire combat system is RNG dice rolling. It's as interesting and skill-requiring as sitting on a chair and rolling a six-sided die on a flat table. Didn't get six? Reload and try again, or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.This game is a joke. You should pay ME to play this game.			"

												I like the previous game a lot but not this one, at least for now, because I really dislike the ""turns limitation""(timer), 8 turns to do this, 12 turns to do that, or you're screw..., what a tactical new ""feature"", it's almost a game breaker for me, so I'll keep the negative review unless the developers can make some changes, such as provide an option to disable it or decrease the mission ratio which has timer in them.Another thing, the characters faces in customization need some improvements,too, especially females, most of them are just too ugly, I can't bond with my team mates if I cannot even stand with their looks. Yes, I know my teams are soldiers/warriors, but that doesn't mean they have to be fugly.			"

												just started the last missionProsDo you like xcom EW? Then there a 99% you will love this game. It is HARDER, though.They improved in pretty much every aspect. I miss some things from EW expansion, but whatever.Now, to why i dont recommend this game.Cons;Bugs, bugs, bugsGame breaking bugs if you are playing in iroman.ex: need to EVAC to finish the mission, but one unit is stuck in place and there is no one left to kill her.Mission failing bugsex; the warning for reinforcments show up but it the dropzone doenst. Enemies drop (literally) in the mid of my soldiers.RNGI know the RNG in Xcom can be punishing. But i truly believe there are some problems with it.70/60% Hacking attemps were failing 80% of the times.The DODGE_GRAZED happens wayyy to much.Two units in full cover, smoke granade on them, far from the enemies. Sectapod one shotted them both with criticals.(disclaimer: again, i am aware this is RNG based. And as such, maybe i am just unlucky. But again, some stuff happen way too much for me to think its just bad luck)Enemies teleporting, walking trough walls, walking trough the ground (not kidding)Soldier stuck in animations from attacks or from being attacked (some of them could still be used, though), soldiers teleporting, soldiers unable to use skillsBad FPS, enemies turns taking way to long to process, enemy turns not being processed in camera(by that i mean that the enimies act but the screen is frozen, the it goes back to normal but every enemy already acted)I saw a lot of these bugs in the streams/videos in youtube. But i figures they were there beacuase of the pre-release version. That was not the case, And from time to time i get some pretty heavy LOW fps.  VeredictGame is fun, hard, worth of being called xcomBUT DO NOT PLAY/BUY it until some patches come out			"

												First off the pros of the game.1. Very flush gameplay that looks great when playing on all 8 cylinders. 2. A truely different system that feels less punishing than EU's council did.3. Well people may or may not agree. The game is a hell of alot easier in the begining than EU.Now the Cons. 1.Poorly otomized. I partipated in the Devision Beta that game had cutting edge graphics that would put this game to shame yet this game lags regardless how much I lower the video settings. Cut scenes lag, game lags randomly, it will go choppy without warning ruining much of the game's fun.2. Narative is almost non existant. Forget being an unpopular narative to begin with. At no point is't the story really told of what excactly went wrong in the first game. You just have one cutscene with the chip being removed and the Archives have almost no information. Just fluff Inomation that I think was copy pasted from a fan site. To eleborate on this the characters all act like you already know what's going on. No ""Okay this is what happened and how we got here."" It's litterally ""Welcome back. Let's get to work."" 3. Even less customization than EU with soldiers. Yes you heard me correctly. Less. One thing I loved about EU was that the soldiers would speak in their national languages. Forget the fact Asian soldiers from Japan and China somehow speak English with an New York Accent. There's even less languages represented then before. And for some reason the toggle for the Soldiers to speak their own national languages doesn't work. You have to manually choose their language. 4. The procedurally generated maps.. Seems to be a lie. Do not chew me out for this one. But On my first play through I gotten the same excact map 5 times. Do not get me wrong but wasn't that the big deal with this game? It's one step forward then 20 steps backwards.5. Hostile social Justice Warrior Moderators on the discussions section for this game. Well not technically part of the game itself. The 2k moderators on the disscussions are the worst I have ever seen. Openly hostile and abusive of the rules in place. People are banned for critizing the game's premise. Which if you read number 2 turned out to still be a problem. They're banned for asking questions or just plain saying any part of the game is something they don't like. Some of the moderators even would start arguring with people just so they can ban them even if the person they started arguring with never actually responded to or acknowledge them. One of the moderators I want the personal adress for since what he did was technically criminal threatening. The people you leave in charge of your discussions boards for a game do infact represent your game studio, game and brand. How buggy is the game so far? Well as a person who plays Bethsoda games. I have to say atleast Bethosada games are playable at launch.Update: Just beat the game. I now seek a refund. And to retract earlier made statements.1. The game is less forgiving then prior. The Avatar Project system artifically jacks up the difficulty. The Majority of Missions are timed. There's is too kinds of difficult when it comes to a video game. Frustrating and challenging. Darksouls is a Challenging game. This game is Frustrating. Frustrating due game breaking bugs. Bugged Animations. Missing cutscenes all over the place. Get used to Blackscreens.2. Clear intention to make terror from the Deep style sequel.  Ending cutscene as well as others lack luster. To sum it up violence in the ending cutscene is censored. No satisfying seeing a mob of baseball bat armed civilians bashing an Advent Trooper's face in. Just cuts away with it implied. Seriously we can slash in the game shoot things in the fact Civilians included. But god forbid an angry mob be portrayed accurately at the victory screen. Also that annoying speaker guy there's a cut scene where the truth is displayed and a mob rushes in to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him. Again cuts out and you never see the satisfying boot to the face from an angry mob. 3. Balance is very poor. Some of the toughest enemies release early in the game while the easiest release towards the end. What do I mean? Sectopods realrease very very early into the game. Long before you see the Bioshook knock off guys. 4. Victory screen bugs. Just a box saying ""Collecting server stats."" Which will sit there until you hit cancel and contine. 5. The set up for this game forces you to rush everything removing much of the strategy element. Oh poorly equiped and niether anything better than a couple of squadies with one gun attachment no equipment upgrades? Well you better figure out how your gonna destroy those two facilities in under a turn or you auto lose the game.6. Can't pick starting location? That's something I liked about EU. You could pick your HQ location. Here.. Not at all. It's random. You just gotta start over and over and over and over until by the grace of the RNG Gods you get the location you want. By the way continet bonsues still a thing so it's not just a flavor thing.But the most annoying bug. It crashes on shut downs. Often! You'd think shutting down a game would be an easy feat anyone can master. Apparently not. If I'm done with the game half the time I have to edit game setting make it windowed so that if it crashes I don't have to manually restart my computer. I am unsatisfyed having beat the game. Hell the DLC never once makes an appearance if you paid for it. Other than the stupid Resistance style armor pack. Which does not cover anything past starting gear. I never gotten that veteran soldier. Even with the increased customization options.. Customization is far less than EU. I will now seek a Refund. Anyone else disappointed in this game I'd recomend do the same.			"

												with every mission being timed this is less a strategy game than a rush to finish. The fun has been sucked out of a potentially good game.  There is no other strategy than rush towards the objective and hope you don't get killed on the way.  If you don't use full rush every turn you fail. Amazing engine. It looks great.  It just isn't a strategy game.  It's COD in isometric form.			"

												Excellent strategy game, poor performance. Running this on a GTX 770, which still is a fairly recent graphics card, but im dropping down to even 17 fps sometimes and I average about 30-50. Don't get me wrong, this game looks great especially for a strategy game but it's not like its MGSV or Star Wars Battlefront.You could say since its turn-based strategy performance doesn't matter. And it doesn't really matter much because you can still do a playthrough just fine (I could atleast, but if it's this bad for me then it got to be worse for someone else with a poor graphics card / bad system). The thing is when you pay 50 euros for a game I believe most of us expect it to be good in terms of performance and optimization.But the game is amazing in terms of gameplay (except maybe the camera being a bit glitchy?), so the reason why I'm giving this a negative review is to help show publishers it's unacceptable to push out games before they are properly optimized and ready in terms of performance.

												This review SHOULD be recommending this game. The game should also be far less cripplingly buggy.For all intents and purposes, XCOM 2 is an excellent game. It improves upon its predecessor hand-over-foot, with stunning visuals and engaging battlefields. I've managed to play it in fits and spurts between crashes, cache verifications and reinstallations, but the fact is that it has consistently crashed with the dreaded ""Error 41"" 9 times out of 10.I have done all the steps recommended for trying to fix this -- reinstalling DIrectX, repairing Vcredist, reinstalling the game, verifying the cache -- but the fact of the matter is that no matter how many stopgap measures you can try, it doesn't change shoddy framework. This is where Firaxis has messed up, and until a hotfix is issued, I can't properly recommend this game.If you want to play XCOM 2, wait for a month, maybe two, for a hotfix to be released and HOPEFULLY remedy these terrible bugs and compatibility problems. I look forward to this game when that happens. Until then, fix your product Firaxis, we'll be watching.			"

												I had good fun with this game, especially when it comes to modding community, something that EU was missing from perfection, at least for me. Wide variety of customization options for soldiers bought me here, as the more love You're putting into soldier, the harder You try to keep him alive throught campaign. It kept good old combat system, with interesting stealth and ambushes possibility. Overall system feels better, but not without bugs, like missing 100% shot. Based on EU You'll see that Your soldiers will make less ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" shots, so that's a big plus. XCOM 2 is also a lot more narrative, it had great DLC missions with Bradford and Shen. If only playthroughs could be made somehow longer, it will get 10/10, but for now here's 9,5/10. We'll see what the Long War Studios bring us =)			"

												As it often happens with games that go crazy on marketing, the core game is very frustrating.The computer ""cheats"", and all the bad from the first X-Com came back and enhanced.The good: -Some cool ideias with base design and facilities. -More lore about the auxiliary characters.-Very few bugs so far (wich means that the comp cheating is intended)The bad:-Free move. The computer always get a free move. No matter what. This removes any try of the game to be a turn based strategy, and become just a Human vs bad AI game with ""challenge"" added by cheats like free movements.-Time counters on every mission. If you hated the first game when you had X turns to do something, well, now you have this on EVERY mission. No strategy, no sense (cause most of time you take days to reach mission site but exaclty 10 turns befora a bomb explode... wow, super awesome for some 6 year old)- It took like 2 hours to get the first chance to edit a soldier or modify your base... 2 hours being told to click here and click there. Again, 6 year old tutorial that bore you after 10 minutes.- Huge loading screens.This game isnt a turn based strategy. Its more like a rogue-like rush game. You will die randomly. The comp cheats. The same rule that aply to your forces dont aply to the enemy, this kindo of thing that essentially destroy a turn based strategy game. Seems like the game was designed to make you go, rush around dying just to see the layout of the map and where the enemies are, then load the game from the start of  the map and go the perfect route to ambush the enemies with overwatch. If you try to ambush them by shooting, they get the free ""nonsense bad design"" move and go to cover before your second soldier can shoot. But if they get you in the open, they all shoot and kill before you can react, cheap cheating is cheap.The game isnt a complete fairule and i would wait a little for modders to make the game people really want to play, my only concern is the timers, since all missions are designed about this stupid ""blitz mode, no thinking"" timers, even if a mod remove them, many dialogues would make no sense. Everymission there is a bomb, a trap, or a incoming something, that you need the timer... awesome diversity i must say, by the third mission i was so dissapointed by the timer that i kept playing just to try to see where the stories go.If you like this kind of rush game, go ahead, if you like strategy, this game isnt for you.Edit after playing to the last mission:Added bad:- buggs everywhere, and sometime is even dificult do know if is a bug or intended. Bugged exactly on the LAST hit of the last mission after 3 hours playing the mission. 3 wasted our of my life.- Scum save game. This game is simpe: No strategy as posted aboved, complete save and load game. After scumsaving every mission, i ended each mission with about the hit rate i would have if the game engine of random numbers wasnt broken. I take most of my shots at 75% chance, without scumsaving, at the end of a mission i hit like 40% of the shots, after scumsaving i get around 70 to 80%! so i am not  even saving and loading to make everyshot hit, but you have to scumsave just to make the game behave as the aim % say it would behave!After all this time trashed on this game, i probably will play last mission again just to see the end, but the game is SO unfun to play that i am really have to make a effort to play again. Bore repetition with scumsaving around.Cant recommend  the game. Probably will be much better with 16 y.o. modders showing a professional company how to make a game. Wait for like 3 or 4 months and try again, thats my recomendation.I was really disappointed when they insisted on make a game disregarding all X-COM EU final, fanboys kept telling me to wait for the game... you have to be REALLY a fanboy to like the game in the current state.

												It is unacceptable to release a AAA game in such a buggy and unoptimized state. Is it playable? Sure. However, the constant slowdowns (even at reduced graphics settings), animation bugs, floating heads (armor doesnt load on background characters), and camera bugs definitly take away from the experience. It is very clear to me that the publisher said screw the polish, just release it. It's been several days now and still no patch to fix any of these issues. $60-$75 for what? A bunch of reused assets on a three year old engine? AND it doesnt run perfectly? Thats what really bothers me.Is XCOM2 better than the last one? Yeah, the game mechanics fit the setting a lot better. The world map is more interesting, even though it just feels like im playing a cheap board game. Is it worth the price they are asking? sadly, no. I should not have bought this, you'd be better served just waiting for the 'complete' version for 10 bucks. If you are lucky, by then it'll run properly.Update:Still no patch... finished the game regardless. Spoilers ahead, you've been warned: I have to say i'm all around a bit dissapointed with the story. It's so linear, nothing interesting happens, no betrayals even if the side commentary keeps hinting at certain characters not being trustworthy. No twists. The idea of the Avatar project feels ripped off from mass effect2. Then it all ends with an episode of dragon ball. I have to wonder, did they not hire any writers? Did they let the intern write the story? I'm thinkin so.Update2:So it's been about a month, and still no 'real' patch from the devs. Game is still a mess, and they've done a good job here making me regret supporting one of my favorite franchises. Pathetic.Update3:Finally a patch. While it does fix some issues and speed up the game play, it also lowers the gfx. Can't seem to re-enable them either, game is noticeably uglier. Pretty lazy, clearly they didn't want to spend time to optimize the game engine and just nerfed it instead. Still Pathetic.			"

												I'm a huge fan of this game.  XCOM 2 one of the best games of all times IMHO.  However, their support  for this game is dissappointingly REALLY bad.  My game worked just fine before the latest Alien Hunter's patch.  Now it crashes to desktop at launch.  I've pretty much tried everything on their troubleshooting tips and known fixes and still doesn't work.  I've posted a help request on the 2k Forums and its almost been a month and no one has contacted me to help.  I didn't want to write this review but I'm not the only one having this problem but there is no word from the company that they are addressing these issues.  I pre ordered this game with all DLCs and season pass and I'm regretting it now.  I've recommended this game and defended this game to all my friends and acquintances but this problem is ridiculous.  My Fanboy levels have dropped big time.   I do NOT ecommend this game until they get all the crashes and bugs fixed.  I'm sick and tired of not being able to play a game I paid over $60 for.   "

												It wasn't worth them updating the graphics. All that time wasted on trying to make it look better (Which it already looked awesome in XCom) could have been spent making the gameplay/story better. Not that gameplay/story lacks....it just seems like I'm buying an EA game because ""Better Graphics.""The framerate is horrible at the lowest settings. Thats with an i73770k, 1gb vid and 32gb Ram.Just download ""The Long War"" and spend time replaying XCOM. If you can get away squeezing out a few hundred more hours on XCom longwar, go for it. Wait for the game to come on sale. Not worth $60 for pretty stuff over gameplay.			"

												In it's current state I cannot recommend the game. If you liked XCOM EU you will like this. Problem is even on high end rigs the game has multiple performance issues. They can be played through, but in a game that can be very frustrating due to its unforgiving difficulty the last thing I want to do is be getting frustrated at constant frame rate drops, lag/random pauses during turns and other issues.. I run most current games on max settings, and ARK: Surival Evolved mostly maxed out and get 60fps.  Here I was getting 5-10 fps during menus, 20 fps during some animations, and 30-60fps randomly throughout CS and gameplay. If this was early access I would put up with it, but it's not. This is not a small studio creating their first game with a small budget. Vote with your wallet, wait for the patches to come out, and lets show the developers we won't continue supporting the release of buggy games.			"

Edit: This hilarious video perfectly depicts the problem I have with the game. It's not too hard. It's too unpredictable. That's a huge difference for a tactical game.


Xcom in a Nutshell [SFM] 
A Video of XCOM 2
By: Admiral General Dictator

			My experience with Xcom to this day Music: Xcom 2 OST - Retaliation		


Now the original review:It's really hard to say ""no"" here, because I liked XCOM Enemy Unknown, but this one feels more like gambling. There are a lot of glitches that let you say ""WTF"" constantly.The Good:- it IS fun for a while- dense atmosphere- all good aspects of Enemy Unknown/Within still there- nice character classes, loadouts, customization- new aspects on strategic play on the world mapThe Bad:- the unpredictable hit probability now hurts with the more powerful enemies, example   * trying to hit a flanked sectoid from the very next square with a gatling, 63%   * aiming an enemy from behind cover = 62%, advancing to half distance, no cover, enemy in front = 70%. Yes, half distance and leaving cover brings a plus of 8% for an uncovered enemy.   * and so on and so on and so on- hit or miss, so missing an 98% enemy on the very next field with the gatling = zero damage instead of reduced damage (this was also an issue on the other XCOM games, but now this is reaaaally painful, because you must not miss!!)- often the pace is too high, both in tactical (often need to rush because of turn countdown) and strategic (several events a day, right from the start, you don't get into it)All that comes out to gambling. Even if you did everything right when it comes to tactics, you just need one single bad dice roll and you have a killed team mate or even a catastrophe. The game recommends ""veteran"" level (second level) for players with XCOM experience, but this only works with a lot of save and reload for me. Far away from Iron Man.So, if you like the gambling factor in a tactical game, this is for you.			"

												***Final Update***After running tests with the tech support, their ""engineers"" have reached the conclusion that my GPU does not meet the minimum requirements. THIS IS COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥TWhile it is true that an NVidia GT220 is really old, hell as long as a game does not require directx12 it does its job admirably, a GPU that runs crysis 2 on maximum settings ONLINE surely can meet the minimum requirements for Xcom2.I mean come on. I've read on the steam discussions that I am not the first to be told ""your specs suck, not our problem"", people who claim to have a much better GPU as well.Firaxis and 2K have created a broken mess, what about all the thousands of paying customers who complain about horrible performance issues and constant crashes, who definetly have more than the min. requirements?It's a broken launch that they are unwilling to fix, good thing steam refunds are a thing, though I feel very sorry for all those who cannot ask for their money back.This is the last time I buy a product from Firaxis and 2K, I mean as if broken launches weren't enough, their attitude of ""we support modding"" takes form in releasing day 1 extra content as ""mods"", giving the playerbase easy to configure .ini 's so the customers can do what the developers couldn't be arsed to do. Amazing.At least Skyrim and the Fallout series have a lot of base FUNCTIONING content.I will leave this negative review because this kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥should not go unnoticed. Even should they fix the game nobody should forget about this.I'm leaving the original review that I wrote underneath this line.Shame on you Firaxis, may the aliens probe your asses. With plasma. At a 20% accuracy shot.----------------------old review underneath-----------------Although I will probably be mostly downvoted by most people, as they are able to play the game, I will nonetheless let my downvote count. For a huge amount of consumers, myself included, the game crashes on launch without any explanation whatsoever.I'm not going to post my specs and everything, this is a ""review"", not a tech discussion thread, there's plenty of'em on the actual discussions page if you're interested to see just how many complain about this game's *HORRIBLE* launch day problems.And yes, I tried all the fixes suggested, and like so many others, nothing will work.And I'm afraid that when (or if) I will even be able to play it, the FPS won't drop to 10 or less, as so many other people complained of horrible optimization.Just so you understand the level of customer care the devs gave us today, there was a patch, yeah: it fixed the missing soundtrack included in the Digital Deluxe edition.Cool, now I can listen to a soundtrack for the game I spent 65€ on without even playing it!If you're thinking of buying this game, do consider the VERY high risk of not even being able to launch it, my recommendation is: wait a few days to see if the ♥♥♥♥♥torm's settled down.I'm giving them a week, after which if it's not fixed, I will refund the game. inb4 ""you're impatient /♥♥♥♥♥♥PC""  "

												Wish I could play the game....Played for 54mins just to change the graphics from the defalt of maxium to minium....Like everyone else having crashing issues and trying to find solutions. My system maxed out at quad core i7 2.50ghz (100% used)and 8gb(95% used) of ram and 1gb of amd graphics card. The only way i can launch the game is to disable the built-in intel graphics card and force the amd card to be the only thing that can run the game. But the issue with this is that the system needs the other graphics card to do other stuff like resolution above 800x600 and such. Very choppy response even at minium graphics UN-PLAYABLE :(. also game crashes if I try to enable the other built-in graphics. I don't understand how they could be okay with this launch and what person thought it was okay to put the default graphics on maxium... Really I expected a lot more from XCOM 2 because XCOM 1 was a lot smoother then this for launch. XCOM 1 would look down on XCOM 2...... Really clean up your act and do it quickly and stop selling your souls and just delay your launch so that it is a PLAYABLE GAME. I know your publisher would be upset but it could also have a huge negitve affect on your fan base and there view of the brand. my 2 cents.... wish I could play the game.....			"

												Todays patch ( Day 1 patch 2/5/16 ) has made it worse, I now get stuck waiting for my troopers to shoot a weapon as well, does the zoom in thing between them and what they are shooting at....and nothing....this happens about 25% of the time. No amount of waiting fixes it.I WILL change my review once some of the bugs get fixed, becuase I know its going to be a good game. I can live with the framerate issues, the glitchy clipping into objects, the fact that my troops seem to shoot thru walls, all in the name of good gameplay. But as of right now, I cant finish 1/2 the missions.  There is a bug which does not let the turn end, im stuck looking around the map.  Have saved and reloaded serveral times and keep getting the same issues.  Not even to the point were the game isnt holding my hand.  Im not sorry I payed for it, I am very frustrated I cant play on release.  Once this is fixed a more detailed review will be placed here and hopefully with a thumbs up.			"

XCOM 2I was a newcomer to the XCOM series, picking up Enemy Within during the summer sale last year. I was quickly engrossed by the game's mechanics, and when I found out a sequel had been announced I knew I'd have to jump on it. With two DLC packs and a cosmetic add-on released now, as well as several patches, I believe it's just about time to take an in-depth look at the latest product of Firaxis Games.GraphicsThe most apparent improvement in XCOM 2 is the graphics. XCOM: Enemy Unknown had a distinct art style, but it didn't appeal much to me and the game itself also just didn't look that great because of its low level of detail. There are almost no such issues here. Your troops have realistic proportions, their weapons are properly sized, and the models and textures themselves have improved greatly. This extends to your opponents, as well; each of which receive a fantastic face-lift. The animations are relatively fluid, and XCOM 2 also offers a host of new customization options for making every XCOM trooper feel just a little more unique and personal. The environments are also much more detailed than they were before. Utopian cityscapes maintain an eerie sterility, which contrasts with the wilderness of the cold wastelands of Siberia and the unbearable heat of the Sahara. XCOM 2 definitely earns itself some praise here, and really raises the bar in its genre, even if it isn't groundbreaking.

AudioAnother big improvement in presentation over Enemy Unknown for XCOM 2, audio design has been greatly enhanced. Each environment features appropriate ambient sounds, adding to the suspense before you engage. Your enemies all have unique responses to whatever situation they're presented with, from the hiss of a Sectoid to the Earth-shattering stomp of a Sectopod. XCOM's own weapons all sound satisfying, and there are a variety of options for your troopers' voices. Voice acting is of similar quality to that found in Enemy Unknown; while I hoped for an improvement it is still perfectly acceptable. Perhaps one of my favorite parts of Enemy Unknown was the soundtrack, and I am once again greatly impressed by XCOM 2. Every track is splendid, from the suspenseful main menu score to the theatrical combat music. Timothy Wynn's work definitely doesn't disappoint, and XCOM 2's soundtrack stands up nicely alongside that of Enemy Unknown.PerformanceI'm afraid that this is going to have to be the low point of the review. XCOM 2 still doesn't perform well, even on a PC that exceeds the recommended requirements by a great deal. It's very unfortunate that this game suffers from such lackluster performance, as it drags down an otherwise well-rounded performance from Firaxis Games. The 30 frames per second I maintain is simply unacceptable given my hardware; there's no excuse for it, and there's even less of an excuse for the 10 frames per second I maintain on the Geoscape map. With that said, I haven't had many issues with crashing, but there are some bugs and glitches that have yet to be officially fixed. These aren't game-breaking in my experience, but they are very annoying. Fortunately, there are a variety of modifications on the Workshop which address almost all of these issues, but I would expect an official patch by now.GameplayXCOM 2 shares many gameplay elements with its predecessor, Enemy Unknown, as you might expect. It is a turn-based tactics game focusing on the control of multiple troopers, and each of them have their own unique equipment and abilities. The game uses a two-moves-per-turn system; every unit has two available actions, and moving any amount within a radial area consumes one movement point; typically, activating abilities consumes one or two movement points, and firing always ends that unit's turn. This comes together very well, and makes for a game that is in-depth enough to excite while not being overly complex. There is a line-of-sight system which is used to reveal enemies and parts of the map, and a variety of units to choose from. These include ordinary humans, cloned government troopers, XCOM's own version of the krogan, xenomorph-like arachnoids, and massive bipedal robots. With this variety, it will take some time before one becomes bored of the game's cast.

SingleplayerThe singleplayer campaign of XCOM 2 places you in the shoes of the illusive Commander, a faceless strategic genius in charge of the XCOM organization. This time around, you eschew the underground command center in favor of a massive VTOL supply spacecraft, the Avenger. This mobile base completely overhauls the strategic world map, known as the Geoscape, forcing you to manage your resources carefully since the nations of the world have capitulated to the alien menace, ADVENT. You'll face these human enemies more often than not, but after you escalate and take the fight to ADVENT's strongholds, you'll encounter aliens more and more. Missions are similar to those of Enemy Unknown, but some enforce a turn limit before the mission fails, which is both challenging and aggravating. There are more ways to customize troops than before, as the classes from Enemy Unknown are replaced by five new ones. New technology and stat-boosting items provide various bonuses to troopers, giving players the edge they need to destroy ADVENT and incite a worldwide uprising. The singleplayer keeps you on your toes and threatens you with destruction, from start to finish. Most players will spend most of their time here, as it is the focus of the game.MultiplayerXCOM 2 also features multiplayer, which allows for players to assemble a cadre of troops from both ADVENT, alien, and XCOM forces, with similar abilities to those of singleplayer units. There are a handful of map types to choose from, but the big issue with multiplayer is the lack of options. The adversarial gamemode quickly becomes uninteresting, and other ways to play would greatly improve the game. One idea is singleplayer gamemodes being introduced to multiplayer; one player must defend an objective, the other must destroy it; perhaps one player is attempting to defend a stronghold of civilian units against another. No matter how you look at it, more variety is needed for multiplayer, and as a result you probably won't spend a ton of time on it.Community ContentXCOM 2 earns fantastic praise here. A full suite of development tools, workshop integration, and bringing the Long War modding team in to work with Firaxis on XCOM 2 modding features shows how dedicated the developers were in their integration of community content support. Take one look at the workshop and you can already see a fantastic variety of modifications: New enemies to give you an even bigger challenge. A total overhaul to how the game is played, making it more like the previous XCOM games. A new weapon tier, or new weapon classes. And a host of new trooper voices and customization options, to scratch whatever science fiction itch you have. This plays a big part in my recommendation of the game.

VerdictXCOM 2 is definitely a worthy sequel to the previous reboot, Enemy Unknown. While it takes a few steps back with features compared to the Enemy Within expansion, its community content support takes many more forward. It changes enough to justify its purchase without changing too much from the XCOM formula, and once again sets the gold standard for the turn-based tactics genre. Though they might be put off by the performance issues, fans of strategy and tactics, as well as those who enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization V, are sure to enjoy this title.I would recommend XCOM 2, but would suggest waiting for a sale.

												Save your money. My experience with this game is rather like most people, even Gollop's: several weeks and haven't managed a win yet. Or rather, I've lost the game to a ******* timer. - Strategic tasks like resource gathering and contacting new zones take far too long and don't leave much time for actually combating the alien threat.- The only game I've ever played that punishes you for doing what it presents as something you should be doing. That is: researching or spending time and resources on anything that isn't related to main quest. No matter how many missions I succeed in, I am always behind the curve. If I'm investing resources in Soldier upgrades, new technologies, or black market purchases, I risk losing the game (months before I actually know for certain that I've lost).- Why is the monthly paycheck only in supplies? Does no one have intel to share? This would help alleviate the above. Also, the XCOM Spokesman rewards me with supplies, but I have to spend 3 days picking them up? That's 1/10th of my time every month.- We are overcharged for using Overwatch. Example: Soldier uses an action at T+0 to set Overwatch. Enemy movement occurs, and Soldier fires a shot. At T+1, this Soldier has _NO TURN_. Presumably, the Soldier spent the previous round's action point on Overwatch and they should have two actions the next round like anyone else. Right? Nope. Frozen, and probably in need of ammo.- AVATAR PROJECT. No. At least in the real XCOM games you could continue to struggle against the alien menace until they were mercilessly dismantling the XCOM Project, fighter craft and soldiers and base facilities all. You were given the opportunity to fight and a slim chance to win. XCOM2 gives you a set timeline, and some opportunities to push it back, but your loss is guaranteed unless you research what you're ""supposed to"" research, are fortunate with your zone expansion choices, and neglect to pursue what are presented as strategic/combat advantages. It's an I win button for the PC, and a very inelegant design ""solution"" for summarily ending a playthrough based not on the player's actual failures but rather on what the designer felt would create a sense of urgency.My interest in future products from this developer/director is nil.

												This is going to be one of those marmite games, At it's core its great.It's let down by poor coding (performance) and the super tight turn limits, which on some missions like some of the 8 turn ones needs to be nudged up a couple more, as it stands your forced to run across the map and likely to ecounter groups of AI to get the objective and then dig in, inevitably costing you silly casualties.In it's present state i couldn't recommend, in a patch or 2 perhaps.

												update: two bad DLCs later and Firaxis insists on digging the hole deeper and deepertried to casualize it, taking it too far away from classic xcom and making it an abortion of firaxis's own misguided designs-most missions are timed, meaning you can't play missions the right way, strategize, or take your time, and ultimately just serves to artificially inflate difficulty by forcing the player to move units double time, ultimately there isn't enough time to move across the map, deal with the enemies in combat, and complete the objective-the concealment phase is ultimately just a bunch of overhyped nonsense that lets you get the drop on the first group of enemies, otherwise it's the same game of creeping into the fog of war finding pods with a couple of floaters mixed in.  sometimes the enemies will counter attack or send reinforcements but this isn't really an improvement over EW in any meaningful way even if they tried to make it feel like a different system.-stupid hacking minigame-loot system is oversimplified at the cost of functionality-automatically ejected out of missions on completion, so you can't pick up squaddies and carry them to the ranger/evac point and therefore lose their stuff, there is no way to drop squaddies off in the skyranger before you complete a mission either (a la XCOM UFO Defense)-took away pistols from non-sharpshooter classes-removed the ability to wait to start missions from the geoscape in the instance that you're waiting to complete some crucial research or an engineering project, and instead declining a mission cancels it out completely-tried to adapt civ's specialist system to the avenger rooms, doesn't work-badly optimized, feels like a console port, <30 FPS at most times, <10 FPS in ""cut scenes"" or on the Avenger-removed a lot of features that made XCOM what it iscombat's better than EU/EW though and the only thing they got rightoverall impression of the game might improve based on performance fixes (which I doubt are coming based on Firaxis's recent track record)go play xenonauts if you want a decent, modern XCOM game that isn't EW			"

												There are a lot of improvements on this game that could make it more enjoyable than XCOM enemy unknown. Character custimization, weapon mods, melee combat, stealth mode and a cool story line for example.  However, the addition of so many timed missions completely ruin the game for me.  I really enjoyed xcom enemy unkown's turn based tactical shooting style and expected the same from this game. Every move of every turn required planning, for both that character and the squad as a whole.  Having a strategy to tackle the mission was essential along with the ability to adapt to unkown enemies that you didn't see.   Instead, the timed missions of XCOM 2, which seem to make up the overwhelming majority of missions, force you to play a blitz style game.  Your only option is to make the shortest route possible to the mission objective in which you are forced to make long range movement, puting your characters into positions of disadvantage, and efffectively removing any type of tactical strategy from the game.  Let me be clear, my complaint isn't that the game is too hard, it's that the developer's have completely and utterly changed the game from a tactical shooter to a run and gun style game that i think they hope will compete with the more fast paced first person shooters. All in an effort to attract a new generation of 12 year olds who don't have the attention span to enjoy anything but a call of duty style game.  The rushed gameplay style ruins any other good aspect of this game.  I strongly reccomend you spend your money on somehting else, I wish i had.			"

												I have loved this series since the original, and I especially loved the previous XCOM installment for PC. It modernized the gameplay of the original and kept alive the feeling of saving the world with the power of good planning, management, strategy and combat tactics. You could choose your path, to an extent, and there wasn't always one clear ""best"" decision to make.  XCOM 2 removes all of that.There is always only one clear goal to accomplish, and only one way to get there. All of your choices are limited by this. For example...You have to raid the facility. To raid the facility, you first have to contact the region.To contact the region, you first have to contact the region in front of it.To contact that region, you have to build a comms facility.To build the comms facility, you have to clear out debris and collect resources.So all of the management decisions from XCOM are gone now; In XCOM 2 you're just checking off bullet points and jumping through hoops when they appear. Overall you'll generally feel like you're catching up and not in control.As for the combat, it is much less balanced. It is sometimes boringly easy and sometimes frustratingly unfair. For instance many of the enemies you encounter have mind control and/or instant knockout abilities that can take your team members out of the battle instantly and unexpectedly WAY too easily and way too early in the game. They don't even have to take advantage of your poor planning; Sectoids only need one turn of line of site to ruin your entire team. All it take is for them to successfully take control of a melee ranger or a grenadier and you're doomed.The challenge level and randomness of this game feel like they'd be more appropriately suited for your average indie roguelike. You're always one die roll away from a disaster that will make your progress essentially doomed. This feels out of place in such a large-scale AAA game and it really adds to the feeling of lack of control. It's all up to the dice and you'll find yourself quitting or save-scumming way too often. There's never a sense of balanced challenge to be found; just success or disaster with nothing in between.			"

												Xcom 2 was not a very fun game to play. The game starts out with a very ""do the right thing"" feeling behind it, but that just hides the fact that is a retexured mod with birthday candles on top. The new ""stealth"" aspect looks like it had no work really put into it. The missions where you start without stealth are the ones where you are stealthier. Guerrlla missions are like the Exalt missions from Enemy Within, the DLC to Xcom Enemy Unknown, except you get punished for making sure your guys dont get ambushed (e.g. Overwatching). At least 80%, not inflating that number, of the missions I ran were timed where you had to exfil (aka leave) the mission in 6-12 turns or congrats! You lost all your best guys, woo. Not spoiling anything, but even the campain is timed. Instead of Enemy Unknown there no ""Saving who you want"" and Helping to reduce panic. Nope the game just says straight up ""You're Doomed"" and hands you a peice of swiss cheese and says its a sail boat. But dont worry! I am not 100% negitive, there are  more customizations for your solders than there are colors of paint at a hardware store. That way when you loose each mission and squad after squad gets wiped, at least they looked FABULOUS!   The movement system is all kinds of wonky, but still the only improvment over Enimy Unknown,  The aiming got worse, somehow . The new Ranger class is an example, The 60% with a shotgun RIGHT next to an enemy will hit more often than the 91% with the sword. I'll be straight with ya now, honestly wait until it goes on sale, or a mod that fixes the ""bugs"" in the game.  Buyer Beware.			"

												Performance issues all around. Stop the ''Give it time BS'' in no other industry it's acceptable to sell an unfinished product why would you tolerated this with video games. I'll recommend this game if they fix all the performance issues.... until then I won't, I'll advice to wait until they actually fix it and then get it for half the price.Pros:-More X-COM.-They took advice from the modding community and added a great variety of utility items and grenades.-Harder-More distinctly unique enemies.-Better base management.-Swords! all around the classes are more unique than in EU/EW-Maps aren't only beautiful but they are also random.-A more believable, darker aesthetics/atmosfere.Cons:-Unsatisfactory optimization, some people can't even play without crashing, radio silence from the developers on the issue.-They promise hit and run tactics but yet force us to kill all enemies even if it isn't necessary.-No second wave.-Some enemies that were meant to be more intimidating than in X-COM EU/EW are just punching bags (sectoids)-No genetics or cybernetics lab-Modders are adding things to the game that seem so obvious it makes you wonder why they weren't there in the first place, such as the ability to extract everyone at the same time at the extraction point.as more things come to mind I'll add them.

One of my favourite games since 2015.Performance.Just a joke. Framerate drops to 20fps, stuttering, loading-lags.Game is not ready for release. Developers maybe tested on HAL9000?

												Better than the previous 'new' XCOM but obviously there are plenty of issues in game mechanics. The enemies still know when you see them and the ridiculous reaction move is still in place. The cover system is pretty much as bad as it was in the previous game and even though many guns shoot bursts it can always count only as a single attack. Also you apparently can't hit wrong enemies by accident. Corpse reanimation via psi powers is an instant action and seemingly requires noi 'maintenance' by the the one doing the resurrection. Also all reinforcement actions are poorly 'translated' into turn based environments. At times when you look all the things that happen you can safely say your team is having a nap while the enemies do strange chains of actions.So in essence this game pretty much has all the flaws I expected it to have and for now I haven't seen that many improvements over the last version. There are some small tweaks in functionality but for now I have completed only a couple of missions so there are still plenty of things to discover.Is the game currently worth the full price? No, not really. I suppose some issues may get an official fix and mods will probably fix some others so this game has a fair potential. Even as it is the game seems to be reasonably enjoyable but the actual game mechanics seem to be on par with the most simple board games ever created.Edit: Started out with a recommendation but now that I have played more the game just feels so unbelievably scripted. Ammo clips also don't last very long as these 'soldiers' spray and pray all the time. There are no single shots for most weapons, meaning that even your more senior officers will act like total rookies to the end of time. Also movement rate for everything is far too great compared with the other things you can do. Also firing a weapon ends the turn for that soldier. You can run before moving if you like but you can't do it the other way around. This game getting over 90 points is just ridiculous and 80 would be a far more accurate.			"

												Coming from a guy who spent more than 200 hours on the game, a negative review is perhaps quite weird, but here's what I think as of now:+map generation, you will never play the same map twice, altought you will see some identical areas on different maps+mods, lots of mods available-Performance, the game just looks like the old enemy unknown with somewhat sharper textures, but whereas the old game ran silky smooth on my machine, this one has a bad framerate on anything but lowest settings-Bugs, in a game where iron man is pretty much is ""the way it's meant to be played"", there are way too many bugs. Enemy unknown did have some, but I never observed them in my 147 hours in that game. Various bugs in this one includes not being able to open a door, smoke grenades not working properly, an enemy visually appearing in the wrong location on the map compared to where he actually was, an enemy going under the map and making me unable to win the mission, an enemy attacking through a closed door, and two enemies who both ""cloned"" themselves upon death, so that they efffectively took no damage despite my soldiers hitting them and triggering a death animation on both-You cannot develop a particular type of ammo/grenade/heavy weapon/armor vest, if you try to develop ammo you just get one out of 5 possible types at random, if you try to develop a grenade you get one out of 3 possible types at random etc.-Concealment, where your soldiers start the map in a ""stealth mode"", it just makes the enemies extreme short-sighted, until you blow your cover and they magically gain long-sight. You can run almost right in front of them and they won't notice when you're in stealth mode.-Assault class in EU, who relied on it's shotgun, has been replaced with this ninja class who has a shotgun, but also relies heavily on a sword, and can act as a scout. The sword in my opinion doesn't fit in the game. Having a scout is very useful, but also a very boring way to play-Sniper class in EU has been replaced with a revolver cowboy class who also carries a sniper rifle. This class is designed to attack multiple enemies in the same turn, rather than focus on important enemies. Doesn't fit in the game.-Panic, is better than EU, but still not good enough. Your soldiers won't start killing their friends at random like in EU, but they will run randomly towards the enemy, into a position with inferior cover. Makes no sense whatsoever.-Psionic units are now a class of their own. You train them not by using them in combat, but by having them sit in a training room in your base. Boring.-The combination of turn timer, some really dangerous enemies, and some really strong soldier abilities, makes the tactic of ""destroy the enemy pods on the same turn the engage you"" the only viable tactic. If you can pull it off properly the enemies won't even have the chance to attack you, which isn't much fun. Colonel rank soldiers are too strong. Lancers and shield bearers are a big pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Sectoids may sometimes be easy to deal with, but in early game you may have bad luck and lose a soldier to mind control. You are forced into carrying flashbangs to counter this, as it is the only reliable counter. Turn timers are the least problem as they can be fixed with mods.-Very armored enemies, like sectopods, force you to bring a heavy gunner on every mission, in order to deal with the armor, or alternatively equipping many soldiers with armor piercing rounds. Limits your options, not fun.-Poor enemy design. The sectoids in EU have become humans with weird jaws, the thin men have become snakes with boobs, the floaters have become some sort of statue with a built-in jetback. The avatars are just humans with glasses and funky hairstyle. The advent troops are humans who speak in a different language. Codex is a yellow human. The andromedon and the gatekeeper are good and alien-like, but they are the only ones.-The futuristic style of houses, vehicles, street lights, fences, etc, are uninspired, and doesn't give the game much of an atmosphere. It also lacks the mystery surrounding the aliens. Much unlike enemy unknown, that game had great atmosphere. Overall: xcom 2 fixed the issues with enemy unknown, in that you don't have to replay maps, and that you can add and change a lot with mods. But they messed up almost everything else.edit: actually I can think of another positive: the level destruction in the game is great. most objects, including floors/roofs, can be destroyed.			"

												What can I say, I love XCom.But I have to admit this one is just a bridge to short for me.  Wasn't a fan when they shrunk squad size in Xcom 1 (Reboot) but it was still a good game. This one is also not a ""Bad"" game, but I am coming to the conclusion it isn't my kind of game.While I love alot of the mechanical changes, concealment, new overwatch mechanics, assignable engineers and scientist, ect. ect. The thing that is killing me most is almost every god damn mission has a turn limit. You are almost always up against some kind of clock. And for me that just kills the tactical aspect of the game.Just turned off the game due to getting a guerilla mission that only gave me 8 turns to reach the objective. Took 3 of those turns just to reach sight of the objective and to get positioned before I broke concealment. But then as Soon as I broke concealment I ended up facing 9 enemies almost immediately. With only a 4 man squad I just can't bring enough firepower to bear without save scrumming. Even when I save scrummed hard enough and accepted losing a guy and taking wounds across the board on the rest to complete the mission with 2 turns to spare. As soon as the last guy went down the dropped reinforcments down right on top of me. And that was the final straw.Now I won't say I am a truly gifted player. Tried Ironman mode in Xcom 1 and will freely admit it was to much for me. But I am no slouch when it comes to strategy games. But it feels like they really went over the top on forcing you to constantly scramble in this version and it really detracts from what I see as the tactical puzzle solving aspect that I have come to love from the franchise.Maybe if the Long War team does a version for XCom 2 like they did for Xcom 1 I'll give it another go.  That mod team made Xcom 1 the game it really was meant to be. "

												This game once again vindicates my resolution to never buy a game at release. I made the mistake of not holding to that with XCOM 2 because I loved the predecessor so much and I promptly got punished for it.In short, XCOM  2 is a great game which improves on XCOM in multiple small ways so if you liked the first one, you will probably LOVE the second.BUT it has so many bugs and technical problems atm that imo it should not had been released when it did. None of the bugs I encountered was game breaking, but there are so many small annoyances mounting up that I almost put it away on multiple occasions out of sheer exasperation.The game is still great, don't you believe otherwise. But if you successfully avoided the preorder trap, wait a little longer until they have all (or at least most of) the bugs fixed. You'll get a much less tarnished experience and will enjoy the game a lot more without minutes long loading times, clipping errors, sound cutting out etc.I am sorry to say, I cannot reccommend buying this game at this point in time.Edit: Rejoice, for I have been shown the way. I has been made clear to me, that I wrote my review in blatant disregard of the intellectually challenged of our esteemed colleagues out there. But fear not! You just have the one braincell and nothing to rub it against to make it spark? I will take you through it step by step.Since you read this review, I am assuming that you have not yet bought the game. If you did, what are you doing here? Go play it, it is a good game!I spent a three digit number of hours in this game, yes. Did I enjoy that time? Yes.... mostly. But I spent almost double that amount on XCOM and far less moments where I wanted to punch through my screen and exactly zero minutes contemplating a critical review.So assuming you did NOT buy the game yet. From the top of my mind, there are two reasons I can think of why.A) You desperately want it, but are broke. And while scrounging the money together, you amuse yourself by reading about how good this game is, trampling its enemies into the dust, grinding their bones for your bread and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on their graves. Yay you! Good for you, everybody needs a hobby, I guess.B) You wanted to see if the game is worth your money and your time. For you, I wrote this review. Is the game worth it?That depends, do you want a really good game (yes it IS good as my hours can easily testify, even if you subtract the idling time) NOW? Or do you want a great game in about half a year (where realistically at least a few bugs will have been worked out and it will probably have already been on a first 10% sale)?Chocolate bar now or tub of ice cream later? What I am saying here is that in retrospect, I should have waited for the ice cream. But hey, it's your decision in the end.Still not getting my point? Go pester your mom, she (hopefully) can explain it to you.			"

												Summary: Rushed and shockingly bad sequel to the excellent xcom Pro: um, art design?Con: Randomness from the distance to your timed objective to the foes you face determines how well you doCon: Fake stealth that roadblocks you at the first mob you seeCon: ANNOYING run around and wait world mapCon: No real attempt at balance, I mean, shock trooper.Con: Short, limited more like a bad expansion packCon: No controller support like the previous title Con: Runs poorlyCon: Major bugs (faceless roof collapse double move bug)Con: Boring class choicesA game suffering with design issues. It's both too easy and yet too difficult due to cheap enemy abilites added late in development to artifically increase the challenge. With the addition of timers from the very onset of the mission (not when you break stealth), luck plays a very large roll in success or failure as you run and gun your way to the end. Just run and gun and hope for the best.The world view simply doesn't work, putting forth both pointless busywork and demanding you move from place to place to place as random things happen. The performance is horrid, lack of basic features from the first one like controller support offputting and overall a great disappointment.Still you will like it if you are looking for luck based puzzle like gameplay employing run and gun.  For a serious, difficult but fair tactical game try Long War.And just fully enable controller support already, sure enough steam controllers have been sold by now.			"

												The first XCOM game is one of my top 10 games of all time. XCOM 2 so far has been pretty great so far. But in a game like this where the campaign completely relies on if you can complete objectives quickly. So I would consider it a game breaking bug if the game doesn't allow you to comeplete objectives. Specifically the game would not allow me to do a supply drop, it was only supose to take 3 days, and I ended up wasing weeks in game trying to get the supply drop to work(it never did). During this time my research was glitching as well ... I went from doing pretty well, and having plenty of time to get♥♥♥♥♥♥done, to being completely dicked over on the entire campaign. I now need to go back and try to salvage a save game and hope that the glitch doesn't happen again. For now I can't recomend this game, glitches like this make an already challenging and stressful game, and pushes it over to infuriating. Hope this is patched soon.			"

												At it's core, I wanted to love this game. It has everything in an RPG turn based long term developmental strategy game that makes the experience fun.It's the tactical nonsense that makes this game so frustrating and difficult to actually enjoy.First and foremost, enemy units once alerted or brought onto the map are given both a free movement turn followed by a complete turn themelves. This may not sound like a big deal, but it essentially enables the enemy units to nearly completely outflank you or position themselves in such a way that you won't be able to complete your timed objectives with any surviving members.Next, the timed objectives are ridiculous. You're given such a short time span to actually complete the mission (for instance, access the network in under 8 turns) that you literally have to beeline it for the objective with no regard for your units' safety. This wouldn't be an issue if you weren't being surrounded AND having to deal with eventual incoming reinforcements. There's no path you can take that doesn't require a conflict...so the only thing you can do is set up for as favorable an ambush as possible and then hope RNG works in your favor. If you don't get most/all the enemy killed right off the bat, you're not going to make it.I'm all for difficult missions and challenges that require tactics, but once the enemy units get free moves, and constantly get missed on 80 and 90% hit chances while hitting your guys in full cover, and half your team panicks when a member falls unconcious from a single hit, yet is still nearly at full health....the game starts to get way more than frustrating.It's not fun....and simply not worth proceeding. As much fun as the game looks, I'm already done with it. Thanks, but no thanks.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I loved XCOM: Enemy Unknown. So much that I played through the entire game twice. When XCOM 2 came out I was really excited about it. But after having played 8 hours of the game and have won maybe 3 out of 15 encounters I gotta say, I'm really disappointed. It's not that I don't mind a challenge, in fact I was hoping this game would be slightly MORE challenging than Enemy Unknown, but this game is more than just challenging. This game is, for lack of a better term, ridiculously cheap. You've got enemies that can run for what seems like half the map and one shot your soldiers. You've got insanely overpowered enemies that swarm you from all sides early on in the game, before you have any time to research new technologies and have half a chance at winning. You've got multiple enemy types that can incapacitate your soldiers for multiple turns/the rest of the match. So you basically go into every battle with 2 guys you're just sacrificing to the enemy no matter what, and then left with 2 other grunts to try and fight 8 overpowered, cheap, enemies. And, you have a lot of missions with turn limits, which ruins any chance you have to set up any ambushes, and ruins any chance of you having any sort or tactical advantage at all. This game should be called XCOM: Hurry Up and Die I'm going to try a new game on Rookie mode and if it's more fun that way I'll update my review but for now, I'm pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I spent 60 bucks on this.UPDATE: Started a new game on Rookie mode and couldn't beat the 2nd level. Completed one objective while remaining hidden, immediately got noticed by the enemy even though I was out of sight. Shortly after my opposition went from 2 easy alien soldiers, to 10 aliens. 4 of which were those one shot kill ""stun"" baton guys that can run way too far. My entire squad couldn't hit anything they shot at, even at close range with 70+% odds, and then eventually became dead or mind-controlled by a swarm of overpowered aliens. Rookie mode has actually turned out to be more difficult than whatever I was playing last night. I feel ripped off. This game is not fun.			"

												Why would you implement this stupid turn requirement? What the F****! I can't even keep going if I fail the mission, that's just stupid. You took the missions I hated the most and made them the main mode. I love the polish and updates and it runs great on my system but this core mechanic is a complete miss. THIS IS A SAVE SCUM GAME NOW. I am constantly save scumming where it was just preference before. I should have trusted the reviews but I really liked the last 2 games. I will recommend others to get a ""free"" copy and avoid this one... just why?? I loved the last game all you had to do was update the stuff. Take the guy that wanted the ""turns"" system and fire that dude.Edit: I'm on the very last mission and the game goes from very easy to insanely frustrating with complete lag and glitches. It's sad that with a 5930k and 980ti I cannont run this game well. This is a prime example of why I longer want to spend 60 dollars on a game. This game is more about luck than skill and it's sad I constantly have to save and load versus actual strategy. There is no surprise anymore since I know I will be reloading. You took a great game and made it medicore.			"

												This game isnt harder than the previous game in the good sense. Its now just a case of lets put 12 enemies in and roll the dice in their favour. Also lets go and make it so that the sectoids will just resurrect every enemy you kill and give them ridiculous health. oh and while we are at it lets make it that they can mind control through walls and make it successful 8 times out of 10 even with mentally tough units. Just to top it off lets make the tutorial take up the first 30 minutes and make it easy as hell just to throw the underleveled units into a retaliation mission (terror attack) and let them pick their teeth up off the floor with broken fingers.They did add in a seudo-stealth mode and the characters look much better along with all the other characters.The games problem isnt that its not pulling its punches its just that it sucker punches you and gets the dice to hold your arms behind you back while it hits you.

												While there is some stuff to recommend, this game is an RNG nightmare for anyone except diehard players. This by itself wouldn't be so bad except for the ridiculously short mission timers in practically every mission (8 turns to finish most missions). Just a totally unbalanced mess. It needed another 6 months in development and fine tuning before release. Maybe an okay game for diehard players but this was this was simply dull to me, just watching soldiers get killed left and right, getting pulled across the map, dying because they were one turn from an objective and the timer rolled out or because I rolled badly. On the plus side, the character gen is nice. Minus side, the clunky combat. This game may also feature the most irritating overuse of voice over in history.			"

PROS+ Snazzy new graphics. Weapons and armour look amazing.+ Environments are varied and look a lot better than XCOM:EW. + Environmental destruction! Need a quick exit? A grenade on the far wall will do the trick nicely!+ Psionic soldiers and powers are a lot more fleshed out.+ Skills and abilities a lot more interesting.+ Customization options.+ Weapon upgrades.+ Ammunition mods.CONS- Everything needs to be scanned and everyone is always in a rush and demand your immediate attention. There's a lot of flying back and forth across the world map. ""Commander, we have supplies waiting for pickup in Asia."" You fly over there to pick them up and then immediately something else pops up and requires you to deal with it. Then another thing. And another thing. And so on... It's annoying.- Missions with timers are a Run-and-Gun gauntlet. This severely prohibits you from playing how you want and it detracts from the overall enjoyment of the game.- Psionics are overpowered. Field a squad of Psi-Ops and you'll rarely want to run any other soldiers.- Poorly optimized. Plenty of framedrops even with certain options turned down/off.- Suffers from typical Firaxis-sequelitis with a touch of Bethesda-modanium - okay that was bad, but still. The fans are expected to ""fix"" the issues in the game with mods because it was half-arsed during development.- Hacking and the weird randomness of it. Having a high hacking skill seems to do naff all. I've had a lot more success with non-specialist soldiers hacking things than with the class that is supposedly an expert on it.- Accuracy is incredibly wonky. Standing in front of an alien, in the tile right next to it, does not give you a 100% to-hit chance.- Pull mechanics from the Viper-alien is horribly broken. They can pull you straight through walls and obstacles.- Melee attacks are also broken. Attacks through walls and obstacles are commonplace. Cover does nothing. I've had instances where I was able to strike an alien standing on the floor above me.- Overwatch and shooting in general isn't making much sense, either. You can shoot through walls and hit the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ standing on the other side of the map as long as someone has spotted the enemy.- The delays after every. single. action. Heal someone? Delay. Hack something? Delay. Shoot something? Delay.- Unskippable cutscenes and Central bugging you constantly.Final thoughts.XCOM2 isn't bad but it isn't good either. The lack of quality assurance is clear; everything from poor optimization and broken pull-mechanics to all the delays after every single action. It's not much but every little thing adds up. I've spent over 300 hours in XCOM:EW (and god knows how many more in the originals) and I've enjoyed every single one of them, from the missed high-percentage shots to the one-shotting of the Über-Ethereal in the final mission. I have 50 odd hours logged in XCOM2 and I think I'll log another 30-40 to get the last few notable achievements (not Multiplayer, not touching that in an XCOM game) and after that, I don't think I'll play more. Not unless a major optimization patch fixes things.What's the verdict?Good question. I honestly don't know. I don't dislike the game but I don't like it either. It's all very ""meh"". It has so much potential but it is held back by its own failings. Final verdict on XCOM2 is a 6/10. It is just... average. I only barely recommend this. It needs to be fixed before it can turn into a truly great game.			"

												Oh boy this is  really kinda a mixedbag.At first this game made me rage really hard (which almost never happens with games)CONS*The game tries everything against you to put all odds against you.   You have limited time worse gear weaker characters and even on high percentages your chars seem not to hit.  Later this changes but till you get there you get to be a nervous wreck.PROS*Great Lore/story. If you love sci fi you will love the story, the detailed aliens with their descriptions/autopsies.  You can just tell that they did take alot of effort to design those.*Graphics look great*The new skills are just fun and add a new layer to the game.*Mod Support (essential mods:Dont waste my time,true concealment,shorter avenger loading times) Prolly Long War 2 not before too long.*The new enemy types and their skills are just to cool. You encounter a new enemy and see it as a hardship but after    some missions you encounter some other enmey that makes the old one look like a cakewalk etc.Anyhow all in all buy it if you liked Xcom 1 but be ready to be frustrated at the beginning.

												There's a lot of good here that's let down by the short turn timers and buggy gameplay. Hustling into poorly set up engagements because preparing properly takes too long isn't particularly satisfying, and the solution - especially in Retaliation missions where you need to get to 6 civilians that are often rather far away from you before they're killed - is primarily to have enough firepower to not get bogged down in combat for too many turns. Actually outmaneuvering the aliens to success is largely too slow to consistently beat the timer. I preferred the risk/reward decision-making of collecting Meld in Enemy Within over this ham-fisted way to always force aggression.The deal breaker for me is however the bugs. Dealing with glitchy cutscenes, random black screens on enemy reveal, getting shot through solid floors, UI that completely locks up, and combat turns that just get stuck and never end was trying, but I've finally given up after the timers on the strategic map started counting past 0 into the negatives, preventing further progress.I want to love this game, but it doesn't seem to want to love me back.

												I never review games, but I'm so disappointed in this game I had to. I have a beast of a computer, yet this game crashes every 5-30 minutes due to the same error. ""pure virtual function being called while application was running (gisrunning == 1)"". If you Google that error, or visit reddit / steam community / firaxis forums, you will see tons of people with the same issue, yet the developer is ignoring everyone. There is no fix. The game works perfectly for some people, and does not work at all for others. I tried every fix suggested by people online, and nothing works. Until the developer at least acknowledges they are working on a fix I will not recommend this game.			"

												So you've probably heard people complaining about the round timers and rolled your eyes. ""Xcom is supposed to be hard, and you're supposed to be fighting a guerrilla war.""I thought the same thing, and dove right in without a second thought. Here's the problem: All levels are randomly generated and difficulty does not affect round timers. It is very possble to roll a level where you can play flawlessly, bulldoze your enemies, complete the objectives in record time, and not have a chance in hell of reaching the evac in the rounds alloted. And when that timer reaches zero, you don't get to pull a Payday and fight off another few waves before evac comes back, that squad is just lost.This, and the mountains of gamebreaking bugs leaves XCOM 2 with a lackluster presentation that rides on the coattails of a better game, and promptly falls on it's face once it's in your library.

												This is a hard game to review. There's some elements to it that I love, then there are some that I hate so passionately it beggars belief.If you liked the original (which I did) then initially you are in for a treat. The mechanics are the same albeit more streamlined and the graphical upgrade is very welcome. The stealth addition works suprisingly well and the change in storyline and subsequent game mechanics also feel fresh and well researched, although once again a little light on the details in comparison to the original XCOM. What I HATE though, is the lack of immersion and the funky 'logic' the game uses. If you can accept that this game is based on a framework of stats, numbers and percentages that will over rule the in game logic then you should be fine. I wasnt. When im standing 3 feet away from an alien with my assualt rifle up his jacksy, I dont expect to see %65 chance to hit.The game is designed to pummel you, you WILL lose people and there will be NOTHING you can do about it. I understand this is a design decision, but it ultimately ruined the game for me.In summary - this is a great game if you can deal with unfair spawning, nonsensical 'logic' and frustration. "

												Unbelievably poorly optimized. Runs like utter garbage on even the highest-end machines. An astounding reality given it's built in the unreal engine, an entirely-known quantity. I haven't played it enough to get into the poor decisions made by the designers with any detail (though they are apparent even with cursory gameplay) because it bugs out or crashes regularly. Not worth it until the developers have had time to make the game function. Never in my life have I been more certain that the 9's a game is being given were bought by the publisher.			"

Posted: February 5, 2016
												Long War Update: Long War adds SO much to the game, and it also makes everything in my original review worse. One would say that it accentuates the original experience, so, if you enjoyed XCOM 2, then you'll have a blast. For me it was a big let down. Not only performance drops to it lowest point ever, but the friggin timers are back.I assume LW doesn't play nice with the mods I had, so that's another problem I would have to deal with if I felt like playing this game in the future (which I won't).First Update: You can now remove explicit timers from the game via mods (doing so won't disable any achievements). Keep in mind, though, that the game was designed around that ""mechanic"", and there're still plenty of implicit timers around (civilians, objective defense, unlimited spawns, etc). In light of that, and the fact that modders are just kind strangers and not Firaxis, my review remains the same.Original review:Here's my -entirely subjective- view of this game as of now. For the record I'll say that I'm a big fan of the old XCOM as well as EU.**** CONS **** (i'll list them first since this is a negative review)- Plenty of timers. If you liked the council missions where you had to deactivate the bomb on a timer, then you'll be fine. However if you're like me and you like to approach things carefully, then those kinds of ops are going to get boring, fast. I get the whole ""urgency"" thing, but when 4 out of 5 ops end up being timed (either by a turn counter, or a civilian counter, or any other counter for that matter) it becomes somewhat frustrating. It may be ok on the easier dificulties, but the higher you go the more you'll hate them. And that's not even mentioning having to beat the Avatar Project.Man Firaxis sure love their timers.- Shorter soldier list, longer recovery time.Your guys are expendable, especially during your first hours with the game, but combine the fact that the aliens are now more dangerous and resourceful with the fact that soldiers may take several weeks to heal up after they're wounded (provided they don't die) and you'll end up recruiting A LOT of cannon fodder, spending precious resources that you won't be able to dump anywhere else.- Friendly Fire.It's always frustrating to see your soldiers shoot themselves when they panic, but now they not only do that, but also blow your entire squad up with their grenades. Combine with the previous points and you'll get how infuriating this can result.- Unlimited enemy spawns.During some ops the enemy will reinforce their numbers, as they did in the previous game. Only that now they'll continue to do so every few turns. What's that? You don't want to risk your guys? Tough luck, you'll do that or you'll be royally f***** whithin a couple turns. Combine with the previous points.- Bad optimization.The game ran poorly on my (high-end) system. It'll probably be fixed once the drivers get updated and all that jazz. Hope so anyway. This was the first time I had any kind of problem of this type with XCOM.- Losing stopped being fun.Because unlike EU or the older titles, this game does not punish your mistakes. It instead pushes you to make them, then punish you for it, which I found to be a little too much, and I was a regular Ironman Imposible player back in EU.If you're of those who consider timers realistic, think about this, everyone knows that you never EVER dash/move twice on Classic or Impossible, yet the turn limit forces you to do that. How bad is it? Well, aside from the fact that worrying about the timer takes away from enjoying the rest of the game, you'd think you can always dash safely while conclealed... Only to realize then that you triggered 2 unseen groups and a turret and now your Ironman campaign is going down the toilet, fast. Remember how good it felt to carefully coordinate your squad to wipe out that alien pack in a single turn coming out of concealment?Good, remember it well, because chances are you're not gonna get to that often.**** PROS ****- No thin men.JK, you'll face worse.- Meaningful choicesThe game is full of them, but the ones I liked the most are those related to soldier classes. A lot was done to improve the skills you get to choose when your guys level up, unlike EU where you picked more or less the same every time.- No satellites.Building satellites was a chore, but was almost mandatory in the previous game. That is, luckly, a thing of the past.- Soldier and weapon customization is over 9000.- Maps are more diverse and feature a lot more detail.- You get access to a lot of tech very early on (by XCOM standards), likely to balance the increased alien threat.- The story is a lot more fleshed out than in the previous game.I have a lot of positive things to say about XCOM 2 regardless of my negative review, and it's certainly worth the price, if you're the kind that enjoys the changes they made to gameplay. I'm not one of those people, and that's why I'm giving this one a thumbs down. Consider it carefully before buying though, or you could end up like me.*** Closing Statements *** (Spoilers) So I've finally -almost- finished the game. I've seen everything it has to offer and my feelings are of disappointment more than anything else. The equivalent of the base defense and -especially- the final stand are long ops that end up feeling like a chore. The final mission is pretty similar to the one on EU, perhaps a bit shorter, but pretty much the same. What's unforgivable, at least for me, is the fact that they spiked the difficulty at the end so hard it makes no damn sense.You can pretty much complete the op breaking face all the way to the last encounter, which throws A LOT of BS your way. So I basically shut down the game and fired up YouTube to see the ending cutscene, because I was not going to do that all over again (You can see how much I cared for the game at this point).Completing the campaign (or at least 99.9% of it) on Commander Ironman took me a sweet time and was fun at times, but there was a lot of stress and boredom involved as well. There were times when I just wanted to get it over with, and the final op was the last nail on XCOM's coffin for me, I didn't feel any reason to re do everything and try again afterwards, much less jumping on legend, though the game cheats a lot less than it did on Impossible back on EU.If you made it this far I thank you for your time :)Cheers.

tl;dr XCOM2 isn't a bad game. However, in its current state(bugs, brutal difficulty, optimization issues) I am giving XCOM 2 a thumbs down.  Forward -- My Perspective I played the original XCOMs to completion along with the EU reboot.  I enjoyed these games.  I am a tough critic.  I expect a game to be fun and enjoyable from my first hour to my last hour.     PROS  (+)Great atmosphere(+)Competent tactical combat(+)Large variety of aliens, items, structures, and skills (+)Customization of troopersCONS  (-)Bugs.  One such bug is the game allowing troops to shoot through one or more solid walls/ceilings/floors.  If the cover system doesn't work in a cover based shooter, then the core functionality of the game is broken.  I don't understand the problem here because these mechanics worked fine in EU.(-) Poor optimization. (-)The first mission is a 100% on the rails ""tutorial"" followed by a far(far) more challenging real mission that is very unforgiving -- this is an ""interesting"" design decision.  (-)Time limits along with procedurally generated maps & random spawns = lol, you were punked situations on occassion. (-)Development traps, RNGesus, unforgiving gameplay, and uneven difficulty limit the way you can play the game.  Over reliance on grenades is almost a requirement in many places.(-)Save scumming is how many (if not most) people will deal with the above ""challenges"".  Designing a game to require save scumming from many players is a questionable decision (imo).   Review Counter Arguments  Why you are right and I am wrong.Get Gud/Learn2play noob""That's XCOM""Load some modsPlay on rookieYou dislike a game I like so  you are ""Another cry baby""			"

												This is a review of the base game, without mods, which I bought 6 months after game release.Summary:Playing this game was like drinking a nice soda and finding a hornet in the bottom of the glass!Pros:Good UIMinimal game-engine problemsGood to great graphicsInteresting soldier mechanics and play stylesExplosivesCons:The PlotPacing.  The Avatar timer mechanic in particularCharacters, or lack of them.  Shallow and relatively obvious tech treeUtter lack of surprise at anythingSave files that balloon in sizeThe cutscene before the final mission causing actual computer crash when equipping WAR suit.A game that feels way too short and unfinished without DLCI had a feeling Firaxis would make a mess of this game... and I was right.  I decided to play the vanilla game, mod-free, without any DLC.Getting to a good balance of difficulty was tough.  I eventually settled on veteran, then realized once you know how to play this game most of the mechanics are largely irrelevant.  There's a more or less simple solution to every problem.The missions are fairly repetitive.  Some require more stealth than others, and some require killing all enemies and other requires soldiers to evac out.  My basic playstyle of XCOM1 was totally fine: lots of heavies and snipers, with supports and assaults carrying rifles.  Explosives destroy cover and shred armor, everyone else gets shots at exposed targets.  Robotic enemies are nasty... until you realize that your supports are absolutely OP against them.  Again, kind of typical of the laziness on Firaxis' part - create an enemy with an insta-counter.  Heck the biggest risk is that you don't level up early supports because you think they're useless.The overall missions were fun, especially once I got 6 colonel ranked soldiers and started blowing everything up.  I didn't ever deploy a single psionic soldier, and it was no big deal at all.  Anyways, the cutscene before the final mission literally crashed my computer!  It resembled a power cycle (and this happened 3 times at exactly the same point in the cutscene)... people on the internet have also experienced it... mine was solved by removing the WAR suit from the soldier who had it in the loadout scream, which apparently caused a graphics glitch.  That is unacceptable, Firaxis!  A known, full-crash bug that still hasn't been addressed.In sum, I think the fun factor of this game is probably in the mods... however it speaks poorly to the creators that the best thing about their game is that other people can make it better.  I am not a modder, I believe games should be good as sold, and that they should not suck in general.6/10, regret buying			"

												XCOM 2, the sequel to XCOM Enemy Unknown, is without a doubt one of the best strategy games I've ever played. XCOM as a franchise has always been some of the best strategy games out there and I am pleased to say that this new entry more then lives up to the legacy of its predecessors.XCOM 2 assumes that you got your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you in Enemy Unknown(Enemy Within if you got the expansion, also reccomended), and turns the tables on you. You're now leading a resistance movement to overthrow the alien run ADVENT coalition, who are now operating a global government. 20 years have passed between this game and the last, and it shows. ADVENT is well entrenched, not only resource and infrastructure wise, but also in that they have the popular support of the people. Assuming you play the tutorial, the game begins from the perspective of Central Officer Bradford, as he leads an operation to rescue The Commander(Read: YOU) from an ADVENT facility. After the tutorial's crash course in some changes to the ground battles, such as concealment, you're taken to your new mobile headquarters.XCOM is now operating out of ""The Avenger"", a re-purposed alien cargo vessel, now serving as your mobile base of operations. Striking from the Avenger, you travel the globe, uniting resistance cells and striking at ADVENT facilities wherever you can. While the previous games had you countering alien abductions, and defending populations, the new version pits you in a guerilla warfare situation. Now your missions consist of hit and run strikes against research labs, local armories, and other facilities, to rescue VIPs, hack their network for intel, destroy data-relays, or protect your own network taps. Some missions even involve kidnapping or assasinating key officials in their organiszation. Dirty Collaborators.Maps are now procedurally generated, so that you never get the same one twice. The new maps are beautiful, and fully destructive. If you need a door somewhere, feel free to make one. Heck, you can even collapse the floor out from under an enemy's feet, or lure them into a building and with a few well placed explosives, drop the entire building on top of them.The change in pace is noticeable. Almost every mission has some sort of time limit, either due to ADVENT actively destorying whatever you need to protect, or an actual timer untill the mission ends. This adds a sense of urgency to missions and encourages more risky play. Gameplay feels more fast paced then in previous installments. This also adds dificulty, not only must you achieve a hard task, but you need to do it in the next few turns or you won't have enough time to make it back to the evac point.Speaking of Difficulty, XCOM 2 continues the franchise history of brutal and unforgiving gameplay. The easier difficulties are just that, easy. You can coast through them and learn the game in a more forgiving and casual environment if you want. Rookie to Veteran is a significant but manageable leap, however, the difficulty spikes hard changing from Veteran to Commander. The last of the training wheels come off at that point and it shows. The real test of your abilities comes from playing under the ""Insanity"" setting. The training wheels have been long forgotten, no more punches are going to be pulled. The game will officially break your nose and toss you overboard into shark infested waters to see if you can swim. That's not to say the game is unfair, because it is. You can beat insanity mode, but there is no longer any margin for error. To win the game, you'll need to unravel the alien's true agenda. The ADVENT coalition is up to something, in the form of the AVATAR Project. This is the alien's win condition, and puts a timer on the game as a whole. If the aliens can make enough progress on the project, game over. Thankfully, you're given ample oppertunity to sabotage facilites critical to this initiative, slowing and even reversing their progress. If you can discover the truth about their agenda, and put a stop to it before they complete this plan, you will reign victorious.A commander is nothing without his men, and to put an end to the AVATAR Project, you'll need the help of alot of them. Lucky for us, customising the soliders under your command has been greatly improved from the last game. New customisation options, incuding scars, tatoos, and individual armor pieces, can help vary the look of your troops. The Character Pool function allows you to save your favorites to share with your friends, and characters in the pool can appear at random points in your campaigns. New looks are accompanied by new skills. The Class based system is back, but has been changed dramatically. The Heavy, Support, Sniper and Assault classes of XCOM EW, have been replaced with the Grenadier, Specialist, Sharpshooter and Ranger, respectively. Each bring something new to the table, but hav roughly the same roles overall. A powerful 5th class exists now as well, if you're willing to spend the time to unlock it.One more noteworthy feature is the extensive mod support, the steam workshop has over 500 mods already published at the time of writing, and more are on the way as modders explore deeper into the game's code.Summary: XCOM 2 is a great game for the strategy junkies in all of us, offering compelling story, beautiful visuals, top notch gameplay, and brutal, but fair, difficulty. A solid 9.5/10, Must own for anyone interested in strategy games, or who enjoyed the previous installment in the franchise.TL;DR: Buy it, game is good.			"

												I love the entire XCOM and UFO franchise. I played all previous games, I preordered XCOM2, I was waiting like for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christmas. But no. I'm disappointed, I'm very disappointed.Because it's not strategy right now. It's ""rush forward and wish for lucky shot or reload latest save if you miss"".Timers, timers everywhere. Every mission crucial for the plot is on timer, main quest on strategic map is on timer, but that's not the problem. Problem is that these timers are set up so you have no tactical or strategical options other that mindlessly rushing forward. Only other choise is defeat from running out of time. You can't outflank enemies, you can't set up ambushes, you can't walk around them because CLOCK IS TICKING.Why? First XCOM didn't have those (yeah, terror misions, but they make sense. It's either aliens kill everyone around, or you manage to kill aliens faster, no issue here). Technically you could take all the time you wanted. But the aliens were also growing and advancing, they were attacking, they were getting new units and new toys. There was no clock but the pressure was there all the time. That's the difference between enjoying the challenge the games gives you and just being worried seeing diminishing turn counter. I want a game where I have to worry about long term decisions and about outsmarting enemies on tactical level, not go Call of Duty dakka-dakka style.Then there is performance issues. It's not even about FPS drops. New games always have issues like that, they will probably patch it soon. But visible animation issues? You can see where animation of soldier running ends and animation of sticking to cover begins. And after you complete some action the game just waits for several seconds like it is thinking what to do now. Or my soldiers lands a shot at the enemy even if he is looking in COMPLETELY different direction.THOSE WERE ALL PRESENT IN FIRST XCOM. HOW MANY YEARS YOU HAD TO CORRECT THOSE?And this feature of editing how your soldiers look and behave? You advertised this as best thing since sliced bread. It's just few options more than first XCOM. And what logic allows you to edit those only after soldier get higher ranks?If I had to rate the game.As a standalone game, not looking at the title - 6/10. Big game, lot of content, good graphics, complex, yet annoying mechanics. Still much better than most other on the market.As one of the XCOM series - 2/10. A disgrace to to the brand for reasons mentioned above.			"

This is turn based game and frends GTX 980 Ti gets 40 FPS...Radeon R9 380 drops to 10 FPS and lags on every cutscene (high settings).Not worth it at the moment.			"

												Solid improvement over XCOM EU/EW. I really enjoyed the change of pace and base management. A lot of the systems they changed felt like an improvement too. Offers a lot of replayability and character creation is a time sink as always.I do feel that in some ways they could really improve the character customisation (more voice, armour, camo patterns, helmets, hair colour, etc.), even by importing older assets from the previous games. They seem to have left it to the enormous modding scene (they offer tools for this), which is a bit of a shame. Of course, that's not to say that the mods are bad - quite the opposite.Yes performance is sluggish if you don't meet minimum requirements (and trust me, a GTX 560 is bare minimum at 1080p), but turning down the graphics settings will improve things (obviously).  Definitely use a 2GB graphics card which is faster than a GTX 560. Running full screen seems to improve CPU load balance, but then I already have a fast CPU (i5 4690K) so it doesn't make much difference to me.It's an unqualified recommendation if you meet the system requirements.

												If you liked the last xcom, you will enjoy this one.  I am finding it to be a bit more challenging, as a lot of the aliens have been rethought in order to spice up the strategy. It's got that classic xcom feeling still though, massive heart breaking losses of favorite characters, epic hail mary long shots.  Lots to research, and a constant feeling of progression of strength in the war.  The one thing I will say I wish xcom had is a bit more diversity to the types of missions.  The game would feel more immersive if certain things were not so heavily scripted. Do the aliens really need to retaliate every month end?  And can I get a nice easy mission every now and again to help train rookies on?  Once you see a new stronger alien type you are doomed to forever see them in every mission.  These are minor gripes though, and you should be killing aliens... like right now.			"

												This is an *Excellent* game.  Well designed, a great challenge, and it's as much fun to watch as it is to play.When comparing to the first game (XCOM in 2012 with expansion in 2013), it's got a ""spin"" on the story that's nice.This game takes place twenty years after XCOM lost the first war.  Yup...you read that right...you lose the first game.There's debate among friends about whether you actually lost the battles you were fighting (there is a ""bad"" ending to the first game), or if you won the missions you were playing, but the aliens snuck in a sucker-punch after the game's official ending (which is my preferred theory), but regardless, you're now fighting as what's left over as the old-guard of XCOM.  Some characters return...so, not so much.The economy of the game is very different...you deal in both supplies, alien materials, and intel.  Intel is the tricky one until you get the hang of it, but without it, you can't expand the resistance.Initially, I didn't enjoy this as much as I did the first one, but as I got deeper into the game, I grew to appreciate even more the work that the developers did.  The story is engrossing, the voice acting is excellent (I wish they had gotten the original voice for Central, but this guy still did great), and the game balance is very challenging.It took a long time for me to ""turn the corner"" on this game.  Initially, I lost a LOT of soldiers (may their pixels rest in the electrons) either through my inexperience of the game or just a balance issue that I had trouble gettng in front of.Nice addtions / changes to the game mechanics:-weapon and armor improvements are now squad upgrades...you don't have to build five or six plasma weapons...when you unlock plasma weapons, all of them are automatically upgraded.  Pretty much the same with armor and explosives.-new alien classes that build on the story from the first game.  It's clear that someone had a general story arc planned out.-outstanding DLC.  ""Shen's Last Gift"" and ""Alien Hunters"" add some amazing content to the game.  The SPARC unit from ""Shen's Last Gift"" is a nice addition, -amazing tweak of Overwatch.  You no longer have to watch in dismay as all your characters on Overwatch (essentially guard duty for the unintiated) all shoot at the same alien, which is taken out by the first shot and all the other shots are wasted.  Now, Overwatch shots are taken in sequence, allowing your squad to react and cover ambushes better-reloading your primary weapon no longer ends your turn.  If you don't intend to move, you can reload and fire in the rame turn (yay!)Things that took getting used to:-very different economy.  You just have to learn this one as you go.-different globe interface.  This isn't bad, but it's a lot more interactive than the globe in the first game.-there's a lot of NPCs demanding attention and wanting things from XCOM.  It can get overwhelming at times (which is part of the fun challenge of the game)Overall, this game shows a polish that illustrates that the developers are fans of the franchise and it was, to some degree, a ""labor of love"".I highly recommend this game.  If you haven't played the first one, pick it up also, but I recommend you play them in order.  Once you play the second one, there's some things about the game mechanics that you'll find frustrating (the second game simply has some nice things added that you'll miss going back to the first one).Two thumbs up.-HitmanHart			"

												I never preorder games, but I loved Firaxis' reboot of the XCOM series, I was excited by the concept of fighting a guerilla war against invaders who had already conquered the world, and I wanted to support good old PC gaming, so when it became available, I went ahead and preordered XCOM 2 with the Reinforcement pack. I regret that decision, I regret buying the game at all, and I will never again make the mistake of ordering a game before there are significant numbers of user reviews.The game does some things right; there are some changes from the last game that are genuine improvements, but the flaws in the game overshadow these and make playing the game a chore. For starters, there are the performance issues that still plague the game months after its release. The game has much more demanding hardware requirements than XCOM: EU, has trouble running on many systems that exceed its recommended specs, and yet, in the end, does not look significantly better than its predecessor. And what is the deal with the ridiculous load times before and after a mission? What exactly is being loaded? I could understand the load times before missions if they were being used to generate the mission map (though that's apparently not the case), but why on earth do I have to wait 5 minutes just to get back to base? I can play three or four games of XCOM:EU in the time it takes to play a single game of XCOM 2, not because the campaign is longer, but because of all the stupid load screens and unecessary delays in the gameplay.The worst flaw in the gameplay itself is the number of missions with a turn limit. The problem is not with the turn-limited missions themselves—it's not that they're too hard or unbalanced in any way—no, the problem is that there are just so many of them that they become dull. The bomb disposal missions in XCOM:EU were a welcome change of pace, and I found myself wishing there were more missions like that. In this game, however, I breathe a sigh of relief whenever i get to play a mission that doesn't have a turn limit.  The developers have stated that the turn limits were designed to speed up the pace of gameplay. In reality, they slow it down. Because each move is more important, you have to spend more REAL time scrolling around the map and carefully planning your moves and less REAL time shooting aliens and having fun.  Again, if it was only a quarter to a third of the missions that had these timers, I would love them, but when it's over 90% of missions, it just gets boring.I won't review the DLC here, but suffice it to say none of it was worth the cost.The biggest problem, though, is the constant bugs. They make it impossible to play ironman. Even with the latest patch, I've had soldiers who got stuck after opening a door, soldiers who were injured by elements they were supposed to be immune to, soldiers killed by explosions in squares they had already moved away from, mission objectives that suddenly went from full health to zero in a single turn with no one shooting at them, and many many others. Granted, not all the bugs have been in the aliens' favor: I did once have a soldier who was killed, but was still somehow able to shoot (though not move). The game has also been crashing on startup with increasing frequency. I can fix this by verifying the game cache and letting Steam download the files that fail to validate, but lately I've been having to do this every time I want to play the game. I'm writing this review now because I just unistalled the game fully intending to reinstall it and see if that fixed the problem, but now that I've removed it, I've realized that I don't really WANT to reinstall it.I preordered this game because I wanted to support PC gaming, but if this is the kind of crap we can expect from developers, maybe it would be kinder to let it die.

												Can't recommend it over the EU/EW, way too buggy and unpredictable (for example I'm on a roof of a 3 story building not even close to a ledge and somehow enemies standing on the ground outside the building can shoot me through walls and floors - plain stupid...). Also the camera during shots and such is just all over the place most of the time. Can't get excited for the ""hacking"" mechanic either. How and why the hell my soldier gets Run & Gun after a sucessful hack (just an example)? Makes little sense. Really liked the original and its expansion, this one had so much potential and yet is such a disappointing failure.			"

												Could be a fun game, if you can get over the frustration you would be getting from neverending timed missions and absurd sightline bugs. Due to these and the procedural level generation, it's very likely that you'll be handed impossibly difficult missions, where squad wipes would be more down to pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rather than poor tactical and risk-assessment decisions. I can totally see why Ironman is disabled the first time you play the game this time.They took a simple narritive and gameplay from the first game and ♥♥♥♥ed it up. None of the characters are likable, either. I personally cannot stand Tygan's ""clumsily reading from a script"" voice.XCOM1:Enemy Within is a better game.			"

												A long time fan of strategy games of both real time and turn based, I found myself rather surprised that I did not enjoy Xcom 2, and in fact found myself rather hating it. Unlike it's most previous predecessor which I enjoyed throughly, the increased random get fukd elements of this game really put it off for me. Though the game makes a lot of steps forward that I enjoyed including increased troop customization for both loadout and looks, I spent the majority of the 20 hours of playtime not really enjoying my experience, with most failures and victories feeling that they occured merely thanks to chance than any actual error or insight on my part. People who enjoy less predictability in their strategy games might rather enjoy this, and from what I understand of previous Xcom titles this is more the norm, but for me this is not the case.			"

												I rarely write reviews, and am a lover of X-Com Enemy Within so it breaks my heart (ok not that much) to write this. In its current form, this game is a bit of a let down. The gameplay, while enjoyable, brings nothing new to the series. It's the same old thing, hide, run to cover, shoot. Leave a member of your team in the open and kiss them goodbye. The graphics requirements seem low but I and others on the net have had problems. I run a GTX750 with 16gb RAM and an i7 quad core processor...I can run demanding games such as DCS and Rome 2 on ultra settings yet I seem to struggle with this game on medium. I've played with various settings and there is no improvement.I really wanted to love this game and may purchase it again if there are improvements made but right now I'm awaiting a refund.			"

												Gameplay core is mostly good, turn timers force players to think ahead but can sometimes be frustrating due to unforeseen twists. Campaign pacing leaves a lot to be desired, you spend a lot of time repeating the same types of missions and hunting avatar facilities. There is a great deal of potential missed in terms of delivering a compelling narrative and aesthetic. Art direction doesn't work with the revolutionary / seperatist theme, a weak and disorganized splinter cell of old XCOM somehow has the ability to produce factory fresh equipment just as good as the old. The music has the same heroic tone as it had in the previous game but it doesn't really work well outside of the idealistic context of a united global effort.From launch this game was a technical mess, now after several patches it still manages to run poorly on setups clearly meating recommended system specs.Mod support is very nice, many good mods are available, some that add basic features and tweaks that should've been in the game from release, as such while yes, the mods are good, the game itself should be judged without those taken into account since we pay the company, not the modders.Perhaps in a while after all DLC's have been released and some more tweaks have been applied this will be worth getting on sale, right now i'd recommend getting XCOM:EW instead.

												I have to give this game a negative review. Mainly because it's so much missed potential and some major design decisions that ruin the experience. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game, but I feel it does not deserve all the credit it's getting from official reviewers, and frankly giving this game anything higher than 7/10 just proves that they have no real grasp of game design or game mechanics.At a first glance the game looks and plays very much like the previous game, I recon this is why it's getting good reviews from a lot of reviewers who haven't really spent that much time playing. I played this on iron-man, and veteran settings because that's how I believe X-Com should be played to offer an interesting challenge. If you play it on easy settings your soldiers will have some unfair bonuses to your aim and damage.The Good:- Upgraded graphics- More events, locations, enemies, gadgets and weapons- The random map generator. (Adds some degree of replayability to the regular missions)- The mod support- Addition of ""stealth""The Bad:- Too much randomness, random events that screw up the most carefully planned mission. Events that you as a player could not have had any chance of predicting. It's just too much.- ""Unfair"" rules, say that you sneak past a group of enemies and think you were smart, think again. If you complete the main objective all enemies that have not been activated might be activated at once and rush you.- Timed missions, most missions have a timer attached forcing you to have to sprint forward in order to reach the objective in time, This in turn makes stealth tactics or any tactics for that matter pretty useless.- Enemy behaviours don't match their roles. As an example zombie aliens can move about as far as your soldiers per turn, even though they look and are animated like they should be far slower.- Lack of unique soldiers/recruits. They are so obviously randomly generated that they sort of lose their ""personality"". Lazily written descriptions where there could have been hundreds of stories for the soldiers making them seem more real.			"

												XCOM 2 is the sequel to 2012's XCOM: Enemy Unknown, developed by Firaxis Games (Civilization) and published by 2K Games. The game is the latest in a long history of infamously unforgiving XCOM games, dating right back to 1994's cult classic, UFO: Enemy Unknown. The premise for the series is that a hyper-intelligent alliance of aliens invade earth, and the player, known in the modern games as ""The Commander"", must lead a group known as Extraterrestrial Combat (X-COM) to defend the Earth. The series was rebooted in 2012 with Enemy Unknown, bringing the dated series back into the public eye and gaining newfound popularity.XCOM 2 takes place 15 years after the events of Enemy Unknown, of which the canon ending was that the player failed to defend the Earth from the alien invaders. Firaxis have said that they decided that the canon ending is failure who have now taken root on Earth as a governing body known as ADVENT, parading as something akin to prophets of the benevolent Elders, providing cures to many diseases through gene therapy and bringing a newfound unity to the human race. A sinister new ""Avatar Project"" has been discovered by the XCOM Initiative, and it's up to you to investigate and combat the threat to humanity, and hopefully liberate Earth from the Elders.The gameplay of the game is threefold: first, you have the turn-based combat. This makes up the very core of the game, and the vast majority of your time will be spent blowing aliens sky-high. The combat system is deep, and easy to come to grips to, with 5 classes for your soldiers to experiment with (6 with the Shen's Last Gift DLC). Missions vary, but all take place on procedurally generated maps. The objectives differ as well, you control your squad of up to 6 to complete goals such as stealing sensitive data, protecting a resistance camp from an alien counter-attack or recovering a VIP to gain precious intel - an important currency in the game. In addition to the combat side of the gameplay, there is  a large element of base management whereupon you build facilities with different functions, research new tech, develop upgrades for your soldiers' arms and armor, as well as decide what areas of the ""Geoscape"" to scan. Your base is a flying ship, and the Geoscape presents you with different options to explore to recover currency, new troops or investigate new leads. The third facet of gameplay is managing your emotional wellbeing. I'm still not quite over losing my favorite sharpshooter, Captain Yoko Littner.XCOM 2 is perhaps one of the best examples in the video game industry of evaluating your risk vs your reward. As a tactical game notorious for its difficulty, literally every decision you make has an impact on the game. Across the roughly 20-hour campaign, decisions you made near the start can come back to haunt you. A misplaced power relay in the base or a poorly chosen skill selection on your soldier can have serious ramifications. Perhaps the best testament to the difficulty of the series is shown in the plot of the game: Enemy Unknown's canon ending is a failure because ""everybody fails their first XCOM campaign"".Normally in strategy games, you can afford to make a mistake or two, but XCOM 2 takes no prisoners. Leaving a soldier without adequate cover can have disastrous effects: not only may your soldier be killed, but its death may send the rest of your squad into a panic, causing them to fire off randomly (possibly at your own troops!) or unusable on the next turn. Similarly, if you hold off researching new armor for even a week too long eventually the aliens' tech will begin to vastly outclass the HP bar of your soldiers, and you will find yourself being steamrolled time and time again. The difficulty takes some getting used to, and can be infuriating on your first campaign after failing your sixth mission in a row, but once the learning curve has been surpassed and the various nuances of the games tactical turn-based combat have been mastered, the game becomes a lot fairer. If The Commander makes good choices, your greatest enemy will become luck.This, however, leads me onto one of my only criticisms of XCOM 2, and generally one of my only criticisms of the entire series. Luck can be your greatest friend in this game, but mostly you will find it to be your enemy. Chance-to-hit percentages feature prominently in the combat of XCOM 2, and there is nothing worse than your soldier missing a crucial 90% chance shot, or scoring the lowest possible damage and being killed by that same enemy with 1hp left. There is a lot of discussion as to whether players simply seem to notice their failures more than their victories, but while playing the game I couldn't seem to shake the feeling that a 90% chance to hit was something closer to 60%. Similarly, ordering your soldier around a corner and activating three separate groups of enemies at once because the game generated the ""pods"" unfairly close together is equally as rage-inducing.Outside of that gripe, however, the rest of the game is an absolute gem. Visually, the game is a huge step up from the previous game, with stunning landscapes and wonderful character design. The models for the aliens are brilliant, and the character creation is incredibly pleasing, and all of your changes are realised on the battlefield. That is, until the soldier you spent an hour customising panics and shoots the soldier you spent TWO hours customising in the back of the head. Wonderful stuff.Coupled with the gorgeous graphics the game comes with a stellar soundtrack (composed by Tim Wynn), which is well worth a listen to on its own. The atmospheric music sets the tension for the game, adding a wealth of depth to any skirmish. A personal favorite of mine is called ""Lazarus"", which plays while overlooking the world map on the Geoscape. The deep bass with anxiety-inducing strings complete the wonderful package that is XCOM 2, and bring it to an all-new level of awesome.XCOM 2 also features Steam workshop support, which adds a fantastic array of community-made mods to the game, with everything from complete gameplay overhauls (a favorite of mine is a wave-based Tower Defense take on XCOM), to cosmetic upgrades and even fan-made soldier classes. With mods, the replayability is endless.In short, XCOM 2 is a fantastic game, and more than lives up to its predecessor's legend. Simply a must-have for any sci-fi or strategy nut, and will surely give them something to enjoy. It improves upon the tried-and-tested XCOM formula in every way, and I can only wait with baited breath for what Firaxis has in store for us.  I just hope they don't decide that the canon ending is my poor squad dying a horrible death and failing to complete their mission.This review was written on behalf of TeamTom's Reviews.

I'm playing vanilla versions with no mods or DLC. Usually I can reload to an older save..but Ive gotten tired of having to do that and verify the cache every single mission.The game was reported buggy on release and absolutely still is.

												Game looks like it´s great! Sadly, can´t play it for more than 1 hour without a BSOD/freeze crash.It also has severe performance issues.VSYNC is broken.In-engine cutscenes are fixed at 30 FPS.Camera ProblemsStuttering all over the place.Lowering the settings to the min, won´t fix the problem.This is a UE3 engine Game. It´s not ""new tech"". There are no excuses to sell a game in this state. Mortal Kombat X and Batman Arkham Knight are a disaster on PC as well, and the 3 games have the same engine in common. All of this problems were identified by previewers WEEKS ago, however, the final code they are selling for 60 U$D has the exact same issues.Looks like we are Beta testing this game for Firaxis/2K, when they are asking full price for it.Like I said, looks like a really great game, but don´t buy it until they fix this mess. It´s unplayable at least in my configuration.Will change to positive once they fix their game.Windows 10 x64AMD FX-8320 @ 4.6 GHzSapphire Radeon R9 290 Tri-X - Crimson 16.1.116GB RAM @ 2133MHzXCOM2 installed on SSD			"

												I'm done until they patch it, or the community mods it.Optimization is terrible. RNG is absolutely ridiculous.  90% miss.  Enemy, across the map, max damage on a full cover soldier.... yep thats working.Forced timers, both in mission, and the world event - suck. There is no strategy, only run run run.My sword has better range than an assault rifle.  Seriously. WTF.O yes, I forgot, there is no cover on the maps because the enemy can shoot through walls, rocks, pull you through those same obstacles, and poison or psi power you from several rooms away with no line of sight. However a giant Muton can hide behind a road cone, and your best sniper can't hit it (the Muton or the road cone), ever.If they fix it I'll change my review.			"

												XCOM 2 is definitely a game with a few issues, mainly in the performance department. That said Firaxis have been supporting the game and patching it to solve issues many have had. I can run the game fairly decently, and enjoy my time with it.It's also a turn based game, and while that's no excuse, a lower FPS than 60 is still playable here. The gameplay itself is a step up from it's predecessor, with you taking on the role of Guerillas rather than Soldiers. It's an interesting take on the franchise as you'll be the one making the decisions on when to attack and ambush rather than the other way around.In the first game you'd overwatch crawl your way to victory, trying to avoid activating pods in unfortunate scenarios. With Enemy Within, meld was an incentive to do more than just crawl across the map, and it worked fairly well. XCOM 2 expanded on that idea with a good chunk of missions having a timer where you'll fail the mission if you don't complete it in time. It's a bit contrived but gets the job done, however to make up for this you start most of these timed missions in concealment allowing you to pick when to engage and blow your cover.It's not a stealth game, I still have yet to complete a single mission without 'alerting' the aliens, however the stealth system does allow you to do something you had a harder time doing in the first game, ambush the enemy and pick when to engage. The gameplay itself has a lot of mods in the works, and is much easier to mod than the first game. Already there are plenty of mods that add new enemies, soldier customizations, voice lines, and map parcels (Maps in XCOM 2 are randomly generated so they get less static than the ones in the first game). There's nothing on the level of Long War for Xcom 1 yet, but the possibility is there and if the community makes the effort to create something like that, I'm sure it can be done.Is XCOM 2 a worthy successor to the first game? I'd say so. Is it a replacement for the first game? Well, the first game with no expansions I'd definitely say so. However is it a replacement for Enemy Within? No, I'd suggest anyone who's yet to try XCOM try out Enemy Within first, however I do think XCOM 2 is simply better than Enemy Within (Optimization aside). I'd put it like this, Long War for XCOM 1 has more depth than XCOM 2, however XCOM 2 is far superior to Enemy Within and Enemy Unknown. I'd also argue that XCOM 2 is an easier game on the harder difficulties, however mods already exist that can tweak the game to be harder or easier to whiatever suits you. Whether it's worth the price of admission is up to you, but with Steam refunds being a thing I'd certainly suggest trying it and giving it a shot, especially if you're a fan of the first game. If strategy games with a bit of chance are your thing, then XCOM 2 and it's tense engagements will certainly be for you.Edit: I've read a few negative reviews and most focus on the timed missions and Strategic side of the game. Here's the thing, the timers prevent you from simply crawling up the map without taking many calculated risks. If you dislike the timers you can edit them in LTX files or download mods from the workshop that elongate or remove them.As for the Strategy side, many were complaining that they didn't have enough time to do everything available there before getting into a mission. That's the point, with Advent controlling the world you'll have to make decisions about where you dedicate your resources. You'll usually be able to get one of the 'resource blips' before a mission, but not all of them. It's about choosing which one you think is more important to you, going for it, and then doing the mission. What's nice about XCOM 2 is that failing a mission or skipping a mission isn't a death sentence like it was in the first game. Yes on higher difficulties missing early missions can be terrible, however there are ways to get around this. Missions simply aren't as impactful, they're still important...But you have ways of getting around the cost of failure.You may have failed a mission and lost a Veteran soldier, but you now have ways of acquiring new soldiers for resources you have. Managing your resources is an important part of the strategic side as I mentioned, and they're much more important in XCOM 2 than the first game. Not only can you get new soldiers but you can get Scientists and Engineers as well, though it's important to remember you'd miss out on other things such as making new contacts, or getting some weapon upgrades. You can even spend resources to rush some research or building if that's what you'd like to try doing.The types of strategies you can emply thanks to these extra systems are just another bit of depth outside the Tactical game. So yes you won't be able to get everything available on the world map, you'll have to pick and choose. The thing is, you have much more to do resource wise, and many more decisions to make that add depth to the game. Also important not to forget, thanks to how easy it is to modify the game and how open the devs have been with this, you can change things such as timers or how long collecting resources takes yourself or by looking around on the workshop. Hope this helps clear a few things up and spread some light on a few issues I've seen people have.			"

												The Game uses turn timers to artificially increase difficulty Leaving the only strategy to rush. You can remove the turn timers with a mod but you can tell how much the game was built around this runing into groups of only two enemies it one sight.It sad really, because the game play is much better then the last game. Maybe mods will fix it but not anytime soon.			"

												The brutal timers take all the fun out of this game and remove any pretense of it being about tactics.  My guess is that there's probably only one ""right"" way to beat each mission and success depends on the player's persistence in trying every possibility until the correct approach is discovered.In any case, even at normal difficulty, the combination of the timers and large numbers of enemies make even the early missions extremely difficult and not challenging in a fun way.I've requested a refund.  I may come back to the game at some point if the designers change up the game  mechanics.Edit - One thing I will say for the game is that it runs pretty well on my 2 year old Macbook Pro.  The OSX port seems to have been done really well.			"

												I loved the last XCOM game to bits and XCOM 2 was supposed to be an improvement in every aspect. Instead, it's the most frustrating game I've played in recent years. Unless you play games for a living, playing XCOM 2 for maybe an hour every day will lead to nothing but frustration and resentment. Why? Because even on normal difficulty the odds are stacked against you at all times, to the point where it becomes grueling. Once you're a couple of hours into the game you will have to scum save every move in order to make it through the mission by reloading it 15 times. There is not a single mission where the balance is not one step away from being completely out of whack. Move one tile too far and you will aggro another - previously invisible - enemy squad that can tear your group apart in a single turn.  With the over-abundance of escalating missions and the timing constraints added as a new ‘feature', strategic depth is simply AWOL in this game. Only rarely are you given the time to set up your units or prepare an ambush. If you don’t like trial & error games where missions randomly go south, you should avoid this game.On the plus side, the graphics are much better (albeit laggy most of the time) and the controls have been improved a lot.

												First off I want to preface that my review is based on ""what you pay for, and what you get in return."" Secondly, I realize I'm going to get flak for this so if you are a die hard fan of Firaxis or the XCOM series you can stop reading now because I doubt this review is for you. This review is for people who want to know if the money they spend is going to be returned. That being said, I flat out cannot recommend XCOM2 right now. I know a lot of people have mentioned bugs and poor optimization. I personally run the game on ultra, haven't seen anything exceptionally bad except for frame rate issues when a mission is loading. So my gripe isn't because of it being poorly optimized. My problem with XCOM2 is game play, or lack there of. First, it is the real lack of character customization with the base game, sure you could pay $5 for the anarchy's children pack which adds a little more to the game but even then it's not really worth it. Secondly, where you do have some armor choices, the tactical advantage conferred by those armors is either overlapped by other armors in various ways or not something worth utilizing a lot of the time. Third, the missions very quickly begin to feel repetitious, the environments all feel the same, the goals very often are the same and the enemy variations and tactics don't really call for major squad changes for most missions. In fact my third gripe is the one that really killed the game for me because XCOM2 got so repetitious so quickly I very quickly lost interest after feeling I had seen all the game had to offer. Now it's not all negatives, between XCOM and XCOM2 the tactical turn based strategy hasn't changed all that much. There are a variety of powers and weapons you can bring onto the battlefield to help give you an advantage, along with class specification getting some nice new additions (like the gremlin which I really enjoyed). During XCOM2 there is this AVATAR project timer that is supposed to give added pressure and force you into making decisions at times rather than waiting for when your squad is optimally prepared for the mission. However, this isn't a problem,  and I find this change acceptable given the story.In conclusion, I really wanted to love XCOM2, I really enjoyed Enemy Unknown and was so hyped to see a sequel to a game I enjoyed so much. So in some ways this is my disappointment talking, XCOM2 feels very unimaginative and doesn't bring anything new and necessary to the series. So for this reason I suggest if you love the series either wait for a sale, or wait and see if there is a DLC release that really opens the game play up (not just a rehash of the previous game please).

												XCOM 2 is the sequel to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  I played over 1000 hours of the first game, including on my Android device, and it was my favourite game of all time... until now.  If you're looking for negatives, scroll to the bottom.  Otherwise, I'm going to discuss all the things about this game that make it better than its predecessor.  (Other than the procedurally generated maps; the feature I was most excited about before the game launched.  The maps feel handcrafted and still provide near endless variation.)XCOM 2 is a genuine sequel, not a polished re-skin with a few new buttons.  This game is a sequel in terms of story, your opponents, and even the difficulty level.  For that reason, if you haven't played XCOM: EU, I recommend you begin there.  Despite my experience with the previous game, XCOM 2 destroyed me on my first attempt, at the difficulty level I played most on EU.  I'm thrilled about that because fans like myself can experience the challenge, the rush, the highs and lows of the war, and those moments when everything's so intense that your heart pounds but you keep on playing!The story and the characters in the campaign have been improved immensely.  The tutorial introduces you to them, and the setting, through a series of story missions that'll make you feel connected to them in a way you never did in XCOM: EU.  As the story goes on, the connection you feel to each character continues to develop, and the story might stay with you for a long time.  In addition, the ending is much more thrilling and rewarding than the end of XCOM: EU--however, this game makes that somewhat disappointing ending into a spectacular one, and then goes on to give you an even better ending in XCOM 2!The strategy layer of the game has been significantly enhanced in XCOM 2 as well.  In the past you could do research and construction however you wanted, but that isn't the case in XCOM 2.  No more watching the hologlobe spin while you pass time at the base either--now the Geoscape is like a board game.  Your decisions on the strategic layer have a major impact on the way the game plays out, and the aliens are also playing their own game against you.  You'll need to adjust your strategy on the fly to counter the aliens' projects and prevent their victory.Additionally, the tactical gameplay is better than ever--and that's where XCOM has always been strongest.  Many games try to copy the tactical combat of XCOM, and you might hear games described as ""like XCOM.""  I assure you that having two actions per soldier per turn, and a cover mechanic, DOES NOT qualify a game to be declared ""like XCOM.""  The number of enemies and their combat abilities, combined with psychological effects your soldiers can suffer, really sets this game apart from imitators.  In XCOM 2, you're fighting to liberate the world from an occupying collective of aliens that has superior technology, and many missions will feel impossible--even with fully trained troops, using the best gear.Last but not least, the audio in this game is phenomenal!  The cinematic scenes and sound effects are as good as a blockbuster action movie.  The voice acting is impressive, and the dialogue feels natural.  The music enhances every moment of the game; from ramping up the tension in the most threatening combat situations, to relaxing you after a hard-fought battle.Negatives:1.  XCOM 2 has some bugs and performance issues at launch, but keeping regular saves and back-up saves will prevent some frustrating issues.  I had one crash during my first 65 hours of play, and the save file got corrupted.  I do not recommend playing in Ironman mode until the game is patched.2.  Some people don't like the pressure of turn timers on some missions.  I love the timers because the tension is part of what makes XCOM 2 special, but not everyone wants to play a game that requires skill.  Don't worry, however, as there's already a mod to take away the timer if you just can't play the game as it was intended to be played.3.  It will probably be several years before XCOM 3 comes out.

												A strong 2nd effort in reimagining the Xcom series.  They came up with new mechanics that added something to the decision making, specifically the replacement of the pointless interceptor piece w/ a campaign map you fight to recapture from the aliens.  Coupled with time pressure both on the campaign map and on missions (which love it or hate it does change the game dynamic) and you'e got a new take on a familiar turn based game that adds purpose and context to the missions by providing a larger picture objective.  I really liked taking back control of what I was doing at the strategic level, in the last one (which I still loved) firing up satellites was the entire extent of the strategy invovled in the campaign level.The one reservation I have is with the DLC which was uniformly underwhelming and not even close to the the DLC Enemy Within from the 1st one.  This time Firaxis phoned it in with cosmetics and DLC that only made the game harder not more interesting.Base game: big thumbs up, DLC thumbs down			"

												Despite my rig being waaaaaay above minimum spec for this game, I am barely able to get much more than 10-15fps on anything but the lowest and crappiest looking settings. It's ugly and more or less unplayable. A little googling revealed that this is a known issue and that many others suffer from sucky framerate and lag, no matter what the pc. The official support response is generic and useless to say the least. The game is poorly poorly optimized. All in all, a total waste of money on my part. I am also sick and tired of Steam allowing game developers/companies to severely understate the minimum requirements for their games just so they can reach a broader market and make more sales to people who would be put off by any HONEST approximation of a games requirements. I believe that to be the case here. This game is not even in a releasable state in my opinion. Corporate greed and corner cutting to capitalize on the success of the previous titles. Shame on them.

												I can't recommend it. All the right ingredients are there, and it should be the best XCOM game ever made according to the sum of its features.Yet the restrictive turn counters that appear in most missions utterly ruin the game, and indeed go against what has always been XCOMs central concept. No longer do you carefully plan your way to victory, but instead find yourself scrambling to rush to an objective completely arbitrarily. Apart from anything else, it simply restricts the way you can play a mission. In the past, if people wanted to rush an objective, that was one of many possible strategies. Now, in most missions, it is the only possible strategy.The problem is only exarcebated because most of the maps are randomised, meaning there is no guarantee an objective is even completeable in the time allowed. When your entire squad can be wiped out on failure of certain mission types, this becomes a simply inexcusable and frankly game ruining design feature.In all other aspects this is a truly fantastic game, and those 1 out of 10 missions where there are no timers can be incredibly gripping. But knowing that a potentially game ending mission (through no fault of my own) could be just around the corner makes it increasingly difficult for me to play this.			"

												A very shaky launch for this one.  Performance is pathetic.  In 2016 we have to talk about ""optimization""?  This is why people play consoles.  Mission timers on every mission.  You'll have between 6-8 turns to get across the map and do something.  Squad wipes are very common as you rush forward into danger.  If you werent a save-scummer in the previous XCOM, you will be with this one.  If the timer runs out, you lose the mission and your squad.  So, the combination of poorly crafted code resulting in choppy performance on top-tier systems and the dubious design decision to make every mission on a timer is not worth full price right now.  Wait for a substantial sale or at least a patch from Firaxis.   "

												-Review may change-I can recommend this game if all the issues are fixed, BUT right now, AT THIS CURRENT TIME, if i were you, i would wait until the bugs, imbalances and core problems are fixed, because right now it makes the game barely functional. Take note that my review is from only having played the very old Xcom games, and not any of the recent titles. (im a bit of an oldie gamer). A lot of people are saying the same thing, the cons outweigh the pros.-=PROS:=-A) The Overwatch system is a great new addition to the game, the ability to setup an ambush from stealth is a great way to open a fight, however..it comes with its own problems (See Cons 'A')B) The graphics, music and voice acting are all amazing here apart from 'The Council's voice...never liked that movie-voice dude, its a bit too over-the-top > to > just plain annoying, TALK PROPERLY DAMMIT.C) I love how you can customize your characters and even import/export your friends characters to the game, making every soldier in this game someone you care about, and not just another worthless grunt. You CARE about your teammembers.D) I love how destructible the maps are.-=CONS:=-A) Unfair Enemy advantages, leading to poor balance where 'save-scumming' is the only way to win (repeatedly saving again and again until there is actually a possible way to win or proceed. See below:a1) Enemies have a free movement action DURING YOUR TURN when discovered rather than at the end of your turn, meaning your overwatch ambush from stealth, (which hasnt yet been finished being setup), isnt allowed to be finished during your turn because the free movement action allows your enemies to run away or take cover before you have applied Overwatch to your teammembers. This is highly unfair when NOT discovered. This almost removes the fact that it is a turn-based game, when your enemies are breaking the most basic rule of a turn-based game. If they can move during your turn, as they are now, it makes completing missions almost impossible in a high number of missions because YOU dont have the advantage of moving however the f### you please when its not your turn.a2) Enemies are given an unfair amount of action points which seems to change repeatedly. For example, (and you'll know what i mean if you have played) Players are limited to 2 action points, enemies however seem to breach this. I had a Viper who MOVED, TONGUE-PULLED, COILED, and ACID SPIT the rest of the team all in the same turn, turning my winning game, into a lost one, in a single turn that was not possible to defend against. Another example are Stun Baton soldiers, who are given 2 Running actions, and are still allowed to attack, which leads to another gamebreaking problem:a3) Most Enemies are all given very unfair 'INSTANT KILL' and 'INSTANT INCAPACITATE' abilities, which are able to be carried out from absurd distances. 1: Viper Tonguepull into coils from 8 spaces away, through 5 'Full Cover' walls (another bug/exploit). 2: Mindcontrol from 12 spaces away (meaning your team has to make a suicide run up to the controller to stop it, meaning, you're screwed 3: Stun Baton from over 10 spaces away -.-, the list of Instant-Kill abilities just goes on, which are super unfair considering my next point:a4) Your team size is limited to between 4-6, you can end up in fights against 20 aliens at the same time...meaning they get far more turns to kill you, and most aliens (see a3) can choose, whenever they feel like, to instantly kill your whole team in a way you cannot defend against, with no counter especially early-to-mid game, way before their turn is even over. Xcom original let you take way more soldiers and even tanks into the battlefield, why are we limited to such a small team size? And dont give me that 'Graphical limitation' bullcrap, Xcom ran tonnes of soldiers and aliens at the same time on the Commador Amiga, back in 1994.a5) Cover and Aim, is bugged and broken. Cover doesnt do anything right now, everyone just shoots you or instant-kills you THROUGH it. You can be in an aliens face with a shotgun, whilst flanking, from behind with a 95% chance to hit (why the hell isnt it 100%) and that 95% shot will ACTUALLY miss 50% of the time. Now i know Xcom is about RNG, im a very experience player of these types of game, but the Aim RNG is actually BROKEN. The % shown to you is not actually the correct %. Many many more players are confirming the same bug. You can actually shoot enemies, and they can shoot you, through Solid Rock, and multiple thick layers of alien metal and still hit you for full damage....wtf is going on here, FIX THIS FIRAXIS.a6) Some missions are so hard, that you can die on your very first turn, wth NO way to survive it, and given no control whatsoever to prevent it. I started a mission to protect a village from attack, (early game too) and had 2 heavy armor units, 3 special health-regen enemies, 2 mind control units, and 5 Advent soldiers who had all started, spawned right in front of my face at the beginning of the mission....they of course Instantly got a Free Movement Action during MY TURN DAMMIT, and then once i told them to take cover it didnt matter..the mission was impossible, and was Instant-death from the moment i came out of the Mission Start screen -.- this is BROKEN. Holy crap i think im done with point A.B) There's no time to do anything in the world. The moment you want to collect a resource, 10 major disasters will happen the moment you want to attempt to get some basic income going, even at the beginning of the game, collecting basic Starter resources gets you screwed over. These disasters and events seriously need reducing in frequency. If you dont do them, the penalties are so harshe theyre too easy to ruin the rest of your game right from the beginning! It's too much of a rush.C) When you do the final misison (no spoilers of course) the game is just OVER. No more freeroaming no more 'confront alien invaders' its just THE END. You cannot continue playing......WTF Firaxis. This needs to change, once the story mode is over, random alien attacks, missions and enemy ships should still be happening, like the good old days of Xcom where the game mode is Infinitely long and you can continue playing to your hearts content.D) No Skyranger VS UFO Ship  battles and downed-ship invasions to recover parts like the good days of Xcom (how Xcom was supposed to be played), if you run into a UFO, the game just goes ""You have instantly lost, defend your ship"" or in other words, GAME OVER, lets just drag out your slow death by rubbing it in your face for the next hour.E) The Avatar Project timer which limits everything you do to a GAME OVER timer, ruins the game for me, seriously just remove it entirely and go back to the classic Endless Mode of the 90's. I dont want the duration of my game to be limited and then END when its the end of the game...it makes all my efforts feel pointless, because The End means you cant play anymore.F) No friendly fire means you can shoot a minigun at an enemy who is engaged in melee with several other squadmates with no penalties or chance of them being hit. This is just WRONG and senseless when you watch a cutscene of 100 bullets go literally through your allies to hit an enemy, friendly fire needs to return.-and many many more issues.HOWEVER....all is not lost here. The game feels amazing to play, this review could easily change to RECOMMEND if Firaxis does the following:1) Fix the bugs, many of them are gamebreakers.2) Work HARD on balance, because you have a LOT OF WORK to do here.3) Allow greater squad sizes +Tank/Heavy Armor like the good days of Xcom. This game is a downgrade from the 1994 systems, and those fit onto a 2.4mb floppy disk -.-4) Bring back ENDLESS MODE, no Xcom veteren wants the fight againstthe alien to just 'end'. -.-5) Bring back SHIP - VS - SHIP battles			"

												Awesome addition to the XCOM games! Quick rundown:+ Graphics look good & unit customization is great+ Solder pool allows you to save favorite looking solders, or import other people's solders. One from the pool may show up in game as a solder, engineer that has to be rescused, or even an enemy informant you need to kidnap or kill!+ Maps look great, and are all of a good size, as well as variety+ Enemies are varied, with more types than before. Aliens are actually a threat!+ Tons of different items for solders to use (various granades, ammo types, gun mods)+ Turn based missions make overwatch turtling an impossible strategy, which was pretty much the I-Win-Button for XCOM EU/EW. Also adds a sense of urgency.+ Ranged heals+ New classes are well designed and have some neat perks- Some performance issues. Sometimes there's a 5 - 10 second pause at the start of the enemy turn. Sometimes on the enemy turn the screen will go black. Sometimes FPS tanks for no discernible reason.- Navigating multi-floored buildings just as much of a pain as XCOM:EU/EW- While I find the time limit missions (which seem to be about 50% of them) fine, I think extending the timer by two turns on a mission would help out the casual XCOM players.- Russian & Polish languages missing. These were added in Enemy Within (along with localization), and should have remained. Even if Firaxis didn't localise there for XCOM 2, I'm sure a copy/paste of sound files from EW would have pleased those overseas. Though I am of neither nationality, I did like my Russian & Polish solders speaking their language, and hope this is implemented in the future.			"

												I am overall disappointed with the game, being an XCOM enthusiast. I've played XCOM1 for 255 hours, but I do not feel like giving XCOM2 more than the 55ish hours I gave it so farXCOM2 follows the same pattern the previous games did: start with rookies, study alien tech, build some armors and weapons, learn psionics, find a way to the aliens' base and destroy it, and have your base attacked at least once in the process. There's even pretty much the same tech development - assault rifles into magnetic guns (laser guns) and then plasma. Only 3 armor tech levels too. Sure, there are modifications and some fancy variations of weapons and armors, but that's still underwhelming. This is hardly an improvement on XCOM1:EW. I expected XCOM2 to be much more developed than EW, but it's merely on par. It's not even longer than XCOM1.The final mission is also an insult to the player. I don't want to spoil the surprise here, but it was not just difficult, the designers made it simply unfair. I was about to prevail against the odds, when the crucial enemy I needed to kill teleported away to the other end of the gigantic map leaving me sorrounded by a dozen enemies. The game is a bit glitchy and unstable - hopefully there will be patches in the future to fix that. Fortunately, not everything is gamebreaking, but I had to restart the game and steam several times in my playthrough. Frozen cutscenes, cutscenes displayed more than once, disappearing/stuttering/looped audio. Currently, it is not worth its full price - I recommend waiting for discounts. What is perhaps the most puzzling is the poor design of gameplay. Sometimes I would roar in frustration because I had to listen to the same dialogues over and over again after restarting a mission and there was no way to skip it - the apogeum of frustration are the terror missions. The game still hijacks the camera away from you (I think I know better what I want to look at, thanks). Also, does the cam really have to center on the soldier I switch to every time? Lots of your time will be wasted for no reason at all (I recommend getting some mods to fix that - they don't change any balance, such as Quiet Bradford) because apparently you need full 10-15 seconds to be told that there has been progress on the Avatar project. There are several improvements though: waypoint soldier movement, reloading does not end the turn anymore, more class balance, diversified enemies, diversified terrain, soldier customization, simplified base build-up, melee attacks (finally!!!). I might have forgotten some things, but they certainly do not change my opinion of the game.			"

												Jeez, I really like XCOM, however, at the moment it is difficult to recommend.In a lot of ways this sequel is a move in the right direction. The game makes you feel pressured and you often have to decide on the best of two bad options. The field game is a lot more in depth and plays a lot more like old school X-Com. that said there are a lot of problems. Some of this stuff can be fixed with patches, however, on some level the game is just fundamentally flawed.It's hard, and I'm fine with that, XCOM should be hard, though I feel a lot of the time it's hard in the wrong ways. The missions often have time limits, and that's okay in itself but combine that with the way aliens enter the fight (they become active in packs of 2-3 as soon as one of your soldiers spots one of the pack, at which point they get a free move to cover) means that it is never smart to push out more than a few spaces a turn. If you discover a pack with your penultimate or last move of a round, 2-3 strong aliens get a free move to cover (or, even worse flank you) and then have a whole round to take down a couple of guys.The game pushes you forward with time limits and then punishes you for moving forward at even a moderate rate.Also, a lot of people seem to feel melee is OP, I'm not sure I'd agree with that, but I don't think it feels very good. If you run up and take a sword swipe at something and miss, that soldier is probably dead.The geoscape gameplay is not very well explained either, I'd advise treating your first game as a throwaway until you get the hang of how that works.Lastly, this game is really badly optimised, lots and lots of slowdowns, the game hanging for 5-10 seconds. Lots of gaps in the action, you'll throw a grenade, and there is significant gaps between the grenade being thrown, exploding, damage being dealt and the next action taking place.This game does have a lot of potential, but I don't think they can change the gameplay enough with patches to really make the gameplay coherent, the mechanics complementary and the difficulty.tough but fair.

												This is a rantLong version: new vs old gameWith mods this game is pretty good considering only 1 of the DLC's (Shen's Gift) is any good. if only they would add secondwave options, and somehow get the enemy within stuff with a third faction and gene mods while increasing the turns allowed in turn attack missions. The soldiers and abilities in this game are not as strong as in the old game (dont listen to totalbiscut) while the enemies are much stronger. they have removed key things in this game, such as proper base building like in the first one, Rockets are gon unless you use a heavy or power weapon with the powered armor. snapshot for snipers is gone (but they do start off with squad sight(and mods bring back snapshot)) SHIV's are gone (though they really werent vital in anyway) they completely removed air combat and medals are gone too. you dont even need to get psi troops to finish the game. this game is more cinamatic then the old one, more story driven. bradford gets facial hair and is much more annoying in this game. Terror missions are harder because you must save atleast 6/14 people or fail. the maps are much more diverse. and the game is buggy (say if you want a soldier to move right there behind cover the game might make a snap second option to send them right into the middle of an enemy group out of spite, because you are doing well)short version: new game vs old oneweapons-weakerabilities-weaker or equal toenemies-strongergameplay options-way lessDLC-3 of 4 are badMods-INSANELY AWESOME THERE ARE SO MANY!!!!!!!(they make up for the lack luster dlc)how attached can you get to a soldier?-Very. you can write their own epitaphcustomization- A LOTvoices-missing a few different countries but mods can bring you voices like deadpool, Lara Croft, Lana Kane, Homer, or even Duke Nukem , Ripely, Freemans Mind and much more.bugs-commonsecondwave - Nomedals - Nonot considering mods XCOM EW has much much more then this game content and gamplaywise.

												Fun, brutal, and oh so unforgiving. This is truly what a sequel should be, improving on the bad, making the good better, adding some new features, and taking away anything unecessary. This game feels exactly like the original (the one in 2011) and former Xcom players will have no problems jumping in. Likewise, newcomers will find this game to be a bit harsh at first if they don't know what they're doing or if they don't know what the best strategy is, though there are lots of guides to help with that. To me though, the hardest part definitely comes in management. The Avatar Project, or the main thing you're fighting, can only be slown down by certain operations, it's no longer the take your time that we're used to in EW, but it still can feel a lot like it the further in the game you go. On a similar note, combat has been revamped and with all the other people talking about concealment and timed missions, I won't go into it, though I will say I like both. Another good thing is the multitude of ways to finish missions. In EW it was straight up kill all enemies or rescue certain amount of civs then kill all enemies. Now, there are missions such as hostage rescue, comm defense, comm destruction, vip capturing, and even detonating bases. The way they all function is great as well, they have multiple ways of finishing them, you can either go in guns blazing with a full squad, or use a lone soldier to capture an objective and then high tale it out without killing anyone. In general, it's a fun game and a great way to feel mad after seeing your rookies constantly mess up. 9/10			"

												Wait until it gets a patch to fix the performance issues. Then by all means buy the game.The only thing i will say is that the timers suck soooooo hard. There is a mod in the workshop that disables the timers (DOWNLOAD IT NOW!)Also the overall story that you need to keep up with pushes you too fast.Game: Come over here and do thisMe: I'll get there later i want to do this firstGame: No Me: I won't take long, just let plan some things get some upgrades etc...Game: COME OVER HERE NOW ALL EVERYONE DIESMe: ...The game makes you feel rushed. Hopefully there will be a fix for this aswell. Or at least a mod.The game is an improvment over the last (still not better than the original) but it is good. There are teething problems so unless you are prepared to be a beta tester, (seems to be the case with all day one releases these days) hold off for awhile.Great game but still not ready.			"

												It seems I may be having graphical issues that are not common (Edit: OK, since a few hours after I wrote this review there are literally hundreds of other people complaining about the same issues, well, I guess they are common after all) but, even after updating my graphic card drivers, verifying the local cache, and trying multiple other fixes that had worked for people with older games I was unable to fix an issue with flickering/choppy shadows and intermittent frame rate drops. I was really looking forward to this game but at the moment I find it to be unplayable. I will add that 2K staff got back to me fairly quickly (about 10 hours, which to be fair, the day after release on a buggy game, is damn quick) and suggested reinstalling DirectX, Vcredist, and Microsoft .NET but I was unable to verify if these suggestions work since by then I had already returned the game and asked for a refund.Added to that multiple people have mentioned the fact that almost every mission involves turn timers (I can not personally verify this since I was never able to make it past the first mission thanks to my graphics problems) which would have been enough for me to request a refund anyway.At the moment, I really can't recommend this game. Especially not when compared to XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within which is one of my all time favorite games.			"

												Before anyone reads this, this is a literal review i am not angry i am not ""butthurt"". I'm going to stay true facts that many others have come across and myself as well.The games RNG has only gotten worse from the last game, simple as that.Most missions you will lose most of your squad or your entire squad.The only way to do much of anything in this game is to be a ""save scum"" and reload till things go your way.This is nowhere near what the community hoped for in a Xcom game since honestly? Its just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game literally,It's like the Developers thought hm? Nothings really wrong with the game(nothing was) So lets make a sequel exact same game, just a few different things and lets up the difficulty scale by 100.It's kind of ridicoulous of much time i have to spent on one mission, I spent up to 3 hours per mission and lose my entire squad. No i am not one of those people who are oblivious to everything and fail at gaming no i am sadly a veteran nerd at gaming specially turn based games like these. I've been following Xcom game series for my entire life i love them to bits. But this?

That shot is predetermined. There is no RNG in this it's just a masochist game for junkies. Sadly i'm a dedicated gamer so i will continue to try to make this game work for me or wait till there is mods that will actually do something about this unbelievable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And i am prepared to face the amount of fanboys who will come to this games rescue but fun fact, I've already made 10 people run away crying with the kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥i can say against this game. I do love it, but its also complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, a waste of time and money. There are very few cons to this game which are outweighed by literally everything about this game.You will see top reviews about (don't listen to the people who just point out a few cons) Yea no thats just another fanboy trying to get you to support this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game. Difficulty is annoying, the ""RNG"" is pathetic. There is also many smaller details i can gladly give anyone who is willing to listen and not waste 60 dollars on this failure of a Xcom game. Sadly my review won't do♥♥♥♥♥♥ i doubt anyone will see it but i hope someone does, i hope this spreads cause i'm tired of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games getting rep for being good.

												I've been on the fence about whether I should review this or not for a while: I'm going to open with that slightly cheeky statement ""I wish there were a neutral button.""But, I really do. The reason I've gone with ""Not Recommended"" is because, frankly, for me it didn't do enough better than EU - and it actually makes several aspects of the gameplay worse. There's still a lot to like, though, and I think if you read all the Steam reviews and on balance think you wouldn't care about the negative aspects people have noted, then I would say it's worth a punt because a lot of people genuinely seem to love this game (especially professional game reviewers) ... which makes me wonder whether maybe I'm just bad at it. The game has clearly been lovingly made, as well - and for what it's worth I didn't experience many bugs at all really (GTX 970, Ivy Bridge i5 unlocked). If anything I had a less buggy run than I did with EU. There seem to be plenty of people on Steam listing the game's flaws (as I perceive them) in great detail and I don't think another such review is needed: in short, the various timers spoil things too much and the game is, frankly, just too difficult too much of the time. I saw a guy on here saying that he ""plays games to relax"" and complaining that ""XCOM 2 was too stressful"", and I kind of agree with that from my own personal perspective; but the real problem for me is the fact that the game doesn't actually really handle the stressful aspects very well... Constantly being badgered by Central on the map and basically everybody else makes much of the experience feel like busywork rather than a rewarding, fair, and appropriately challenging one. And on the battlefield, simple mistakes (honestly in my case sometimes because of the UI being so sensitive), resulted in devastating consequences for my outfit. This basically forced me to save scum even when I didn't want to, since it seemed like the game was trying so hard to stop me from doing that. Which, I guess you could say, is incongruous.  So, I reluctantly give this game a thumbs down. Rarely have I seen such a big dichotomy between ""average player"" reviews and ""professional"" reviews, which is quite interesting in itself and that's what led me to want to write this ... but I feel like maybe someone might read this review alongside the others and think twice about spending what might be quite hard-earned cash on this and get something else they've been looking forward to playing, instead. With refunds I guess that's less of an issue nowadays. Anyway, like I said, people obviously really cared making this game: it's just that I don't think the design choices the developers went with to try to make this a unique experience that stands out from its predecessor make all that much sense.

Maybe then they will get a thumbs up.			"

												I tried reallly hard to like this game. But I failed. Most of the gameplay is all about RNG, which is uttelry infuriating. Seeing how your Sniper Guy misses an easy shot with 90% hit chance, which causes a chain of events that kills half of your team is just.. not enjoyable.I also despise the fact, that those ""rulers"" can appear on ANY mission - even the ones which have a restricted amount of turns  AND are crucial to the outcome of the ""Avatar"" Project (practically a ""you-lose-no-matter-what-event"", that has a countdown over the whole game process (who thought this was a fun game design???)) until you automatically lose the battle. So either you can decide between sacrificing your soldiers and completing the mission, or play safe and maybe still lose some soldiers and also the mission. Even if you are a cheap cheat and use save files to reload your game, you still might not be able to win.. sooo.. yeah, that't that.The missions feel kind of repetitive after a while, except for the ""ruler"" events (they ♥♥♥♥ you up most likely and make you want to uninstall the game)			"

												I just can't recommend this game. I'm a long term fan of the franchise with 100+ hours in EU. XCOM2 just fights me at every turn. It's more frustrating than fun. The difficulty seems moreso frontloaded than XCOM is known for, so I'm not entirely sure this game is for newcomers to the franchise either.I sat back and asked myself, was I having fun playing this game? Not much fun to be had in getting punished for playing honestly without reloading in the form of post-combat debuffs (gravely wounded for 5/7 hp? sure, thanks for that). XCOM2 feels like it just devolves into reloading the last save (which takes a bit) until you get the desired result.I usually enjoy difficulty and challenge (granted this example is cross-genre, but Bloodborne is one of my top 5 favorite titles of all time) but XCOM2 feels contrived and frustrating. I don't get any satisfaction after overcoming a level, instead I found myself breathing a sigh of relief that I was just done with the mission.I'm sure there's fun to be had here; it's just not for me.

												Timers have never ever been considered fun in any game. At least not like in this game, where you are fighting against time on the macro scale and in the micro scale (almost every single mission is on a timer). I dont play games for the hectic feeling of stress, I play to relax and have fun. And this just feels like hectic work, rush the objective and throw grand strategy out the window. Nope, nope, nope. Not me. Not going to play until I get an option to turn this off or reduce timers by 80-90%. Other people might find it fun to be under pressure and stress, I don't.			"

												I loved the original XCom game and had great fun with it.With 2... not fun at all.  The forced timer on almost all missions means you have to run your troops at full speed to even get close to accomplishing it.  12 turns before the ""intercepters"" chase your transport off.  And it takes you running full speed for 6 turns to get there.  Drop a couple alien squads in the way with your troops missing at 80-90% hit chance combined with trying to defuse bombs/rescuce people and you have a failed mission and a dead/abandoned squad.If they added even 3 more turns it would be a nice balance, but with all the missions having barely enough turns to finish (and you will lose 1-3 people each time) makes this not fun to play at all.

												This game has been out for over a year now but there are still major bugs that remain unfixed. The latest of which, after over 150 hours of gameplay has made the main menu screen for the game unusable, ie I can no longer load, or start a game, or change any options as I'm getting <1 frame per minute and none of the on-screen buttons work (I used to get 40-50fps in game). I've tried multiple ""community"" fixes (there's no actual publisher support to speak of), deleting and reinstalling, verifying integrity of game files, deleting .ini files, uninstalling all mods etc etc.Lots of people seem to have no issues (apart for well known bugs, like enemies shooting through walls with no LOS) running the game, but it seems like if you do, you're on your own.If this most recent bug ever gets fixed and I can once again play the game, I'll return and update this review.

												I wanted to like this game, as I really enjoyed the previous XCOM titles. But this game is fundamentally unfinished. My computer meets specs and runs better looking, more complicated games much smoother than this. It's slow, janky and frequently glitchy. The RNG dictating hit chances is also inaccurate and frustrating, more so than than in Enemy Unknown (though maybe not and my judgement is clouded due to other frustrations with the game). I would not recommend this game until Firaxis actually finish it, otherwise you'll get more frustration than enjoyment out of this. Unless you have a beast rig.			"

												This is a poor excuse for a tactical game.  Strategic elements are entertaining and interesting.  I find it challenging that attempting to gather resources may cost you in the long run because it forces you to choose between gathering or accomplishing missions rather than being able to achieve both.  In terms of tactical combat, this is a terrible game.  The cover system is horribly flawed.  Elevation plays no impact in the game whatsoever.  Having a good angle on an opponent means nothing if their plane of cover is between you and your target.  Fog of war prevents you from being able to make rational ambushes more than once per mission.  It's as though the game is designed around quick saving because they can't come up with a more creative engine, just nerf certain aspects such as overwatch.  Honestly had way more fun with the Front Mission series.  It's not that I expected this game to be that series, it's that it doesn't offer anything more than it.  A good tactical game should allow you to recover from an initial mistake if you play your cards right, not heavily punish you for scouting fog of war.  If you're going to make it so enemies can instantly discover me behind cover, you may as well make them all aware of my presence after the first ambush.			"

												EDIT: Comments and further research have shown that whether or not the game runs fluently has less to do with the power of your PC but hardware lottery. Some people with terrible machines have it run just fine, while others with beastly monstrosities have experienced all sorts of issues. There seem to be a lot more people with problems than without, so you may not even be able to have this game run fluently if you do have a supercomputer.ATTENTION: If you work at NASA or have access to the computing power of IBM's WATSON, you will find this to be a fantastic game. Otherwise, you will have big problems with performance where there should be none, not to mention the fact that this game is buggier than a square kilometre of the Amazon rainforest.XCOM 2 is, gamewise, a worthy successor to XCOM. It may not feature the full range of contents yet, and the story is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor as you'd expect, but if you bought this expecting something on par with Mass Effect, you should not have. XCOM is about shooting aliens, machines, and alien-human hybrids (seeing as the players cannot be expected to simply be fighting human soldiers who have threwn their lot in with the alien overlords), and if good turn-based tactics and moments of euphoria followed by indomitable rage are what you're into, this game is for you. Sadly, it seems Firaxis somehow managed to do many of the things it did right terribly wrong. Yes, there is full modding support (as in: the tools the devs had, we had available on day 1), but the documentation on it is spotty at best. The character pool was a great idea, but it turned out to be an unweildy and unecessarily complicated feature. Not saying you wont get the hang of it, but once the ranger guy you carefully worked out to be an insane brute becomes a specialist because the game refuses to use the class you specified you'll be quite mad, I assure you.This is also one of the better sides of the game: the mods. The community is already hard at work, and some fantastic groundwork has been laid out, so you can be sure great things will follow. Firaxis loves the modders already, and maybe that is because they hope they can figure out a way to improve the horrendous performance, but the encouragement people are getting can only be rivalled by Bethesda. And seeing as EVERYTHING is moddable, workarounds for everything you don't like about the game will be available soon enough.Still, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. Wait until they fixed the performance and the modding scene is a little bigger, and this will be well worth your money.			"

												Ok this is not gona be easy to say but some one must say it.The game is not finished. After installation i could play for 3 min before game froze and i was forced to restart my training mission. That is your first mission to do (That is also forced on you). So game out of box is not functional. But after deleting one file (Documents\My Games\XCOM2\XComGame\SaveData profile.bin). The game works fine. And i could go on and explore Xcom2.The game looks nice, and it feels nice in the eyes. With all the shadows and light laying down correctly on the characters and ships and consoles when you look around in your HQ that can fly !  And it have big potencial for mods with accessories and stuff. But what i feel the game lacks big time and is a game breaker is the % to hit stuff. I was playing the game and having a blast when i got the game to run. But i fast feelt that some thing was odd and strange about the game. It took for ever to do some thing in game. And when i have done some thing. I way often missed all the shoots my characters was taking. If i had like 50% or more to hit, i oftenly shoot around the enemy. But if i had under 50% to hit. I more oftenly did hit !. And it did not mater if the target had cover or was running or if it was a long distance. It hits !So i started to get iritated by it. And after lite more game time i was raging. I know and i do feel that Xcom is a game that should be hard and unforginving if you do a wrong move. But even tho i do it correctly as much that i could. But i keept on loosing and loosing and loosing. Even tho the mission it self says Easy. No way ! No way ever ! In my eyes the game is rigged and incorrectly built. And all i can say is that Xcom2 have allot of problems that Xcom:Enemy Unknown had. So in my eyes Dev's have not put in enugh effort to fix old problems to the new game that they know was there.I do not recomend this game in it current state (2016-02-14). I am gona shelf this game and hope for a big update to fix this un-balanced rolls and hit %. Before i even think of opening the game again. If you have purchased the game or if your thinking of buying the game. Refund your money if you can. And then wait for the game to be fixed before you support this game.			"

												First off I will point out that I am enjoying the game to an extent and I will put more hours into it, but I am giving it a thumbs down because of the aggressive mission timers.  They ruin the pace and strategy of the game for me and force you down one path - rushing the objective.  In a single player turn based strategy game I like to take my time and try different ways of achieving the objective.  One suggestion would be to make it so the timer doesn't even start ticking until you are out of stealth at the start of the mission, but overall I just don't like the timers.  I certainly don't think that they should be in 75% of the missions.  If timed missions came up around 10% of the time I would be OK with it, so maybe it is a question of not enough diversity in the mission types?Hopefully the modding community can sort this problem out.The other problem is the performance of the game, which I have found to be all over the place, and I have a pretty good PC (i7 4790k, GTX970, 16GB RAM, SSD).

												WAIT!!!!I love this game, i love it so much. I played this game right after playing xcom enemy within and nearly everything has improved. The classes are far more interesting and have less obvious choices as to how to build them. The game prevents you from using the same tired ""overwatch all day"" strategy from the previous game. I hear alot of people complain about mission timers, and i do think they get overbearing, but missions for the most part have so far given me enough time to do them. My issue with the game, and why i simply cannot reccomend it, is the disatrous performance issues. Even on the lowest settings on a computer that can run games like witcher 3 on the near highest settings at 60, this game chugs and chugs and chugs even on the lowest settings. It chugs when loading the main menu and missions, it chugs when you throw a grenade, it chugs when something explodes, it chugs when the aliens take a turn or do literally everything. This game would be a glowing reccomendation from me , but until these nonsensical performance issues are fixed, dont buy it. Wait till a sale or for when the issues are patched			"

So now game has no performance issues (at least for me) and it respects my time. Parts of review about boring gameplay still stand though.With timers - this is not even xcom. It's no longer thoughtful game of chess. It's rush simulator.Without timers - AI is boring as hell and prefer to retreat the hell away. Also game can't end itself properly. There is a bate.

												personally i disliked the game:the performance for me is really bad (2x980 cards etc. to match), turning of antializing helps a lot on this issue though.the gameplay i found boring once i got into it, at first glance the stealth part is cool, but then you realise that all it does is give you a free shot on the first group you encounter and thats it.it didnt fix any of the issues from the last xcom game in my oppinion.it added a rush element to most maps and the entire setup, so you are now on a timer the whole way (personally not a fan of that).the RNG is still strong with the game, and some enemies blatently ignores LOS and can grab you/shoot poisen at you, through walls without any LOS from any enemy.research, weapons, etc. is basically the exact same in design setup. the weapons are uglier this time around imo but besides that more or less the same.it still plays like a console port. no real camera freedom (locked 4 pov and no control over the tip of camera.)besides that there was a handfull of gameplay issues i found (overwatch is better, but you still have no control over who they shoot from stealth.)i did like the idea of being the underdog, and i like the new aliens, just sad you fight more ""humans"" than you ever do aliens, so yer.but that is about the only thing that was improved.i didn't enjoy it really, not only did i use a good deal of time on the performance issue, but i didn't find gameplay fun or pleasant.

Timed missions were the curse of the first part, because all the nice setups you can plan in this kind of game just need to be hurried and you cannot explore with a timer. This happens almost every single mission now. The entire laid-back feeling that made the XCOM series great for all that time is gone with this single change. It wouldnt be so bad if this happened to b the occasional odd-one-out timed mission. But it is almost every single one.The same principle applies to the whole campaign by the way. Your only have the illusion of choosing your goals in the campaign, because the very narrow time limit has you chasing after primary objectives and the means necessary to acces them (contacts/intel) all the time. This always hectic feeling really squelches the fun out of what could be a prime gaming experience.The second issue is the ridicoulous low performance and memory leaks.The in-combat performance is really low on default settings, but can actually be tweaked via lowering graphic options to manageable levels. The bigger problem here is a kind of stuttering that is introduced after you run the game for some time. Usually starts with slightly longer breaks between turns, missions or changing a screen on the campaign map. The longer you play, the longer the pauses, until you feel like the game freezes every couple of seconds.Now this feels like something that could be patched in time, so the question remains: why on gods green earth does every premium developer nowadays resort to releasing half baked products?

												This will be my first review ever.This game is not remotely as much fun as the previous one. The game is totally different and feels unpolished. Enemies will shoot you through floors/roofs. When in overwatch, my players will fire at enemies through the roof/floor as well. It makes for difficult game play when the game gives you an x amount of moves to complete the stage. You can't play tactically, for its a rush from the begining just not to run out of turns. The turns system ruins it for me. I like exploring the stage and getting my snipers in good positions. You will get let say 12 turns to extract a scientist and then get to the extraction point. To move to the scientist will take about 3 - 4 turns without encountering any enemies. To then move to the extraction point will take atleat another 3 - 4 turns without any enemies. Throwing enemies into the mix makes that you have to blindly just move forward and hope you choose good positions for you don't know where the enemies are. When you get the scientist the AI will drop enemies straight in the path to the extraction so if your players miss shots that says 70% chance, and they hit you, you barely have time to heal them. When they are hit they will be unavailable for a few missions.I am not happy I purchased the game. I don't mind playing difficult games, but taking the part that I enjoyed out ruins it for me. Other players might enjoy it, I don't.			"

XCOM 2 had the potential to be a bigger and more accessible game than its predecessor, but this sad fact only makes its resulting mediocrity all the more disappointing.XCOM 2 continues on from the events of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and things play out in much the same way as they did before. Players once gain assume the mantle of commander and must oversee an entire war against the alien menace, organising strike teams, and researching better weapons and upgrades that will (hopefully) result in victory.The aliens rule Earth now though and they've installed their own Orwellian world government that regulates every aspect of life on the planet. XCOM is no longer the sanctioned anti-alien outfit it used to be either; now it's a downtrodden rebel alliance intent on ousting the ADVENT council through covert tactics and guerilla warfare.It's a fresh setup that brings new pressures to the planning phase. Your role as commander is as all-encompassing as it was before and your duties have expanded to include some interesting new responsibilities. You'll need to make contact with rebel settlements across the globe and construct communication relays in order to improve your network of resources. The aliens are more proactive too so you'll need to work fast in order to counter their battle plans whilst reserving time to investigate the numerous points of interest that appear on the world map.This simulation side to XCOM 2's wider gameplay makes a good first impression and it provides some of the most thoughtful, if a little vague, decision-making moments that the game has to offer. The aliens' ominous Avatar Project acts as a game-ending timer for your actions at large. Answering distress calls and investigating supply sites costs valuable time and with each passing in-game month the project's completion bar ticks forward another space. Not wasting time is critical to your ongoing success and it means knowing when to make sacrifices in order to focus on the big picture.The turn-based battles themselves have undergone dramatic changes with all of the showy muzzle flashes and tactical manoeuvrings being right where Firaxis left them. And yet, combat is also the first noticeable area where XCOM 2 as an experience begins to completely break down.Nearly every mission in XCOM 2 is timed and success will often be measured by how quickly you can complete objectives before the timer expires. Whilst the objectives themselves are varied enough (kidnap a VIP, disarm an explosive etc.) the whole approach of limiting turns is completely at odds with the game's otherwise methodical turn-based gameplay. Carefully positioning your snipers and moving your forces between cover spaces is no longer a vital tactic as much as it is a luxury. Missions too often devolve into a mad dash towards another arbitrary point of interest and in a game that features character permadeath as a core gameplay mechanic, players will be re-loading their saves constantly.This change in direction also highlights the new concealment system which masks your squad's position until the first bullet is fired. As a pseudo form of stealth, concealment allows your soldiers to get close to an enemy's position without immediately prompting return fire. Once concealment is broken though, it's pretty much lost for the remainder of the battle and any new enemies that enter line-of-sight at this time will be immediately alerted to your presence. This is incredibly annoying when your squad has already exhausted their actions for that turn as it leaves them completely wide open to attack and with XCOM being XCOM, you can always bet on losing at least one soldier in the crossfire.Adding to this difficulty are several early game enemies that will happily wreak havoc upon your squad. The vcious snake people and Sectoid powerhouses have upwards of eight health points a piece and they have no qualms about binding, disorientating, or even mind-controlling your troops into submission. The ADVENT Stun Lancers are even more obnoxious in this regard as their huge movement pool allows them to cross the length of the battlefield (often ignoring retaliation fire) to strike your troops down, often in a single blow.Enemies of this ilk are indeed a fine challenge when you consider how blissfully overpowered humans can get after a few levels, but when you're meeting these game-changing foes as early as mission 2 - a point where your squad can barely muster together a basic medkit - then it makes for a very unpleasant difficulty curve. Hearing that this is a very hard game probably won't come as much surprise considering the series' reputation for brutal difficulty, but XCOM 2 always feels cheap before it does challenging.It's also worth mentioning that whilst the variety of enemies is strong (maybe even too strong), their anthropomorphised designs seem a tad stale. The new foot soldiers fit snugly into that 'dudes in armour' category, the existing Sectoid enemies have completely lost their quirkiness, and the snake warriors actually appear to have breasts for some reason. Similarly, the design of the infuriating new Codex enemy is so nonsensical in this regard that Firaxis Games should really be charged with first-degree Deviant Art baiting.The ""scarier"" alien designs in XCOM 2 are also indicative of how seriously everything is treated this time around. Your communications manager called Central is a walking microcosm of this shift; his newly grizzled face and loss of charisma gelling awkwardly with an inability to keep his mouth shut. Like the world's most annoying project coordinator, he is always on your case. Everything is ""ASAP"" with this guy and he rarely stops explaining to you how ""time is running out"", or how ""civilians are dying"", or how you're presently doing a cruddy job at spinning all of these plates he's put in front of you.Now in some ways XCOM 2 does improve on the formula established by its prequel. The base-building system is leaner for one, it's much easier to heal troops in the heat of battle, and the achievements are more interesting this time around. It's a visually impressive game too especially during those cutaways that show the soldiers (or aliens) gunning down their quarry in a blaze of plasma fire. And yet the game can be dreadfully slow when in motion. There's a noticeable delay upon issuing orders to your troops and transitioning between menus at XCOM HQ is tedious, especially when you consider how frequently the different departments request your attention.Amid the odd performance concern (I experienced a few stutters and one CTD) there are a few mechanics that just seem weird. Damage indicators sometimes fail to display, troops can't seem to climb into trucks that have had their housing destroyed, and I'm still not sure how how a Viper at street level is able to grapple a sniper crouching atop a three-storey building.The XCOM 2 Digital Deluxe Edition is a mixed bag too. Included in this version are several bonus DLC packs that add more missions to play and equipment to use. Extra weapons and costume parts are always welcome, but the idea of adding more missions is hilarious considering how much stuff you have to deal with already. Your attention is always being diverted by another alert from XCOM HQ or by another distress single or by another painfully slow update to the Avatar Project track.It feels as if Firaxis Games went too far in satisfying the upper 1% of their playerbase. This is an unforgiving game at the best of times and it relies far too heavily on its brutal difficulty to provide a wider sense of character and appeal.Read the full review at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												It's only worth it on sale, maybe not even that. Marred by issues, the pros don't outweigh the cons.PROS:* Gorgeous cutscenes, and the graphics are nice when they're not bogged down (which is unfortunately more often than not).* Very interesting narrative and story setup.* Highly customizable units.CONS:* Graphical stutters and lags unlike any game I've played on this machine. I'm sure tweaking the settings would bring it up to speed, but this is unacceptable, my rig should not have to turn down anything for this.* AI takes an obnoxious amount of time to respond sometimes. You could end up waiting up to, say, 15-20 seconds before that last alien makes its decision on what it's going to do. Maybe even longer. I've gone AFK sometimes. That's also unacceptable, and combined with the graphical stutters makes for quite the chore.* On the whole, it's too damn difficult. It feels like I'm fighting against the game makers and they're like ""a-HA! gotcha AGAIN!"" like they're torturing ants. Or more like, bullying children. Because ""oh, it's too hard for you? You're weak, git gud! Hahaha! Have another Codex thrown at your squad!"" It's just obnoxious.* On that note, the RNG is very much NOT reflective of itself. I don't know what smokescreen they're trying to pull, because ""idk, it's random! you could just have bad luck!"" but no. This ain't no bad luck. And early on, getting hit literally once could spell doom for the rest of the mission. Oh wait, that's later on too.* And of course, walls only sporadically work for line of sight. You *could* argue that they're shooting through walls if you've already given away your position--which is fair--but not fair when one squaddie gives away everyone else's position everywhere. And for the rest of the mission.* Stealth/ambush/whatever element makes no sense contrasted with the time limits and ""rescue X amount of civilians"" elements. I wanted to like this game. A LOT. But frankly it feels like a chore after a while--too much work for not enough pay, so to speak. I'm not about to throw myself at the same missions for hours just to end up being left with a (loaded) dice roll against me as usual and likely a dead squadmate or three if I *happen* to get any luck. I took similar issue with the previous title, but that was significantly more tolerable than this mess.See, these difficult RNG games *can* be fun, I'm all for them, but the problem here is that victory just isn't satisfying enough. You're quickly going to be thrust into a new mission again with a now-broken squad and very little, if anything, more to show for it. So what's the point? To just continue watching my squadmates die while I replenish them with recruits that just end up dying too? Oh, my reward for this mission is a scientist and a smattering of resources? Hardly makes up for the dead and injured.I might seem a little salty--and I am--but it's largely because I got this game on release, and now that I've waited months to try picking it back up again in hopes it's been tweaked to be more fun and technically sound, I'm instead greeted with some weak DLC. Difficulty and gameplay issues aside, it's the technical issues that really just kill it for me, that just adds insult to injury.Overall, while I love the game's presentation, I can't recommend it, but damn it I wish I could.

												I'd really been looking forward to this game but it just seems as if the XCOM-guys have a problem setting the difficulty levels. Usually I don't mind a challenge, however these missions take ages to complete, and the concept of enemies constantly respawning while your poor soldiers are being shredded to pieces just becomes annoying. I haven't played it through (and doubt I'll have the patience for it) but even after re-setting the level to novice I'm constantly reloading to keep at least some troopers alive. Really a pity in that the well-known setting in line with the older games in the series is quite cool. Well, have fun! I you want to play it then wait at least for a proper discount...			"

												I want to say I love the game, I really do. It's everything you expected out of an xcom 2 game, but when it comes to me working so hard and having everything corrupted because saves no longer work, I just can't. I've reported this and hope it will soon be fixed as I am in a late game, but this pushed me over the edge along with bugs causing my people to die, such as many occurances with enemies line of sight. I don't think the team working on this project purposely let the aliens see past walls, and this accident has ruined many, many mission. As of right now with all the bugs, and corrupted files I can't give this game a good review. I'm not saying to avoid xcom because of these small, yet annoying, bugs I have encountered. If you've had your eye on the game for quite a bit then go for it, it's amazing, but I just want to put out an honest review that this game has finally crushed me with multiple save issues. Restarting from scratch won't be so bad, right...?			"

												Years after finishing Enemy Unknown and loving it, I couldn't wait to get XCOM 2. However, after many dozens of failed missions and restarted campaigns later, I just can't recommend this game. It's too random, way too luck-based, more than before, to the point it becomes aggrevating. Countless of times I found myself yelling at the screen when my squad mate misses a target at point blank range with 90% hit chance, only to be gunned down with ease by another enemy 30 yards away. People say ""that's XCOM"", but I say it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The beginning missions are ridiculously difficult, even at an easier difficulty, your squad mates die constantly, so you have no promoted soldiers and therefore no edge against the enemies. When you complete an objective with barely your squad intact, more reinforcements show up to kill you. I had a scenario where 1 enemy with a stun sword killed my entire team. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's even worse when you have to complete an objective in X amound of turns, forcing you to hurry and dropping your guard, so you have absolutely no way to plan a careful approach, which is what XCOM is supposed to be all about. Instead, you have some annoying ♥♥♥♥ back at the HQ barking orders at you while he's eating a donut, telling that the Alien relay is closing down, as if you didn't know why you're there in the first place.XCOM 2 is like playing Mount & Blade and selecting ""Auto-fight"" before every encounter and getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by the computer. You can maneuver, yes, but ultimately it all comes down to a dice roll and you will die in situations that would never happen in real life, like missing a shot, when the gun barrel is literally at the enemy's stupid face.There's just so much frustration in this game. Creating a squad of friends and seeing them all die during the first mission is beyond infuriating. To me there's nothing more annoying than an unfair challenge and that's what this game boils down to. Some people get easier missions and scenarios early on so they can build their team, but if you're like me, you just get humiliated again, again, again and again. You start feeling like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because you paid full price for a game that makes fun of you at every turn, and forces you to turn down the difficulty, because you're too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to play on Ironman like you did in the previous game.It was also plagued with weird gamebreaking bugs, like a zombie ragdoll glitching through the floor and flying around the map, preventing the game from progressing. I have never seen a game, where a round continuing is dependent on whether a random ragdoll is stationary or not. Astounding.Overall, I felt like I was going insane while playing this game, I almost broke my mouse and my keyboard. If you buy this game, you might have an easier time, but I'd rather shove a pineapple up my♥♥♥♥♥than play it again. "

												XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy developed by Firaxis and published by 2K Games. It is a direct sequel to the previous XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the expansion XCOM: Enemy Within.In XCOM 2, follows the story where the XCOM lose the war to the alien. The aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order. So they said it, we are now on the offensive on XCOM 2. With only limited resources, XCOM must retake back Earth from the ADVENT.XCOM 2 gameplay are quite similiar with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but plays differently. In fact, you feel like you already knew how it plays out until you see the timer. Yes, each mission has a time limit to reach certain objectives. But most people describe it wrong as a turn timer or whatever it is they said. The truth is, it's a turn limit to reach certain objectives such as hacking a device, rescuing VIP or destroying key objectives. Most of them if completed, then the timer is gone and you can have all the time you want to kill the enemy. NOT all missions has this turn limit objectives however. Overwatch in XCOM 2 is even more powerful I think, even if some people didn't like the turn limit, overwatch now doesn't trigger all at once, they trigger one by one that you can be sure every overwatch is count. Base building retains the same element but building adjacent bonuses are gone, instead you get to upgrades with resources. The global map have been changed too. Since you have a mobile headquarters, in the global map, you need to move from place to place to scan for resources, intel or even contacting resistance on other location.There is this thing called Avatar Project or simply AP by the community, I think, it renders your campaign has time limit which you have to act fast to delay or setback the project progress. You can do this by assaulting alien bases or hacking then kill the alien codex. There's also Dark Event, which some kind of random even that if left unchecked will, I say again WILL give you disadvantage and give the alien an advantage. Like XCOM: Enemy Unknown abduction mission, not all Dark Event mission can't be completed, you have to choose which you think is the best... or the worse. All of this makes your campaign has faster pace then the previous.Tactical combat also has become more difficult, at least for me. I can see more challenge here. Remember Sectoid? They're not what you remember now, they posses more power and can mess you up if you don't kill them real quick. What about Thin Man? Now you will see the true form of the alien infiltration unit. Soldiers now also has even more useful abilities, some are in fact powerful if you know how to use them. Soldiers can even be upgraded further to gain more advantage, whether it's a weapon or the soldier themselves. Turn limit may be frustrating, but in my opinion they're not as frustrating as some people said.Customization in XCOM 2 are great, I will say huge if they actually add more content or option into it, nevertheless we have modding support. There is a dedicated place where you can create you characters before you even play the campaign. Characters you created can be set to appear as XCOM soldiers, or VIP which is scientist or engineer, or even Dark VIP which will appear on some mission and you must capture them. With mods, customization will be unlimited.Firaxis did improve the graphics and effects on XCOM 2. They look prettier than XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The downside XCOM 2 has is the performance. It is unoptimized that I can barely have FPS above 35. Most of the time I get stutters and lags. Mission loading time is quite long. They need to fix this.Overall, XCOM 2 is a great sequel. Some people don't like the turn limit, but for me, knowing that we are on the offensive with guerilla style warfare, that's just about fair and challenging. With mods support is even better. If only the performance were better on release, I would give XCOM 2 way better score. I recommend XCOM 2.Rating 7/10			"

												XCOM 2 is largely a refinement of and an advancement on XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It honestly doesn't feel like a full sequel. Feels like XCOM: Enemy Unknown 1.5. But that's not really a bad thing. As mentioned, many things have been refined and streamlined, and there have been a host of new additions that do mix things up to a certain degree. Though yes, at the same time, I must say I am a tad disappointed that things aren't more different. So, long story short, if you like XCOM: EU you will most probably like XCOM 2 as well. The campaign length for a first run is around 40-50 hours. Now, the game has some glaring issues. One is optimization. I honestly do not find the graphics to be anything stellar (they don't seem that different from in XCOM EU), but even on the lowest settings I am getting absolutely terrible performance. Another is from time to time, the game can bug out. I hacked a Sectapod successfully, yet somehow it remains out of my control and kills my troops on the next turn. Then there was once a muton who was actually on the roof, but the graphics made it look like it was at the bottom of the roof. And once my scanning went to -3 days (it just bugged out). Gameplay wise, too many enemies are just bullet sponges in the mid-to-late game. Now that I am right at the end of the final mission, I can say that this game suffers the same two issues from XCOM EU. 1) The mid-to-late game is relatively much, much easier than the fiendishly difficult early game. 2) There is no ""middle ground"" difficulty setting between Veteran (a tad too easy) and Commander (a tad too difficult)This game is a net recommendation actually but I leave a thumbs down until Firaxis can fix the optimization issues at least.

												One for the sales probably. If you can grab it on the cheap a few months down the line when the mods have fixed it this would be a really good purchase. As it is, it's a bit meh.Has a few really big flaws:1. Oversimplified strategic layer means every game pans out pretty much the same way.2. There are too many 'get out of jail free' abilities either on high level characters or in the form of grenades or psionic powers.3. Really short. You can spin the campaign out a bit if you want to but there's very little there.4. It's way too easy once you get the hang of it and what's more it's front-weighted the challenge again. In other words it starts really hard, then gets easy and stays that way, especially if you start again.Other than that s'okay I guess.Edited to add, almost a year later, and so I don't look like one of those nutters who've got hundreds and hundreds of hours in a game they don't recommend, mods do fix this game. The Long War mod specifically fixes it very much into what I want it to be. Takes a lot of time and tinkering but if you're willing to put that into it then it can be great.			"

												Disabling v-sync and framerate smoothing, while lowering anti aliasing from msaa 8x to fxaa will pretty much fix any stuttering issues people are experiencing. There are already two mods, one extending timers and one disabling timers on the workshop. So that fixes that complaint.With those two issues out of the way, the game looks good (the people that claim it looks like xcom 1 or looks worse are full of it)  the concept is great. The customization options are crazy, and will only expand as more mods are made. Can't wait until there's a long war equivalent mod. Playing on a i-7 4770, gtx 970 and 16 gigs of ram, aside from the cutscene stuttering that was fixed with the above options, the game runs smooth for me. Haven't run into any bugs yet, I'm sure I will though. Some advice, don't grow attached to your squad members.			"

I played videos games since I was 9 years never have I seen such a buggy game in all my gaming life. If you think you can play this game on Ironman, you are in for a world of pain and frustration!3. Firaxis is the worst company, imo, when it comes to patching their games right after Bethesda. They don't love their games, this is not CDPR! They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about you, me or the game!The game runs the same way it ran when it came out.This is a chess like game. And becasue of that the game must be consistent and clear! As it stands, the game does not follow it's own rules and does not show you all the info you need to see to make a educated guess. You will get screwed by the game more then once I guarantee that!Conclusion: I'm never buying another game made by Firaxis!DON NOT BUY FOR FOR MORE THAN $15!			"

												If you buy this game, immediately look into mods. Without them, it's just not worth the purchase.  Previous iterations of the XCOM franchise prided themselves on torturous levels of difficulty and tragedy.  It was balanced by a keen sense of style and humor, rooted in 50's/60's-era alien invasion paranoia. With XCOM2, the developers seem to have bought into their own ""difficulty"" mystique and made a game that borders on being more frustrating than fun. To do this, they added gameplay elements (e.g. timers, terrain-ignorant fields of vision, and plot-wedging ""Advent Project"") to ensure the game is challenging for experienced players, but often defy logic. On paper, some of the new elements sounded great; previous iterations frustratingly relied too heavily on RNG to increase difficulty. The result, however, puts XCOM2 ""on rails"", meaning that despite the awesome amount of thought they put into class customization, maps and new ""concealment"" element (which tantalizes an option for stealth gameplay), missions can only really be accomplished one way. Players are forced to brute-force their way through most (if not all) objectives, which quickly becomes rote and frustrating, given the difficulty level. In other words, missions can't be accomplished with much creativity on the player's part. This vastly diminishes the reward for employing strategy - and this is a strategy game after all.  Thankfully, there's a community of modders who felt the same way.  I recommend saving yourself from feeling like you wasted money by looking into the highest rated gameplay mods on Steam and download (i.e. ""subscribe"" to) them before even starting your first campaign. Sadly, XCOM2 has lost much of the whimsical approach to alien invasion, in favor of scarier, or more intimidating aliens (unsuccessfully, IMO).  There are story, voice, and character design mods to be explored too but dive in at your own risk.			"

												I will be brutally honest about my review here: I am not being objective. This is pure oppinion and if you enjoy the game it is completely and utterly up to you.So, did I like it?No, I hated it fully and completely. The game has very clear goals and none of them are admirable or interesting. While XCom: Enemy Unknown had issues, two things that I loved about it were the scope and the story. It felt like the desperate attempt of an unsuspecting planet to fight against a highly superior invader. That feeling is gone. The game tries to go for a ""fight the POWA!"" feel, but it utterly fails on a mechanical level. Missions are always about attacking and routing or anihilating the enemy. Enemies (like before) only activate once spoted, so you never feel like a covert ops team. In fact, your soldiers become so strong during the game, I hardly ever had one seriously hurt. By adding more content, the developers overlooked the dreadded powercreep. Now for the second titanic issue: The story*Spoilers*While XCom: Enemy Unknown went with a very event and action driven narrative that was mostly told through the memos and Ufopedia entries, it allowed the player a very good feel of what the enemy was up to and made it clear that XCom, while necessary was a very shady organization. You got black money from a shady council, constantly lauched military actions in neutral airspace and basically confiscated alien technology right from the soil of sovereign nations. Your actions were not black and white.XCom 2 forgoes these ideas and makes it obvious: Aliens EVUL, rebels GOOD, you HERO!The narrative is mostly character driven, following 4 people who handle everything (scientists and engineers only support, you never get the feeling that there is a whole legion of workers behind any breakthrough). Sadly, the characters are neither very deep nor very interesting. Due to the fact that rebels need constant rescue from you (the new terror missions are attacks on rebel bases), they come off as completely ineffectual and kinda sad. Your fellow freedom fighters have the same AI as civilians in the first installment and never take a shot or fight back. Finally, there are the aliens... The strange, unsettling enemy of mankind that has unified dozen of species and attacked you without provocation for no reason have basically become Dr. Robotnik from Sonic. Their motives are outright stated at the halfway point and their evilness is underlined with Auschwitz-imagery and their personal Steven Jobs - like spokesman. At some point they ""want to harvest the entire genetic material of the world"" by putting people into meat grinding factories. The final cutscene features the Commander himself in Psy-battle with the alien leaders. Yes, it has become that simple and dumb. It ends with a hint at what I assume will be the next installment. Anyways, I really didn't enjoy this game. Sorry, hope you do			"

												I just want to start off by saying that at its core, this game is phenominal. Enemy variety is plentiful and is for the most part really well balanced. The game is a decent looking game too. Sadly, the enemy variety sort of goes out the window late game and the longer you play, the worse performance gets due to a nasty memory leak. The Avenger base isn't anything special. It's just slightly better than it was in EU and not really worth mentioning. Oh, and the sound design, both with the in game voices and sound effects to the phenominal score is nothing short of amazing. I absolutely LOVE this game. XCOM has always been a series that I've LOVED since I was a child. And because of the love that I have for the series, I HATE writing a negative review on this game. You see, aside from the core aspect being amazing, that's really the only positive thing I can say about this game. It's quite clear that this game seriously lacks polish. There's even evidence that the developers actually panic patched the game at the last minute to make it harder. And there lies the problem with XCOM 2. The XCOM games have never been hard, challenging yes, but never hard. This game however is hard for all the wrong reasons. From spawning 2 Archons and 2 Advent elite troopers at the LZ of a timed mission (and then landing another 3 troopers ON the LZ making it 7 foes to face) to having your troopers caught during the ""concealment"" phase without so much as a warning to let the players know that said troopers can actually see behind the 2 buildings you're at. The game honestly feels completely botched. I NEVER felt screwed over when I played the older XCOM games or Enemy Unknown/ WIthin. I've always played on the harder difficulties to make it more challenging. The AI has ALWAYS cheated in the older games (it's a fact), but NEVER as blatantly as they do in this game. This game has absolutely no sense of balance nor fairness. And the game completely contradicts itself too. It wants you to sneak around and set up well planned out ambushes. Well, that takes a lot of time to pull off and 90% of the time you're expected to use these ambush tactics, there's a timer where you have 8 turns to hack into an item across the map or you lose meaning that instead of doing what the game was designed to do (at least in the early stages of the level), you have to dash towards the objective. It makes no logical sense. Not to mention that flanking offers the player no reward aside from higher chances to land a critical hit on an enemy and the high grounds offer no real advantages either (though you still do get a bonus for being up above). A lot of the times the player is actually punished for making tactically sound maneuvers. The aim penalties in this game are beyond insane too! It's tooth shatteringly logic defying when a giant metal floating ball is floating 1 square away and I have a plasma rifle aimed at it with only 50% chance to hit on my colonel ranked support character. I understand that since it's floating, it gets a ""flying buff"", but when it's no less than ONE SQUARE AWAY, should't I be at 100% to land a hit since it would literally be impossible to miss that shot? I have MUCH more to say about this game, but I fear that, that would require me to write at least 4 pages worth of complaints. And that's not even me talking about the TERRIBLE optimization and performance issues (I have a 980, i5 4670k OC'd, and 16gb of RAM) that this game has nor the countless bugs. Fun fact, the reason that I ran into a terrible (even game breaking) bug that wouldn't allow me to make any actions, but if by God's good grace I managed to pull off an action, the game would just freeze up. And no, not crash, the game would literally just halt at the zoomed in character that is about to make a shot. Background noise and music still playing and soldiers and aliens still doing their idle animations. It was nearly impossible for me to finish the mission I was currently on. I did fix it though. It really saddens me that a PC only release is plagued with such mediocre and amateur mistakes. Especially from a dev team like Firaxis. As the game stands now, I cannot see how ANYONE could give this game 9's and 10's across the board. This game is a 6/10. It's such a shame, because I want to love this game (more than I already do). It sucks to say and even think this, but I can't wait for the patches and modders to fix this game. Once it's fixed, I know that this game could easily be a 9 or a 10.			"

												Let me just say I have no problems with the game's mechanics. There has been a lot of back and forth between the timers, balance, etc. but overall I enjoyed the design choices. I can see how people might dislike certain things about those, but that is not really the most pressing issue.The optimization, however, is.I find it hard to justify a purchase no matter how much I like the design when I could barely play it even at the lowest settings. Perhaps the specs requirement has risen greatly since EW, but even then there should be no justification as to why it chugs at 10 fps when EW works fine. Long story short, if you don't have a powerful pc like I do, I wouldn't buy this game until it's optimized a great deal. "

												In regards of this review: I will only review the un-modded ""vanilla"" version of this game.The game is quite badly optimized. To give you an idea of my specs:Gtx 980Intel i7 3.5016 GB ram--------So, the game makes my pc STRUGGLE at max graphics, a pc that handles witcher 3 on max with no issues whatsoever. However, it only struggles when i maximize the settings. If i set them to medium, there will be some framerate stutters here and there. I do not know if this optimization issue is only relevant to the GTX 980, or if it is worse on other cards out there on the market.The gameplay is the same as the first one, with some annoying things (that can be solved with mods, true- but we're reviewing the game itself here.) The gameplay has to be described as ""annoying"" because that's exactly what it is.  If all of your squadmates are on the same extraction platform, why do you have to extract each and every one of them individually, why not add an exctract all button? (There is a mod that solves this, however.)The game continiously annoys the living crap out of you with dialogue, dialogue hindering you from doing anything on your turn. ""We've just recieved a transmission due to X"". Or, one of your officers pop up in the right side window, mentioning you do not have many turns left. Why am I not allowed to do anything while he's talking? And this goes on and on and on in the game! I couldn't bring myself to play it any more. (However, there is a mod that fixes this.)The worst experience so far- for me, Is the world map. I had one day left on my research, and I started it. One day usually takes 1.5 seconds to pass. This took me three minutes, due to dialogue popping up, that was unskippable, mentionings of the avatar project growing further. The camera pans to where the avatar project is on the map, but does not pan back to where you were before on the map. HALTING your production as well. So, I start it again and another dialogue pops up. It's atrociously annoying!If you did dislike timed missions in the last XCOM game, then this game just isn't for you. 80% of all missions are ""8 turns left to finish before X explodes"" or something else. While, it encourages the player to use tactics, it is just too much of it. Almost every god damn mission! (there is a mod that fixes this.)The loading times are bad, just dreadful.The game saves itself ONLY because of mods. Mods made by players to fix this boring & annoying game.I would not recommend you buy this game. But if you do, I would recommend checking out the mods in the workshop section fixing this game!			"

												Harsh design, poor optimisation and a baffling lack of truly random outcomes spoils an otherwise interesting sequel.  The strategy layer is much improved, the concealment mechanic interesting (if not actually all that useful) and the new aliens and soldier abilities expand into new territory.  It's such a shame therefore that it seems hellbent on preventing players having any fun at all.  Tweaks can be applied by mods to smooth out some of the worst, but presently there is no way to ensure the game properly delivers random outcomes to possible actions, meaning all the decision making by the player is ultimately irrelevant.

												Xcom 2 isn't a bad game, the problem is that it's not that good either. Xcom Enemy Unknown (and later enemy within) kept me coming back over and over again. While there was a host of problems with the first one, it still had that feeling, you never know what you're up against, and you never know if a mission is gonna end well or not. In XCOM 2 you know what you're up against, because you only ever fight the same 3 types of enemies with very rare exceptions. Half the classes are really broken when it comes to balance, which ruins the experience if you go for a higher difficulty run. Risk/reward analysis forces you to play in an incredibly boring manner, which makes the whole point of high difficulty gone. In the first game, I would sometimes have to go for a hail-mary, and risk everything to keep my men alive. This never happens in XCOM 2, as there are no classes that can do anything close to a hail mary move. My advice, get XCOM enemy within, and when you've gotten good enough, download ""Long war"", it's way way better.Oh, and also, it's completely impossible to play Ironman mode in it because it bugs out and messes up everything regularily			"

												Exactly what the premise of the game promises, it denies.You can not diverge, you can not play veteran mode intuitively on a blind run,precisely what it deals with and what those structural insights demand of you, it has not even build in the game.It does not punish you for taking the resistant stance and tell you something in the process. The requirements to merely stand a chance to avoid the end of the world are the selling point in every fiber of its presentation style, and the climatic progression with every event stands in no respective relation to the options to deal with ressources and their investment.The gamble to take the threat through aliens and answer it with resistance in any shape or form is its attitude, message and supposed conflict, and it is simply not build into the game.If you can follow this critique with intrinsic or learned understanding, avoid this game as per 2016-08-10.Diehard regards.

												Look this game has a 91 average from the kind of people who tend to get mocked for liking their games on easy mode only. If they can adapt and like XCOM 2's general stratagem change of ""no you can't overwatch turtle anymore"", so can you.(And if you love overwatch turtling that much, there's already mods that cater towards your casualness.)More seriously this game does have some major optimization issues that'll make you wonder what kind of rigs they have at Firaxis Games, but nothing at the severity that will make the game truly unplayable for you in my experience. If you like Enemy Unknown and are willing to adapt (or download a tiny mod that'll change the game for you), XCOM 2's right up your alley. It has the ability to save customized soldiers you love so you can see them live, die, and live again, its got a much more improved Geoscape side of the game (even if I'm still uncomfortable with ex-drunkard Bradford being the pilot of the Avenger), its got fully destructible terrain, and it has a SDK with an absurd amount of stuff you can do with it if you're the sort that likes tinkering with the games they own. At the very least, pick it up next steam sale if you're a fan of this kind of genre.			"

												X-com was perfect, you could move through the game at your own pace and were punished or rewarded depending on how you played.X-Com 2 forces you to rush every mission thanks to its 8 turns per map limit, which artificially increases the difficulty, instead of putting some effort into the games design to make it difficult. Gone are the epic 30 minute battles instead we get this 8 turn rubbish.I wish I had bought this on Steam so I could refund it.			"

												In its current state I wouldn't recommend it. Not only are there balance issues but the campaign mechanics are poorly explained, meaning you'll most likely lose the game and have to start over. The second time will go better since you now know what the game should've told you in the first place (black sites only remove a few pips from the avatar project, they don't reset it, your main goal should be taking out those as fast as possible).So to sum up the issues point by point:- Poorly explaind Avatar Project/campaign- Balance issues on missions, even on normal- While people say base building has been simplified it still has an optimal build order. If you don't know it you're screwed.- Turn limits on almost every mission exacerbate balance issues- Bugs galaore. Most are just visual and can be ignored but others affect gameplay.- Major performance issues even with a 980Wait for balance and performance patches.			"

												It really breaks my heart having to write this review to not recommend this game with flying colors. I am a big fan of the franchise and a big fan of the previous game, enemy unknown/within. XCOM 2 was probably the one game that I looked foward to playing in 2016. I was more excited about this game than any other AAA games or indie games that are coming out this year. It is sad to say that the game did not live up to my expecation at launch. I say this because the core premise of the gameplay is good, but the technical aspect of the game is horrible. The peformance and bugs that came with release of this game can rival that of Batman Arkham Knight and Assassin Creed Unity at launch. What really gets to me is that this is a PC exlusive game, so it should have beeen the game that comes out the most polished on the PC platform in this current generation and the graphics in this game are good but not mindblowing to a point where gtx 970 should not be getting 20fps in sideview of your avenger base. It is hard to defend this game base on optimization and bugs because the game have been delayed so the developers have ample amount of time to fix the performance and bugs reported from the review copies of the game. Aside from the technical problems, I really enjoy playing this game because it is XCOM at heart. If you are new to the franchise I recommend waiting until hotfix or performance patch have been rolled out. I would glady change my review when technical problems have been solve by patches but I feel like performance wise this is the best we are going to get. I am not hoping to see major performance upgrade from patches because the peformance problem may tied in to their heavy tinkering with the Unreal Engine 3. I hope they prove me wrong.			"

												I'm disappointed in Firaxis. I'm disappointed in the development team. I can't imagine that there isn't at least a few of the developers, whether writers artists or programmers who didn't think ""Man, there's going to be a lot of really angry players.""This game is a reskin. That's it. That's the entire review. Everything else is just exposition and nuance. Satellites are now Listening Posts. The Council timer is now the ADVENT timer. You excavate a starship like you excavate a bunker (amazingly straight down only. No, you can't excavate starting from the bottom or sides ignore the areas of the ship around this smaller-base-than-XCOM-1 you must excavate down). The Terror Missions are now named Retaliation Missions. The Classes are still split into Heavy, Sniper, Support and Assault but there's been some rebalancing to remove certain abilities players were abusing and name-changes to protect the innocent. Combat is the same. The AI is different, but also in a strange way, the same. Did you play Long War? Did you listen to Long War talk about what was wrong with XCOM1? Congratulations. You've already played XCOM2's combat. It looks the same, it plays the same beyond minor tweaks (if the enemy getting free moves bothered you then you'll be happy to note: its now an essential gameplay mechanic). This is the same engine. Same content. Same everything. Its ctrl+c; ctrl+v. Its lazy... and amazingly it doesn't have things that we find in the first XCOM like Second Wave mechanics. The cynic in me says that Second Wave will be released under a new name as DLC. Again. It feels like an expansion pack. No, it doesn't. Scratch that. It feels like the Blue Shift or Opposing Force campaigns. Allow me explanation on that one in case you're not familiar with the examples. In Half-Life1 you had some alternate campaigns that were released as expansions. Same game, same engine, obvious recycles the whole nine yards. You just played the same story from a different perspective. The same happened in a lot of older video games. You got two campaigns. Usually an Allieds and Axis, or Rebellion and Empire. That sorta thing. This feels like a Blue Shift campaign being marketed as a sequel in hopes that the playerbase is too stupid to notice. That's what you get here. Not a game in its own right, because you've already played it and this game is so identical that you could probably mod in XCOM2 back into XCOM1 without a whole lot of work. And you know what pisses me off? What really angers me the most about this? This isn't like the trailer. This game doesn't even reflect the main menu (for those of you who haven't seen it, its one of your soldiers in the suburbs about to ambush alien police officers). You don't build up multiple fronts of cells. You don't fight and take cities. There's no thought or complexity in this beyond ""hack the thing and shoot everything in the face"". There's no campaign beyond flimsy goalposts of ""research this"" or ""stun a Sectoid Commander for interrogation"" (in XCOM2 its stabbing ADVENT Commanders in the face with a probe to interrogate their faces directly) but that's one of the requirements.Obviously there's a lot of money in the XCOM franchise. XCOM1 sold well. The DLC sold well. The Enemy Within expansion sold well. There's a lot of people like myself who bought the second game with little more than a trailer and some hope. The press releases for XCOM2 were... quiet, but what was released promised something more than just a reskin and taking notes out of a modding community's playbook.If I had to sum it up: XCOM2 was a♥♥♥♥♥♥move, Firaxis. You should be ashamed.			"

												Let me start by saying as I played through the game, I started out loving it and enjoyed it less and less every passing moment. Also, I am a diehard XCOM fan and have played every game from the original through the expansions, Xenonauts, XCOM:EU and EW, The Bureau, and now XCOM 2. I also believe Ironman is the only way to go, otherwaise you can just negate every bad thing that happens. Now to the review:The start of the game is fantastic, and Firaxis has made some awesome refinements to the combat systems from XCOM:EU/EW. The textures, animations, and overall polish are crisp. The game started out hard, as an XCOM game should, but not unfair. I then found myself constantly interrupted by ceaseless side missions and events that interrupted the flow of the game back at base, while I was able to quickly field a force that was unstoppable and never lost a soldier after upgrading to Mag weapons. By the time I got plasma's, it was no contest. The game quickly turned into a tedious affair, but I had high hopes for the final mission. The second to last mission, which I won't ruin was phenomenal and I found myself re-invigorated and ready to finish the game on a high note and write a stunning review. The last mission was going awesome until the final battle. I suffered innumerable bugs, the worst of which was that when I moved my soldiers across a certain point ont he bridge, which if you've played you know what I'm talking about, a cutscene triggers. This cutscene locked the camera on the final position the camera was in when the cutscene ended, and I could not issue any commands to my troops. I had to save and exit then reload for every single soldier, which took about 30 minutes to just get through that position. Then the final battle occured. For the first time in any XCOM game or XCOM spinoff, I felt cheated. It was not just difficult, it was blatently unfair. There seems to have been no creative process behind this battle and in order to make an epic final challenge, the developers decided to throw endless waves of troops at the player, while supporting that with several of the most powerful alien forces in the game. This might seem like a a fun challenge, but an ability with a four turn cooldown, meaning there is only ever a one turn break between attacks, takes off half a soldiers health and is AOE that spand half the room. You have a similar attack, but it also forces a position change, which there is almost only half cover throughout the room, which is equivalent to no cover. I felt cheated. I was destroyed on my Normal/Ironman game with no hope of winning whatsoever. I could have employed some cheap tactics, like hiding out back on the bridge and mowing the enemy down one by one until I fulfilled the objective, but that would be an exploit of the AI system and would not have felt fair.TL;DR First XCOM game to botch the insanely difficult but always fair feeling of the game. Cheap tricks employed by the developers at the expense of a clever but difficult final challenge result in frustration. Bugs abound, even after multiple patches that break gameplay and ruin the core experience during the most critical levels and dramatic moments. Save yourself the headache, get XCOM:EU/EW and Xenonauts unless you feel that exploiting AI systems instead of tactically challenging gameplay is fun.			"

												Very early review and hopefully I will change my mind but after loving every Xcom game over the past 20 years, my first evening with this one has left me with nothing but frustration. I was never too keen in the last games missions where you had to get to a target in a certain amount of moved but accepted it and moved on however this time around, the first 2 missions were exactly that. Now as mentioned, I am no stranger to Xcom however am currently failing to understand how, in 8 moves you are to get to the target, eliminate 6-7 targets which mind control your party, and ""upload data"" from another target.  Second mission I clear out the first 4 enemies in 4 moves, spend a further move getting to the mission goal only to get jumped by more enemies! One get mind controlled, another panics and the others get picked off in a couple of shots.Maybe it has been a long day and I am off my game a little but currently very puzzled. I hope to return to this review and change it over the coming days to say something along the line of ""after the first 2 painful missions, the game opens up, lets you hire who you want at last and stops forcing you down dull mission paths"".**update 1**its a new morning and a fresh approach. 8 moves to get to the target.... in 2 moves I take out the first 2 bad guys and am feeling good, putting my first playthrough down to luck. The next targets trigger, kill one of my team from a mile off and through a window while all 3 remaining troops panic and one even shoots my own team in the back.Really confused as to how I am doing this so wrong. Still not finding it enjoyable at all.*update 2*Mission 3 and still being spoon fed exactly what I can do and where. Force fed a story I dont want as well. Refunded :(			"

												Truly a great successor to the first XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within.XCOM 2 has a story that is a lot more engaging compared to the first XCOM, and I managed to finish the entire campaign on Ubuntu within 51 hours on Veteran. That's a drastic improvement in content over the first XCOM, which could be completed in 20 hours on one playthrough.Gameplay mechanics have been improved quite drastically to keep things fresh each time you play a mission, and difficulty rises as you progress but does not feel insurmountable once you know what you are doing.Customizations for your soldiers really let's you get attached to your soldiers, and I even found myself scolding my ranger often for failing his Bladestorm attacks but never wanting him to be in harms way.The Linux port is very well made, with one caveat. Performance is not as good as I would have hoped, but I do trust that performance improvements will come in the near future. It is playable, but not as enjoyable in that aspect as it could be on a GTX680 at 1080p.The only last real caveat I feel the game suffers from is timer-based missions (gameplay mechanic). Some of them force you to abandon tactics, and sacrifice soldier's lives for the sake of completing the mission in-time. This is a turn-based game, but it feels like I'm being forced to play it like an RTS which is off-putting for those missions. Thankfully most main missions don't have these turn timers or have well-balanced timers.Overall, a worthy successor to XCOM EU & EW. Highly recommended for those that love strategy games, but even more so for those who do not define their libraries by genre but rather by engaging and well-made games! "

I open it and it immediately crashes. Looking at the crash logs it seems it cant locate some ressources.. well.. I guess no luck for me.I will attempt to reinstall it on a different machine, if the problem persists (I suspect Windows 10 being it) I will have to get a refund.Until then I do not recommend this game.

												This game feels like visiting one of your best friends from high school, but everyone told him he was awesome, so he's decided to change. He's the same physical person, but he likes different things, has a different sense of humor, and he is a sore loser at games and often cheats. That's how XCOM 2 feels compared to XCOM. It's not more of the same, but instead it throws out the well balanced strategy layer I and others found fun, and it replaces it with a chaotic mess with a timer that can randomly tick up faster certain months. The resource restrictions feel more annoying than enjoyable, and much of the game feels scripted, the opposite of what any XCOM game should feel like.In all honesty, I take this personally. I love XCOM and have bought it on PC for myself and others, on XBox, and even on iPhone. This was a day one purchase, but I've put off playing it because it feels like the game is upset with me playing it. The game is no longer well balanced for Iron Man mode and seems to encourage save scumming instead.To be honest, because I want to beat it and see the ending, I've been playing on Beginner difficulty (with Iron Man selected because I enjoy the perma death aspect still). I've almost beaten it in my sixth game. I've lost five games on normal difficulty and had to resort to beginner just to have a chance, and it's still hard.XCOM 2 feels like playing a game with a child who cheats and changes the rules. What hurts my feelings is that my favorite game is XCOM, so this feels like an old friend who has changed who he is for no reason and has become a sore loser to boot.			"

												I would recommend this game, and for people who truly enjoy strategy games, science fiction, strategy, and cheesy storylines, I would still recommend it - but for numerous reasons, to the general rpg and strategy player, I simply can't provide my recommendation of XCOM2. Here's why.First of all, the game is incredibly demanding on PC resources - so much so that even with a near top-of-the-line air-cooled rig, I run it on low settings. It is buggy and crashes occasionally. There are frame drops and hiccups. I had issues with the cinematics when it was first installed - sound would play out of sync, and sometimes the cinematics wouldn't show at all.Secondly, it is overpriced for what you get. The DLCs add very little to the game, and the rewards from completing them are quite hefty from a resource-cost standpoint. Even if you forego all of the DLC, on Commander+ difficulties you will find yourself grinding missions simply to get more resources before the final assault. Throw in the DLC rewards, and you will very quickly realize just how much of a grind XCOM2 can be.Third, there are no *real* choices in XCOM2. When you have access to three guerrilla operations, you are merely choosing between the best reward in most cases (which is typically fairly obvious.) Outside of that, your only choices will be whether or not to spend intel to buy a weapon upgrade on the black market, or spend resources on your ranger shotguns instead of sharpshooter sniper rifles. Missions are completely linear, and some missions are literally impossible to complete thanks to cheating AI and random spawn locations. (One time I spawned on a map with four alien groups that triggered simultaneously the following turn, even if I didn't move.)There are no alternate endings besides success and failure. Missions do not change much even on new playthroughs - you will meet new aliens at approximately the same times and in the same order. There are only three or four game-progress missions that *require* completion. The rest are time wasters and provide a slow trickle of resources...which are the only real impediment to your progress. Player skill and good decision making will not impact your completion speed much - only the random rolls for whether or not you get downed UFO missions will influence that.It becomes painfully obvious eventually - 95% of the missions are simply obstacles to your progress within the game, and barely feel like they *are* the game. They're more like a house fly that won't stop landing on your arm. Your actual success or failure depends not on completing these missions, but rather on whether or not you have the resources to obtain region contacts to reach the missions you *need* to progress. This lack of importance makes 95% of the game - the mass of meaningless missions - feel like the filler on a one-hit-wonder music album.If I were to rate XCOM2, I'd give it a 6/10. It's not a terrible game by any means, and I know a lot of work went into it, but it seems like they never finished it. Maybe they expected the mod community to do the work for them...maybe they figured they'd make their money back and some more, and that'd be enough. But the lack of RPG-type customizeability on soldiers, the apparent meaninglessness of most missions, and the on-rails story really ruins what would otherwise be a solid turn-based strategy game.

												This game probably has a lot of potential, but it's too broken to know for sure.  Many times I would have a soldier aim at one enemy, but then shoot at another one that I didn't intend because of some glitch.  The camera has an odd tendency to slowly drift on its own when you're planning a movement or aiming a grenade which results in leaving your soldier in the open or missing a toss.  Whenever an NCP in the game talks to you on the radio, you're not able to take any action, and there is ALOT of radio chatter, which is usually reminding you of mission objectives that you already know or telling you about the mission timer of which you're already well aware.  There is an option that makes it seem like you can reduce this needless dialogue, but it has no noticeable effect, making missions last much longer than they need to and adding frustration to the already broken system.  It's disappointing to have the experience ruined by game glitches, bugs, and wasted time, and until they fix these problems, I cannot recommend playing this game.  Was very excited for XCOM 2, but ultimately very disappointed and frustrated.			"

												This brief review comes from an old time veteran of UFO games going all the way back to the 90s. Being a great fan of the relaunched Xcom the second installment was an autobuy. And I am very confident they will eventually patch it to where it should be, but...Even on easiest setting some of the missions are extremely hard - mainly due to the RNG gameplay mechanics built into the core mechanics: I've had to reload for literally 2 evenings to finish one of the missions because of flaws in my team that I simply could not have prevented as a player. And that comes from a ironman player of Xcom 1. I have no qualms with being punished for stupid gameplay - in Xcom2 I am constantly reloading simply because stuff happens that I have absolutely no control over.The alien opponents seemingly use their maximum movement range and still melee attack - or they have insane range. And why Aliens get an out of turn movement phase when they are surprised by my team beats me. Result as so often is that they can essentially flank the hell out of me without my team even being able to reposition. The timers are extremely tight and often enough I had to restart missions all the way from the beginning simply because I had that one turn missing to finish the extraction. I even had to leave folks behind due to the constantly reapearing aliens - without my guys having a fair chance to fight their way out. No one left behind? Not in Xcom2. And don't get me even started on the hit/cover percentages... Let's say it this way: they really need some love.Story and core combat of the game are great and absolutely addicting. It's just not really polished for the player yet. But I am sure it will happen over time and then my hesitant ""NO"" will become an overwhelming ""YES""... until then: you either have to be a lucky star OR masochistic. Or both...			"

												While I'm still playing through the campaign, I can say that XCOM 2 is overall a well-made game, but there are some downsides with it. For me, mainly two: the game isn't as optimised as it should be, I'm running a 650 Ti 2GB currently but I feel like it should be able to run the game at higher frames (although the game has never outright crashed). I also feel like the difficulty of the game needs some tweaking - I've been playing on the second difficulty and it feels too punishing in certain areas. If you make one mistake in your research, mission choices or facility choices, you can find yourself in completely frustrating situations, like not having enough squad member slots, or wasting all your money on new soldiers because you didn't buy the facility needed to use the speed boost that heals your current soldiers faster and in time for the next mission. Once you realise your weaknesses and start trying to correct them down the road, the Avatar counter will keep ticking up as expected, not giving you enough time unless you want the red bar almost completely filled by the time you're prepared for the mission.Making these types of oversights can make the game extremely tedious unless you constantly revert saves, which isn't how you want to play it. You can find yourself saving after every mission so you can revert to any point of the game and change your choices so that you can avoid the problem that made you revert in the first place.Overall, good game for strategy players and one that improves on Enemy Unknown. Don't buy if your graphics card is old or if you don't want to constantly revert saves or constantly lose all time and effort you invested into your playthrough.(Yes, I understand XCOM is meant to punish bad decisions, but personally I feel it went too far in that direction and could have been more forgiving at least a few times, especially on the first two difficulties).P.S. I wrote this review for the Pillar of Community badge.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown - the complete version is one of my most favorite games of the recent past. I played it on my PS3, PC/MAC, and my iPad. Hell, I still play it on my iPad. I then got into the Long War mod, and I couldn't play the base game anymore (except my iPad). XCOM 2 had some large shoes to fill. Did it?I think it did. Let me first put a disclaimer up. I didn't experience any crashes or game ending bugs. I somehow missed all of those. Sure, I had some slowdowns and long loads, but no crashes. Very few bugs at all. I don't even have that great of a system, but that's besides the point.I love XCOM 2. It took me a while to accept the timers, but when I did, I got over one of the few qualms I had with the game.I love the new story. We lost to the Aliens. How refreshing. We are having to fight back and try to re-conquer our world. AWESOME. We have new mission types, and we use the hellicarrier from the Aveng....  er... floating alien transport ship instead. We are a guerilla force out to exact revenge as we uncover the plot of the story. The unit rebalance and customization is great. The new gameplay is great. The timers... um, not so much. But then we have mods.Oh the mods, the glorious mods. After downloading a dozen, I can't play the base game anymore. The modders are making this game even better. How would I score this game? Hmm, I would certainly recommend it, but players need to accept that the RNG is brutal. Really brutal, and the game is harder than XCOM:EU was. Is it as hard as the LW mod? No, but it can be on the highest difficulty.I have many more thoughts about it and if you are interested in reading them, here's a link: http://explorminate.net/2016/03/04/friday-excursion-xcom-2/Have fun commander, and if you want to know what mods are a must, just comment here and I will let you know what I use.

												It's the same game as X-COM 1, but with more constant, annoying interruptions from Captain Sweater(now mildly grizzled) and, somehow, worse storytelling. It'd also be nice to be able to click a button without a damn cutscene. It feels like the game also aggressively wastes my time every time I take an action, by trying to extend them with as many animation flourishes as possible. It's neat the first, to be positive, ten times, but after that it just makes you wish the game would get on with it.I eagerly await when Firaxis will start releasing actual games again, rather than full-conversion mods of stuff they've already done, while pretending they've actually spent time programming and designing(Looking at you, Civ: Beyond Earth).If you're buying this at full price, you're being cheated, because there's practically nothing in here that a crew of modders could not have added to X-COM 1 over the course of a few months, and most of the actual mechanics changes are negligible or, incredibly enough, make the game worse.

												Firstly - it's buggy REALLY buggy. It used to be fine. A patch about a month ago messed it up and now it stutters and crashes. Check my Steam profile, 600+ games. This and  ""Bully"" (which is listed as not for Windows 10 my OS) the only two that crash. If you have AMD graphics we are lead to believe your results will be much better. Maybe Firaxis hate Nvidia? Who knows?Then the nonsense ""tank rush"" mentality of the game itselfLead your squad through rushed missions where common sense applies only where the developer thought it would make the game more ""Doom"" and less ""XCom"". Rush against deadlines that make no sense -  build massive bases artound your craft that the aliens - who have technology far in advance of the level humanity will reach in decades time - for some reason cannot see despite 1005 satellite coverage - ,but then watch as those same aliens develop a 2nd sight and somehow manage to start the ""turn clock"" the minute you disembark from your papier mache landing craft. Yes it makes sense if you can twiost your logic around corners and give the devs enbough rope to hang themselves withThe question reamins WHY was it needed in the first place. Why turn a turn based strategy into a  turn based tank-rush?Loving playing the original on my PC and  Ipad Pro. Stopped playing this after a week.			"

												Finished the game on Commander+Ironman (second highest difficulty).The turn timers are fine, grenades and mimic beacons let you play agressively while you enjoy the destruction you cause instead of boring overwatch camping all the time.Don't hate the game because you are bad, try to improve your skill!It does have performance issues though.

												The game's current state is aweful. Constant crashes, FPS drops, stuttering, etc. You name it, this game suffers from it. I ignored the problems and beat the game; now I wish I had just requested a refund when I had the chance. Don't give these people your money.A recent hotfix did very little. Someone, either the devs or the publisher, made a huge mistake here. Just, please, save your money and go elsewhere. At the very least, if you do buy this game, test it out and if you have any problems, promptly hit that refund button.			"

												I put a few hundred hours into a modded XCOM (Long War) and loved it. XCOM2 is better is so many ways. Obviously it's not quite balanced and optomised yet, but it's onyl fresh off the market. A patch or two and some modding will make it amazing. Everyone goes on about the turn timers. This is not an issue on normal difficulty. It adds more strategy imo. I often use a soldier with the extra concealment perks, and let them run ahead out of sight to get to these objectives.My biggest hates: - The Advent moving like power ranger enemies with rediculous arm gestures.- The SLOW time between turns- Not being able to focus on completing tasks in the main control centre - always getting urgent pop ups. - No easy way to generate Intel to expand communications.As i said though, almost everything else is an improvement for me. This game will be solid in a few months.			"

												Almost unplayable...I'm running an AMD 8350, GTX970, and 8GB of ram.  Not the absolute best system, but it handles pretty much everything I throw at it at a playable fps on high (not max) settings depending on the game.  XCOM 2 is worst in terms of performance.  I've been able to chug through about good number of hours with the horrible framerate drops.  I'm at a point where in a mission my FPS is running at around 10-15 fps at minimum settings... that's right, at minimum.  It's constant - not even a drop in fps.  I honestly can't believe it and I'm very disappointed.  I loved EU/EW and sunk a lot of hours in those games (just look at my profile).  The gameplay itself is very fun and just like the first Xcom, intense.  I like the mechanics quite a bit and love the extra customization features.  Just the performance... ugh....I sincerely hope for an optimization patch, until then I'm afraid I'm gonna shelf this one for a while.  I honestly would not recommend buying this until they fix these issues.			"

												Scum saving is the only way you will survive this game. After all, do you really think I will allow a character I have spent hours building just to die because a big goo monster appears in front of him and swipes him dead in one shot? F(*k that!It is very unbalanced and the odds will NEVER be in your favour. .The gameplay is entertaining, tense and exciting, however the amount of times I throw the mouse because I miss a 90% shot from 1 metre away.......and then scum load...to miss again!.Missions get very repetitive. Land here, attack this and extract here. And you don't seem to get time to do anything. You are always trying to dig up some intel or something and a UFO lands somewhere else or a dark mission pops. So frustrating..Some balance is needed so that scum saving is not needed..... "

												Purchased this on sale. This is the first game I have ever requested a refund on.The AI and the L.O.S bugs as well as a screwed up RNG make this game impossible to enjoy. You can't adapt your strategy and learn form your mistakes as the RNG screws you over and if that does not hurt you, then the L.O.S bugs will.Try to lay an ambush with multiple guys behind cover? Good luck, your guys get hit with insta-kill behind multiple walls. 2 missions in, 4 hours of game time and still no means to enjoy it.			"

												It's like they attempted to throw every idea they had into a melting pot, but implemented every single idea in such a way as to specifically annoy the player.-Turn timers that are barely long enough to complete the mission, or sometimes are so long you can ignore them, and you have no idea which is which.-A spawning system that places groups of enemies in the exact worst places, resulting in critical mission failure because you trigger three groups at the same time for reasons you couldn't possibly see coming.-Soldier levelling options that force you to make Hobson's choices between useful abilities and not-useful ones, screwing you over if you accidentally pick the one that isn't useful.-Soldier levelling options that deprive you of useful abilities on a specific soldier, resulting in needing to bring two specialists along because you can't both hack robotic units and be able to revive and heal your teammates.-A stealth system that is hilariously useless. Bypassing enemies will just result in you being pincered every time, when it's even possible in the first place. The aliens will actually pause their patrol path while you're close to them, and then resume it as soon as you move forward, resulting in them walking right up and seeing you - even if you waited 15 turns with them just standing there, the instant you move, they move too!-Grenades have to be engineered one at a time. Soldier armors and weapons do not. What?-Overworld pacing is horrible. Nothing can wait. If you try to finish up a task you have an hour remaining on, the game will immediately say ""No, you have to do this now!"" Ignore that and you inexplicably lose an entire region. I guess extracting that VIP was critical to the resistance's very survival or something, and it couldn't wait an hour, even though it takes you six hours to fly there.-They tried to make the game much harder, and make you have to deal with soldier losses instead of just reloading every time. Unfortunately, with the value of skilled soldiers, you're screwed if your A Team dies, so...-General performance issues. Long loading times.-Every time anything happens, the game locks your input and zooms over to it. This includes things like a soldier returning to cover, a soldier changing weapons, a soldier saying something after killing something (in which case the game waits 2-3 seconds!), a new enemy being spotted (sometimes multiple times in the same turn), a civilian dying, anything. While the total time is neglegible, it's just long enough to become annoying. It's astounding how they seem to figure out a way to get the game to wait exactly long enough for you to be annoyed.By far my biggest complaint, though, is the difficulty. No, the game is not too hard. No, the game's not too easy. It's both. Yes, both. This game does not have a difficulty curve. I'd be tempted to say it has a difficulty sine wave, but that's not true either. A sine wave is predictable. This game has a difficulty scribble. Certain missions are ungodly hard for no reason I can adequately determine - I've had to reload and restart some missions eight times while playing on normal - and other missions are laughably easy. The easiest mission I've had so far is a BASE DEFENSE. How screwed up is that? There are almost no missions I can remember that had a difficulty that was just right. Everything is either too hard or too easy. The things that make this game difficult aren't facing tough, smart enemies who will move to flank you - it's when the game decides to throw you a mission with three groups of enemies all clustered in the same place right around the VIP you have three turns to extract.I'm having some fun with it, but this game isn't worth the price being asked. It needs serious balancing and many patches, perhaps a complete difficulty and mechanic overhaul, before it would be worth anything like the asking price.It's astounding to me that they screwed up this badly. I had the utmost confidence in them. XCOM 1 had issues, but it was a fun game. It wasn't annoying. This game is annoying. And that's horrible - it's one thing for a game to be bad, but annoying? I'm so disappointed. :/			"

												I wanted to love this game. I was excited for the hype. I made my name doing Let's Play videos of XCOM:LW. Someone donated to me the $80 pre-order edition. I hyped it up for a year before it was released. I made over 150 customized soldiers before even starting the campaign. It had so much potential.I'm going to try and keep this brief, so that I don't lose too many people.- If you loved XCOM:EU/EW/LW: All strategies you learned in that game you will be punished for in this one.- I got this game to fight aliens, not timers. The timers are overwhelming and ruin the game.- The storyline is the least important part of the game. The strategy even less important.- The stealth mechanic they hyped up forever? Completely useless in every way in every encounter except for the very first attack. After that it might as well not exist.- Everything I love is dead.EDIT: So I went back to it, through huge recommendations from my stream. I played all the way until the last mission on Ironman Legendary. My opinions of it haven't changed. The game is programmed to cheat if you're doing too well. Firaxis had no interest in balance or fun. The community is so masochistic as to be toxic if you're not enjoying the game punishing you for trying to HAVE fun. 100% artificial difficulty instead of any actual strategy involved, and a community that is so used to being told, ""If you're losing you're just not good enough"" that they can't see bad design when they're being beaten with it.Firaxis: You did so well on XCOM:EU and EW. What the hell went wrong?			"

												Could've used a bit more patching up before being released, but the issues (for most people it seems) are performance wise and not liking the new mechanics, such as the timed turns etc. But luckily there are already mods to fix some of these things, and in time, with patches and great mods, this game will take its place among its legendary predecessors.

												If you like Enemy Unknown you will love this. From what I have played, it's basically a tuned up version of that with much better customization. hat said, if you really hated EU then I probably would not bother with this.The only real gripe I have is that it's poorly optimized with frame rate issues, but turn of AA and it certainly improves things but if that bothers you, wait a few weeks. Otherwise, I highly recommend this game.			"

												In Xcom 2 Firaxis have done what many thought impossible and improved on almost every aspect of Xcom EU. And if you are a fan of turn based stratagy games then this is a must-have purchase. That being said however, It does have it's drawbacks.Pros:1. Far, far deeper customisation for your soldiers, now being able to choose things such as face paint, camouflage and individual options for the torso, legs and arms of their armour.2. Randomly generated levels meaning that you won't play the exact same level multiple times like in EU.3. Consealment. Now when you start most missions you are in consealment meaning the enemies don't know that you're there, Allowing you to move without being attacked and set up abushes.4. Strong class system requireing you to think tactically about who you bring on each mission and what equptment to give them.5. Much improved Visuals.6. Mod support.7. More varied enemys with unique abilities to each other.8. More methods of going about the task than just shooting. You can now use a specialist to hack robotic units, or use a ranger to deal massive amount of damage with their sword.9. More mission types. The missions are no longer just kill everything or escort someone across a map. There are new objectives such as destorying a communications relay. Breaking VIPs out of prison or having to carry an unconcious VIP across the map to the extraction zone.10. Almost fully destructable environments. Is there an enemy flanking one of your soldiers while on a rooftop, and there is no way that you can shoot it to death in that turn? Get a grenade and blow up the floor beneith it! making it take the grenade damage, fall damage, and if you're lucky, fire damage from the building begining to burn down.Cons:1. Clipping issues. Soldiers will often fire through solid walls, break windows that have already been broken, or standing on absolutly nothing in order to shoot an enemy while positioned on a ledge.2. Performance issues. For some unexplained reason this game is far more demanding than it deserves to be, or that the reccommended settings say it is. Unless you turn off MSAA then it WILL lag. Even without MSAA it will still lag, jusst not as much.3. long load times. Even on an SSD, expect load times to be 30 seconds+. While it is understandable on the way to the missions due to generating teh map, on the way back the load times are even longer. An issue that can inexplicably be fixed by pressing the 'Caps Lock' button which makes it load almost instantly.4. Mod support. While I said that it is a good thing that it has it, it has been implimented in a way that means that any mod you turn on creates a dependancy for that mod in that save. This means if you install a mod, play a mission with it an descover you don't like it then you either need to keep playing with it, revert back to a save before you had it, or with Ironman player, restart the game.5. Steep dificulty curve. While in Xcom EU the first 3 missions would be fighting sectiods, then they intoduce thin men who can spit poison, on Xcom 2 the first 2 missions are fighting nice, weak enemies, then suddenly the introduce sectiods in the 3rd which can panic and mind control your soldiers. In the 5th mission the introduce vipers that can grab your soldiers from 7 tiles away and pull them out of cover. The game gets very hard, very quickly.6. Mission timers. Most missions now have a timer for you to finish them in before you fail and are either force evacuated or captured by the aliens. The problem is that they give you usually less than 10 turns to kill about 12 aliens, finish the objective then get to a set evac zone on the other side of the map. Another problem is that most of the reasons for the counters are 'drop ships are coming to attack you' or 'the aliens have rigged this thing to explode' but when you enter the missions you're consealed so there is no reason for the countdown timer to start in that case.Although I listed almost as many cons as pros, the good things that the pros bring by far outweigh the badness of the cons, and none of the cons are things that can't be fixed in updates or by mods. And yes, this is a difficult game and I have rage quit it many times, but i'm not going to be pathetic and post a negative review, just because I wasn't thinking tactially enough to get myself out of those situations.

												Please ignore this review if you are new to turn-based tactic games. Just set lowest difficulty and enjoy the game.Pros:- Looks good- Sounds good- Well balanced- Can hack turretsCons:- Hit chance seems to be calculated by alien algorythms. 85% and below means about 50%. Don't bother reloading save and changing position - game already decided that you'll miss.- Alien ""patrols"" are not patrolling, they just heading in the direction of your squad.- No point to ambush enemies. You trade hit chance bonus (which is counetered by Overwatch penalty) with your turn. - Enemies spawn in groups just like in previous XCOM.- Three of the above making stealth entirely pointless.- Haking is pure random. You HAVE to pick bonus that lower feedback threshold, even if you don't want that bonus.- High difficulty. Very high.- Loooong level loadings and other performance problems.There is no tactics, It just ""random this, random that"". I don't want to give it up, but I am not enjoying it.			"

												FIrstly, I need to start by saying that I love the XCOM series and have played each and every one of them for endless hours over the years. However, XCOM2, despite having fantastic new game mechanics, is rendered virtually unplayable due to ridiculous framerate issues and mission load times. The recent patch did not improve the situation whatsoever. Simple gameplay is made frustrating and this ongoing issue has totally taken the joy out of the game. Even throwing a generade is hazardous due to the lagging interface, and so ironman styled games are almost out of the question. Simple navigation around the avenger is frustrating also. Mission load times are more often than not, extremely long. I can go make a cup of coffee whilst waiting for missions to load from the skyranger, reminding me of the days I would load my hotmail inbox using a 56k modem. I love this game, and I want to sink endless hours into it. However, whilst these performance issues persist, I cannot recommend you buy this game. You will be paying full price for a half finished product. Go play some Enemy Within whilst the devs sort this out.			"

												XCOM 2 PC review: Well I tried for 13 hours and it’s not very often I quit a game especially a game like this where I loved UFO Defense, Terror from the Deep, EU and EW but I can’t take it anymore. This game has WAY too many time constraints and timed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that all it does is ruin the gameplay. Here is a quick list of all the timed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I came across: loot, crates, consoles, missions timers, vip timers, avatar project timer and hostages (doesn’t really count because it’s in every game but it’s one more timer on your shoulder). There are some people who like this style so more power to you but this is just not fun to me what so ever. There were some cool new elements in the game that I liked but it was just completely overshadowed by all the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I hope the next game does not follow this same time limit garbage because that is an absolute game killer for me. ♥♥♥♥ this world and ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

												- Enemies see and attack through walls- There's basicaly no height advantage since everyone can see everyone and aim perfectly through the roofs, walls etc.. more than ridiculous.- Patrols are triggered without seeing you, only because your guy noticed them 5 miles away- You noticed the enemy? Don't worry you won't get any tactical advantage since they always see you as well, get a free turn to position themselves behind covers. Lazy lazy programming and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design.- Removed secondary weapons because too much tactical depth. You have to reload your plastic guns every few turns.- There's nothing that makes sense for this game being a PC exclusive, as it's basicaly an overall dumbed down experience.- They were praising Long War all this time, but made basically no changes to the overall formula. There was a massive amount of improvements in Long War that they were very much unable to include in the sequel.- Turn timers for each mission... GOTTA GO FAST. GOTTA GO ♥♥♥♥ING FAST. THERE'S STILL 5 ENEMIES ♥♥♥♥ING YOU UP AND ONLY 3 MORE TURNS AVAILABLE BECAUSE REASONS.- No optimalization aka game runs like♥♥♥♥♥br>- 3 of my soldiers were killed by exploding walls while shooting in the overwatch stance- Awesome Enemy Unknown music was replaced by a stereotypical hollywood strings.- You can't realistically hide in this game, because even if you are positioned behind a solid concrete building, waiting to ambush an enemy, you are instantly exposed and being shoot through the walls. I can't even imagine what kind of people design their games in firaxis. It's just unreal.			"

												First of all, as many have begun with: I really loved XCOM EU. I was hooked, no question about it; I set myself offline on Steam and Skype just to keep playing, and didn't regret not seeing the light of day. And even, to top it off, the only surviving soldier from the very beginning became my first Psi soldier, and she ended up triggering the final cutscene - MVP? Definitely. I was fully invested in the most understated sense possible. However, this game, whilst it's definitely not a bad game, doesn't have the same level of connection to me. Whilst I get that the beginning levels of a game shouldn't be unfailable, nor should they feel like the halfway point of the previous title in the franchise. I get the whole ""You've lost the war, you're on the backfoot; survive."" sort of thing, and I like it in concept, but in action it just feels poorly done. I neither feel like I'm the underdog - since I'm getting to every conflict on my side of the globe with six soldiers, a flying boat, and a ♥♥♥♥-ton of grenades - nor am I the remnants of a super-efficient private war unit - since I've got a scientist, a girl who makes her colleagues do everything, and a commander who won the award for ""Most cliche, expressionless soldier"" at the army's summer ball. It just doesn't feel like XCOM. The aliens have really ramped up their abilities too; of course this makes sense, but towards the end of XCOM EU this felt like a tactical issue rather than a resigned ""Yup"". My skirmishes go somewhat like this: ""Alright, okay, everyone in position. Twelve turns to move this MVP and the squad up to the evac point (which could have literally been on top of us, but okay). Put these guys into position over there annndd ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥. Okay, we'll flank h- ♥♥♥♥. You're mind controlled are you? Okay, right, he's floating in the air."" and so on. That floating in the air bit actually happened at a point where two of my soldier were side-by-side on a church rooftop, which got blown out from underneath them. One fell to their death, the other just calmy stood up there, not being able to move off of the nothing that he was now perched on.In summary: it's frustrating, it's slow, and it's definitely not the sequel to XCOM EU.But since I'm not one for spoiling things, I'll let you find out about the performance issues yourself.

XCOM 2 is the second BIG triple A title to come out this year and so far the year looks good for PC gamersXCOM 2 is a TBS (turn-based strategy) game and the improved sequel to 2012's reboot of the series, XCOM: Enemy Unknown.The story picks up 20 years after the events of the previous game. Aliens have taken over the Earth and it is your duty to reclaim our planet.All your favourate character classes are back: Snipers, Assault, Heavies and support.Heavie is now called the Grenadier and, as the name suggests, now carries a powerful and upgradable grenade launcher as well as the good 'ol minigun you already know from the previous game.Snipers now have a powerful pistol they can use as well as their usual long range sniper rifle.Support is now known as the Specialist and they have a military drone that can hack into the enemy's network, heal teammates or electrocute enemies.Assault is now called Ranger and they wield swords. You read that right. Swords, baby, swords! Hack 'n' slash through the alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who shot down your ride!You can now customise all of your soldiers tho. You can change their sex, name, nationality, voice, hairstyle and colour, armor style, colour, camo and same for weapons. You can even download mods from the Steam Workshop to take customisation to the next level.I had a tough military looking guy in my squad. His name was Arny ""GetToDaChoppa"" Commando and he used the Arnold Schwarzenegger Voice Pack. Amazing!R.I.P Arny Commando. You'll be missed.Your base is now an alien spaceship. You can fly it around the Earth to collect supplies, build resistance radio towers, contact and join your forces with the resistance in different countries, visit the Black Market and go on missions.Where we’re going, we don't need roads.Remember collecting resources with the Normandy in Mass Effect 2? That's basically how the ""Earth map"" plays out in XCOM2. It may sound like there's much to do on that map but there really isn't. Fortunatelly you don't spend too much time there. It's a cool addition but near the end i realised how repetitive and boring it really was and it just turned into a chore after a while. It's still a cool addition tho. I just wish there was a bit more to do on that map and that they wouldn't spam counsel missions that much.What more can i say? The graphics are improved. The gameplay is exactly the same as in the previous title which is good. There were couple of graphical glitches and i experienced 2 crashes in my 38 hours of gameplay but overall i'd say  that XCOM 2 had a pretty good launch (which seems to be rare in this day and age) and is an absolute joy to play. Definitely a must buy for all strategy fans.Buy it now and start savescumming! "

												Xcom 2 retains most of the same formula as its previous game except this time they added more, The enemies are stronger, tougher, and smarter and made missions much more faster paced. Humanityhas new ways to fight from new technology to even strategy on the field. Xcom is even more bad♥♥♥♥♥than before and adds so much more. It starts off a bit hard, gets harder and then pisses you off if you've made the wrong choices or just bad but still a good game. Video Review

			Loving the sequel to this right now, It's the same formula but moar! more tech more weapons, more strategy, more aliens and more miss on 80% faceshots!		

Graphics The graphics is improved in this version of the game while still using the same engine and a beefier pc is needed to run it although it isn't drop dead gorgeous it still looks very good. At the same time there are some performance issues for the game even for me running a Titan and higher end processor but it is minuscule and the situation seems like it can be fixed via patches.The environment is more detailed and come in many different varieties all over the world towns, cities, snow, rain, sand etc. Sounds and music New alien sounds and voice acting in the game along with some returning familiar voices. The guns sounds great and new alien devices just blows your eardrums with its creative sci fi fx along with thier speeches. Accompanying this are also some great voice acting which goes does a really great job for the story. The music pieces for this game is phenomenal and gets your adrenaline going. StorylineThe story is much more action packed this time around and explosive along with time sensative missions. Most of the game is accompanied by cut-scenes but there are also in game chatter between characters to let players understand the lore and situation of what has has been happening to the world in the past years. There are also archives and logs players can go throughto discover and read to obtain more insights. The aliens are up to something but what exactly play it and fondle thier plans.GameplayThe game pretty much follows the same formula from the previous Xcom game except the r.n.g the game (Random number generator) during shots seems alot more improved (Sorta LOL)_. You can still of course miss shots at 40% or even 50% but it doesn't happen ALL THE DAMN TIME! Although 80% chance to shoot in the face can still miss lol.Along with the returning gameplay there is more strategy and the action is faster paced since there are many missions which are turn sensative (many of them). The new concealment system helps player plan ambushes on the battlefield and also strategize ambush attackson the aliens before they can react along with new devices to scout, technology to upgrade, guns, armors and even environment hacking  to buff your units or debuff enemies  for a better chance to fight back. There are also plenty of new class promotions, skills and load out for characters. The enemies this time are tougher, harder and even more annoying. They will bind you, poison you, shoot lasers at you, mind control you,teleport around you, aoe you, blow you up and kick your teeth in, thankfully you can retaliate.Everything is randomized as usual even your start location so you don't really know whats going to happen as you play the game because your planning on resources will have to be appropriate for the counter. Sometimes it can start out smooth or harsh but it all depends on what you invest in and your choice. Pros + Graphics looks much better maxed out on the pc.+ Much of the same formula and gameplay, improved rng+ environmental destruction improvement adds so much to the strategy including grounds building floors blowing up which can create win conditions.+ New Concealment system, More weapons, technology and loadout and class trees with stats to help in the battle against the aliens.+ Emphasis on the base building of choices you can invest in to get stronger. The choice is yours but the wrong investment can spell your downfall. Go for Supplies? More scientists? Engineers? or keep attacking?+ Your base is now a badass mothership, and even called avengers at times I thought it was the avenger ship+ Randomized missions and more side missions, the aliens COUNTER ATTACKS this time too.+ Many new types of alien enemies and they look damn good. They'll knock you around like pebbles.+ Multiplayer with ranks, quickmatches and custom games.+ Mods support+ Close your windows, shut your doors, hundreds of hours galore Cons - Some performance issue in certain areas and a bit of stutter/fps drops (miniscule such as loadout and lifting off) - hopefully they patch this up!- Some graphic clippings, enemy clipping walls, you making wierd shots, invisible guns but miniscule things due to engine.- even though the rng is better a bit with the new buff skills, you can still miss an enemy while standing in thier face with 80% chance of shot lol.- Most missions have move times, its super rough if you aren't fast. This can♥♥♥♥♥♥off some slow people who can't react to the pace that wants to take thier time. Recommended for you is easy so don't play veteran- Camera during the attacks can be a bit wonky aims at wierd places which can throw view off a bit.- The chatting between characters can cut off quick if you press a button on the menu too soon on the ships before you can listen in on them or sometimes it overlaps other voices.- Can't think of anything else- Oh god they're taking over my mind- I can't move- must.... call... for... help... xcom.... mayday			"

												The developers hype a game that showcases stealth and ambush tactics, then force us the do a run-n-gun playstyle 90% of the time as we are barely able to make the timed objectives.  Why didnt you just make a first person shooter?  This is NOT an enjoyable strategy game as it is.The graphics are jumpy and give stupidly low frames per second. I think I actually got down to 1 fps during the class intro sequences.  Also, why do we have to watch the inside of the skyranger for 5 minutes while it flies back to base? Slow and sloppy. I went to change the loadout of my troops and got ""stuck"", I was unable to back out back to the mission prep screen, had to shut the game down.I am debating a refund request.  I would advise you to seriously consider waiting to purchase this game.  There is no way I will ever preorder a firaxis game again. This game is not worth $60. "

												This is not a fun and strategical anymore even I have no problem with Save/Load 10 times per single mission :)Biggest thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off are missions limited by Turns counter. Ie. You have 8 turns to do something or you loose. 8 turns mean that all strategy is gone. 8 turns mean that strategy missions turned into run competition with lots of Save/Load, because you have no time to approach carefully and strategically.I have no problem with missions limited by Turns counter (It was fine with previous XCOM), but in XCOM2 it is crazy. Even I am playing on second difficulty.I played all previous xcom (DOS one included :)), but this version of xcom do not give me THE Xcom feeling anymore :/			"

												I really want to like this game. I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about the difficulty which is really inconsistent in my opinion, but I will comment on it.I don't play a game like this with the idea of winning through failure. I like reloading and trying new strategies out. Sometimes reloading resets the RNG, sometimes it stays exactly the way it is whether your moves are the same or not. This gets frustrating in some situations like: moving your troops to better hit the enemy, moving your troops to avoid being hit, or running to try to complete the mission.So basically I find 95% of the time no matter what my moves are, if I miss 4 times in a row the first time I try, it will happen no matter my % of hitting or where my troops are. That doesn't feel good: I've reloaded a single spot 25+ times and every option comes with 2-4 misses and minimal damage, while every retaliation 1-shots one of my units. Besides personally irritating, it seems completely scripted to me.Otherwise the building transparancy gets frustrating a lot. I don't think it ""ghosts"" through buildings half the time I need it to, only to not figure out how to get it to work. Overall the game has a great concept but the overall player experience is sooooooo irritating my desire to play wears thinner every time I play it.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown successfully revived an old, mishandled series by taking the core of what made the classics so great and boiling it down into a much more accessible formula. This reboot did a good job of gently introducing its ideas and mechanics while retaining the challenge that is part of the series’ identity. If XCOM: Enemy Unknown and its expansion were a well-oiled but slightly drab machine, XCOM 2 is a relative fire-spewing monster truck that could do with a good deal of repairs. Tons of changes that seem relatively small by themselves add up to make XCOM 2 a significantly different and more daunting game, and while many of these changes hit their mark, others go a bit wide, and the entire experience is hampered by persistent technical issues.Continue Reading[www.newgamenetwork.com] "

												XCOM 2 feels a lot like XCOM except they added bugs and removed a lot of the fun features we had in XCOM. Still an enjoyable playthrough. XCOM was better in all aspects in my opinion.If you liked XCOM, I would recommend playing that again instead of paying 60 bucks for XCOM 2. The XCOM 2 story is not as interesting and the gameplay is practically the same if not worse than XCOM.			"

												Finally fully finished a run of this game so I am now able to give a complete rundown of the game.This game takes the normal formula of an XCOM game and twists it to fit the guerilla warfare style of the story. While this is refreshing and forces to player to play far more offensively and aggressively there are some issues in doing so that I feel were not ironed out before launch as was left up to the modding community to fix.Story:The story opens with the Commander being rescued by his old advisor and reveals that Enemy Unknown/Within never happened at all and that it was a series of simulations done by the aliens immediately following the instant surrender of Earth after they captured the Commander. The story continues to unfold with the game and the decisions of the player but every so often key parts of the story open up and show that the aliens are actually doing bad things to humanity rather than actually helping them and culminates on a final assualt. A lot of people had a problem with how the first game was relegated to simulations but I find that outcome not only logical but hilarious considering that only 10% of people even beat Enemy Unknown at all with how easy that game is. My problem is that the stance of the aliens is barely explored at all throughout the game and only does get explored on the final mission.Gameplay:The gameplay is still the same at its core as it was in Enemy Unknown but with added features and elements. The main feature added is the Concealment mode. This allows your team to move around without enemies heatseeking them until you open fire or enter their field of view, which in turn allows you to set up an ambush.Along with concealment, some new features were added along with some new goodies, too. A lot of classes have been reworked from EU and gun attachments that augment how a specific soldier operates and new explosives and armor have been added as well. The main problem with the gameplay is how Concealment works logically with some of the timer missions. Why would they rig their own supplies to explode when they don't even know that XCOM is in the area?Graphics and Performance:This is where the game really falls apart. While the game as a whole looks pretty good, it performs like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ With a 970 memecard, I was getting huge frame issues on max settings even after the patch. Turning off ambient occlusion and reducing AA to FXAA helped a lot but there were still issues that caused it to dip into the 40s after turning off some partical effects as well.Audio and Music:The music is still roughly the same as it was in EU but sounds a lot more triumphant upon a victory than before, mainly due to being a tiny rebel force fighting a huge alien force that has the planet in its grasp. The audio is about as standard as it gets but voiceovers can NOT be skipped and during retaliation missions, Bradford never shuts up and continues to repeat the same unskippable dialogue over and over each turn.Other:There isn't much else to talk about aside from the modding community. While Firaxis left a lot of issues in the vanilla game, they made modding tools very open and acceisble to the community and they have done wonders for this game. From adding small aesthetic mods to full blown mods changing how Concealment and timers work, the modders have done good work and have effectively fixed all the issues of the game. This does not excuse Firaxis for releasing the game in the state it was, but it allows players to easily change the game to either their liking or just enough to fix some issues they have with some game mechanics. Keep it up, mod community. You guys do good work.Epilogue/tl;dr:Even with all the graphical and gameplay issues, the game is still solid and adds a great deal more content to play with and against and any issue a player might have with the game can be fixed with the click of a button in the workshop.WARNING: Adding a mod to a campaign and then removing it and attempting to continue playing will result in an error and bypassing that error may result the campaign corrupting or becoming unplayable.I give this game a solid 8/10 and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of XCOM, new or old, or strategy games in the vein of XCOM in general and would recommend those that aren't to at least give it a good shot.

												Good tactical game..is not a strategy game.At that it is more of a luck based game than a tactical one.It is a good sequel and has the xcom tactical spirit.  Frustrating things:- Enemies shooting through walls- vipers tongue grabbing or poison spitting through walls/ceilings- timed missions where the only win solution is to run and sacrafice soldiers..if you stop to engage enemies you will time out-Success is more luck than tacticsHere is the short story...it is a good game but luck is way more important than skill.  You will be punished even when you use good tactics.  The first few times it happens it is annoying, the 50th time a Viper tongue grabs your soldier from inside a train or a house..not only from all the way across the screen but though a wall, it gets..well...not fun.  Might not sound like a big deal but very often a singular event like that will result in the whole squad dying...which is great if you screwed up tactically.  It sucks when it is crappy game mechanics.I've given it a good go.  Not sure I can play to much more as is.  I like being rewarded when i play smart and getting smacked down when i screw up..too many times it works the opposite.			"

												Dont buy this through Steam. Forced updates will mean if Xcom does work well for you steam will terminate its ability to run on your machine (forced no way to stop the update etc). If the game does not perform well you can try and update. First game ever through Steam, but its constant ability to go online (I know - very simply - 'offline mode' does not work the game will go online). Its not even big brother I am bothered about, but its like having a friend kick you off your own machine and run off with all your games. Worst decision you'll make, get he box and DVD atleast you have something to return. Game was great, but you can only document what it looks like at the moment and Steam is crashing the game constantly now. 6 hours of trying to fix my poor old game. Better luck next time XCOM maybe you wont have updates or wont use steam, "

												First: Love the game, Love the gameplay and Xcom series is my favorite series of all time, by a very large margin.Having said that: This game is unplayable.  I'm playing with a Nvidia 4gig 460 GTX, and a 4.7ghz 8 core AMD cpu which should run this at a reasable rate.  Min settings: caps at 27 FPS.  Max settings (excep AA is turned way down) 25 FPS.  Something is just wrong there.  This, I could actually tolerate.However: The crashes are so prolific it's unplayable.  It crashed 3 times at different points in the tutorial, two of them during cutscenes.  Disabled tutorial, and I get 20-30 crashes per mission.  I can usually get 1-4 turns off before it hardlocks my PC.  I've went through about 40 hours of troubleshooting, and without a doubt it is the the game software.  It's not my hardware, it's not over heating, it's not drivers, it's not corrupted software.  The software itself repeatedly crashes on a significant number of people.Judging by the overwhelming number of compliants of poor performance and random crashes, it's clear they did not beta test this properly.

												This game runs very poorly on recommended/above recommended hardware, that alone leads me to in turn, not be able to recommend this title. (this will likely be fixed soon)Also the turn timer is limiting, and gets very tiresome after about the third mission. It's not fun when the game forces you to make decisions which are sub optimal. Especially when those decisions lead you to get burned from placing your hope in one diceroll, which was a perfect example of a misplay in EU/EW. The thing is I loved XCOM Enemy Unknown, I got enough enjoyment out of it to play for 200 hours. I don't consider myself very good at it, but I still tried and failed a few times until I became experienced enough with the game to complete Classic/Ironman. Obviously something kept me going to try again when I failed and I still had a good time even when I was playing poorly. This is not the case here.Between the performance issues and the game telling me I can't have any enjoyment on a level for more than 8-12 turns, this game is more of an exercise in frustration than it is fun. This game tells you exactly how it wants you to play it, and that can't deviated from whatsoever. Why not just put me in a level with minimal restrictions and let me discover for myself what works and what doesn't?If I could get a refund for this, I would. I can't recommend a title which is so tedious and frustrating to play as this happens to be.Honestly, it's a shame.			"

												So, Xcom 2 is here and people are asking ""How is it?""Overall it is a great game and a really nice improvement over the last Xcom game, but it is not perfect. Let's start off with the Negatives shall we? The game is not optimized very well and has some bugs, this seems to vary from person to person but there is no denying Firaxis needs to get to work on some performance fixes. I also had a few graphics bugs when my character goes to pick up his teammates when they are down and a few times the game has gone below 50 fps. No gamebreaking bugs and the performance issues have not been disasterous but they are there and should def be mentioned.With all that said, shall we get to the positives now? There is alot of them so let's get started. First off there are some wonderful additions that really add to the gameplay and overall enjoyment of the game. The animations and graphics are also better, not drastically huge improvement but without a doubt things are smoother and tighter as far as how the game looks. There is a bunch of other new features that add to the game and make it feel like a well thought out sequel instead of just more of pretty much exactly the same as before ala AC or FC series. Voice acting is good and the game also controls very well. I can see myself playing this game for many, many hours. Alot of hours have gone into the old Xcom games and Enemy Unknown for me and this one will be no different, it is very addicting.Overall the good far outweigh the bad for me personally (and by a good amount) but some might want to hold off until a patch or two come out for the performance issues and small bugs. These are my thoughts after 16 hours on the game so far (I will post more after 50 hours, this right now is just a first impressions), if you love Xcom as a series this is a no brainer, I liked the last Xcom but it wasn't as good as the older xcom games, this game here though takes that the last game did well and adds a bunch of great features and improvements, while unfortunately suffering from the odd nagging issue. Xcom is back and it is back in a big way, once the kinks get ironed out this will be even better. Already a game of very high quality but at the same time one that can improve and get better in a few aspects. There are so many aspects to games, from graphics, to ai, writing, voice work, to gameplay,  performance, controls and much more. This game nails 90% of these things with near perfection, but struggles with that one issue, optimization.So many mods for this game! Played a ton of hours on it now and I am blown away by how many cool mods there is already. New Classes, New Voice packs, new helmets/hats/tattoos,etc.. for customization your troops. Yes the game has bugs and performance issues, but that is really the only problem, everything else rules and is a nice improvement over the last game. Did I mention all the mods being awesome yet? LOVING THEM! Especially for my second go at it!			"

												If I could refund this game I would. Unfortunately I fell for the hype and preordered this half baked turd. Wait until people have modded the hell out of this to make it actually good.Class trees have been dumbed down to either pick every ability on the left, or every ability on the right. No more mixing and matching to create different synergies. Missions have been dumbed down with their stupid timers forcing one type of playstyle and removing any option to use tactics other than run and gun. The new mechanics of this game should encourage us to explore various ways to overcome and solve them and allows us to develop multiple playstyles. Instead we are railroaded into only one aggressive playstyle which means we have to rely on RNG to go our way too often. A huge step down compared to Enemy Within. The devs should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this garbage.			"

												Inexcusable performance issues with this game. Very low fps/stuttering performance (I can max Witcher 3 @60fps but not this?), graphical glitches, loads of sporadic bugs in-game, and let's not forget the mini hangs/pauses. Probably the least fluid gaming experience I've ever had, it's like I'm in kindergarten playing Red Light Green Light again.This is a PC exclusive, there really is no excuse Firaxis. The reviewers weren't wrong (unless you hate timers), the gameplay is rock solid. The modding support is excellent. On most fronts its XCOM:EW 2.0. But I'm starting to think the only reason it is a PC exclusive is because the amateurs can't get the game to run on anything else.I tremendously hope they patch this so I can change my review to positive, but Firaxis isn't exactly known for fixes outside of expansions. I'm not holding my breath.  "

												Even being an experienced X-COM series player, I simply can't stop feeling angry by losing without doing anything wrong at all! No matter what you do or how expert is your strategy, you'll be right in the edge of loss without explanation. Not even the probability of hitting a shot seems to be fair.. I mean, you'll never miss so many 70%+ shots again. It's not ""cool, it's challenging. I'm excited how to defeat this level"" at all. It's just ""forget it, it's not funny lose without guilty"". I mean, X-COM has always been known by being a very hard game.. but you could definitely win if you didn't nothing wrong..The new ""Concealment"" stuff is pretty cool but to be honest it doesn't give any advantage at all, as there are almost always a ""time-limit"" or ""turns-limit"", so you'll not be able to use it in your favor the way you wanted. There are simply too many missions being poped-up that you can't even enjoy ""building"" your ship/researchs/weapons.And, as people mentioned, there are several performance's issues.This game isn't even close from the first X-COM award-winning. I'm deeply regretful for buying this game. Please, stick with the first one.			"

												Massive Dissapointment. It's probably a great game. But was released far too early, with a massive amount of bugs and performance issues, which makes the game virtually unplayable. Greedy developers.			"

												I don't know whats worse, the fact that Valve dreamed up the idea of an exclusivity deal for their controller so you can't use any others, the fact that Firaxis agreed to it, or the fact that the morons and Valve and Firaxis who thought of this crap are still working there. I will never buy anything else from Firaxis until the fix this garbage. Especially with it coming out on consoles soon with regular controller support, but I won't pay twice to someone who would come up with such a crappy policy.			"

												While the Game itself is everything I'd want in a sucessor to the xcom enemy unknown 1 (which I played on console). it's an ubalanced fleshheap of a game that is riddled with frustrations rather than anything one could amount to ""If I had posistioned better I would've been able to have gotten out of that gah I'll improve next time!"" its a more, ""Oh those aliens who somehow conquered the earth have no idea of self preservation and will bull rush you regardless of where you're standing they also do more have more health and take less damage than I do"" it's the same fault I find in the game dark soulsThe difficulty is all artificial and isn't something that could be considered a strategy to overcome gameYou have enemies that can teleport behind you across an entire map instantly flanking you and then they still get a shot seeing as the spell ""teleport"" is actually used as their move. they will never NOT flank you instantly and neither will the soldiers. the aliens in xcom enemy unknown were at least cautious in how they made their plays but these ones will even walk out of cover into one where they're flanked just to get a closer and higher percentage shot so you can't be cautious at all you just have to attack the hardest and by then all your units should be injured and sitting out for half a monthThe patrol paths are not set and they are not patrolling. They walk towards you constantly unless you're moving towards them. I tried a sneaky approach on one of the missions where instead of a frontal assault on a base I tried to flank around the rear closer to my objective and sneak in with a quick recall out. instead when I reached where I was at I realized that all the gaurds that I had passed were actually just walking at their ""patrol"" pace towards me on the map. who cares if I had waited turns for them to reverse their directions so I could sneak past? it was a forced combat situation in which 14 units (8 of which who were snakes that all instantly bound every soldier I had) were dumped into my lap completely unfairlyThe rate at which missions happen and the end game timer runs up are way too simultaneous and uncontrollable. instead of you running any form of what could be considered game it's more of a see how fast your rat army can scramble as you constantly get kicked in the ribs and bombarded. the timers in missions go incredibly fast and seeing how you'll always be facing around 6 units at a time unless you make incredibly risky situations you will just BARELY ever be succeeding in them more often than not you'll have to save scum your entires missions or risk losing the game because your units have paper mache' for flesh and glass for bones (which is suprising seeing as they'll jump down two story drops of their own will rather than use the nearby ladders)In the end this game is just you getting kicked in the teeth for however long it takes you to finish it. 3/5 could be way better if there was a lot more balances to it			"

												Let me be honest: I love this game.LOVE. Not ""oh, this game is fun and I spent a lot of time on it, so I must really enjoy it.""I love it. Solid gameplay. Great story that carries on in the tradition of the ones before it. Wonderful details in characters and environments. Amazing sound quality. Deep customisation options. Ramped-up sense of danger and difficulty. I could sing the praises of this game for years, for all that it has done right. I love this game and have missed family events to play with it. I have left friends waiting in the rain to finish missions because they were so intense and nerve-wracking. Amazing on so many levels. Ask me, and I'll gush!Which is why it pains me to say that I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend.March 17th Update: I told you folks I'd update you when I have a better idea of what's gone/going wrong. To all the ""toaster"" comments"" and the people talking about attitude, I have to say only that you need to examine the whole of the situation. People are having problems. Nobody knows why.""Hardware roulette"" is a thing with this game. Somewhere along the way, script got broken or a setting got changed without direct input, preventing some mods from updating. I forcibly removed everything (everything, people) that the game placed on my machine and reinstalled. I then had to validate files almost instantly because things weren't woring properly. Whether this is Steam or XCOM 2 is unknown, but the problems are now fixed after reinstalling the game a few times and making sure the files are validated.There is, undeniably, something amiss. Firaxis has admitted as much, and are working hard alongside the customers and mod developers and magic code sprites to brings things up to speed and deliver the game that was promised. Kudos to all involved.However, it's still kind of lame (and quite infuriating) to have the ability to run at mid-to-high settings and be stuck at low-to-unplayable. This is sadly common and I cannot recommend a game that was so obviously pushed out before it was fully-prepared for launch. ""Big AAA"" means nothing if the delivery system or the product itself is flawed.It's like buying a used lamp from eBay and it arrives broken at your doorstep. Who is at fault for the condition, and how do you fix the situation easily? No simple answers, but it will take time.In its current state, I don't know that I can recommend in good conscience. Given some TLC, it can be THE game of the year. My review will stand as-is, since I will likely be back to playing it indefinitely without coming up for air. I hope I can tear it down and post an ""ALL FIXED"" update with a rave review, but the many problems my friends and myself (with many others) are encountering for no reason other than a rushed product (and it doesn't feel that way until you examine it, believe me; it's the most well-polished 95% of a game ever!) keep me from given this game the Thumbs-Up it desperately deserves. Maybe in a week or two.TL;DR: I love the game, but there are a few game-breaking issues, mod support is amazing but buggy at times, seems over-polished without being fully-realized. Worth buying, for hardcore fans and gamers, but may give some troubles.I don't mind ""negative"" comments, but let's at least keep them relevent instead of bashing preferences or systems. Hardware and OS aren't the issue, in my case, just a sloppy bit of coding that created conflicts. Anyone wanting more information about specific issues will be answered to the best of my abilities.

												Looks like I did not win the hardware lottery requirements for XCOM 2 with an SLI 680.  Have read other people's experience regarding the poor performance and bugs and the like and finally tried to give this game a go - pre-purchased after all. Experience so far - decent intro sequence to introduce the player to the world. Then:Going through tutorial, and the triggers for the next action seem to take 2-3 minutes. E.g. game tells me to click at a certain spot, I do so, then wait 2-3 minutes before I can interact with the game again. Impressions - although they have improved the graphics, it just feels like too much information, messy if you compare it to XCOM Enemy Unknown. Probably just need to get used to it;  I suppose I will try and get this to work by tweaking settings etc, however this kinda sours the experience of enjoying a game if you have to do this. Definitely unrefined compared to the previous instalment.Update: Tutorial still buggy. Went straight into campaign: Dislike- layout of maps messy- jerkiness of movement of soliders, it appears that they are programmed to move square by square especially when turning corners, instead of just a smooth run from one point to another. Example - move one square, stop, move a bit more, then run to selected location.- one of my soliders used a movement point, completed turn the turn moving left, and some how ended up 2 movement points away to the right.Like- I do like how it clearly shows damage/miss- Action cam and slow motionUpdate:Again, issues with triggers - place the X4 mine, and then can't do anything for 1-2 minutes after which the map finishes.Update: For the issue with triggers, seems that all that was required was the good old reinstall.

												I am rather disapointed in this game. The game has a lot of new content from the previous version that I like very much but the story line is very short. Also after playing this game for one time I really have not reason to play it again. I have already discovered everything in this one short play.I really expected the story will be far longer. In the end I finished the story line in about 20h including who knows how many lost hours because the game crashed every hour or so. This will be my last X-COM series game I buy.			"

												I really wanted to love this game. I had heard of Xcom in the past: but never played till this games predecessor(one of the best games I have ever played and hands down better than this game). It was actually going to be the first game I ever did a ""let's play"" for. That came to a really quick end when I was smashed in the face with horrible loads, graphics issues, bugs on top of bugs, ect... It was so bad that I couldn't bring myself to upload the footage. Before anyone asks I was running a GTX 960 and an FX-6300 processor(well above the max requirements for the game). Here we are over a year later and nothing has changed. Save your time and money by skipping this one.			"

												I've just finished the game on Veteran and the sequel for me was a let down. Even with the added DLC it really didn't add much to the game. The final few missions were a disappointment. Particularly on the final mission. You can just setup your squad on overwatch and the enemy just run into your fire. It lacked that fear factor that the first game had. I had plans to replay the campaign on the hardest difficulty but the game is just too boring for me to do it all over again. I love the customisation, the different classes and abilities but it was such a rinse and repeat cycle. Fly to supplies, interrupted by a mission, fly back to supplies. It hurts me to put this game down, because I loved the first game but it really let my expectations down.			"

												Im not metioning bugs or performance issues, those will be fixes in future and doesnt break game experience. Only gameplay.No tactics, i.e. flanking useless because mobs have much bigger HP pool / DR than your damage even with position superiority. Elevation... theres no elevation, To Hit chance for mobs the same even with full cover ( according to how fast dies your team )No weapon difference, i.e. rifle / MG / sniper rifle have same damage in matter of hit damage vs aim penalty. Only shotguns works somewhat close to common sense.Covers makes no sense because of mob's aim.Few examples which you will encounter in this game:1. Sniper on 3rd floor with full cover vs flanked low level mob ( simple gunner ) = sniper dead :D2. 2nd VIP mission already with Robots with 2DR3. 2nd campaign mission full of Mutons with 2DR4. Global time pressing almost from beggining of the game5. 2/3 missions with turns limit, i.e. time pressing againWorst decisions on design, gj Firaxis with killing XCOM for me.Team of autists with broken hands trying to save the earth.

												I am so pleased to give them thumbs up to this game. I was so stoked to get my hands on this new reiteration of the XCOM franchise, and after finishing the campaign, I am very happy to repport that 2K & Firaxis took it to a whole new level. They improved almost every aspect of the game, cutting off the unnecessary ones and gave us even more control over everything. That is how a sequel should be done! I remember my initial dissatisfaction at the delay in the launch date, but my, now I am so happy that they did, cause all the extra game polish worked wonders!XCOM2 is all about survival of the human race. The canon story behind XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within is that we lost horribly and the aliens decided to take the role of ""benevolent"" rulers who are constantly improving and ""helping"" humanity. Pockets of resistance across the world still remain and one of them is led by none other than ""Central"" - our trusty right hand, office Bradford from XCOM1. He goes on a hunt to discover YOU - yes, you, Commander are in the game! And so it begins...In true fashion for my reviews, I will take a look at the good and the bad.The Good:1. Extremely immersive gameplay. To me, this point outweighs every single other. You will get immersed in the story, you will care heaps about the world you are living in, you will care about your soldiers as if they are your children, you will feel happy when all of them make it back and sad if someone gets injured or doesn't live through a mission. You will remember and tell their stories, and I can assure you, there will be tons of stories to tell.2. Amazing story, with great buildup, that only gets better till the final showdown. You will have full CLOSURE in XCOM2, and you will have a lot of fun finding out what happens to you, Bradford, the Council Leader, the old team, new team, everyone! Hell they even tell you why a Sectopod is called like that!!!3. A soundtrack elevated to the next level. Every single song will get you very pumped up and ready to go kick some alien♥♥♥♥♥♥ Turn up the volume, cause you are in for a treat!4. Customization brought to a whole new level - every single thing is customizable now. You can totally expect to spend an inordinate amount of time just making soldier(s) look the way you want. You can fully customize: 4.1. Your soldiers - name, sex, race, nationality, voice, posture, armor types, accessories, colors, etc. You can literally do everything.4.2. Their weapons - as in XCOM1, you have 3 tiers of shotguns, heavy guns, sniper rifles, pistols, and assault rifles that can be named, colored, improved with loot you find on the field, which leads to a ton of new combinations that fit your taste or vision of how the soldier should play out.4.3. Their armor - once again, you have 3 tiers of armor, which is extremely slick and aesthetically pleasing. In XCOM2 you get to kick♥♥♥♥♥♥and look good doing it. What's more to ask? To make things even better, armor types of the same tier don't get obsolete - and you can even make experimental armors to boot!5. The new Avenger, the better take on the world map, and the improved research and engineering – you are no longer forced into using the same best strategy over and over again. The Avenger is your base, and even though it is very much like the old one with levels and stuff to clear before building, it is mobile, which lets you get creative. The world map is your playground where you and the aliens both have your goals – they must complete the avatar project, you must prevent them from doing so by making contacts with other resistance cells, hitting them where it hurts, choosing in what way to hinder them, and so on. The research and engineering have seen marked improvement, and you are even allowed to do meta projects that are not mandatory, but can give you better gear, ammunition, powerful psi abilities, bestow skills from other classes to a certain soldier, and so on and so forth. This gives you a plethora of ways to approach the game!6. The graphics – XCOM2 is undoubtedly gorgeous. Streets, signs, the skyline, everything looks amazing.7. The Combat – the combat remains very much the same as it was in XCOM1, but there have been a lot of small tweaks to make it more fluid. A lot of actions that used to end your soldier’s turn in XCOM1 are now just half the cost – most notably the reload, which now means you can reload and then shoot! Add to that the whole new concealment mechanic where it is actually YOU stalking the aliens! 8. The enemy variety – there are even more enemies in the game, ready to surprise you and make your life a living hell. Every enemy in this game comes with own set of skills and own danger level, and you will have a lot of “fun” discovering who can do what. And when you think you know everything, the enemy will suddenly use some secondary skill you never know he had… like that time a Muton charged my soldier and melee attacked her. And I was expecting shots or grenades…9. The soldier class variations – you may be disappointed to learn that you only have 4 main soldier classes (plus a secret one that I am not going to spoil for you), unlike the crazy amount that the Long War mod introduced, but don’t hate on the game just yet. Each class can be customized with skills (some that even belong to other classes!), psi abilities, weapons and weapon mods to such extent, that you can barely recognize your starting guy.10. The mission timers – so many people hate them, and it is understandable, but as an XCOM veteran, I welcome them. They give a sense of urgency and prevent cheap half move/overwatch tactics. And if you still think this is a bad thing, read No. 11!11. Modding – as Jake Solomon himself said, once you buy the game, it is yours to do whatever you please with it. Less than a week after release, there are already a good number of mods for you to choose whether to use or not, including ones that extend or flat out remove the mission timers people hate so much.12. The line of sight indicator – now you always know whether you are going to be able to shoot an enemy if you move to a certain position. While the camera could be a bit finicky to position in order to see whether the cross appears or not, whaddya know – there is a camera mod that helps with this!The Bad:1. Bugs, bugs, bugs – XCOM1 was no stranger to bugs on release as well, but so far I haven’t had gamebreaking ones, and 95% of them can be solved with a simple save and reload. Unless you are playing Ironman, you have at least 3 mission autosave points to return to.2. Only 3 tiers of weapons and armor – while I don’t terribly mind, the Long War team was employed to help 2K/Firaxis, and they did create number of additional weapon and armor tiers for XCOM Long War… I guess it just wasn’t a priority here. I am quite sure there will be mods to remedy this, though.3. The learning curve – XCOM2 is a whole new XCOM, with many new things for you to discover and learn. It can be quite daunting of a task for a new player and even for veterans with hundreds of hours of XCOM1 under their belts. The game will also force you to break a good number of old habits, which can be quite disconcerting for some.4. Framerate is all over the place – many other people have found this to be an inconvenience and it is fair to point it out.5. Hefty hardware requirements – for a turn based strategy game, the recommended specs for the game are actually quite hefty.Conclusion: XCOM2 is a marked improvement over XCOM1 in every feasible aspect. They learned from XCOM1, cut all the fat and put even more meat where it was sorely needed. 2K & Firaxis took a game that is already awesome and brought it to a new level of brilliance. This game is worth every cent of its purchase price, and then some. Once all the bugs and oversights are dealt with, you will be in for the best combination of turn-based/management/tactical experience to date.			"

												I have just finished playing XCOM 2 and here are my thoughts about the entire experience.XCOM2 did some great things but executed the overall game poorly.TLDR: Until FRAXIS can deliver a polished product onto the market, they will not deserve money or respect.Good things about XCOM2- Music was great and I enjoyed the atmosphere it created- Graphics were pretty good even though I had to run the game with minimum options for the sake of performance- Great enemy diversity compared to XCOM EU/EW, each had their own unique look and actions- Hacking mechanic did not seem like a gimmick but a solid tactic- New classes are fun to play with, Psi ops are particularly awesome- Diverse grenade/ammo types in the research tree- Lack of overall polish for the following reasons- HUD is pretty much the same in EU/EW- HUD mods vastly improves gameplay- Navigating through the Avenger unmodded is unnecessarily slow with the graphics- Constantly bombarded by annoying NPC chatter- Game does not run optimally, even after lastest patch in March- Bugs that I came across at least once during my playthrough: game crashed after trying to use waypoints for the first time camera shaking after a kill that is not resolved unless the game is reloaded Advent MEC immune to grenades Death Audio looping even after Advent unit is dead Dead Advent troops flooding Advent troops becoming poisoned without being fired upon Dead archon flying/floating underneath final room in the final mission

Posted: March 10, 2016
												EDIT: as 2017 commences, I thought I'd make a swift dash through this game again, as many mods have seen much work since I had enough, and some new may have come on the stage. ANYWAY; the game is now unplayable, not only for me, but for a growing number of ppl, due to CTD either in main menu, upon trying to launch combat missions, or in a specific scene of a mission. ""pure virtual function called (GlsRunning = = 1)"" RE-EDIT: February 2017 and XCOM 2 inexplicably works again. Strange.First off, if you enjoyed XCOM1, you will enjoy XCOM2. But wait, performance fixes are needed, and modders are doing a good job patching up what Firaxis has delivered, it is becoming a game. When it came out, it was mostly a storyline, non-canonical at that. Again.What do I like? The battles work much better, now you can actually sneak about - set up ambushes, and spy on patrols and try to predict where is the best angle of attack. Mostly the same game as XCOM1, but with has an abundance of cutscenes and animations, which is a bit of a problem for some in regards to performance. I manage. Snake people are back, instead of the thin man concept, they are actually snake people.Science is still stupid. Always was. If the soldiers given an alien a nickname in the field, that's basically the name that sticks, and you get the animation with the analysis when you initiate the research, not when its done. Well you get it then too - more text, no new content. Lots of loading, nada content. But it was always like that, now its just - IN YOUR FACE. Engineering works much better. There are no MEC's this time around, though. Instead they have more armor, and a hectic game pace. This game is actually a bit of a challenge. BUT: There are no factions, like in XCOM1, you just have money handed over to you from more or less irrellevant sponsors. Why of why have Firaxis abandoned the concept of factions - which were brilliant in Apocalypse, when you could pillage, raid and wage war as much against human organizations, as against aliens, and they would gravitate towards XCOM or the alien ""masters"" (otherwise that game was extremely silly with teddy-bear graphics...)This game, with its terrorist angle would not be any less of an enjoyment if you could try to make alliances with other resistance groups, could try to convince corporations to lend you aid covertly, or attack these treasonous groups outright for supplies and corvè labour. It is a blunder and missed opportunity that tells me that Firaxis is more interested in mass production than quality.Then we have damage. You can actually kill everything here. You kan kill every civillian and level all buildings without any consequences whatsoever. Of course there is 1 type of mission where you HAVE TO RESCUE 6 people. Because they are yours. But even here you can safely blow up the rest. This is stupid. In the ""olden days"" collateral damage, even damage to infrastructure would harm your budget and support. Now maybe, as a terrorist, bombing buildings would not have a totally negative consequence but playing ISIS is completely possible here, and doesnt affect the game at all. And is stupid.Now, I have to mention that physics is back where it used to be before Firaxis took up the thread. Now objects will not be hanging in empty space if the supporting structure is removed. Killing aliens by blowing up walls and floors, making them fall many stories, or having the roof cave in on them is actually a workable strategy, and this is a huge and welcome improvement. I could not believe why this was not the case in XCOM1.Now I must also mention the stupid mistakes they have made upon launch. Like smoke grenades actually not providing any game effects at all. Oh you might think you got some defense bonus, but that's just a puff of color you have there. Fortunately, the modders have fixed it, but you HAVE TO get one of those two mods. Like the sound options; you can tone everything down, but there are some ambient and triggered sounds that DONT RESPOND to your commands in the options. Like the intro music that will still blast you upon launch until the menu appears, like the sound that comes when aliens are revealed, this will always be loud, radios and other sources in game will jabber on. So if you play on a headseat, or late at night trying not to wake others from sleep, be aware of this so you dont go deaf or something.Also, still there are no bases to be built. Now you fly around in a captured (?) UFO, which is fine for a resistance I guess, but it must get cramped and you loose any possibility of specializing your capacities. So there OUGHT TO be a feature where you build small bases, which would act as your recruitment/training facilities, the listening posts, R&D stations, etc. But there are No such Things. You fly around the world and set up radio towers. Like the analogous radio network would be beyond the capacity of aliens to infiltrate. There are no base attacks either, so this time around Firaxis saved themselves ALOT of work. There are no alien landscapes at all in this game. Very few aliens as well in fact (they are all projections or genetic reworkings, the aliens are gone).The storyline hints at a dynamic approach with the option to turn against the resistance. This is only in words, there are no such options in the game. It is a uniliear storyline, with very little strategy, and these make up my primary problems; No strategy, no factions nor economics without any diplomacy and very little responsibility.Tactics work fine, great and much better than last time.If I can manage to learn, I will make the factions and the ways to deal with them myself. Cause of course without modbuddy this game would be DOA.			"

The game does not shutdown ever (steam cannot detect its shutdown) preventingyou from turning off steam and your computer ( you  need to  hard boot your computer after laying this thing they dared to call a finished game.

												XCOM is a tough kind of game to sell, because when it's good it's bad and when it's bad it's bad. The best time you can have in XCOM is when you're scraping on the skin of your teeth with one soldier dead and another one bleeding out and a sectoid waving his finger ominously in the distance, and so it's hard to sell to someone who just wants an easy time. Thankfully this is the sequel, so presumably everyone here is a masochist who enjoys feeling like they've lost even when they've won. The first thing that surprised me in XCOM 2 is how much they've expanded the unit customization. Unlike in the previous game, which was somewhat dull in soldier clothes and left me just giving everyone the classic Guile hair, 2 features a pretty wide variety of glasses, hats, hair, beards, and other ways to form a personal relationship with your soldiers before they're eviscerated before your eyes because of your own orders, blood which will never wash from your hands. You can even choose from different arms, legs, and torsos for each type of armor, though the later armors usually have less variety than the early one. The game also has a stronger emphasis on story, with more cutscenes and development to the characters. I thought it was a welcome addition, though it does leave things slightly less resolved at the end than I would've liked. Most of the enemies are reworked versions of the old ones, but there are a few new ones here and there, and they all perform a bit differently enough to give veterans a surprise every now and then. There are still the usual customization options for your soldiers' abilities, but the more interesting ones from Enemy Within like genetic modification and augmentation are missing, leaving the game feeling like there's something more interesting hiding in that expansion pass. Other things like UFO landings also return, but they don't seem to have any real significance like they did in EU aside from just being minor resource grabs. My only actual problem with the gameplay is that in some ways it feels like more of the same in a bad way - they introduce a Concealment feature where your soldiers start some missions hidden and can ambush the enemies, reversing the typical xcom formula where you're the one being ambushed and fitting in with the game's guerilla warfare theme, but after you break concealment the first time it's gone for good except for special skill-based circumstances, and after that the game just starts with the same traditional gameplay. I'm not wanting to change the game into Invisible Inc. or anything, but I think it would be interesting for some of the more low-key missions like hacking a relay to be able to done with a small squad in stealth (or maybe it can - in my game whenever I tried there would be humans blocking the doors to every building, but maybe I just had bad luck). Another thing in this vein that bothered me is that almost every mission in the game requires you to kill all the aliens, rather than just do your work and get out. This is something that made sense in the old games, since you were defending earth from invaders, but in XCOM 2 they've already taken over, and killing this tiny group of aliens is completely inconsequential to their overall effort.But while I overall enjoyed the game outside of those minor flaws, the big problem with this game is the actual build quality. On my GTX 970 and overclocked i5, I managed about 15 fps on the main menu scene, with maybe 20 to 30 in-game. This isn't necessarily a problem since it's a turn-based strategy game, but the problems got worse as the game went on. Reaction shots would sometimes cause the game to hang in front of the character shooting for several moments, enemies would stand still for upwards of 30 seconds before moving, just flying to the single-screen or loading a small map with one building might take 30 seconds or more on an SSD, etc - and that's not even going into all the times characters would go flying around the map or robots would get stuck in trees. During the final fight my game crashed 5 times, and on 2 of those crashes it corrupted my autosaves and made me start back 10 minutes or so. It even caused my computer to bluescreen at one point. The build quality is so terrible that it makes me think that the only reason the game is PC-exclusive is because they couldn't get it to even boot up on a console without it immediately melting.Overall, XCOM 2 is a game that's still good enough for me to recommend, but just know that you're going to have to take some bad in order to get the good. Maybe in the future Firaxis will patch the game, but in the mean time you might want to double-check your specs before jumping on.			"

												Xcom2 is a difficult and challenging game. If anyone new is thinking about getting it I suggest lots of research and learning on how to apply the game's available mechanics successfully. My perspective is purely from some one who's new to the series and haven't played much turn based strategy in the past.Much of your success will be based on probability rolls. What this means is, even if your shot has an 85% chance of success, you could still very well fail. It can be infuriating, but careful planning and smart use of the tools available can very much help mitigate some of that frustration.

I've mentioned that this is a difficult game, and indeed the learning curve is very high but strangely enough, understanding the core mechanics was easy and well paced. Learning how to apply them is the challenging part.Overally XCOM2 is a very satisfying game when things go according to plan, but can be infuriating when it doesn't. I like it!			"

												If we purely look at the content, the game is absolutely great. Possibly the best thing that developers have introduced are procedurally generated maps. Maps are not random, instead they are a combination of huge number of ‘modules’ (sets of these modules are exclusive to locations) that are picked and shuffled in a new way every time you start a game. If that was not enough, there is a number of weather conditions that take place – rain, night, flying burning ashes, etc.Classes have been revised, now you have five of them (sword person; hacker; sniper; heavy; and psi-soldier) and sixth will be added as part of the pre-purchase DLCs later this year. I really like the new psi mechanic, you now train your psi soldiers within the base, but you can take them to mission when needed and they will jump in back to complete their current education upon return to the base. If you train the psi-soldier long enough, they become a bit too powerful.Gameplay wise, the game is slightly tougher than ‘XCOM: Enemy Unknown’ and at the same time, I found it mostly more enjoyable to play.Downsides? Visual glitches and a few bugs here and there. Until they are fixed, there is no point to even try completing the game on Iron Man difficulty. Quality Assurance is not exactly the strong part of Feraxis. I hope that they will fix them soon, as they did with the first XCOM and Civ 5.			"

												The option to be tactical and strategic is no longer an option in this game. 80% of the game is on a timer - blah blah you have mod for it blah blah. Why do you people feel that it is acceptable to pay full price for a game that has to rely on the community to fix it, is beyond me. Mod is supposed to enhance the game , like Long War did, not ♥♥♥♥ing fix the game. 80% of the game is : Deploy- run to objective- get objective - extract. Content wise, feel less than EW in-term of armors, and I dont know why the company feels the need to release cosmetic DLC for a fully moddable game, so a no-go for the season pass right there.Overall, fun, but not $60+ kinda fun. Wait til discount and til the game get fixed, then it is worth it. Right now, not recommendEdit : 21st of March, encountered the first bug, and I believe this bug is gamebreaking for those who want to play Ironman. Minor spoiler ahead ! Final mission requires you to destroy all the Avatars in Advent base. However, I was lucky enough to get the Repeater to proc, and the first avatar was killed instantly. This will prevent the remaining Avatars from spawning. So if you encounter this bug on Ironman, time for a new run I guess. ♥♥♥♥ this game !!!!!!!			"

												I dont usually write reviews this early into a game, but I really like this one. Love the customization, that most of the missions you do have some sort of impact on the future, good or bad, and that everything can go so wrong or so right after just one turn. I dont even like turn-based strategys, but this one sucked me in.There are some bad things about this one though, such as that while the customization is pretty good, you HAVE to level up a troop a bit before you can get into the real good stuff, which I dont really get since customization is purely cosmetics to a degree (not counting weapon customization, which isn't all that great).The game also is a bit to punishing for newer players such as me on difficulties higher then easy, absolutly demolishing me on anything higher then easy. Easy is also a bit to forgiving, dumbing down the AI to levels where a 10-year-old could beat the game in no-time with a bit of savescumming.Overall, I'd give it 7/10, since it is a pretty fun game regardless of if you thing it's easy or not.

6/10XCOM 2 reminds me why I didn't quite like XCOM EU when I played it on console.If you've read around at all, the usual suspects criticizing this game aren't exactly wrong in their gripes about XCOM's core gameplay mechanics:This Game Is a Roulette TableNo pun intended on this game's apparent seeded RNG mechanic (That's a Random Number Generator for you non-nerds). Seeded RNG would be more like a loaded digital slot machine, which is exaclty how is games core mechanics funtion, but anyways...I love strategy games, so I know quite a bit about the niche, from classic cardboard table tops like Chess, Risk, Catan to old school computer titles like Starcraft, Warfrcat, Z etc. to modern day games like Front Mission, Homeworld, and so forth. But, XCOM feels more like being in a sketchy casino rather than a strategy game; It's like betting a big stack of money on an post-apocalyptic alien invasion coin flip.The never ending dice rolls is what takes so much away from this game. No matter what amount of skill a player has in this game, randomness is what sends you spinning out of control, epecially in missions on the harder difficulties.There is so much work lost through random-chance character deaths and mission losses, that any enjoyment and reward are overshadowed from the amount of frustration and hours of grinding and reattemps.And I can attest. I completed the last game on its hardest difficulty and played this one on its ""Legendary Ironman"" mode just to say that I did. So, I can honestly say I gave this game a complete and comprehensive playthrough before criticizing it.If you've read anything about this game, you'll have picked up on the flame wars in several threads between the highbrow critics and fankids. I suppose I am the former, but the issue is apparent.However, I am a patient completionist. As I said, I played the previous XCOM and beat it (Reluctantly, after several attempts) on its hardest difficulty. It wasn't fun. I did it simply to say I did it.And now I am playing this one on its ""Legendary Ironman"" and will beat it (Eventually, after several begrudged attempts). But, I gotta say it's really not fun. Needless to say, its really hard. But, it's so hard that it's not fun.I'm just going through the motions for some achievements.Playing it on its hardest modes only bring out the reasons why its reliance on its All-or-Nothing RNG gameplay is just not fun.I suppose this is what the game was intended to be like. That's just XCOM, as they say right? You could play it on easy mode, but why buy a new game at 60 bucks just to play it on easy mode a couple of times? Is that worth it?The gameplay mechanics not only make the game unenjoyable and frustrating, but seems to make alot of things unbalanced as well.I purchased this game with it's AAA price tag in hopeful expectation that I'd see some refreshing new core gameplay and a better level of enjoyment, but I rolled the 2K's RNG dice and it let me down once again as it has so many times before. SighMaybe I am the demographic that XCOM is targeting, along with the other gambling addicts and ""masochists""?I cannot recomend this game with it's current $59.99 price tag and have usually told my friends who are strategy buffs to avoid it, as most wouldn't enjoy it. The majority of whom I know that have tried this or the last XCOM game have been disappointed, unfortunately.If you really want to try this game I'd say wait for a price drop or give an older XCOM game a go. Preferably try a free demo. Like I said, you might not enjoy this game because of it's core mechanics. It tends to put off many players.In the meantime, I hope that 2K takes heed from other turn-based tactical games like Square Enix's Front Mission series and reward skill, not gambles.			"

The 2nd installed comes with all the same problems.  They haven't really tried to rectify any of them, plus it brings some more of its own.Problems such as*LOS issues*Tight Turn Limitations (new)*Free enemy movement on reveal*Inconsistent difficultly curve (a round is either really easy or almost impossible)*One turn wipeouts.  With very little warning you can be doing fine one turn and then the next turn have half your squad dead or out of action, making the mission a guaranteed failure.*Missing when standing next to enemies*Badly implemented ""stealth"" turnOverall the game just isn't fun. And that's the main problem.  The introduction of the turn timers in particular.  I just don't find myself enjoying them game.			"

 Broken and Buggy game with Constant crashes. No Controller support.	So far the game is a buggy and broken mess for me. There is a 50/50 chance the game crashes on startup when it gets to main menu. I have a good spec PC (i7 4790K, 12GB RAM, GTX 970) and should be able to run this game great on 1080p but that is far from the case. They delayed this game from the original release date and only had a PC release and they still fracked it up this bad. This is worse than the Arkham Knight launch, atleast the game was playable with FPS drops not constantly crashing to desktop. 2K needs to be held to the same standards, I've already uninstalled the game and will coming back to it in a couple months if they can be competent enough to fix this broken mess.Also aside from Steam controller this game has no controller support. I have a Xbox One controller and it is useless in this game. Lazy developers. Firaxis and 2k games have officially been added to my Do Not Buy list and get them when they are in the bargain bin price range.			"

												I am giving a ""Not recommended"" for the release version. Wait for a couple of patches is my recommendationRasons:- Really bad performance, even on top end systems, like mine. The game recommends me to use highest settings with my system but I actually have to run in medium settings as not to get stuttering or massive frame rate drops. It is a shame considering how good the game looks in max settings :( - Turns are stalling in between player/alien turn switches. - This is a big negative one one for me: Timed missions are poorly implemented. The timers are way too short.  Missions often end after just 8 turns. It is just enough time to force you to rush to a mission end but you can't enjoy the map or possible side actions.  On top of that those timed missions are way too numerous. It makes it impossible to enjoy a stretched out tactical game for those players who like it slower paced and are not overly aggresive.- Melee is far too overpowered. All you need is a squad of sword swinging maniacs and you cut through the aliens like butter. No more tactical weapon usage required.  - Camera angles are awkward at times- Grenades are bugged in some instances when you explode walls- character stances are bugged in somes instances and facing the wrong way while shooting Plus a dozen other smaller bugs that by themself can be overlooked but with those piling up fast are starting to annoy a lot.It very much looks like this game did not get a proper quality control testing before release. *sigh*			"

												Bug ridden, even after 9 months of release (no mods installed). Just a list of potential issues, including a gamebreaking one:- sound is lagging- game runs smooth, then time to time lags as hell- the longer you play, the more the FPS drops- after missions the camera is stuck, no chance to progress in the game; gamebreaking bug, solution is to validate the game files, then it will redownload one file. Then you are allowed to replay the last turn of the mission and game progresses. Every ♥♥♥♥ing time!That was the last time when I bought a Firaxis game.EDIT: So, the third game verification fixed the game for me to an extent that I can play 2-3 missions without the need for reverification. It's a pity I didn't buy it on Steam and cannot get a refund.Also discovered other bugs (like a certain sound effect stucks, if it should cease in a way devs didn't think it will; like supressing an enemy, then killing that enemy in melee), none of them game breaking, but pretty much discouraging that 9 months after release the game is still plagued with such issues and random freezes.By the way dear 2k, if I refuse to accept your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t online service terms, then PLEASE STOP NAGGING ME, BECAUSE I REFUSED IT FOR A REASON.It's a shame that games industry reached such a stage. Until people stop purchasing tinkered and poorly supported games, nothing will change.FINAL EDIT: Ok, I played this game for a while now, so I can give a final word on it. The game is definitely fun when bugs are absent. It has the typical Firaxis ""just one more turn"" charm, although it's not flawless. Instead of the ♥♥♥♥ed up satellite-fest of XCom, now you have timer-fest. Really, you are running against timers all the time, on the main map, during missions, almost everywhere. Guess the game designers were lazy, it was easier to overuse this element. For the first few missions, it adds excitement, then it just becomes ""meh"".Some other bugs I discovered, so you know what to expect:1.) after loading a game (during mission), hotkeys don't work, can't order troops to move, have to reload a campaign map save game (you already had progress in the mission? Firaxis says ♥♥♥♥ you and deal with it)2.) NPC message overlays stuck on the screen without any text3.) music just stops, plain and simple, game restart fixes the problem4.) loading a game makes you stuck on the loading screen, reboot fixes partially, since chances are that you will fall back to bug ""1""5.) random gen seems to be iffy as well, like missing a 98% shot, then missing a 96% shot, then missing a 9x% shot, in this order (I start playing lottery now)6.) grenades work strange time to time, enemy units are in the area of effect, it blows up everything around the enemy units, but fail to damage them, reloading save game fixes the problem7.) make armor / items available button either puts you back to the campaign map or plainly makes the game to freezeSo yeah, don't buy it, unless you are happy with paying for a bugfest.

												I loved the game from the start. Even though in any graphical configuration but for minimal the game was full of lag - a problem I hadn´t have with any game in my current pc before, I didn´t mind as the gameplay was fantastic. The innovations and changes refreshed the serie and everything feels different from the previous XCOM even though a lot of concepts are unchanged. In some reviews people complained about the turns limits, but in all the missions that I played that had those, I didn´t need to rush too much and managed to complete the objectives just in time with few turns remaining in a way that it seemed that the number of turns was well balanced - neither making the mission too rushed nor letting you move slowly abusing overwatchs. However, soon the crashes started. Firstly, I tried hard to make excuses such as that the problem was with my computer or that it was just something occasional so I could just let it pass and keep playing. But they persisted and striked everywhere: in the middle of a mission, in a loading screen, in the geoscape, etc. And they have the peculiarity of even if I reloaded a save happening again if I tried to do the same thing that resulted in the first crash, which worsened substantially the problem. In the end I couldn´t evade from the obvious and unfortunate conclusion that the game was UNPLAYABLE - at least in my PC, but I didn´t have such problems with any other game before. Certainly this will be fixed in the first patches for the game but it is rather frustrating to have bought this game in presale and to have waited so anxiously for its launch to receive a product unplayable and to have to wait more for the patches to be able to properly play it. Anyway, it may be that the problems I am having do not extend to all players, but if you are thinking on buying XCOM 2, the safest route would be to wait for the game to be fixed. A part from those problems, the game is great and I will totally recommend it once it hopefully becomes completelly functional and playable.			"

												Xcom EU/EW is easily one of my favorite games of all time.  If you don't have that one, skip this and get that.  If you do, keep reading.Summary:As a lot of people here have said, this is one of those games that I really wish I could give a middle recommendation for.  The underlying mechanics are mostly solid, but as people have said, the graphic problems are surprisingly bad.Specific Areas:Performance: Dominions 3 is one of my favorite games...I do not generally care about graphics.  But if I could go back in time and not buy this game, I would because of how bad the graphics issues are.  I don't care enough to type up a bunch of specs, suffice to say that xcom runs worse that possibly any other game I own.  Frankly I wish they had just left them alone, because EU/EW ran at least.  While the game technically runs on the max settings, I can't see anything that is happening.  Even on the lowests settings, I'm probably getting about 20 fps and the game is extremely jumpy.  Its distracting to the point of being stressful.  The cutscenes are great, and I would be happy if the rest of the game looked half as good.  Be prepared to be constantly taken out of the moment.Difficulty:  I don't mind the timed missions, though they can be ""unfairly difficult"".  But xcom has always been this way. War is not fair, and xcom has never been a game of chess.  It is more about recovering from impossible situations...or even just failing spectacularly.  Xcom 2 just ebraced the dark side.That said, this creates a new issue that EU/EW didn't have.  Xcom2 isn't more unforgiving, because that implies that if you didn't make any mistakes you would be okay.  While I appreciate impossible situations...here they feel a little arbitrary.  This might be an odd comparison, but Dragon's Dogma handled this extremely well.  From the beginning, you could run into dragons that you had no chance of beating, but you could also just look at them and being like ""yeah no way is that happening"".  In xcom, there is giant pressure to do a million things at once, and any one of them may be just completely impossible given your tech level, current team, etc. You have very little insight into what you will run up against, which given how much ""recon"" is talked about, seems like a missed opportunity.  From what I have played so far, half the time I am collecting or securing some kind of recon, but at most it is always ""hey there is a mission here"".  Why isn't it ever actual recon, such as ""there are 3-8 vipers in the area"".  Instead I go on what seems like a story mission, and hey its a Viper King and he kills my entire team in two turns because he follows different rules than anything else and has a billion health.  Which would even be kind of okay because then the game is about how do I recover from losing an entire team, BUT NO hey one of those guys was critical to the story so I lose.  If you want to reload saves a lot that's fine I guess, but I'm only really interested in Ironman.Long story short, Xcom2 is often not great at giving you leeway to think on your toes.Everything else:Its xcom, there is just more and its different.  If you can get past the stuff above, you'll like it.  I'll probably try to finish it.  Someday.  But the performance sucks enough that I might wait til I have a better computer. 5 years from now.  Maybe they'll fix it somehow and I'll change the review and get to enjoy the game. "

												The game itself is quite solid and enjoyable, but in its release state, it is desperately in need of work to address issues of balance, functionality, and stability. I've suffered consistent crashes to desktop upon loading certain saved games, massive framerate drops and stuttering, and the usual assortment of line-of-sight issues and teleporting enemies that were so prevalent in the initial 2012 XCOM release.I'm looking to update this review in a few days--hopefully after Firaxis addresses some of the biggest technical problems--but at the moment, this game looks like it would be more at home with a giant Early Access banner across it. This is currently an unmarked beta, and it's absolutely not worth the AAA pricetag it's demanding.			"

Everything from load screens (2 min wait), getting shot through walls, and other glitches, make tis game so frustrating. Read the reviews with people with monster rigs and they still get bad FPS.   It has now been released for a while now and devs are not fixing any issues.  This game has damaged the xcom name.Jan 2017:Still as slow as I remember.  Bugs still there.

												This game isn't XCOM at all, it's more like a strategy game race to get from Point A to Point B, I get there may be some missions were a timer is needed, but it is forced in nearly every single mission. If I have an ambush opportunity, I have time to fly across the United States to get there, why do I find I have 8 turns to complete the mission and extract my soldiers? 0 Point in Snipers at all, I lost mine as I could exctract them in time. I wouldn't recommend at all, until at least some kind of Long War mod comes out, I'm a few hours in and already it feels like the game is forcing me to do this and that as quickly as possible, the campaign has a timer, so you can't even really spend time doing the missions that pop up, you have to throw yourself at every opportunity (even with full Rookie squads, as things like Codexes appear, and you are fighting two boss enemies, after clearing the map, with a basically dead team, wiping them out).Furthermore, Overwatch in Concealment Sucks and is broken. I had a stun trooper, walk in range of all four squad members, all four in overwatch, hit my medic in the face, and then it was my turn? Not a single shot fired by the overwatch guys?!It's a good game mechanically, but the forced nature of the story and every single mission makes me wish I had not of purchased it and waited to see if the modders can fix it.

												Previous review was about the spike in difficulty (enemies gets a free move on you, they have OP abilities from start, there are timers for every thing, and so on) but those are not really problems any more with all the mods that came out in the weeks after this games release.What is still in the game thou, and something that maybe will never get fixed is the sheer stupidity in the combat system. I'm not far in to the game (as I waited for mods to even be able to play it) and the amount of bullcrap this game has done is staggering.Enemies will see your sneaking, fully in cover soldiers when they are sneaking on top of a roof two floors up. They have some sixth sense (or wallhacks) and will spot you (and shoot you) from positions that defy all logic or fairness. The game will give you some really neat action shots of your guy shooting an enemy thru a floor, a wall and a busstop. Boy, those are some strong bullets you have in your rifle there soldier!and as every one knows by now, the game runs like crap. It will make your video card work a staggering 116% (as reported by MSI afterburner, GPU meter and HWmonitor) so you better have it water cooled!TL;DR unplayable in it's vanilla state for everyone but the already initiated, the game will constantly ""cheat"" and it will take your system to the breaking point no matter the hardware.

												Multiple \""performance\"" issues make this game fairly unplayable. And yet I still play it. At it\'s core, it\'s XCOM, and that\'s great. But there are unresolvable issues related to interface lag. I put performance in quotes becaues the game is still rendering, camera can pan, etc, but there are often 5-10 second delays all over the place. Incoming radio transmission? The UI will be unresponsive for 10 seconds. Kill all the enemies and win the mission? Wait 10 seconds. Working in the base and telling Shen to do something? Wait 10 seconds for an \""aye aye commander.\""I recommend waiting until these issues are resolved.

												If you like TBS games in general and you liked XCOM: Enemy Unknown - you will love this game too.Just like with XCOM:EU - you will get sucked in from the very first minute. Holy sh|t it's so fun early on. It gets really hard to turn off this game once you start it. There are lots of things to do and to learn. XCOM 2 changed quite a bit from XCOM:EUCharacter customization is pretty huge! There are many new items, skills, abilities and enemies. The whole gameplay feels really solid and without any hiccups. RNGesus is still bread-and-butter of this game and I think that's the main reason why it's so fun to play XCOM games overall.First 1/3 of the campaign is just awesome. You have so many things to work on, but eventually you will get to a point where everything becomes quite a bit stagnant. It was the same with the previous games too. When you reach the middle-late game - it starts to feel a little bit repetitive. I would have liked to have a bigger variety of things to do on the World map. I think it was a wasted opportunity to make this game more in-depth in that category. But hey, you can't have all the things in this world.Apart from the strange approach to implement RNG into Proving Grounds (a facility where you can research new items and overall upgrades to your squad) item projects. If you are not lucky - you may not even get the items you want in a single playthrough. For example - I wanted to get an Acid Bomb from Experimental Grenade project. I did more than 5 and I still didn't get it. I ended up with several Incendiary and Gas Bombs. Oh well. This game delivers a fun, challenging and highly replayable gaming experience.			"

												Xcom 2 was an impresive sequal to enemy unknown. with over 250 hours on enemy unknown, i was Antisipating this game to come out. Since it was released I have restarted the game 48 times the vanilla game is a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but you feel a sense of achievment once you beat it. But not only that , the game is easly modable so you can easly rebalance anything in the game to your liking, and achievments stay active. The Mod community for xcom 2 is amazing, i love the soilder detail and the custom voicepacks mod. As well as some of the beta gameplay mods comming out. There are a few mods that are in progress of being made and im excited for, one of which is the Longwar mod for xcom 2. The game itself has lots of replay , but mods make it forsure that your game will never be the same.                                                                          PROS        : Graphics are smooth and extreamly high quality( most of the time details later)         : Good balance between all dificulty's, the Difficultys do what they say.        : Rng is high which means you will be investing into a new computer because of salt.         : Ironman mode #master race, Those who want to play casual can disable it tho :P (scrubs)        : Lots of classes and well thought out abilities. Between mods adding custom classes and the base classes the game is diverse. Both sides of each tree have completly different play styles which means you can fantasy your dream team to follow your playstyle. (personaly i go with 1 psi 1 ranger 1 granadier 2 spec and 1 sharpshooter)         : Combat does feel much smoother compared to xcom 1, When your soilders miss they dont miss by a football field, all xcom vets remember those moments, 98 % chance to hit, pointblank range , Somehow fires just straight up.                                                                               CONS * Biggest annoyance but adds to the difficulty are the timers in xcom 2 , Now i do reccemend you try beating the game first. but I used a mod which increases most timers by about 2-3 turns. This is not really  a con , Vanilla xcom 2 is a very fast strategy game.*Even though the game is smooth, it has a metric♥♥♥♥♥ton of bugs , like today, i found out if you haywire a mech and hack it. If you put it in overwatch, and it go's back to the aliens team with the overwatch, It can move and stay in overwatch permanantly, Essentialy until you kill it every time you move your unit it gets a shot at them. (until it needs to reload.) *Another bug which is more halorous then anything, Is sometimes how the bullet enviro damage works. When your sniper is on the middle of a roof and he fires at an advent trooper on the ground, the bullet hits him, but takes out one side of the building hes standing on, Which happens to have my ranger sitting on the side in half cover, And my ranger falls to his death because High velocity tank shells are used in sniper rifles. *Explosives OP *theres a mod to fix this, But just how generaly stupid sectoids are. I have a mod which makes them Satans minions. But in vanilla they are some of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobs. *  another mod to fix this, But how random the injury timers are. Even if you have a soilder on (impossible difficulty) 5 health and he takes one damage, He can be sent to the med bay for 34 days gravely wounded. And somehow someone who was bleeding out get revived and is sent to the med bay gravely wounded for 14 days. Thats really all i can say bad about xcom 2. I highly rate this game. It is a worthy predissesor to Xcom Enemy unknown.BTW MUSIC IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWSOME :D   "

												Damnit Firaxis! Why did you release this game in such a buggy state?Short version: The game is actually OK, but you risk running into gamebreaking bugs along the way. Without the bugs, the game would be about as good as the XCOM reboot (The prequel to this) with the bugs, you risk major frustrations.Buy the game if you want more of the same, and don't mind restarting your progress.In fairness,  I must have hit about every bug in the game. My first encounter was the second mission, that would not complete. Then around the middle, the game crashed when i tried to research Mag-Weapons. I reloaded several missions worth of saves back in time, but to no avail. That is when i restarted the game. Then, for the last mission, my game just hang on the crew selection screen after the cutscene for the mission played. I only got past that on the last update, and i started playing when the game came out.Mix into that annoying crashes, that resulted in in-game cutscenes being replayed again and again when i loaded the game back up, and you have yourself a full frustration-sandwich.I have lost a few lumps of hair to this game, which is actually a good game, but stupidly buggy.I would not buy it again if i had the choice.

												It keeps the same frustrations from XCom and adds to them. Unfortunately, everything comes down to a dice roll, which is not good for a strategy game. The player makes a strategy but can't rely on 70% chance to hit, can't move foward to surround the enemy without risking unveiling another group of enemies hidden in the shroud who were just sat there, who will then have flanking shots into that soldier you just moved and you can't do anything about it.The randomly generated maps means you often end up with a map which makes the objective nearly impossible unless you bee-line to it and pop every pod of enemies on the way. Not to mention you sometimes simply don't have any cover when the enemies have plenty of full cover - then again you can't rush to it without risking popping another pod. This wouldn't be a negative if it was intentional map design, but its not, its randomness which screws the player.There's a lot of positives, the new classes are pretty good and fit the Guerilla style very well but the game has fatal flaws at its core which feel like a much bigger drag on enjoyment than with Xcom EU/EW. I've put hours in, finished it on veteran/ironman and tried a second playthrough but it's hard to try and enjoy honestly.Not to mention the DLC so far has been atrocious.The mod community is pretty good though.

												A worthy successor to the XCOM franchise, featuring your usual incompetent rookies with crappy off-the-shelf gear, RNG that'll make you wish you weren't playing on Ironman mode, and a wide variety of aliens ready to perpetrate all of the usual♥♥♥♥♥♥moves upon your soldiers. Like its predecessors, this game is NOT a power fantasy and will constantly remind you of that.If you're looking for a challenging turn-based strategy game with a campaign polished to perfection and a plethora of replayability as you work your way up the difficulties (and take off the training wheels by turning on Ironman mode), look no further. Just the base game was worth every penny, though I can't speak for the DLC or mods.But before you buy, some cons worth noting: this game has a few performance issues and bugs, though most of them have been patched out over time. If you don't want to play with ""potato"" graphics, you'll need a good-quality computer. Also, there is a multiplayer, but it's very barebones with a ranked leaderboard and not much else, though there are still people playing and the netcode/balance is adequate.			"

												Still the same card-game mechanics, except this time the game itself isn't even sure if it wants to be Mass Effect 2-like, C&C4-like, XCOM-like or something else-like. More timers, more pressure that isn't quite justified, less balance, most things that were bad about XCOM are still unchanged. The one thing that was fixed was how overwatch targets are handled - units do not waste their overwatch shots on downed enemies anymore if they have a different target on that same turn.Of course, wierd pauses pretty much everywhere are still here; poor intel (actually, criminally poor intel, lore-wise) is still here; atmospheric immersion is worse, ironically because there is more of it - more points of failure have emerged.XCOM you could play while drinking a beer and watching what was on your screen like a nineties action flick - brave americans kicked some alien♥♥♥♥♥and looked cool doing it. This game doesn't play like this. It doesn't even play like a 'rebel tactics'. So all in all, while being graphically an upgrade over XCOM, logically and atmospherically it may well be quite the opposite.Disappointment reigns.			"

												Although it sucked away 33h of my life, I can't really recommend this game if you want a good XCom game.Cons:-If you have a 60% chance to hit the shot you're going to miss it 100% of the time. Same with hacking and melee when you have 90% chance to succeed, you're probably going to fail 50% of the times.-Doesn't matter if you're in full cover or half cover, the enemies are still going to hit stupid shots on you from far away with their rifles. They also shoot you trough a wall and you can melee attack them through a wall as well.-Abysmal fps. During the opening sequence to a mission, you'll go down to 2fps even on a good computer. Cinematics are 30fps at best and gameplay is 60fps when it's feeling generous but 30fps most of the times.-Stupidly contrived story mode. It doesn't take skill or good tactis to advance the storyline. You just have to wait around until the build, research or excavation timers run out so you can do something until you have to wait again and then constantly be interrupted by stupid alerts and investigations. Allah forbid if you try to research or build something the storyline doesn't tell you to, then you're left sitting there with your♥♥♥♥♥♥in your hand while the avatar project advances more and more and you're flying around trying to collect supplies only to be stopped by a mission to go rescue John Mc♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from alien captivity. Speaking of missions, the mission timers are ridiculously short. It pretty much expects you to run straight ot the objective and then to the rescue zone but it forgets that you have to fight several enemies on the way who have a 80% chance to hit you from whenever and you only have about 30% chance to hit them even if they stand right in front of you.-Soldiers stay wounded for stupid amounts of time. If your best soldier falls and scrapes his knee, good luck seeing him in any of your next 5 missions. Not only do they stay out for a long time, they also lose will if they get injured too much and then they'll panic even if their teammates ♥♥♥♥ing sneeze next to them and then they run out of cover and get themselves killed.-Sectoids are stupid. They have way too much health and they can just mind control you from really far or just make you panic or confused. Mindshield protects from that but why would you waste supplies on that when you can only buy one thing  before going broke. And grenades are more useful anyway since you can't rely on your weapon's accuracy.Vipers are pretty dumb too since they can try to bind you and if they fail they just take another action and poison or just straight out shoot you but at least they have less health and are easier to killPros:-Good customization options. You can give your characters a lot of different armour and headgear and you can choose from a lot of different colours. Gives your squad a lot more personality and variety-Workshop support. The mods make the game a lot more enjoyable. Too bad if you install too many the already♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FPS goes even lower and it basically becomes unplayable.-Enemy variety. Lots of different, good looking and visually well designed enemies.-Good class system. Although not perfect, at least they added new stuff and the mods make the classes even better. "

												Full of bad implementations, lack of polishing and optimzations, while it is expected that most of the bugs/freezing and simply not launching issues are going to be adressed soon, this game had plenty of testing time to actually completely avoid those, not to mention that since is a sequel, experience shouldn't be lacking, yet it does. How do every animation looks worse now? wont they ever learn? just pay attention to EVERY SINGLE dying enemy, the ragdolls are ridiculous. Lacks proper closure, explanations and is excessivelly supernatural even for an 'alien' game. Late game, you may ask yourself why you even need a gun when there's X Y Z factors present (i'll not spoil)However that is not the worst, X-COM is known for it's difficulty, and this one derailed badly on this behalf. Best case scenario, forced a challenging concept that should have been left in the 90's. Time or turn limit, whatever people want to call it, is the plague that affected this game even in before release, that wich is clearly a disgusting attempt to compensate for the terrible (brute force oriented) A.I. Pretty much the same as it's predecesor XCOM:EUBad review? so what else is wrong with it?-The game may simply not launch, forcing a validation check, that may or may not work-Bad support-Glitches, promotions sometimes simply do no work until going through the next mission (one last rookie ride maybe?)-Even on high end machines it stutters horribly-Every action has a 1-2 seconds delay, afterwards it may freeze for 3-5 second by the end of the action-Every cinematic has a ""hiccup"" or small freeze-Lip-synch is laughable-Animations are clumsy and not fluid, not to say that they actually defy the laws of physics-Shooting through walls/doors/windows and corners! never stay on a corner because it doesnt not block the line of sight as it should!-Melee attacks over walls/doors and windows as well...-The plot is weak, too many questions, not enough answers-Over supernatural even for alien stuff with kame-hame-ha shows going up and down.-Over novelized, terrible closure-End game armors/weapons are extremely generic-MASS EFFECT COMPLEX (this one assures a bad review by its own)Now so I'm not being biased or simply unfair, there are the pros. It's a newer game after all, the graphic is overall better but at some heavy hardware cost, the maps are beautifuly crafted, cannot lie about that, and the customizations is awesome as well, you could spend hours just customizing your squad with very unique appearances.TL;DR on top of the foul turn limit system, its plagued by technical issues and lacks the ""smooth and polished"" feel for such a title. Wait for patches and fixes, you won't be missing anything, and will save yourself some few gray hairs.			"

												This game is why Fireaxis needs to start implementing emplyee drug testing.  It isn't just broken, it's bad.It's not the difficulty, it's not the graphics, it's not the lag: It's the horrible, poorly thought out game mechanics that traded in working, balanced gameplay in favor of cheap gimmicks yanked from tacky Korean MMOs (read: lottery loot) and a total clusterfark of a strategic map. And the entire plot was unabashedly ripped striaght from Sorcerer King.The Doom Clock is nothing more than an arbitrary time limit that does nothing more than artificially force you down a certain research path & gameplay style under the threat of losing if you deviate from it in any way. The fanbois says this game is proactive instead of reactive - that's complete horsepucky.  This series has never been more on rails than in this iteration.All of the Second Wave options you knew & loved are gone. Random stat bonus on level up? Gone. Random rookie stats? Gone. Flanking aim bonuses have been reduced to a flat rate that doesn't involve any real math. Ditto for criticals. The experience points system have been traded in for raw kill totals.  Comparing the tactical game mechanics of XCOM1 to XCOM2 is like comparing chess to checkers.Your base experience, likewise, has also been dumbed down. Alien containment? Gone. Interrogations? Gone. Interceptors? Gone.  The once mighty research tree has been trimmed down to a pathetic shrub, mostly so that they could implement their latest gameplay gimmicks over in engineering.The engineering room is the epitome of XCOM2's failures. Shen tells me that she's got the technology to make a powered armor exoskeleton combat suit with flame throwers in the arms that can phase through reality and walk through walls like a ghost... but then tells me that the only way we can put a scope on rifle is to loot one off a dead enemy, because manufacturing such an advanced piece of obviously alien technology is clearly beyond her capabilities.  And it gets worse. If you want to make a +1 hitpoint vest then you go to engineering, spend the materials, and produce one vest that can be equipped by one soldier. But when you make a single +4 hitpoint armor suit literally all your soldiers can now wear it all at once. But if you want to make a powersuit then you have to manufacture each one by hand, one by one. But if you want to make plasma rifles you can build one and now literally everyone has them. But if you want to make a fancy hand grenade you have to make them one at a time and, oh yeah, they're completely random even if you've already made one exactly like it before. But that one hand grenade can be used an infinite number times. But only by one soldier at a time.  Shen, your drug test came back and it says you're a carrot.Mind you, these are all the game mechanics that are actually working as intended. I haven't even mentioned the bugs and I'm not going to, because that would take another six pages. Sufficie it to say, the graphics aren't the only place where Firaxis slept through their workday.Yet now I must get to my conclusion and the core of my complaint about XCOM2, and it is thus:FIRAXIS HAS CLEARLY PULLED A BETHESDA ON US.They looked at XCOM1 and how popular LongWar was, and they realized that, oh yeah, they didn't actually have to do any of the work that went into LongWar. The modding community did (specifically, one small and amazingly talented group of modders). They took an already good game and made it great. Firaxis took that lesson and ran with it... and ran with it... past the touchdown line, into the parking lot, and into the next state over.They released two things at the exact same time: A buggy, barely finished game that featured only a minimal amount of core material... and a modding kit. Golly, I wonder what they expected to happen next? It's rather obvious - they, like Bethesada, are 100% counting on a bunch of talented people from the modding communities to figure out how to use their SDK and finish making their game for them.Only 4 classes? Eh, let the modders fix it. Only 3 weapon tiers? Eh, let the modders fix it. Poor interface choices? Eh, let the modders fix it. Limited enemy variety? Eh, let the modders fix it. Weak core, lack of variety, poor optimization, bugs and generally bad design decisions all around? Eh, let the modders fix it. It works for Bethesda, right? Why pay our own people to this game's cornucopia of problems when you can make the customers do it for free?I can sum up all but one of the DLC in two words: ""Horse Armor.""In summary, Firaxis has given us lazy, poorly thought out game design that focuses on gimmicks rather than real upgrades & deeper content. The gimmicks are trying to prop up gameplay mechanics that were either devolved or removed outright and they just aren't up to the task. XCOM2 did succeed in bringing us a different game experience than XCOM1 did, but it failed at bringing us a better one - or even a comparable one.  This is isn't the brutal blend of strategy & tactics that we've come to love.  This is 2/3rds ""Barbie's Army Dress-up Playset"" and 1/3rd of blatant ""V - The Visitors[en.wikipedia.org]"" rip-off.

												No, i would not recommend this game until bugs are fixed! The most annoying for me are ""vison"" problems - enemies can see and attack you through the roofs\walls sometimes and your squad members can do the same so you can just activate multiple enemy pods because of this. Last mission was crazy! I was unable to aim grenades properly like there was a wall in front of my grenadiers, got visual artifacts and huge fps drops at the last battle. With the lastest hotfix (18 February 2016) and ini-file tweaks from here http://steamcommunity.com/app/200510/discussions/0/846960628563773260/ fps is... fine. Not the perfect but fine. (I have: Geforce 780 GTX, i7 2700K@4300, 16GB RAM, SSD). Visually game looks really nice.Game play is fun actually! Much more interesting than XCOM: EU/EW for me. I was mad multiple times at the beginning (Legendary difficulty), but after i learned enemy abilities and AI i'm ok with the difficulty. There is some BS ofc but it's xcom so nothing new here. Maps (randomly generated) are interesting. No scripted missions! Aliens have lot's of abilities so battles are interesting and intense.Overall there is huge potential in this game but in its current state its just unfinished product. I really hope for the future pathes.			"

												The most bugged game I have played in almost 25 years. It is a shame to release something like this. This game have a rate of almost 1 bug per MINUTE. Colision problems, movement problems and the CRAZIEST BUG I HAVE EVER SEEN: The enemies stopped to attack, move and cover and I just can attack with melee weapons. The ranged soldiers just move, but cannot attack anymore. The Viper King Mission was totally bugged and I had just 1 guy with melee. 35 TURNS to finish the mission because JUST THE GOD DAMN MOTHER>>>>>> GUY with a sword can ATTACK and 1 viper spawn every turn. The end mission status? FLAWLESS AND NONE OF MY CHARACTERS WAS HARMED. BECAUSE THE ENEMIES DO NOT ATTACK.O.M.F.G.U N B E L I E V A B L E.SHAME ON YOU FIRAXIS AND 2K.			"

												Honestly its pretty sad to see where this game has went....i loved the old ones but every single mission in the single player now is timed to like 7 moves so its basically the first 3 to 4 moves you move your guys as far as they can go to get anywhere near the objective that has to be hacked or detroyed or whatever....so you has the remaining 3 or 4 turns to complete the objective and kill 10 guys all while they can mind control through walls accross the map....They made it disgusting hard to play this game....for a game that can be slow (turn based) IT ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS RESTARTING A MILLION TIMES OR SAVING 15 times cause you finnally killed 1 dood closer to the objective but had 15 restarts to do it without losing half your squad....I just think they should have made the single player missions less time retrained. That♥♥♥♥♥♥is BS and that keeps you from strategizing at all its just a mad dash to make it near the objective....			"

												You can make a mistake once, and this game repeats TWO of the previous games mistakes. First: when aliens see your troops they do that stupid ""war cry"" and hide free movement. So you cannot plan and execute good ambushes, not even with this concealment system. Second is that hit percentages don't have ANYTHING to do with the weapons range, accuracy, range to target, possible obstacles between you and the target... In both games my SNIPERS, who should hit the target, regularly miss with 90% hit chances. AND I AM WELL AWARE OF RNG SEED MECHANIC that prevents save scumming. Even with 100% chance to hit, my guys miss the shots. Flanking the aliens does not seem to improve hitting them, even when i'm standing next to a huge sectopod, gun barrel touches that robots leg, quess what happens, missed shot, with 95% chance, several times and no save scumming. It is quite hard when 5 out of 6 soldiers miss the shot in same round.When your tactical decisions don't mean anything it is really frustrating to play the game. I hope second games incresed modding helps with this.In the next game, would it be possible to fix the percentage to calculate at least the range to your target having some effect to the hit chance?Second thing, like the original 1994 xcom game, this one and the next should calculate actual bullets firing from the gun. Now the game engine just shows the percentage to miss and nothing else. Back in 1994 is the original XCOM, you had to be wary of chokepoints, shooting when you are behind your own soldier, where the stray bullet might hit, etc... I still remember when using autocannon my soldier missed intended target, but the bullet travelled on and hit some hidden alien on the other end of the map. Or in the UFO: extraterrestrials stray shot went on and caused explosion that killed two of my team.It's hilarious when my grenadier misses big Andromedon with minigun and then hits the wall behind him. Learn from your mistakes Firaxis.			"

												Would not recommend the Mac version at this time. Performance issues seem as bad or worse than those being reported by PC users. I'll wait a few days to see if a patch fixes things, but expect I'll have to request a refund. I was very much looking forward to XCOM 2, so hopefully the game will be worth a second look once they optimize it and resolve the performance issues.Here are the main issues I noticed playing the tutorial and initial section on the strategic layer:1. The game fails to launch more often than not after hitting ""Play"" in the initial Mac options window. I only managed to get the game to launch twice out of 8 or 9 attempts. When the game fails to launch, the XCOM 2 app is unresponsive and requires a force quit to close.2. Very poor framerate as reported by PC users, especially during the pre-mission Skyranger sections. I was aware of the reports of poor performance and turned off anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion, and VSync before my tutorial run. Other settings were at ""high"" except for max texture quality, resolution at 2560x1440. Game was very laggy outside of cutscenes. Exited the game to turn on the Steam FPS counter so I could do some more fiddling with the graphics settings to try to increase the FPS, but couldn't relaunch the game.3. The main menu screen is quite noticeably bleeding through the background at times in both missions and the strategic layer. Distracting to have a ghostly portion of a desert scene suddenly pop into view when you're assaulting an urban Advent facility.System specs:iMac (27-inch, Late 2013)3.4 GHz Intel Core i58 GB 1600 MHz DDR3NVIDIA GeForce GTX 775M 2048 MBOS X Version 10.11.2 "

												I love the X-Com series, loved the original title back in 1994 and love it's sequel. I even have a fondness for the reboot of the series, of which, to some extent...I would recommend. This title however, though it has some great mechanics in place and could be quite enjoyable, has you suffering through so many peformance issues that you really have to wonder what the hell they were playing this game on while in development. They MUST have seen these issues that literally every one of their customers has witnessed, yet they just didn't bother to fix them.More often than not I sit around 50fps, then at times I will drop down to 40fps in retaliation sites. On an i7, 16GB RAM and a GTX970...that is far from acceptable for this type of game. Character customisation is great, you can set up some great plays and feel like you are being quite sneaky. In the end though, performance becomes your biggest enemy and the RNG regarding your soldiers shots cuts down any tactics you had in place. I want to play it, and I want to enjoy it...but they messed up so damn hard. Sorry, Firaxis, fix it before releasing any more DLC and we might see a change.			"

												The game features some nice updates since the first part: hacking, soldier customization, even the increase in difficulty and the change in settings where you are always being pursued by the aliens (which I personally do not like, but am willing to accept). Visuals look great too. If I were to base my review just on gameplay, the review would be positive.However, the game is still very buggy, even though it's been a long time since the original release. This is the reason why my review is going ot be negative. It has problems setting resolution (requiring me to reset the game resolution every time I launch it), the support for gamepads is buggy (I don't use a gamepad, but I have a few joysticks connected and the game assumes I'm using them, even though I have Mouse as the control scheme - the buggy controller support results in inability to name saves, because edit boxes behave as if the left arrow were pressed all the time), the game crashes once in a while - and those are just the biggest problems. These problems seem to have been known for a long time, so it doesn't look like they are going to be fixed ever.Then there are a few intentional interface design decisions that make things difficult. Texts are rendered on floating screens with a pulsating random effects - making it painful (literally) for someone like me, whose eyes are not perfect. Fortunately, this can be turned off by directly editing the config files. The transitions between different parts of the ship interface may look great, but seeing the same transitional 5-second animation for the 50th time during an evening isn't fun. And again, there's more.So overall, the gameplay is great, but the technical problems make the game so much worse than it could be. Thumb up for just the game contents, but thumbs down for the technical problems, resulting in an overall thumbs down.			"

												XCOM is back and aside from a few annoying details, it's better than ever.Virtually every area of the game has seen an improvement in some way. The strategic layer, combat, classes, soldier customization, enemy AI, enemy variety, mission variety, maps, resource management, all improved. But optimization and overall polish has definitely taken a hit, and there are a few questionable decisions that hold it back from being perfect.On the strategic layer back at the Avenger, managing your base's allocated space has seen a pretty drastic overhaul, and the new contact system replaces the satellites of previous games. In general, you have a lot more control over what missions you take and what you spend your time doing, instead of always passing the time by scanning for activity like in Enemy Unknown. Now as different scanning opportunities pop up with all different kinds of rewards, you can proioritize which place you'd like to take the Avenger to scan based on the rewards that each location gives out.As far as managing your space goes, the new upgrade system is a welcome improvement over EU. Now you don't need to wait until late-game to get the most out of building generators, for instance. When you unlock the next level generator that increases output, you can just upgrade the generators you have. It's a system that punishes you for early building considerably less than EU did. In addition, each facility can now be staffed with engineers, which are a resource that you'll gather over the course of the game. Staffing facilities gives different bonuses depending on each facility, and you can switch up which facilities are staffed on the fly to focus on what you need at any given time. Combat is much the same as EU and EW, with some subtle refinements and UI improvements here and there. Grenades and explosives are more powerful and more important now, as you'll often fight armored enemies who need to have that armor shredded by explosives before they become vulnerable. Verticality plays a larger role now as the new maps are built more with setting up for height advantages in mind. The procedural map system works brilliantly and honestly feels like these maps were handcrafted. Each of the replacement classes for the classes from EU is a step up from the last game, and each one has two distinct paths of skills that almost make each side feel like their own class. The Ranger replaces EU's Assault class, and can be specced for stealth melee or a shotgun vanguard. Sharpshooter replaces the Sniper and be specced for pure sniper or as a gunslinger (a pistoleer that actually has distinct advantages over a sniper -- I once took shots at 8 aliens in one turn using the Faceoff skill that lets you take a free shot at every enemy in range). The Specialist replaces the Support and can be set up as either a field medic or a hacker, and comes with a drone that allows him to heal or hack remotely. The Grenadier replaces the Heavy and can be either a demolitionist focused on explosions or a heavy machine gunner that focuses on the usage of miniguns. And there's a fifth class this time around, the Psi Operative can be acquired earlier in the game than Psi troopers of EU, and is its own distinct class with tons of great abilities. My favorite is being able to permanently mind control one enemy per mission. And the best part of all of these classes is that you can mix and match skills from both sides of each class, so you have a lot of freedom in builds.Soldier customization is great. You have a lot more control over how your soldiers looks, with customizable faces, names, nationalities, bios, props like shades, headbands, bandannas, headgear like hoods and helmets, full control over weapon and armor color, you can add patterns to weapon and armor (and might I add, weapons and armor can be customized separately), you can pick variants armor torsos, arms, and legs (except for the  middle tier of armor -- you can't change the torso there for some reason) and can even upload your characters to a global character pool so the people you've created will appear in future playthroughs. One big missing feature: If you save a character, you can't load that appearance/description onto a rookie, you just have to hope you bump into that soldier again randomly if you want to use him. To that end, I refrained from using the character pool and will just manually recreate my soldiers next time if I want to re-use those characters. But you can also create characters to be engineers, doctors, or bad guys if that's more up your alley. And finally this one is to Firaxis (thanks for reading, Jake): Give us some more helmets, please. Such a great selection in EU and EW and yet there's only a handful in XCOM 2, and they don't look so good.Now for some negatives: The game is not optimized well. At all. Back at the Avenger it's  not uncommon for dips down to 10-20FPS, and I have a capable rig playing on reasonable settings. I had better performance on missions after the initial ten-second stuttering as the map first loads, but many people have terrible performance all around. Here's hoping Firaxis addresses this in a future patch and manages to make this game more playable for more folks. It's unacceptable that a game in 2016 that was delayed and made exclusive for the PC runs this poorly, especially when the visuals, while ultimately good, are nothing crazy. There are also frequent hitches like the game hanging in between turns, actions taking longer than they should to start/stop playing, UI and sound bugging out. It's hard to understand why the game shipped like this when Firaxis generally knocks optimization and overall polish out of the park.Mission timers. Oh boy. Mission timers are a divisive topic within the community. Some people love them, some people say they ruin the game, some people don't care much either way. I played on normal (""veteran"", as it's known in-game) and won my first campaign, and on normal the mission timers are very tolerable. On higher difficulties however, the general consensus seems to be that they're only there to force you to rush and make mistakes. I definitely agree that they're artificial difficulty at best and while they didn't bother me so much at my difficulty level, if I had the choice, I probably would have disabled them. They didn't detract much from the game, but at the end of the day they didn't really add anything.Wounds. My biggest gripe with the game. Injuries for your soldiers are much, much more prevalent this time around than they were in EU. If a soldier takes any hit, no matter how strong their armor is, and no matter if they get healed with a medkit, they're wounded. Wounds come in three flavors, lightly wounded, wounded, and gravely wounded. Grave wounds last up to an in-game month, and while this isn't so bad in the early game, by late-game you're going to be on missions where high-ranking soldiers feel almost mandatory to counter what you're up against. There's a facility where you can staff an engineer to cut recovery times in half, and even then the amount of time your soldiers spend wounded is obscene. The EU system of soldiers only being wounded when they take more damage than their armor adds to their health was much, much better, and I hope this new system is addressed in a patch.Negatives aside, the game that we got is pretty much just EU but bigger and better in every way. It's not perfect, but what is? It's got some problems, but what doesn't? I would still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody, especially people who liked Enemy Unknown.			"

												What a let down.   Game is only a short 20-30 hours tops.   Very linear, extra simplified over the other Xcom remake, has some annoying game save corruption and other odd perf bugs.   The game has really strayed far from what X-com is about.  Hopefully someone will mod in a real xcom game here.Instead of tactical game play, there are tons of missions where you have to do something in a small fixed number of turns (ie, defend/destory X object in 6 turns.)  this means you just have to rush to the objective and end up losing tons of units less you save scum or don't care and just go and lose the mission. Instead of a really good AI, they got lazy and just added in teleporting monsters (teleport next to your guy, free shot, rinse repeat),  ones that have very high move rates so they can close in on you in one turn even if you setup a shop tacticaly a few screens away.Due to the forced events that control game time, the game has limited replayability (compared to say X-Com:UD or X-com:TFTD.)  Save your money, buy it for a one time $5-10 expiernce when it goes on sale.			"

												I like the game because I love xcom, but I can't recommend it. There are performance issues, bugs and just unexpected lazy efforts in some areas by the devs. My computer is high end, I get mega load times and huge lag spikes some graphical errors here and there with animations. They say it's not universal and they are aware that some high end systems have issues. That's basic laziness because things like that would easily be found out with any, ANY competant testing. Who did the math calculations? They should be fired and never allowed to work anywhere near a computer or anything electronic again. Oh you can miss 98% shots 10+ times on a playthrough but good luck ever making a 30% hack. 30% = 3 out of 10 in most parts of the world if not all. Try a 30% hack 500 times and let me know if you ever succeed. These aren't game breaking but seriously annoying. Gee let me try that 50% hack, nope denied, everyone is discovered, enjoy, be sure to try next time. Seriously? There is very little strategy in this one too, kill, kill, kill, kill. What you build and in what order matters very little in this one, just do every missions, destroy the avatar buildings as fast as possible, unless you like reloading saves never try to hack anything and never bet your mission on a single shot unless it's 100%. It feels more like a step back from the Xcom Enemy Unknown not an improvement. This one EVERY rookie can be a psi operative lol, and no jets vs. saucers, if I didn't know better I'd think this game came first and Enemy Unknown was the more advanced newer game. Just my opinions, play it and judge for yourself. If you never played the earlier versions you'll probably love it, if it runs well on your computer.			"

												At its current state of unfinshed product I would not recommend this game. After about 20 hours or so I am finding, and others if you care to read the forums, that there is a ridiculous amount of crashing and failed launch start-ups. As for me every load I attempt to load up in-game continually gives me a game grashed scenario, thus now I am not able to play period; as of this moment of course. Until you see a major update in the update section I would recommend you stay away from this game.			"

												I don't normally downvote games when I have so little playtime, but here, I feel it's justified. That playtime you see - about 15 minutes of it is actually game time. The rest is being stuck on a black screen right after the 2k logo etc., I have tried nearly every fix there is, and that I could find, to no avail.If I pay $60 for something, I expect it to at the very least be functional on the most basic of levels the day it releases. Yes, it functions for some users, but many have various performance issues - mine being one of the worst out there. So, I am posting this review of the game to clue prospective buyers in - it may be hit or miss with your performance, and it may not even run if you're really unlucky. For those curious, I am running Win7 64-bit, gtx980ti 6gb, 32gb of ram, and an intel6700k 4ghz. Maybe this information will help you in deciding whether you want to buy the game or not.Perhaps if they fix it in the future, and I decide to buy the game again, I will change/delete this review.

												AFter playing XCOM: enemy unknown I was interested in the XCOM series, but I wasn't too keen on getting XCOM 2 because I found enemy unknown to be lacking and at some points rather dull. But for the autumn sale I got deluxe edition. And I can say this, I love this version of the game! It has more refined graphics and the characters movements look more natral whether its a cutscene or actual in game movement, theres a wider veriety of enemies to fight and the story is very interesting and with the DLC's you get more weapons, items and even some unique units to put into your squad (which I won't spoil). I love the depth of character customization and equipment modifying that helps me make my best squad.Along with this the game has new types of missions and mechanics. such as if one of your characters is unconcious and the mission requires you to go to an evac point, you have to carry that character with one of your other squad mates, otherwise they become MIA. But if a member goes MIA that isn't the end of them, it is possible for you to recover them if you get a VIP rescue mission because they can sometimes be the VIP you have to rescue.Theres so many things to talk about in this game, but one thing I'll say is this. This game far outdoes the previous game and is well worth getting.			"

												Around a year ago I was in two minds when it came to recommending XCOM 2 or not. I enjoyed my first playthrough, but there was something I could not put my finger on that, unlike XCOM:EW, deterred me from repeat playthroughs. That has certainly changed with the introduction of the Long War 2 mod. It turns a solid but somewhat unoriginal sequel into something that I'm enthused by all over again. It makes the game different enough from the preceding game in ways I care about.Without mods, XCOM 2 felt like a solid refinement, but not enough to sustain the time investment that multiple playthroughs would require. And without multiple playthroughs, it's hard to get a solid feel for how the hidden numbers behind the strategic layer play out. And without a firm understanding of that, it simply becomes a long string of loosely connected tactical missions.I'd still recommend XCOM: Enemy Within before this. If only because that's bound to be cheaper, and is still an excellent game. After finishing that though, I do feel that the current state of XCOM 2 with the mods that are available makes it worth moving on to once you are done with EW.			"

												(05/02/2016)I dunno, feeling bit iffy.97% flanking shots missingevery mission is a race against time.I dunnoPlayed x-com 1 on impossible, and it's got less bu****it shots than this one does on 'classic'Left me with a strange feeling.Doesn't feel like x-com in any way.Gonna give it some more time.But it's allready drained all my energy today.Left with a sort of sad, empty feeling.My expectations where too high I guessEdit: (06/02/2016)Not only that, but it is very clear the game got rushed.Too many bugs ruin the entire experience.One time you can't see what you're hacking, as the camera thinks holding a wall in front of your screen is more interesting. Another time, you see an enemy soldier slow-walking out of his position, rubberband back to where he was. Then he performs the same move, and suddenly one of your own soldiers drops dead without anything attacking him.When trying to move your squad somewhere in cover, checking out good locations, the camera also loves to jerk back to the character every 2 seconds.Picking a good spot can thus result in the wrong tile being targetted instead, ruining everything.On other times, targetting the correct spot refuses to respond to the move command untill you wiggle the mouse around a bit.Too much 'lagging' and extremely long loading screens ruin the experience even more.A high-end computer turns into a vacuum cleaner and has trouble switching smoothly from one screen to another.This is especially the case in between missions.Even returning back to base gives you enough time to do some groceries.By the time you get back, it may have finally loaded.There's also too much aggravation during missions.A 99% hit shot at point blank range against a berserker decides to result in a miss.And more too often, do enemies with 20% chance to hit your people, get a perfect shot at them.Launching/throwing grenades now 'locks' to a tile.No more free-aiming, when you know you could hit 3 targets if it didn't force you in this position.Resulting in more too often, having to choose between hitting 1 big enemy, or 2 smaller ones.While free-aiming could perfectly get all of them.X-COM 1 had me hooked from day 1, and still makes me play it with a lot of pleasure on impossible difficulty.X-COM 2 is depressing me to a point, where my energy is drained. And I must even push myself to turn the game on.It definately needs a decent fix at the point of this writing.Looked forward to this one so hard.Never have I been disappointed so horrendously before.Guess I expected too much.Edit: (07/02/2016)Now even more bugs pop up, as 2 mutons and a berserker show up.Having hit a regular muton with fire ammo, he is going to burn to death on his next turn.So the heavy can focus on the berserker.No matter how many times I reload this particular save, the heavy keeps firing at the near-death muton, no matter how many times I try to force him to shoot the berserker.There is even the third one in his sight, and that one isn't even an option when klicking it's icon.The grenadier guy wants to finish off the dead muton, no matter what.(spoiler): If even troops start taking random orders (not even disoriented or anything), then central could have saved the trouble of freeing the commander. Since these freedom fighters take orders of their own anyway.Watch the bug here:


YouTube™ Video: X-Com 2 infant problems: Bugged to the core 

			Views: 42		

			2 days of suffering since it's release, is what X-COM 2 has been. This is only one of the many issues the game suffers from.		

And after trying to move a ranger in close from a different angle (since the suggested path makes him open), the game suffers a critical crash.The game definately needs a stabilize protocol at it's current state.Edit: (08/02/2016)Bugs keep popping up left and right.Game crashes, wrong actions being taken, etc...Launch grenade! ..... evac point gets marked instead... -.-Wait... wut?For 3 days, I've been sighing and staring depressed at the screen how one horrid bug after another unfolds.When you're reloading the same file 10 times in a row, hoping the bug will not trigger this time, you know you got some real quality on your hands.Also, why do extract data missions require you to kill all aliens as well?Package is secured, there's 135464645 billion more aliens around on the entire planet.But killing 3 more is a must to have the objective completed (or it's marked as failed).Sir, we got the data allready? -.-Just sitting, feeling your life drain away from all the stupidity that occurs, and sighing the day away.I thought games where meant to be interesting and entertaining?Even the people living with me are affected by the way this just brings me into a dark depression.I understand there some masochists out there, who love seeing their entire squad get bludgeoned.I just want to see my people make it through the day and actually advance (without stumbling into another 50 bugs).Left with an empty feeling.Forcefully pushing myself to advance.Why am I not playing boshy or another anger-inducing game then?Because X-COM did things right.Yes... did.This one... it's something... but it's not X-COM...Final report (10/02/2016):After 5 days, beating the game on commander (classic) difficulty, I can finally make my final report.And sadly enough, it still remains a non-recommended from my point of view.Replayability is extremely low compared to it's predecessor.The Avatar project counter ensures that you have to, sooner or later, make a move towards the end objective.This excludes having time enough to explore more, train more troops, and all around have a lengthy ammount of good fun.The player is constantly being rushed and pushed. The game tells you how much time you have, untill you're forced to end it, taking away the player's freedom entirely.Thankfully, the modding community is very active. Most likely, there'll be a mod where this avatar project no longer limits your play time.I loved spending hours in X-COM 1, finding new recruits and exploring their potential. Literally playing for months on one playthrough, in search of assembling those particularly unique good people.Which also brings me to another minus point: There is no second wave option, once you beat the game.'None are equal' and 'hidden potential' are nonexistant, 2 of the options which where my favourites.Once you beat the game, you get the choice to make another playthrough, and that's it.Only ironman remains, but what's the fun if you can't add in random generators of your choice?Again, it'll be completely up to the fanbase to make mods for these.There was also a dissappointing lack of customization options in terms of character creation.What was promised as an endless ammount of possibilities, ended up in only 6 faces to pick from.Also props and such, fall pretty short if you look at them.There's too much 'cheating' going on in the game as well.Have a patrol passing by, and waiting for them to leave to sneak past?The moment you do so, the computer decides to send this patrol right to your hiding spot, instead of completing it's patrol route.Dumbass enemies like the sectopod, andromedon and gatekeeper, destroy their own facilities with their patrols. Showing little to no care given to the facilities in which their own avatar project is being processed. Some patrols even refuse to move, when your team is hidden away, waiting for them to pass. Resulting in an endless loop of ending your turn, waiting for these stubborn guys to move on.This ruins the stealth aspect of geurilla attacks, negating them pretty much entirely.Operating in shadows is only good for getting that first scout off. It pretty much ends in guns ablazing. An attempt at being groundbreaking, but failing to do it's part.If you plan to play the game vanilla only;Wait untill it's on sale.With the game now completed, it fails to keep me in a grip like X-COM 1 did.

												Firaxis is kinda infamous for buggy releases but this time prelease reviews were claiming it's relatively free of game-stopping bugs, only chock-full of visual animation/camera bugs. While it seems like there aren't a ton of of game-stopping bugs there's still one pretty major one: During any mission the game can crash and corrupt every single save made during the mission, including autosaves. On ironman this means game-over - you have no chance of salvaging the run. Without ironman you can go back to the latest save made on the world map - though considering that the intended/prefered way to play xcom as stated by the devs is ironman a bug like this is unacceptable. Personally I ran into this bug around 3 times even before the final mission but what takes the cake is that this bug seems to be most common during the final mission - several prominent streamers had their ironman-run killed right during the final mission due to this bug and one streamer I occasionally watch is now waiting until there are any fixes for this bug before attempting the final mission.Other noteworthy bugs include the enemy AI completely borking out which in turn has the effect that the AI's turn takes an abnormal and aggravatingly long time while actually remaining completely stationary and inactive.Another common bug is the alien viper enemy being able to use their tongue-pull to pull your soldiers without any line of sight and through entire buildings.Combine these technical issues and game-stopping bugs and the extremely poor optimization that a lof of people already have drawn attention to and I don't see how Xcom 2 deserves to be supported/bought at full prize in its current state. If you put aside the technical issues Xcom 2 is a fairly fun and decent squad-based TBS/RNG-BS game and would be worth the full prize for fans of the genre like myself - in its current state it's a lot less clear cut. My advice would be to hold off and wait until patches are out and while you're at you might just as well wait for a sale. Personally I won't buy any Firaxis game at launch anymore and instead hold out for patches and sales. At this point I just don't trust Firaxis to not release a game with game-stopping bugs and I don't think they should be rewarded with full-prize sales for a MO like that.edit: i feel like a lot of reviewes kind of glossed over the more major bugs, this one does a good job at addressing the issue imo: http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/xcom-2-review/1900-733/ "

												Overall game is great but it is very frustrating when enemy can see you and shoot through floors. Game navigation is a bit sloppy and annoying. The worst part is that every mission seems to require you to finish it in specific number of turns which makes game more of a chore than fun. I think this game has NOT an improvement.

												For someone, who don't want to read this all:Positives:+ improved game mechanics+ ""new"" classes of units (Grenadier, Ranger, Specialist, Sharpshooter, Psi Operative, SPARK - in DLC Shen's Last Gift))+ many kinds of enemy units+ more tactic possibilities than XCOM: EU or EW+ great graphics+ nice soundtrack+ thrilling storyNegatives:- unlike old x-com series you don't have to take care of many things (game is easier in some ways)Ok, where to start. After XCOM reboot, most players were expecting, that this XCOM will be underwater. Luckily it's not like that. I mean, I like Terror from the deep, but it didn't bring anything new (but this game has a little legacy of Terror from the deep - magnetic weapons). This XCOM is really big surprise to me. It keeps game mechanics of XCOM, but it has many improvements. You are on the opposite side in this game, prepare to be an intruder. Now it's not the time to defend the Earth, but conquer it back! Your forces are hiding in flying base and it's your responsibility to make right choices. I'm disappointed with one thing. Games in this age are getting really easier. I don't mean, when you switch difficulties (you can make every game really challenging), I mean, do you remember old x-com series? There were many things that you have to take care of (richer micromanagement). In this game are only several things. However, it won't stop me to really enjoy it. I recomend this game for fans of the old series and for players of new XCOM.Guys, just enjoy it!P.S.: I consider XCOM 2 better than XCOM: EU or EW.(Edited and updated 01.10.2016, 23:20)			"

												TL;DR? = Unenjoyable, Every mission felt like a chore, stupidly flawed probability system, missions gradually become impossible to complete, game forces you to play how it wants you to play, timer to beat the game makes it virtually stressful and unrelaxing. I personally enjoy turn based games with a strategic and tactical element implemented to make you feel like a commander of a fireteam. This game fits right in there but with major disappointing twists that have rendered it unejoyable and everything about it is forced onto you. In addition, one thing I HATE the most about this game is the element of probability, and not just that but the probabilities you get in terms of a successful hit are very unrealistic and just straight out annoying.In the beginning of the main campaign, I was having fun. Missions were playable, but only easy if you knew how to position your fireteam and target the most lethal and threatening enemies first while taking care of your own team in order to suffer little to no losses or damages. I was mastering that pretty well. The enemies I faced were a suitable match to the soldiers and lack of equipment I had to begin with which was fair enough. Then came this AVATAR project. Now I understand Firaxis wanted something unique, but to implement some sort of timer required in order to beat the game well thats just thrown any form of relaxation and joy of the game straight out the window. Then enemies staretd to become harder, and I couldnt keep up with improving my team and equipment. The game forces you to use your veteran teams more often due to the sudden rise of difficulty. Leaving you with no chance of using any additional rookies to promote them and give them access to better equipment. The further into the game I got, the more stressful it became when you lost even one soldier (who was either a squaddie or Cpl) because that meant you needed to replace him/her, but that was vitually impossible because I have now reached to that part of the game where every mission I play now is extremely difficult for rookies. I then eneded up having to restart because I kept losing soldiers bit by bit after every mission. How I was losing them I will explain later.Now the missions themselves I believed were forced onto the player. You're given a mission to do in which although you have an option to skip it, you will suffer a serious penalty if you do. Now you're probably asking, why would you want to skip it anyway? Well maybe because I was in the middle of picking up a supply drop and researching equipment to further improve my fireteam, and I know that if I don't finish those researches then I won't stand a chance in hell in doing any further missions. I understand that sacrifices have to be made sometimes in order to complete a mission, but sacrificing after every mission makes any future missions impossible to complete. It's stressful enough that you need to spend time in collecting supply and researching equipment in order to keep up with the mission difficulty, but then to stop me mid way and literally URGE me to do this mission or I suffer a penalty, its just silly. I also understand that they make us do these missions so that we dont go ahead of the difficulty and enter a mission with a fully kitted out fireteam making the mission a walk in the park, but the difficulty is already way ahead, after the fact that I lost two soldiers from the previous mission, and I had to waste supply recruiting more which will be useless because they dont have the equipment to even survive for two turns in the next upcoming missions (sorry for abusing the word ""missions"").Now onto the stupidly flawed probability system. 6 out of 10 ten times I was given a probability of a 70%+ chance of hitting the enemy and I end up missing. 2 of those 6 misses my soldier was in point blanc range of the enemy. Not only that but on several occasions my soldiers were behind full cover and end up getting critically hit back to the stone age as if they were sitting ducks out in the open (and no they weren't being flanked because the sheild symbol was still blue and not yellow). You were doing a good job killing off the enemy fire team with no wounded soldiers because you mastered the arts of flanking and cover just to have one alien, suddenly blessed by the vision of god and snipe one of your guys who was behind a brick wall. I stopped beliving it was due to unluckiness and started thinking that it was just plain bull, since it happened consistently. Overall, the game became less enjoyable after every mission. The missions started to feel like a chore instead of actually being hyped to do them. The probability system works against you and in the favour of the AI, despite following every rule in the book when it comes to a turn based, stay-in-cover-and-flank game. The game makes you play how it wants you to play, and any diversion from the ""script"", and you get severly punished. 2/10 would not get critically sniped behind full metal cover again.			"

												Full of bugs. - On some tiles despite the fact that the interface shows you can go there you cannot, this even if you change views. This totaly ruins the already limited tactics you can apply. - The game freazes in cutscenes (e.g when the Advent reinforcements arrive, when you discover enemies etc.) and also randobly after totaly random turns. You have to wait minutes until the game gives you back control of your units. - The game crashes in cutscenes (e.g. when you destroy a Avatar base and  it explodes at the end of the mission) - Idiotic tutorial, it forces you to move in particular places on the map, forces you to make bad decisions and you loose soldiers. This not mentioning the fact that it does not explain anything useful. I played most of the XCOM series and it confused even me. - The aliens are overpowered even in the second level dificulty (Veteran), they hit you 90% of the time from insane distance, most of the time with critical (even if your troops are under full cover) and 80% of the time your troops panic.  - Your troops suck, the sniper misses shots with 90% chance to hit 2 times in a row, the heavy never hits anything, so on so forth. The only good soldier is the ranger.  - Another huge inconsistency that prooves the AI advantage over the player: Turrets. A hacked turret never hits anything even from almost melee range while a turret in AI control will hit you half way across the map evey time. I will stop with the examples here im sure there where other players mentioning these things in other posts. My conclusion: - this game is not fulfilling his role as a recreation, is not fun, gives you no satisfaction, after playing and while playing it leaves you frustrated and with a very bad impresion. I know the difference between a complicated hardcore game and a really bad implemented one, this is the latter. Unless they fix it don't waste your money and time on it like I did.			"

												I'm gonna try and keep it short. I was a huge fan of Xcom Eu, and like many, was eagerly awaiting the arrival of Xcom 2. I preordered the game and found very quickly that i should have waited until it went on sale. The modding community is the only thing that made this game bearable for me. Why wouldnt i recommend this game? It's tedious and exhausting in comparison to its predicessor. The game constantly makes you feel rushed and forces you into sloppy compromises during game play, such as putting a 5 round timer on missions. Honestly, if it werent for the modding community, this game would be a wash. theres literally no compelling story line and the characters are easily forgettable. Read some of the more extensive reviews before buying this game, they do a much better job of explaining it than i, and please, if you feel the need to buy, at least wait until it is on sale. "

												It's XCOM baby!Going into this I was expecting basically an up-scaled EU/EW with a tweaked storyline.  While it looks similar, the feel and gameplay vary greatly from the first game.  I just finished my first run through and I enjoyed every second of it.This isn't the old school ""overwatch till death"" game we're used to, You actually gotta take risks and think tactically to get anything done in XCOM 2.  Not only are you weaker than in the first game, the enemy is way way stronger, and you'll be punished badly if you make a mistake.  I accidentally moved one of my soldiers 2 tiles too far and lost 3 of them in the aliens' turn.If you enjoy getting the most out of meagre resources while fighting endless enemies with a few good, though fragile, men( or women), This game doesn't dissapoint.  The only criticism I have is the graphics glitches that sometimes occur, like a movie not loading, or the screen freezing for a while, but I put that down to growing pains, and the development team already said that they were working on those.

												I loved XCom, and beat it on Normal Ironman [1] twice. But after eight hours XCom 2 (Veteran dropping to Rookie after a while, Ironman again) seems hopelessly, needlessly hard.May have another go on Rookie from the start, but right now am not inclined to.If you don't play Ironman, you may of course find it easier. Much of the hardness takes the form of viciously punishing small mistakes - being able to restart the mission would help a lot there.(I have no-interest in non-Ironman play - it just doesn't have the same rewards)[1] Self-imposed, since the single save isn't reliable against software faults.

												The developers of XCOM 2 were upset that early beta testers of their game found it to be too easy.  They responded to this problem by adding difficulty, not by restricting the number of turns available to finish a mission or by making the enemy AI better, but by upping the enemy HP and throwing more of them at you than is reasonable.I'm on the first terrorizing mission of the game.  My squad size is four.  It's impossible at this point to have increased it to five because there haven't been enough missions to get someone to sargeant rank.  When I move forward for the first time on the map I uncover five enemies.  They each take a volley from my entire squad to take down.  The five enemies are: a sectoid, two commanders, and two stun lancers.  One of the civillians next to me is actually a shape shifter.  If I kill anyone other than the sectoid in the first round, it's immediately resurrected as a zombie.  The shape shifter gets to reveal itself and attack in the same turn regardless of whether or not I get close enough to it to make it transform.  There is literally no way for me to avoid having at least one stun lancer running through my party knocking people unconscious after the second round.XCOM - you didn't make this game more challening by making it more unfair.  You made it infuriating to play by obviously overstacking the deck against me.  This♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't fun.			"

												Looking for something better than the originals or long war ? Probably best to go back and play those.-cons:  -turn timers: so many posts on this not even worth mentioning anymore  -char pools dont work properly  -graphic glitches galour   -limited gameplay due to rush tactics and rush campaign tactics = pain  -music isnt as great as EW/EU  -fun factor sub par +pros:  +nice new graphics  +cool story if your looking to expand on xcomsummary;If your a die hard fan of the original series. Wait and research until all the cons get fixed. This game has more issues than a magazine stand. Too much hype and too many apologists. To this day I cannot understand the release delay as its an utter piece of junk until things get sorted.  Most likely another franchise looking at the cash cow and to the mod community for polishing their mistakes. Currently nothing to see here move along, move along.			"

												Well, after i have played over 200 hours, i think it is time for my own little review.I have played XCOM2 since release and it gave me very mixed feelings from start on.Is it a bad game? No, of course not. It really is a good game.I really do recommend buying it! (the base game, not the DLCs)Install all the cool mods that are out there and enjoy the game!But if it is a good game, why do i give it a thumbs down?I play XCOM since day one. UFO, TFTD, etc... I have played them all.I do not consider myself a pro gamer but i have played them all.And i really really loved the new XCOM EU/EW.But XCOM2 just makes me sad, mad and angry! It is so disappointing!On release the performance was just crappy and there were so many technical issues.Then there are bugs everywhere. Even today.This line of sight issue is just a no go for a game like this!Timers? I hate them!The user interface is just bad. This game is about numbers and gives you no inforamtion.It lacks any comfort-features and you need lots of mods to make it enjoyable.The game offers 21:9 support but no one adjustet the interface. Why do i need a mod for this?The global strategy gameplay is also designed very badly.Running an underground organisation and using guerilla tactics offers so much possibilities.All you get are the same 3 scripted missions that pop up every month at the same time and have the same goal.Why do i have to choose between 3 very hard missions when all my soldiers are wounded?Why can´t i just do an easy mission with some rookies an raid some kind of warehaus to get supplies and XP?I run a secret organisation. I am supposed to do whatever i want to do, whenever i want to do it!20 years ago, good old UFO gave you total freedom in your gameplay! There was no big story but it worked!The soldier classes are not designed and balanced very well.The DLCs are just bad. The enemies are not balanced and do not fit into the gameplay.Why does someone put in a giant sectopod when the graphic engine can´t deal with it?The rulers are a good idea but badly implemented.And so on...This game had the potential to become the ultimate Xcom but at some point in developementeverything went totally wrong. The graphics designers did such a good job butthe game designers totally went in the wrong direction. They failed miserably!But as i said, it still is a good game and i recommend buying and playing it.But for me, this is so disappointing. It just makes me sad! So sad...I really do hope for a big expansion that fixes some of this problems.			"

												9.5/10I've just completed the game on Commander difficulty and immediately decided to do it again but on Ironman as I did do a little bit of save dancing in the most intense parts of the game and want to remove the temptation next time.For anyone that loves a multi-faceted strategy game that delivers tough decisions at every layer then this game is for you.Pros:+Aliens are much more varied than before requiring new tactics, tough decisions and intense fights.+Your non-standard gear is random. I only unlocked a few grenades and some vests on my first playthrough and they went on every mission. Can't wait to unlock new interesting items.+You can play your own way. I finished the game without recruiting a single Psi Operative.+Every non-story map is procedurally generated, I have yet to see any serious repetition as I start my 2nd playthrough.+The new perk trees are interesting and fairly balanced, I did not at any point think I wanted to bring ALL of one class on a mission. Though I did exempt Psi-Ops just because I did not have time to build extraneous facilities.+The strategy layer is much more complex than the original and the addition of strategy missions for gaining resources along with the task of building a resistance network, recruiting and assigning Engineers to Excavation, Construction or Maintenance, researching specific technologies and dealing with the Black Market makes it an entirely seperate and sophisticated game within a game.+Character customization is now an incredibly powerful tool that will allow you to create many varied characters and through the game give some extra badass-ness to your best performing soldiers.+The character pool system allows you to add your family and friends into the game, but still nestled inside the random generation of the game. I recently had one of my friends mind-controlled and shot another friend in the face whilst attempting to escort a 3rd friend to safety as a VIP. This also works with getting attached to a character in a previous game and saving them to the pool for later games as this super badass.Cons:- The game bugs out occasionally with the screen being blank or units dancing around the screen, once my screen was blocked by scenery whilst attempting to hack and couldn't see the UI.- Nothing throughout the entire game prepares you for what you will face in the final missions, it was disconcerting when I first attempted them.- The main story is a bit weak but the game never focuses on it for long.

												XCOM 2 is to XCOM what Beyond Earth is to Civ V. The same game, made slightly different and released with a lot less features than you might come to expect after playing the previous game. If you're unfamiliar, Firaxis seems to be making a habit of releasing the bare minimum required to catch people's interest and to then release $50 expansions that slowly bring the game in line with what you were actually expecting.The game plays out much the same way, including all the graphical bugs we know and love from the previous game. There's no real graphical change, just a slight alteration in overall aesthetic. The Avenger is a simplified xcom base with an ideal layout that is obvious once you work out just what things do. Put the power on the big power things, put the workshop in the middle and then build everything. The interface is completely unchanged feeling exceptionally clunky with mouse and keyboard, especially when trying to use area of effect abilities such as grenades. You don't have any mechs of any sort this time, just soldiers which are divided in to five classes now, mostly the same as the previous game just psionic is now its own class that is easier to secure a soldier for and brings back memories of an avenger full of Psi Amps considering how strong it is.There's a lot more I could say about this game. It's not a bad game, don't get me wrong... but there's no way I could recommend it to anybody. This has sealed the deal for me on this developer. Wait until they're making xcom 3 and then buy a bundle with the full game when it's on special. Spend the $90 you'll end up saving somewhere else, perhaps on a developer who's willing to give you your money's worth on release.			"

												I don't want to write a giant wall of text, so i will keep it short (or atleast try to) and summarize the pros and cons of this game. Please keep in mind that these are based on my own experience with this game. Some people have little to no issues with this game. That is why the reviews are not all negative nor are they all positive. Anyhow, back to the pros and cons:Pros:- it has the potential to be a great game, if playable (some recurring new mechanics that i did enjoy: timed missions,    blacksites and class mechanics (all classes are good and none of the builds are inherently weaker than the other builds.    It really depends on the mission, to determine which build is more efficient. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with     your builds. You have the option to retrain your soldiers at some point in the game.) - most issues people have with this game are fixable- a great and friendly community (a lot of people, who have small performance issues, can find help in the steamforums    of XCom 2)Cons:- crashes and freezes that leads to crashes (black, grey, red, blue screens, i have experienced them all atleast once in the    last 4 days) - poor optimization (low to mediocre fps even on high end rigs)- a lot of bugs and/or glitches ranging from aliens detecting/shooting you through walls to allies sinking in the floor- poor technical support on the side of the developers (a friend of mine was advised to use the same strategy as with     XCom EU/EW. That is to play untill you crash/freeze with XCom EU/EW, then start up XCom 2 and play untill you reset    your pc. Repeat this process, if you want to play XCom 2 without black screen (or whatever colour you're    experiencing))- no patch announcements, so you can forget about short term improvements and/or resolutions.Conclusion (Well, i did promise to keep it short, so here are my final thoughts regarding XCom 2):I loved XCom EU/EW and XCom LW, but sadly i am unable to enjoy and play XCom 2 due to technical difficulties. So even if i wanted to, i just can't recommend this game to anyone, untill the game is properly patched. Which is a shame, because the game has a lot of potential. I just have to wait a few weeks (or more likely months) for the game to be patched, so i can enjoy the game thoroughly and on my own terms, instead of making compromises due to poor optimization and or technical issues. I sincerely hope, that i have dissuaded atleast some of you from buying this game in its current state, because i really want you gents and/or ladies out there, to have a great and memorable (first) experience with this fantastic franchise.Cheers!SnuPi			"

Even playing friendly games with your friends quickly becomes very frustrating. Area attacks dont work frequently, dont get to move a character, shot percentages low then you can change state guy (open close shell armour) and back and all of a sunden high. Very very Laggy and Time delayed so good luck having quick games. I never make reviews but just warning you I almost want a refund in the state its in. Not happy.			"

												TL,DR Version: If you are looking for a challenge and got the system to run it, this game is for you.Long Version:Good game overall, suffers from some technical issues here and there. Seems to be fixed as of now.However it is HUGE in terms of datavolume (~25GB) so you better plan some extra time for the download.The graphics are fancy yet require quite the system to run with decent fps-rates. The storyline is interesting aswell as the tides have turned and you are kind of in the role the Aliens had before. The new classes are interesting too but sadly the melee aspect which firaxis tried to implement seems kind of weak and therefore (in most but not all cases) useless. A lot of missions have a time restraint early (I got the feeling this changed later on) and so does the genereal mission. So this is unlike XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I know a lot of people bragged about that, but I don't think it's that big of an issue. The limits in missions can hurt but also force you to take smarter and more effective decisions. While challenging, I think this would have worked better as a feature for the IronManmode. The general limit makes you feel an urge to go on and maybe also a bit of unrest or even panic which I like a lot. On the other hand this limit can be kept in check by regulary doing special missions which wasn't so hard in the end. It also feels like the difficulty went up a notch which is not a bad thing. I enjoyed it a lot but somehow liked Enemy Unknown/Within a little bit better.			"

												Nope. Just get the previous game instead. This game is using the same engine but for some reason the performance is atrocious. Add to that a whole bunch of stupid gameplay decisions like the timers (not that bad), the civilian rescue missions (seriously?) and the Avatar timer. On top of that there are tons of little annoyances like not knowing if something you purchase is an upgrade for all your team, or if it's 1x item. Note that I havent finished the game yet. Provided a patch is released that lets me play without alt-tabbing to resume frozen screens every 10 seconds I might tho.			"

												As a player that likes a calm and sloooooow aproach to missions, XCOM 2 is just not for me. That's the reason i refunded it after 2 hours.Behind the timers, there is a nice-looking and probably good game, but bugs and this design choice to limit playstyles is not worth 50 euro to me.And before i get attacked with ""duuuuurrr, there's a mod for that!!!1!"": I know that. And it's actually saddening me even more, that modders have to do Firaxis' job to make the game accessible for more players. That doesn't make me regret my refund decision. It actually encourages me that my decision was right for me.I'm sure that alot of players will like this approach, but it's just not for me, which is completely subjective. Everyone who enjoys XCOM 2 can do that. i'm not going to bash you for your opinion			"

												I can't recommend this at all with the technical problems that it has. It’s badly optimized with stutter and FPS drop even after patching. My rig is WAY ABOVE the recommended specs and can run any other newer game without problems (GTA5, Witcher 3, DOOM). I really hope they do a better job next time, because I enjoyed XCOM from 2012 even with it's flaws and I am sad that I can’t enjoy this sequel :(			"

												No fluidity to the game play. Very slow. I am an experiences Xcom player and strategy gamer, this game actually got harder when i dropped the level.  Impossible to ""just play through"" you need a degree in small group combat tactics. Then ther is the FPS issue - I have a 980Ti, and this game stutters along at 2-25 FPS in the cut screens and one crash. i have issue with the amount of time the moves take to make too. BORING. I really tried with this game. I hate it and wish i had the ability to get my money back. Game is not ready .			"

												A really good sequel that live up to its predecessor. They add many feature:-Avenger assault where your own base is attack, feels like in the old xcom.-A class for the psychic, but still i dont like they aren't lvl up by combat experience.-Ambush, a fun feature which can be mod to be more realistic.-Weapons and armor are bought only once. While you could say it was harder the other way since if you lost a mission you lost all your new gear.I have some personal problem about realistic, like shooting through roof or wall while there is no way you could know the enemy is there.So 9/10 will lose rookies again			"

												Awesome sequel to XCOM:EU/EW. You are now on the losing end of the stick and need to fight your way back to winning the earth back.New aliens, new fighting force (Advent) and lots, lots and lots of customization options.The modding is an awesome new thing too. Where modding with XCOM:EU happened, but wasn't supported, with XCOM2 it's fully supported. Difficulties have been reworked too. Impossible no longer exists. Legendary is the replacement. And it aims for a very difficult, but doable, and longer gameplay experience.I'm super stoked with this game, and want to play it all the time!Definitely should buy it!			"

												Xcom 2 is more like an xcom 1.5 than a xcom 2.It expands a little here and there, but ultimately is worse than alot of the things that made its predecessor great.1.  Bugs galore - Couldn't beat last boss cause of bugged portals and win condition2.  Monsters with cheap abilities and cheap deaths -  Deaths feel cheap and unfair and unavoidable at times no matter how well you play.  You could say ""Well that's just xcom"" but the new monsters like the Snake(especially) that can grab you halfway across the map and hold you while other enemies shoot them.  That's just cheap.3.  Timer - Forcing people to run their units into disadvantageous positions and ambushes are less fun than people think.   Some people like to play perfect maps even if it takes them 15 minutes longer.  THen let them and put timers on maps where it ACTUALLY MATTERS.Alot of other frustrating things with this game, played it on easy.  Honestly i don't think i could tolerate it on hard.			"

												I have played every single xcom game to date, this is the worst one by leagues, I've never played a game that was made by developers so angry that people played passiveley before, but it completely ruins the actual turn based strategy game part of this, where every ♥♥♥♥ing mission is a turn limited deal which gets incredibly boring very quickly. The geoscape layer of this game is one of the worst pieces of garbage i've ever seen, where countries like north america and south america aren't connected somehow, and you have to waste your time to collect your monthly cash. This game has barely any new content as well, it's an incredibly boring buggy piece of garbage that everyone should stay away from.			"

												If you were able to run XCOM with no problems on your desktop or laptop don't think for a second you can run XCOM 2 at the same capacity. I'm not sure why it's standard practice in ""next-gen"" games for every leaf on every tree be given is own physics engine to sway with absolute percision in the gentle breeze. And no, there's no turning that effect off. Where in previous games dumbing down the graphics settings makes it playable XCOM 2 might as well have two options: ""You can't run it"" and ""You definitly can't run it."" I love XCOM and the gameplay of XCOM 2 is solid. I just wish gaming companies would quite trying to shake the gold coins out of my pockets by demanding I buy a new desktop setup every year to look at their ""next-gen"" graphics. Great game, hindered by the alleged demand for 1080p turn based strategy games. Once a mod comes out that eliminates the RAM devouring effects of gentle wind and weather I'd be happy to revise this opinion.			"

												XCOM 2 is a game that tries too hard to be XCOM: Enemy unknown, by slightly changing the names of the classes and by introducing a timer and new aliens.XCOM2 Hasn’t learned the difference between “hard” and “punishing”. In XCOM: Enemy unknown both sides try to get the upper hand, the aliens through number and brute strength while the player can achieve the goals through destruction of terrain and positioning to flank, while in XCOM 2 if you don’t kill everything that you see in the turn that your unfortunate eyes sees them, which you won’t with the few hundred of them, which is understandable with the story, but with massive amount of health and damage that your B-B guns will merely tickle the Muton that will evaporate on your cavalry impersonator by looking at it funny. In addition, even XCOM: UFO defence which is known for being difficult is just difficult, not punishing. The aliens have a larger range and are usually hidden, so you have to be careful as you move, unlike in XCOM 2 where the Cortex will disable all of your weapons, teleport behind you and kill the only useful team member you have all in the same turn which will cause the animalistic “super soldiers” to go into a panic, run out of cover and then get immediately shot by whatever waits for them.XCOM: Enemy Unknown glitches are fun. You grapple onto a ledge and you get teleported under where you started, or by doing a Chryssalid dance with the dumb AI, while in XCOM 2: If you log out of the game while something is building, which you probably will as doing more than one mission at a time is about as desirable as grinding teeth against a cats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the building suddenly doesn’t exist, all the days that you waited for it have gone to waste, and the materials you invested into it are now gone. I mean, it’s not like you really need those Psi operatives to make the game playable.We’ve come this far without talking about the timer. XCOM 2 has introduced a timer for practically every mission, which isn’t fun, it’s just artificial difficulty that will make you panic. If you don’t do the mission in the time limit, the world becomes that much worse, everyone blames you while you were standing on a roof trying to not get absolutely everyone killed with the mass amount of aliens the game throws at you. Take Jet Set Radio into account: Would be an amazing game but gave everything a time limit, but there it made sense as it’s supposed to be a fast paced hip hop game.If you wanted to buy XCOM 2, my advice is: Don’t. I’m going to play some more XCOM: Enemy unknown.			"

												I don't play many games through to the end these days. Time is short with a little kid running around. So it says a lot when I played X-Com 2 all the way through the final mission. What a fun game. I played the original X-Com as well as the first sequel a few years ago. This game captures the spirit of those, while adding some new twists and turns for seasoned fans. The story is engaging, and the sense of impending doom is there. Not a single game crash, or major bug experienced.You see, the game will end one way or another if you play it long enough. Either you take out the aliens and win, or they complete their world project and you lose. I played it on an easier difficulty level, and the game still managed to send plenty of my soldiers to the hospital bed for recovery. The final mission was nearly overwhelming. Everything in between had moments of challenge without getting stale. I'm contemplating playing through again on a harder difficulty level, because I didn't get a chance to really dive into psionics.My one complaint is that the game doesn't allow you to save, then load to get a different outcome (at least, not without going through some annoying hoops). I'm not sure why developers try and prevent players from doing this. If you are the type who doesn't want to go through those hoops, I suggest downloading the ""Save Scum Roller"" add-on. TacticalUI Counter is another good add-on, and the ""Long War Perk Pack"" is nice for some rebalancing. If you want an even easier play through, try out the ""Flawless"" add-on which rewards you for a flawless victory (still not easy to accomplish, but when you do, it gives you extra resources as a bonus).

												I loved the previous XComs and was excited about this game but somehow they managed to make a series I enjoyed an absolute frustrating experience.  I have only played 10 hours but for me 10 hours is enough.  Uninstalled.  In that 10 hours, I only had one mission that did not have a timed aspect.  The game is brutally punishing.  The random rolls are just infuriating.  How you can stand one square in front of an enemy and not get a 100% hit is beyond me.  Frustrating is truly the best adjective I could think to give this game.			"

Somehow, the MP in XCOM 2 is actually WORSE, plagued with massive slow down and numerous disconnects and crashes. Firaxis needs to stop putting their money into graphics and start putting it into gameplay, because it'd be nice to have something that PLAYED well in the long run instead of just LOOKING good for all the review sites that won't play more than 2-3 hours of it before calling it ""Game of the Year"".

												Only Reason I'm putting a negative is because I get tired of the snakes grabbing me THROUGH ♥♥♥♥ING WALLS... I know that's one hell of a tongue (impressive actually, it could have OTHER uses too :wink wink: ) but come on, going through walls? it gets annoying really fast, I mean the first 5 or 6 times all's well that ends well... but for the love of the holy avatar, it is ****** annoying and one hell of a bug. Aside from that there's some ""lag"" I'd say, sometimes windows break  even before a soldier charges in, or the snakes damage appears even before they grab and bound my soldier but that's fine I guess, maybe other ppl go through the same?Other than that, this game is amazing, love the mechanics (except the tongue thingie from before), enemies are great and tactics are well, actually that word, tactics, just like in the previous release you can't just go charging in guns blazing (or you could... heh that'd be fun I guess), you have a really nice variety of soldier classes and their skills are well thought, the system in which if they suffer an injury they can remain shocked is good, the cover system oh god that's amazing, love how everything goes from being the best cover to literally nothing, ashes.Story so far with the few hours I've put in is a blast, characters are even better than in 1 (except for shen, shen father was better than lily) and I'm expecting even more surprises.All in all I do recommend this game but that ONE BUG with the snakes is a negative, really negative point for me ruining completely some tactics on important points of the game.* Update after last patch *So I've been playing it a bit more, MODS are saving this game, they´re really, REALLY saving it, new katanas, new weapons, new enemies, new maps, buuuuut, the game retains its usual mechanics and that's a win.Although since I'm still facing same issues from before, I won't change my recommendation on this game, you need to polish the game (bad optimization maybe?) and the bugs a bit more Firaxis, you made such a great game and one of the best things it has is that even though it's a rush simulator it's fun, enjoyable and really well thought to let such bugs (and their workarounds - yes I'm looking at you cap rushing the return to the avenger without knowing that it can crash your game-) ruin it.* Update*Can't play this with mods and have to constantly verify cache? Way to go, I've over 30 mods at least in FO4 with no issues and you're telling me I can't have even 10 here? This game went from a not recommended to pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, if you're reading this you're better off getting this game from a torrent (yes, I'm saying to pirate this game to hell) ever since launch it had issues, it continues to have, it's not properly optimized and firaxis gives little to no attention to the game. In all fairness I've tried a couple of fixes... and got the debug screen in which I was able to select what I wanted to do or even if I wanted to go to the final product screen, come on people, that's utter crap, uninstalling because it's too late to get a refund.

												Its times like these that I wish Steam had a sideways thumb as this is not a bad game by any means, however it does suffer with a couple of issues.Let me start by saying that I believe Xcom 2 has the potential to be a great game, it has all that I would like in a Turn Based RPG and I’ve only just scratched the surface, however there are a few balance issues that need to be remedied that make certain things in the game impossible.I have played just under 10 hours on veteran mode on the opening weekend, and have had some really good moments, however there are certain issues which I know will eventually nullify my enthusiasm.1) CoverCover seems to be a bit pointless. More often than not I lose full health squad members who are either in full cover or in half cover (I understand half cover isn’t always guaranteed). On one occasion I was flanking around the side of a garage with two troops at full health. Soldier 1 was behind a road block and soldier 2 behind the garage wall, this gave me both Half-Cover and Full cover respectively. However this didn’t seem to matter because soldier 1 was hit at distance and died instantly loosing 5 health. Soldier 2 was shot through 2 solid non damaged walls and again was killed (How the enemy would have seen her I don’t know). That doesn’t leave a lot of room for setting up your team and formulating a tactical plan if the enemy can just shoot through cover as if it wasn’t there, this for me is a major issue. I feel that either the enemies are too overpowered or the cover isn’t working as it should do. Surely a concrete roadblock would assure a smidgen of protection.In another instance, I had a full health rookie behind a barrier; the enemy melee unit ran all the way up so he was positioned on the other side of the barrier (half-cover) and killed me with one thwack to the head.2) Timed GoalsI have no problem with the idea of a timed goal; however there are 2 issues I feel need to be addressed:a) Harsh countdown times - The timed goals given are on the whole too short, running and gunning doesn’t work as combined with the above issue of cover being like jelly, it makes getting to the goal impossible and in most cases I lose the majority of my team getting there, just to have to spend all of my supplies on new recruits and thus getting stuck in a vicious cycle. (and this was in the Early game).b) Random reinforcements are too penalising, as you just have barely enough time to get to the goal. But add in the fact that 75% of the time, reinforcements form behind your team, and just mop up with 1 shot kills.From what I’ve played of the game, there’s a lot that I’ve enjoyed, there's a lot of potential and I’m genuinely excited about it, but I personally feel there needs to be a re-think when it comes to the cover situation and the harsh countdown timers.There are also a few performance issues that I believe are being looked into, however, I’m not as badly affected as some.

												Really like the game, game seems like a new fresh game, as it should. The customization process for soldiers is awesome, and I love how you can customize soldiers ahead of time and have them appear randomly.BUT, the optimization is pretty bad for a AAA PC title for just coming out. There's just a lot of lag and randomfreezes all over, so it doesn't seem too well optimized, performance-wise. I almost get the idea(as others have said) that Firaxis/pushlisher may have slacked on fixing the performance/bugs, since the game was created with ""mods"" in mind. Mods, that could fix said issues. I'm no expert, but I assume this isn't Skyrim, and should be terribly hard to optimize for such a well-established development company.I really like the game otherwise, but not gonna recommend until it's a little more stable and has a nicer overall flow.

May contain minor SpoilersTL;DR: Not as good as expected. Maybe an Addon will bring more fresh wind but the Story is very thin and Missions get dull really fast. Would give 5/10 with Sideway-Thumb.The improvements over the first part are good:- Classes fit their role perfectly and different styles are encouraged (from very mobile agressive to very static lurking). Also the new character customization options are great. However there are some minor balancing problems (Melee of Ranger too weak for the amount of risk, most of the time you can just Run'n'Gun with Shotgun for more damage)- The rework of the worldmap need you to be more active and gives you the feeling of having more control over the given situation: You can decide to a certain factor, what you're doing and how you're doing it. (more about that later). Also different kinds of Ressources (Info, Ressource, Scientist and Ingenieurs) leave room for your approach to save the world.- New mechanics like Armor,Melee and weapon upgrades bring some fresh air to the battlefield. Especially armored opponents require more tactical work in fights and changes your Setup and Loadout a lot. - The new Enemies are fun to play against. Especially the Snake and ADVENT Melee need you to adapt to the situation fast- Starting in Concealment is an interesting way to let the players feel like hidden agressors and allows for better preparation of the whole sector. Works great! - The Basemanagment seems very well thought through. There's new buildings which fit perfectly to the game and the old buildings got a great rework. The building part feels less grindy and more impactful on your gameplan.What didn't went as good as expected for me:- The Story is dull. A modern version of ""Nazi-Germany suppressing the population and experimenting with certain civilians."" Haven't seen that in a while! After 2/3 of it I already had the urge to stop playing. Currently I'm in the middle of a Legendary Ironman run (Tier 2 weaponry and armor) and am not motivated anymore.- The freedom of the decisionmaking on the worldmap is mostly illusional. It's mostly contacting the sectors to the next ADVENT Base, clear Base, repeat. That's mostly it. Also you get interrupted by Advent a lot which gets annoying really fast. After the 4th or 5th time you sit there rolling your eyes and ask yourself ""what's it this time?""- Repetitive missions already during the first playthrough. There's basically two types of Missions: First one is ""Get to Point A (Hostage, Hack Terminal, Collect Information), then go to Point B (Extraction)"". Even the special missions where you locate and collect storyobjects work that way. The second type are the missions known from XCOM 1: Rescue Civilians. Just more difficult since the aliens prioritize them more and there are less. Didn't find them interesting in the first part, here aswell. Also hidden enemies in those missions. Why?The last point is the dealbreaker for me. Even when every other part of the game got really really well refined, the lack of different missions in XCOM2 made it boring very fast for me.			"

												This game plays like a bad joke, literally. You will have the feeling that somebody is telling you a bad joke or that you suddenly became part of a trashy movie. XCOM EU/EW were pretty cartoonish to some extend, but this game feels like it is the Goat Simulator of the XCOM series. And on top of that, all the hefty bugs make it even worse.It all begins in the tutorial that does not seem to end at any point of the game. You will be FORCED to make dumb moves and you will be forced to let two people die in order to learn how the game works. That is the first ""haha"" in your face and the prelude of the horrible joke that this game actually is. The second thing you will notice is that you will be told that you are ""concealed"" which will grant you a huge bonus: The element of surprise. That is not only a lie, it is a joke in itself. Because the next thing you will do is, you will plan out your ambush. Only to understand that when you fired the first bullet, all the enemies grant one free turn, again. The worst things of XCOM EU/EW have been made even worse. There is no element of surprise. Once one of your guys fires/is spotted/jumps through a window, all of your units are unconcealed. There is no combined ambush, no group surprise attack.Than you will learn the next important thing: Hit chances are also a joke. A parody. Lines of sights are completely broken, the cover system has no purpose and the hit chances should just be ignored. This is the only tactical game I know that punishes the player for smart actions and motivates him to just randomly ♥♥♥♥ around. Really, once you stopped caring for the hit chances, your hits will skyrocket. Ever since I just took every 41% hit chance, my overall hits went up to 75%. Flanking is broken aswell. There is one effective way to flank the enemy: Put a soldier right next to him. The rest is highly ineffective or sometimes does not work at all. There can be a clear line of sight from 2 metres away with no cover in your soldiers direction and the hit chance is 35% without any flanking bonus. Oh, that is another joke: Ignore the lines of sight. Yeah, your sniper cannot actually see the enemy, but squuuuadsight. Just take the shot and watch your sniper aim at the air, firing through 2 walls and blast this stupid enemy away. It is a joke. A parody  afterall. So just do random stuff.The maps are small. In EU/EW the maps were small, but you had time. In this game, you have timers all over the place. Active timers, passive timers, non-sensical timers. If you don't have a clear 8 turns timer, you will face a situation where the enemies are already killing civillians/shooting at some sort of goodie and so on. That is a timer as well. Even the loot items have timers. ""It seems the aliens have programed their equipment to self-destruct"". This, ... this is one of those lines that actually made my laugh. This is the moment you know, you are watching a crappy movie written by untalented, lazy writers. ""How do we add more timers?"" - ""I dunno, man. Wait, how about we make the equipment go boom in 3 turns?"" - ""Awesome!"". This is so cheap, it is hard to talk about it without making this game look like a total piece of crap. And the game is littered with stuff like that. The soldier that does not hit from 2 metres away will comment his failure with ""Adjusting aim"". Yeah. You just can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't blame the gear. Your entire crew, whether it be the scientist, the tinker or the creepy guy that loves to call you ""commander"", will all lament on how you do not have time and you gotta rush, while you cannot do anything except listen to them, telling you in eeeendless paragraphs, that you don't have time. These contradictions make the game funny in a total unfunny way. You will be called ""commander"" all the time, but everybody will tell you what to do and the game will take away your control whenever it can. Sorry, I was talking about the small maps. Every map is a small rectangle. If you start in the lower right, there will be a troop of enemies in the lower left, the upper left and the upper right. That is it. End of transmission. To not trigger them all at once, so that 12 enemies get one free turn to get in perfect cover, you will always attack one troop full frontal. You have to. Time is running out and bla, bla. So, there is not much tactic in the game. You do what takes the enemy out of the game as quickly as possible.  So every map will be the same.Thin men suddenly became reptile aliens. I mean, just ... is it ... I cannot. That is dumb beyond any reason. The weakish thin men used their form to infiltrate humanity. In one of the cutscenes you see a thin man shaking hands with some sort of politician. A 3 metres high guy, looking like a giant. How can those people infiltrate humanity? And if they are viper things in reality, why did we not see any viper before? They are so awesome, they will pull your soldiers from behind full cover, through a wall and 2 cars across half of the map right into the enemy line. And than, you have another timer. The enemy AI is dumb as can be. It is not difficult to battle them mentally. It is difficult to mentally endure the artificial way this game was made difficult. If you fight a tank with a pea shooter, yeah, that will be hard. Impossible even. The XCOM AI is not smart, it will always take the same actions it did before. But is has better gear, does not care for your cover, has uber awesome skills, can take turns during your turns and when the glitches and bugs set it, they can even fly and melee attack your soldiers through walls and stuff. There are some enemies, that will have a turn every time you do anything. Literally anything. Or, when your soldier fails to hack the red light towers, the enemy does get insta-reinforcements. Right in the middle of your turn a spaceship will land and boom, here they are. All these facts combined turn the game into a huge, goofy parody of EU/EW. It will ask you to just rush and take dumb movements. Whenever you try to play smart, it will hit you in the face and go all ""haha"" on you. It will take away your control every ♥♥♥♥♥ing time it can. You will constantly switch between menues, because your scanning for this or that gets interrupted by ""hey look at me"".There is only one thing, this game is good for: If you like to create purple and pink pimps and strippers in pink fedoras with pink weapons, this is your game. Literally, that is the main strength of the game: The customization. It encourages you to go all joker on this game. And than you laugh yourself into stupidity while watching your pink grenadiers with sunglasses whip the enemy. Sadly, this is all there is. A big, fat, sad joke. A bad movie that plays a heroic soundtrack. A huge contradiction and sadly, if this has become XCOM now, I'd rather not see a third part of this series. I feel ashamed and insulted when I play this game. And that is why I could not force myself to finish it. I tried two times, I just can't endure all the crazy stuff I paid 50 bucks for. I would not recommend this game to anyone, at any time for any reason and price. A product, so flawed should be shunned.			"

												Short: In comparison worse than the first remake. Buggy, less fun due to strange physics and unnerving enemies.Long: Concerning Software, I really dislike that the mouseclicks tend to glitch a bit and my chars run to a different square. Meh. Worse is, I've had several times that the enemy's actionphase just.....pauses. It doesn't crash, it just hangs. So I had to reload the mission (not the savepoint, because it just repeats the prob at the exact same point).Smaller glitches like disappearing objects or wrong actionpoint are acceptible.Concerning content, (of course it's my taste) I really hate the 90% timebased missions (gaming-no gos: Pay to win, Waterlevels, Icelevels, Protectmissions, Timelimits!) as many others do. That there are unlogical lines of sight (my char can't shoot an enemy because there was a 1ft rest of a lantern pole) seems to be a USP of 3D Xcom   :PBut worst for me, and destroying my fun and the flow of the game, are the Special ""Alien Hunter""-Lords. They can react every time I do anything?????? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Maybe my fault for buying the DLC, but it made me stop playing the game a lot of times. Not comparable to Dark Souls Ragequits.Only the worldmap-stuff is more fun than in Enemy Within. Which is more likely to be replayed for me.			"

												I really love this game. It is well designed, beautiful, atmospheric, and did everything better than its predecesors.However, I simply cannot recommend XCom 2 at its current state. It is simply too buggy.The bugs ranges from minor issues like graphical glitches, performance drops, animation not properly displayed, to unfortunatly what I would call game breaking:I play on Ironman mode and I have lost two of my best soldiers to bugs. One of them got stuck to a wall and I cannot evac her at the end of the mission. Another was bleeding out but somehow I couldn't pick him up even the evac zone is one move away...[spoiler free, don't worry]Now the worst is the final mission...  there is a known bug that makes me afraid to even attempt it. As the game is designed you are allowed to restart the final mission should you fail, even in Ironman mode. However, people who restart their mission reported that all their passive abilities, ammo, and armor are gone. Given the difficulty spike of the final mission I don't even want to try it before they get this bug fixed.I'll update the review when Firaxis get the game fixed properly and it would be an amazing game. Until then, I don't recommend it.			"

												Let me cut right to the chase. XCom 2 is a great sequel and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the prequels or turn based games. I actually don't want to get into detail about the gameplay but rather the things that need to be fixed as fast as possible.This game really fixes some of the issues with the prequel and reinforce the strong points that made it so great. Thus far I enjoyed the game exceptthe horrible technical problems, bugs and countless issues that really destroy the enjoyability of this game. This game has so many performance issues and the framerate is all over place even with a powerful rig. It's absolutely random and really decimating the enjoyment. Furthermore there are bugs, clipping errors and absolutely broken things. It also could add some more balancing here and there. Gameplaywise I would appreciate the timed missions to be more lax in order to give the player some freedom instead of the constant rushing.I see a great game that needs some serious patching before really being enjoyed. I hope they Firaxis will deliver so that I can turn this review into a positive one.			"

												The game forces you to play stupid. Placing the objective 9 mad dashes away and giving me 10 turns to reach it is basically the game in a nutshell. I had to look to the workshop as many other people have to make the game even strategically enjoyable and not just some mad dash to the suitcase with some dice rolls.			"

												WELCOME BACK COMMANDER !When the game manages to get on your nerves with its difficulty, but you still come back to it and spend every minute of your time thinking about how to improve your strategies, that's when you know it is a real gem and you are hooked up. And that is, exactly, the case with XCOM 2.This is one of my most favorites games. It is a tactical turn based strategy game. The critics are right: it can be unforging of mistakes. It is difficult. It takes a lot of patience. But if you spend time with the game it is absolutely addicting. You are always at a disadvantage. You are always juggling priorities. You are always worried to advance too fast or advance too slow. But that what makes the game so fun. This is not a game that requires any dexterity. It is a game that requires a lot of thinking and creativity. Not everyone's cup of tea but it is certainly mine.			"

												This game is amazing, finished the story, and cant wait for the next Xcom game. Some glitches but anyways extremely fun game and story is much more hooking than i have experienced in any other Strategy games, and the character customization is amazing, so much fun to make a squad of your friends and see them fight. This game have improved a lot from Xcom: enemy unknown. but still have those camera glitches wich can be annoying, not fun looking at a wall when your trooper is shooting. The story is about 50hours long, depending on difficulty, harder difficulty will stretch the story more, and you will experience more losses and failed missions.Workshop is also a huge pluss, more gametime from that. And if you have a friend you can play it 1v1 in the Multiplayer			"

 There's a lot wrong with this game; to much to make it a valid 60 dollar purhase at this point. 	  Gameplay  The Random Number Generating system (RNG) is absolutely broken and completely rediculous. From what i understand, the RNG is a single element that applies to all XCOM units and ADVANT forces regardless of the circumstances.    For example: lets say you have a Ranger unit within 3 spaces of a target thats out of cover, and you have a 95% chance to hit; this Ranger then misses for some stupid reason. you can load from the auto save and try again, but now anyone is garanteed to miss the first exchange regardless of who attacks first and regardless of ""hit percentages"".  This type of situation can result in some pretty ridiculous kills. My best kill was a critical hit with a shotgun at it's maximum hitting distance, through a full cover wall; and that was an 11% chance to hit and 2% to critical it (AND THAT WAS REPEATABLE FROM THE AUTO SAVE!). Seriously, if that doesn't show how bad the RNG is in this game, I don't know what will.  Every XCOM class is unbalanced, overpowered, or completely useless. The XCOM classes have a handful of useful classes: snipers, medics, demolition, heavy gunner, and psi op; every other class is completely worthless unblended (putting all your class points in one skill tree) and will get your team killed.       The Combat Technician (combat hacker) gets the ability to hack mech units, shock enemies with a drone (minimal damage at best) and do local scans to find enemies within proximity of the user; Medics can heal, revive, and resurrect from a distance (that in itself is extremely overpowered, no need to keep the medic close by), and can get the ability to do all that to everyone on your team, all at one time, once per mission.      The Gunslinger (Pistol Popper) can use their pistol (not main weapon) to shoot multiple enemies, shoot multiple shoot at one target, and take a pistol shot before using their main weapon (really the only good ability they have). Snipers can shoot at multiple enemies with a more powerful weapon, set up killzones (overwatch on crack), obliterate armor or near instakill (deadeye), and shoot from anywhere as long as someone has eyes on the target.     The Blademasters and phantom skills need to be blended in order for rangers to be any good (if you didn't do this, good luck).  Alien units are Unbalanced and OP. There are a lot of Aliens you will hate to fight in XCOM 2; mainly: Sectoids, Gatekeepers, Shieldbearers, Vipers, and Codex.       Sectoids have a huge variety of psi abilities and sometimes use more than one in a turn.     Gatekeepers are tank-like psi enemies with huge AoE attacks and laser eyes.     Shieldbearers can turn any aliens around them into tanks or better tanks.     Vipers can spit venom like thinmen, and grab units with a long tongue like Smokers from L4D (btw, their snakes, not frogs, wtf, they shouldn't have a tongue ability).     codex can copy themselves, teleport, and AoE disarm units. The timers are stupid and make no sense in certain missions. Why do I have a timer for a rescue mission or an assassination mission? Why is there a timer for stealing enemy intel from a box or computer?   Release Quality   The game was released in an unoptimized state. It's glitchy, slow, and can crash pretty hard from time to time. I had to start three missions over because my autosaves were corrupted, and restart the game at the final mission to fix some texture issues.   Conclusion This game needs some serious overhauls and patches; the game is down right frustrating with the current RNG and game mechanics, and is a chore to get though. Wait till this game gets an update, patches, overhaul mods / DLC, and a drop in price to no more than $30.It's not a bad game, it's an ungraceful game that needs some serious reworking.			"

												All in all, a fun continuation of the Xcom series. If you enjoyed the first game, you will probably enjoy this. That said, if you are looking for big improvements on the first game, you may be disapointed. Much of the variety from the original (including the expansion) is not in the game. There is a really streamlined version of troop enhancements and MEC style troops, but it is not near as diverse or satisfying as the previous expansion allowed. Everything else is repeated pretty much right from the base game in a lot of ways except ship combat was completely removed. Considering that, it is disapointing Xcom 2 didn't do a bit more, but Firaxis as a developer is pretty well known for phoning in sequels these days. I don't mind that they didn't even attempt to improve on the interceptor game, but if it is going to be removed, players should see new content added. One could argue that the mobile base is that new content, but really it is the exact same base design mechanic as before with a different UI for interacting with the global map. That is about all it does.Also, the economy is actually pretty bad. Everything special in the game costs elerium cores, which is random drop only from enemies. In effect, you end up with tons of alloy and elerium, but nothing to do with it if you didn't save those elerium cores. It is nice that core upgrades, like switching to laser weapons (well, I think its called magnetic, but whatever) just upgrades all your guns and don't require individual construction.Difficulty wise, at least on normal/veteran, it felt a bit easier due to increased access to AoE, high damage ordinance. It really isn't that hard to get everyone sporting a rocket launcher in a reasonable amount of time and that is one of the weakest options available. A few other balance bits felt off as well, though the special weapons are satisfying to use.It could have been more, but it is what it is. If you want a fresh Xcom fix, go for it. If you can wait, then I would highly recommend waiting for a sale. As it stands, it is hard to justify this game as being worth full price.			"

												I'll happily change to an affirmative recommendation, just as soon as the devs finish their work and fix the game so it works properly.  My system meets the minimum requirements, and yet whenever I play the tutorial mission (in order to start the game with Jane Kelly and a fully customized squad) it crashes during the Avenger arrival cinematic.  Every time.  If a person who wants to play the tutorial can't get past it into the game-proper, then your game isn't working.  Then there was the fact that smoke grenades didn't do anything, until a modder finished the devs' job.  Or how the ""permanent control of turrets"" described in the haywire protocol ability had to be corrected by a modder.  Or how your soldiers don't always fire on the correct enemy unit that you very specifically selected.  Or any of the multitude of other flaws reported by others.When the game works, I enjoy it, I'll grant that.  Well, except for the perception that the RNG *massively cheats* in the aliens' favour.  But the problem is, the game DOES NOT consistently work, and in some ways, consistently doesn't work.  And that experience isn't what I paid for when I bought this.Oh, and post-patch, the game crashes every time I try to load my save game.  Or start a new game.  So, basically my game is ****ing crippled by the ""fix"" for all the bugginess.  GOOD ****IN' WORK, guys!			"

Supplies take large amounts of time to gather forcing you to keep abandoning them to deal with missions, this combined with how quickly extrememly powerful enemies are introduced is devastating.

												Don't get the review wrong. The game is not bad actually. From the visual, stability and game design point of view overall it deserves the name XCom. It's in a decent stable state already at release day, which one can't say from the majority of games. Yes, it has crashes, yes there are bugs, but it's certainly playable (and thanks to auto saves, even if it crashes you just restart the game and continue from where it crashed).Still, I have to rate the game with not recommended.... And all of that due to two of the major game design decisions which for me personally don't make this a recommended XCom game:1. round limits in the majority of the missions2. the overall time pressure of completing the whole gameI always liked the game design of the old XCom games as well as the different forks which evolved over the time for allowing me to play in the speed and manner I want to (be it rushing through missions or just being quite sneaky and careful). Unfortunately at its current state, XCOM 2 does not allow that.			"

												If I'm expected to produce 100% of the money for a game on the spot, with no negotiation, wiggling, haggling, or reduction under any circumstances whatsoever, than you, game company, are expected to give me 100% of the dang game. Now.Well, not necessarily 100. No launch will be totally perfect. But I definitely wish I'd heard about the absurd performance issues from, you know. Games media, reviews, people with pre-release copies. Unlike with other games, I figured a pre-order was a safe bet here, having watched like half a day of Beaglerush streaming it and thus knowing the gameplay will be awesome. But uh, performance.Every review, negative and positive, on the entire store-front mentions this issue. And since the game was pre-ordered, I'm pretty sure the refund window for people bitten on this has already expired. Funny how that works, huh? Honestly, I'm just a tiny bit relieved it really is a global issue with everyone on every platform, and not just my computer being too far behind the times yet.This review isn't about whether I love the new XCOM under Firaxis, because I do. This is 'should you buy this'. And if you weren't already big enough into it to put down the cash, then please don't buy this yet.

												TL;DR: Good, but buggy, not recommended for now - as good as the core game is, the bugs make it too frustratingMechanically, the game is fine - plays like the first one for the most part, with a few changes I would consider improvements, such as the ""Concealment"" system which - at least to some extent - makes overwatch crawling unnecesary for the first part of most missions. I, for one, like the ""dumbed down"" base building, seeing as in the first one, it didn't feel deep, it just felt needlessly complicated, but of course that's a matter of opinion.However, I've run into a lot of really annoying problems, mostly with the UI - not only does it seem poorly designed in a lot of cases, it also flat out breaks a lot. This includes stuff like not being able to click on buttons or icons for skills and mismatched tooltips.But I could deal with that stuff - it's just annoying, not really game ending.I will not recommend though, not until the number of bugs I (and apparently quite a few others) have run into. In my last session, all of a sudden, research and buildings stopped popping up when done. I didn't think much of it - the UI does a terrible job of conveying information at other times, so I figured I'd just misunderstood, and they simply weren't complete after all. But then I went to look, and construction timers and wound timers had gone into negative values - I had a facilty with a due time of ""-195 hours"", and soldiers with ""-4 days"" recovery, and I couldn't do anything with it, until all of a sudden I got spammed with alerts of completed stuff all over the place.In a game with fairly strict time and resource management, that's just not okay.Other than that, I frequently get ""blackouts"" during missions, where the screen turns grey with a red outline and only the HUD visible. The game still runs, and it will recover after a short while, but I just can't see what the enemy is doing, even though they're in my vision range.Then there's the framerate tanking, which I've seen quite a few people report here and there - it's simply atrocious. I'm running on a high end rig, I should not be seeing 15-20 frames.And whose brilliant idea was it to keep excessive screen shake in the game. One mission had a very strong shake throughout several of my turns. I kept my cursor completely still, but the shake of the screen meant that I was switching between 4 seperate tiles at random, making it really difficult to throw a grenade properly to hit 3 enemies.A lot of people are reporting crashes and shader errors, and the inability to quit the game without it crashing and mocking about - I get around this issue through the magic of Alt + F4.I want to keep playing, because the game is good. But the bugs are making it really annoying, and I will therefore in stead recommend picking it up at a later date.Edit: As a lot of people have pointed out, the game involves a lot of ""timed"" missions - many more than the first one. I'd be okay with that, if it didn't feel like there were just slightly too few turns to do stuff - if you step out in the wrong direction, you'll likely simply not have enough turns to get to the objective.I've rushed through missions, putting my soldiers in really dangerous positions and taking out targets as quickly as I could, but a lot of the time, they get reinforcements at the last second. So even when I rush, I usually get to the objective with 1 or 2 turns left, which is just barely enough for me to also ""activate"" the objective.The very highest I've had left (and I save-scummed on that one) was 4. The margin for error relative to the price of failure just seems off on many of the timed missions. But hey, maybe you're into that, in which case: Go nuts, you'll love it.			"

												I'll happily change to an affirmative recommendation, just as soon as the devs finish their work and fix the game so it works properly.  My system meets the minimum requirements, and yet whenever I play the tutorial mission (in order to start the game with Jane Kelly and a fully customized squad) it crashes during the Avenger arrival cinematic.  Every time.  If a person who wants to play the tutorial can't get past it into the game-proper, then your game isn't working.  Then there was the fact that smoke grenades didn't do anything, until a modder finished the devs' job.  Or how the ""permanent control of turrets"" described in the haywire protocol ability had to be corrected by a modder.  Or how your soldiers don't always fire on the correct enemy unit that you very specifically selected.  Or any of the multitude of other flaws reported by others.When the game works, I enjoy it, I'll grant that.  Well, except for the perception that the RNG *massively cheats* in the aliens' favour.  But the problem is, the game DOES NOT consistently work, and in some ways, consistently doesn't work.  And that experience isn't what I paid for when I bought this.Oh, and post-patch, the game crashes every time I try to load my save game.  Or start a new game.  So, basically my game is ****ing crippled by the ""fix"" for all the bugginess.  GOOD ****IN' WORK, guys!			"

Supplies take large amounts of time to gather forcing you to keep abandoning them to deal with missions, this combined with how quickly extrememly powerful enemies are introduced is devastating. Fundementally the game takes off the kid gloves to soon for all the new mechanics it is introducing.Also it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												If I'm expected to produce 100% of the money for a game on the spot, with no negotiation, wiggling, haggling, or reduction under any circumstances whatsoever, than you, game company, are expected to give me 100% of the dang game. Now.Well, not necessarily 100. No launch will be totally perfect. But I definitely wish I'd heard about the absurd performance issues from, you know. Games media, reviews, people with pre-release copies. Unlike with other games, I figured a pre-order was a safe bet here, having watched like half a day of Beaglerush streaming it and thus knowing the gameplay will be awesome. But uh, performance.Every review, negative and positive, on the entire store-front mentions this issue. And since the game was pre-ordered, I'm pretty sure the refund window for people bitten on this has already expired. Funny how that works, huh? Honestly, I'm just a tiny bit relieved it really is a global issue with everyone on every platform, and not just my computer being too far behind the times yet.This review isn't about whether I love the new XCOM under Firaxis, because I do.

												Don't get the review wrong. The game is not bad actually. From the visual, stability and game design point of view overall it deserves the name XCom. It's in a decent stable state already at release day, which one can't say from the majority of games. Yes, it has crashes, yes there are bugs, but it's certainly playable (and thanks to auto saves, even if it crashes you just restart the game and continue from where it crashed).Still, I have to rate the game with not recommended.... And all of that due to two of the major game design decisions which for me personally don't make this a recommended XCom game:1. round limits in the majority of the missions2. the overall time pressure of completing the whole gameI always liked the game design of the old XCom games as well as the different forks which evolved over the time for allowing me to play in the speed and manner I want to (be it rushing through missions or just being quite sneaky and careful). Unfortunately at its current state, XCOM 2 does not allow that.			"

												I am currently subscribed to 94 modsthink about that94 mods to make a game that should be good on release be fun to play, and even then, I have only managed to finish two campaignswhich is weird because this game is all about rushing short campaigns, it's all about time and turn limits on everything, but doing the same thing every time, with the same squad (thanks to the character pool) in the same 3 types of areas kinda gets old after a whileit takes mods to add diversity, which is the main thing I want in gamesyou know, when they release a sequel to a game, you expect it to have more, better content, right? this game should be Long War 2.0, instead it's Enemy Unknown 0.9and even so, probably due to the 94 mods, the game runs really bad and choppy, and I just bought a freaking 1080, dudethey released mod tools on release day, they expected people to make their okay-ish game good, and that's just bad and lazy company tactics dudethen there's the fact that XCOM 2 isn't about tactics, it's about luck, it's about setting up a play, and setting up a back-up in case that play failsremember the good old games like Silent Storm where everything was destructable in a good way, and every bullet, movement cost it's own AP out of 100-150 ish AP as your characters level up? when you had to use AP to go into your inventory and put an item in the usable slots? remember when there were more than 6 levels + a useless rookie level? when you got a whole skill tree to pick from, or stats to upgrade instead of just picked the good skill (if there is one) instead of the bad skill?well this thing throws all the stuff I love about tactics games out of the window, and simplifies everything... this is not a  real tactics gameso yeah, buy it on sale, get the top subscribed mods from the workshop, enjoy for a playthrough, a few months break, another playthrough, a few months break, half a playthrough, etc...the worst thing being unable to skip all the story scenes and dialogue, I don't care about seeing a scenic shot of the alien facility for the 15th time, just let me kill stuff alreadyon the plus side, snipers are no longer OP, they are fairly useless now, so it's nice not being able to just steamroll everything once you get squadsight			"

												Whilst the core game is extremely good, I'm not a massive fan of the direction they've taken the game in. Perhaps an unpopular opinion as clearly there is a huge segment of the player base who love the ""Long War"" mod and studio, I personally do not. I simply do not share their vision for the game or the way they prefer to play XCOM, and unfortunately XCOM 2 entirely caters for this audience.I've finished XCOM 1 several times and played the originals to death, but I've only gone through about 33% of this one and I find myself mostly frustrated or with the feeling that I'm missing something.And then I realise that I spend more time looking in the workshop how to fix things I don't agree with, than actually playing the game.So, whilst this is in essence quite a good core game, it has a ton of bugs with performance, line of sight and other issues and suffers horribly from the input and influence of the Long War team. As such, I would not recommend it - as XCOM 1 gives a more enjoyable experience.			"

												I wanted to love this game. I'm a huge X-Com fan. This misses the mark. The flying base the ""Avenger"" is just a frustrating waste of time, it bogs down the game. Some of the new enemies completely unbalance the game. Like the enemy that has the same ability as the Ranger class. Which is lazy and lame, the rangers ability should be unique to your squad. Your going up against a much larger force, they shouldnt have the same abilities as you, and this ability allows them to move across vast distances and melee you, and it rarely misses, so basically you'll always have a wounded soldier almost guranteed every mission once that enemy is introduced. Its buggy, choppy, and slow. Oh, and the amount of timed missions is completely awful. Once you get a few hours in the enemy troop difficulty ramps up VERY quickly. If your lucky you'll barely have magnetic guns at this point, and its not enough...Something is just off with this game, and leaves me just frutrated  with little willingness to play it anymore. Most likely going to try getting a refund.			"

												I am currently subscribed to 94 modsthink about that94 mods to make a game that should be good on release be fun to play, and even then, I have only managed to finish two campaignswhich is weird because this game is all about rushing short campaigns, it's all about time and turn limits on everything, but doing the same thing every time, with the same squad (thanks to the character pool) in the same 3 types of areas kinda gets old after a whileit takes mods to add diversity, which is the main thing I want in gamesyou know, when they release a sequel to a game, you expect it to have more, better content, right? this game should be Long War 2.0, instead it's Enemy Unknown 0.9and even so, probably due to the 94 mods, the game runs really bad and choppy, and I just bought a freaking 1080, dudethey released mod tools on release day, they expected people to make their okay-ish game good, and that's just bad and lazy company tactics dudethen there's the fact that XCOM 2 isn't about tactics, it's about luck, it's about setting up a play, and setting up a back-up in case that play failsremember the good old games like Silent Storm where everything was destructable in a good way, and every bullet, movement cost it's own AP out of 100-150 ish AP as your characters level up? when you had to use AP to go into your inventory and put an item in the usable slots? remember when there were more than 6 levels + a useless rookie level? when you got a whole skill tree to pick from, or stats to upgrade instead of just picked the good skill (if there is one) instead of the bad skill?well this thing throws all the stuff I love about tactics games out of the window, and simplifies everything... this is not a  real tactics gameso yeah, buy it on sale, get the top subscribed mods from the workshop, enjoy for a playthrough, a few months break, another playthrough, a few months break, half a playthrough, etc...the worst thing being unable to skip all the story scenes and dialogue, I don't care about seeing a scenic shot of the alien facility for the 15th time, just let me kill stuff alreadyon the plus side, snipers are no longer OP, they are fairly useless now, so it's nice not being able to just steamroll everything once you get squadsight			"

												You did it again, Firaxis.This kind of performance is unacceptable, considering that the initial release date were postponed for over six months.There is really no excuse for PC exclusive title that runs on Unreal Engine 3 not to have over 100 FPS on i7/R9 390 in 2016, really.I'm looking forward to rebuy the game some time later, when the performance bugs are fixed.Edit: The game itself runs around 50-80fps 1080p on my setup (sometimes dips below 50 [40-30fps] when scrolling around the map!) with all max but AA and vsync off, and locked to 30fps during cinematics.

												Much more hard then the first.  But a blast to build each soldier and customise them.  The missions are a challenge, but once you get the hang of moving in shadows and understanding that shooting right off is often the wrong way to do things, it becomes so much more rewarding.  This game is a must have for those who are a fan of the XCOM games.			"

												As an XCOM fan I think this is an ""OK"" sequel but frankly going from XCOM Enemy Within + Long War to this just didn't cut it for me. If Steam would have a rating system I'd give it a 6.5 ""Meh"". Wait until this is on sale.My beef with it is as follows:- Main story just doesn't grab you; The guerilla vibe quickly fades once you learn the ins/outs of the new globe game and the story is quite generic and riddled with plot holes that leave a dissapointing taste upon completion.- Visually the game is a resouce hog (I.E. it looks nice) but brings nothing new to the table in respect of map interaction and squad mechanics. Yeah sure there are new units/perks but under the hood its pretty much the same game as the original. Nothing revolutionary.- No reply value for me. Beat it once on high difficulty and you've pretty much experienced everything XCOM 2 has to offer.			"

												I'm not going to get into details about the pros and cons, as other reviews have already done that to death. Instead I'll just throw in some ""buyer beware"" points if you're considering buying XCOM 2.So, it's definitely a lot better than the original, it has fixed a lot of the issues I had with Enemy Unknown. Things like the BS ""choose one out of three possible areas to defend, and the other two will get a Panic Penalty and there's nothing you can do about it because reasons"". But, it still has a lot of the same really frustrating issues. Things like the difficulty setting not really making enemies smarter or more numerous, but instead just tweaks the likelihood of you hitting enemies (down to ridiculously low chances) and the likelihood of your troopers getting hit (up to astronomically unfair chances). Enemies can still see and shoot through multiple walls to get ridiculous hits on you where they should not, and there are also a ton of other bugs and frustrating elements.There's also the newly added frustrating feature of countdowns in almost every mission. You need to get to point X before some random timer ticks down, or else you fail for no apparent reason at all. And the amount of turns you have to get to that point is often so low, that you're forced to throw any tactical thinking out the window, and just run for the objective before the time runs out - and hope to anything holy that you hit on every shot and the enemy suddenly somehow fall into a streak of bad luck.The game is also rather poorly optimized at the time of this writing. It runs fine if you turn off Anti-Aliasing, but once you try to tweak that up even a little (f@$k jaggies), then your framerate will tank even when you're just browsing your home base. A patch will hopefully fix this in time, but it is worth noting now. If you're allergic to aliasing/jaggies, then you'll get cancer from this game in its current stateUltimately, the game is enjoyable if you intend to play it on low difficulty just for the sake of the story and the progression of your troops (and the new character customization system is pretty robust if you look away from facial customization). If you liked the original and were completely blind (or for whatever reason chose to forgive) the glaring issues it had, you'll find a lot to love here. If you want tactical freedom in a supposedly ""tactical"" game, or if you absolutely hated XCOM: EU, then this will not be your cup of tea.So do I recommend it? I personally liked it just enough for it to barely tip over to a Thumbs Up rating. It's dumb fun, and with the already implemented mod support through Steam Workshop, modders can do a lot of the job that Firaxis were too lazy to do anything about (like the stupid camera rotation - come on, Firaxis). Just don't expect it to be a tactical masterpiece or a worthy successor to the old X-Com from '94. If a modern X-Com: UFO Defense is what you're looking for, I recommend looking at Xenonauts instead. Though don't expect smooth animations or amazing graphics.			"

												This was... disappointing.Whomever decided this was the way to go has (obiviously) never studied asymmetrical warfare.<rant>In AW you pick targets carefully, and let them go if they get away.  The timers are, in a majority of cases, stupid.These are guerrila resistance fighters: mobility and lack of a foot print are key points to their survival.  You don't have homebases on the surface.  You don't have established colonies.  You're nomadic.  Anything stationary is trapped to offset the cost of discovery with enemy casualties.  Just damn Firaxis, get it right, you're supposed to.</rant>On the more specific end of the spectrum, the arbitrary timelimit is stupid.  X-COM is a AW IP, where planning and limited gambling make sweet victory babies.  As it stands now, it's garbage.New map is cool, even if I don't know what half of it means/does.			"

												To be honest, it's not a bad game.  It's just not worth $60 and has issues that pervade the entire experience.-Feels rushed.  Still has the same issues as the previous incarnation and has balance and technical issues (slow downs).-Has moved further away from X-COM and more into the XCOM rendition.  It seems to have forgotten what made the old games great and is more of a linear story than the simulation that they used to be.-Everything feels ""gamey"" and artificial.  Over-simplified mechanics and lack of depth might work for a boardgame, but the PC should be a platform for greater complexity.  As it is, it is a pathetic shadow of games that came out over 20 years ago.-Lacks variety.  Tactics devolve into a set of stock manuevers that you will use ad-nauseum with little need to change.-The Geoscape is more reactive than proactive and you still have the ""you can only choose ONE mission and have to fail the others"" bullcrap.  Again, it feels arbitrary and dumb.  Why can't I have 2 skyrangers?  Why can't I have multiple squads en-route?-They've also removed interception as a mechanic, opting to have a mobile base.  Base building has also become more stream-lined, with no real choices for the player to make.  You NEED too many facilities and you're stuck in another ""satellite"" buying scenario in which you're wasting time, money, and space to build the pay-wall style crap so you can move on.I could go on, but the bottom line is:  buy Xenonauts, X-Com: Ufo Defense/Terror From the Deep, or even UFO: Aftershock if you're looking for a GOOD alien killing sim.  This is the dumbed-down beer and pretzels crap that they shovel out these days.			"

												After being a fan of the original trilogy, let me rephrase that as a huge fan of the originals - the reboots have angered me greatly as they have not done any justice in my personal opinion, if anything - have been a travesty to the Xcom franchise and Xcom 2 is arguably the worst because not only do you have the same cheating AI with miraculous almost impossible shots to spawning extra alien squads at the worst possible times making some missions all but impossible...and then, to add further insult...A large chunk of missions are timed with very tight limits making a front frontal assault the only viable option to meet the limit and that method almost always puts your prized troops at risk.    One of the main things what made the originals great was the fact that each mission the aliens was placed in random positions, and none of it was carefully scripted like the reboots - those scripts are one of the problems because first time around, you're going to fail and lose...multiple times doing it you've figured it out and even the harder difficulty settings are not that hard.Right from the start, you're against nearly impossible odds-   Even sectoids have been given massive psionic buffs and can mindcontrol your troops fairly easily right from the very first missions making mindshields all but a nessessity and this trend continues,  each fight you're spending more resources than your making back so its a constant struggle and after a while it starts to get frustrating. I try hard to like the reboots, but at the moment - they are lacking something that made the originals great.			"

Posted: June 14, 2016
												So I've waited for the DLC to come out to see if Firaxis would release an update to fix this game. After realizing that almost nothing is fixed, I've just about had it with waiting for this game to be good. Instead of having a list of every single problem with the game, (for example, how health is displayed, the imbalanced difficulty, how detection tiles are incosistant, enemies are just given buffs later in the game instead of new enemies being designed, etc.)  I'll just list and explain the 4 fatal flaws with this game:1. PERFORMANCE: If you look at other revieews, other people are having a hard time getting this game to run well. For me its not too bad now, as I noticed that general stability is improved to a good range of 20-40 frames. But that's far from optimal. It's also far from the only thing wrong with the game.2. CHEATING AI/BAD AI: You can test this out on the first mission with the statue if there is one enemy left and you have a soldier (with no other soldiers nearby to possibly flank the enemy) near a statue. If both of you are in the high cover of the statue, and you move out of sight into the low cover base of the statue, the ai will abandon high cover and go into the low cover base to flank you, even though he couldn't see where you moved before. This makes fighting the AI holy unsatisfying. In addition, the AI in general is easy to predict (when it's not glitching out). Psionic enemies in particular always use their special abilties first before shooting, even if they go out of their way to flank you. Enemy soldiers have no sense of preservation, so overwatching in front of them will never keep them in place.3. BAD PACING: The biggest problem to the actual gameplay (in both combat and base management) is that the game always forces you in a rush. Got to capture a VIP? Hurry up and get him in 12 turns even though the enemy doesn't even know that you're there yet. Capture this cargo in 8 turns otherwise it blows up for no reason. Did you actually win a combat mission? Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ the doomtracker's clicking down. It's always rush, rush, rush. There's never a time that the game (and by extension the player) can have a breather to calm down and get his bearings. In the prior game, base management was the way the game calmed down. You didn't have to worry about moving your base constantly that takes 4+ hours to land and take off in each area.4. LINE OF SIGHT BUGS: The thing that kills this game is the constant line of sight bugs. Literally anytime urban warfare is involved, you can expect to have shootouts through solid walls and ceilings with no visibility. Sometimes cover just doesn't work and you'll get flanked by an enemy who is clearly right infront of your cover. You might move a soldier behind a wall so an enemy won't have a shot on him, only to realize that the enemy can still see him and he will get shot like he wasn't in cover at all. The worst that has happened to me is when I was rescuing a VIP from a truck, and when I came into visual range, the walls of the truck didn't work so I saw the VIP. When the VIP was revealed, the enemies saw the VIP, and since the VIP isn't in concealment, then everyone of my soldiers lost concealment, no less after i made all of my moves. The game is frustratingly unfinished.There are positive additions to the game, which is what kept me for playing this long. But the more I played it in general, the more I was frustrated at its bad design and terrible stability. This game is unsalvageable.			"

												I got this game in March of 2016 and it is still unplayable - multiple posts state they have been unable to even get past the first mission due to a game breaking glitches.  Very little character customization and very little difference from the previous xcom, which I would rate as far superior in feel and performance to this game (even though I can only base my experience on a couple of missions and a modded version that skips the game breaking tutorial crash bug).  I'd wait a good long time to buy this and keep an eye on the discussion boards for if/when firaxis patches this game and makes it playable.  Modders may be able to fix this down the road as well but it is not worth the money right now.			"

XCOM2 ended up being my first return.I imagine I will return to this title in the future, because this game should be right up my alley. That will have to be at a time when the current issues have been addressed, because as far as I'm concerned this is not a finished game in this state.			"

												In its current state the game is unplayable for me. Yes yes, I KNOW there are 'fixes' for it. Trust me when I say that I have tried them all. Nothing works. Although I do get a FPS booast from some of the tweeks, but that's just turning off most of the graphical effects. Currently, the game locks up when a mission loads. That moment when your team is about to jump out of the ship onto the ground. Just locks up. The back ground music plays but nothing happens. Tried everything. I am sure that they will fix it at some point, but I've given up. It's been a full month since the game released.It's not like I am playing it on a potato. I have a AMD 9590, 16GB of DDR3, 290x, and running off a SSD. Sure it could be better, but it's hardly anything to scoff at. My point is, the game should not have been released like this. I have got maybe 2-4 hours of game play on this. I tried to get my money back but I keep getting denied because I have logged 13 hours. Most of that was just trying to get the game to run correctly or at all.All that aside, this game could be great when it's patched up. But as it stands, it's not worth the $75 I paid.

												Honestly, this is the first Xcom game I've ever played and I must say im dissapointed. First of all, the bs %TO HIT system is dumb. Ask yourself, in what possible game, do % to hit fit in? Not in this game, not in any other. Because in real life or just a normal shooter, there is alot more factors involved other than a random item you found on the ground's bonus stats which can be attached. Your character can literally miss a guy standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM SOMEHOW. Theres also ALOT of waiting in this game. For some reason, the develepors of the game decided that you have to watch as they walk into their death duo to dumb % hit system. The camera's locked on the character that you told to move ALL the way, and they are slow as hell. Honestly, if I did not have to watch ALL my characters move to position SEPERATLY I would not have 11 hours on this game, it feels like you're spending hours on watching them move. DO NOT buy this game or anything like it. Hell it was just scratching the surface of fun starting my first campaign, but this game got boring so fast for me.			"

												Honestly, it's not worth full retail price. It's a good game but it's still hit and miss. The AI's still stupid, the control scheme is ill thought out and the gameplay is still clunky and not fun. I had the same issue with the last game and it really does nothing to fix it. It's good to start out with, then you realise it's just a mess. However I will probably buy it again once it goes on sale. 6/10			"

												XCOM 2 is basicly XCOM: Enemy Unknown...... with a lot of bugs... with terrible balancing... with horrible pacing... with lots of performance issues... with worse environmental design... with immersion breaking glitches... with an AI that loves to take it's time to ""think""... with an unnecessary turn limitXCOM 2 lacks the design, care and love that was put into ""Enemy Unknown"" that made it one of my favorite games of all time.It's not a bad game, but it's not what you'd expect from a sequel to the groundbreaking ""Enemy Unknown""I'd say wait for a ""Game of the year""-Edition or some major patches.

												In its current state the game is unplayable for me. Yes yes, I KNOW there are 'fixes' for it. Trust me when I say that I have tried them all. Nothing works. Although I do get a FPS booast from some of the tweeks, but that's just turning off most of the graphical effects. Currently, the game locks up when a mission loads. That moment when your team is about to jump out of the ship onto the ground. Just locks up. The back ground music plays but nothing happens. Tried everything. I am sure that they will fix it at some point, but I've given up. It's been a full month since the game released.It's not like I am playing it on a potato. I have a AMD 9590, 16GB of DDR3, 290x, and running off a SSD. Sure it could be better, but it's hardly anything to scoff at. My point is, the game should not have been released like this. I have got maybe 2-4 hours of game play on this. I tried to get my money back but I keep getting denied because I have logged 13 hours. Most of that was just trying to get the game to run correctly or at all.All that aside, this game could be great when it's patched up. But as it stands, it's not worth the $75 I paid. Not by a long shot.			"

												This game is plauged by bugs and performance issues. This game is broken. It often doesnt play by its own rules. Sometimes I have soldiers flanked when there is no enemy to flank them. Sometimes a gernade forgets to take away an enemys armor. Line of sight and fog of war are a nightmare. some buildings seem to make it worse then others. I was a HUGE fan of XCOM enemy unknown but I regret buying Xcom2 on launch. Xcom in known to be difficult but I feel like the hardest part of the game is doing battle with the faulty game mechanincs. FIraxis says they are working on it and I have faith in them that eventually fix the issues. If you are thinking about buying this game simply dont. Wait until Firaxis works out the kinks.If you really want to play Xcom just play Enemy Unknown.			"

												Well..... I'm just not even sure what to say.  I loved XCOM Enemy Unknow, but this is rediculous.An enemy in the open and flanked with a 90% chance to hit? MISS!My squad in cover being fired at from across the map? CRITICAL HIT!It got to the point where it was laugh out loud aweful. I should have waited for it to go on sale, but I was so excited to play it that I just went ahead and bought it. Horrible decision.Graphics: not really better.  To me they feel like something I would expect in an indy game. Glitchy and it didn't look, to me, like an improvement on EU.Game Play: Not bad. The move counter gets annoying when you have to rush across the map to do something, but it wasn't so bad that I disliked it. It's turn based squad combat and I like that. I did like the new stealth aspect, but it kind of seems useless when the enemy gets to make a bunch of additional moves(see below).AI: I really feel like the Advent soldier's either had an unfare advantage, or my squad was just the unlukiest group of soldiers ever.  First off, when you trigger the enemie's awareness of you, they get a free move for some reason.  So the ambush you spent many turns setting up gets ruined. Second, their aim is impeccable from any position. And finally, they come at you in such large groups, even in the beginning of the game, that the fact that it takes 4-5 of your squads shooting at 1 enemy to kill them makes it infuriating.I think I'm done with the game for now.  I will take a look at it in a month or 2 after some updates have come out to see if it has gotten better.  3/10 would definitely not pay $60 for it again. "

												See I had high hopes for XCOM2. The first game of this re-imagining was fun, hard but challenging. Managing weapons, fighting aliens, hard bosses but plenty of ways to get around all the challenges. XCOM2 though...well were to start. No difficulty curve. It starts hard and does not ease you in. Hell the tutorial completely cripples you if you try to play the game with it. Now I know what you're saying. ""Oh but this is xcom toughen up."" NO ♥♥♥♥ you. Orginal excom hard was managing money and council nervousness and soldier skills not, throw what used to be an end boss mechanic in your second level. The lead dev even addmitted this. They made it harder at basically the last week before launch. (Because as we all know nothing says a well thought out game then a lass minute decision that completely underminds the entire programming of it.)Another thing their head developer admitted was that all of their testers hated the timer mechanic. Remeber in this imagining of it? That rare timed mission? Thats now 50% of your missions. Oh each tester said. ""Stealth to timing mechanic (which mind you makes sense) was not fun. So what did they do? Got rid of the point of stealth and just started the timer quicker for each mission! Bravo dev team for NOT GETTING the point. Head dev's responce was literally. ""Well I don't want to say, thats what the modding community is for, but that can be used to change your game."" Because if you ship a broken game, its best to let your fans fix it. Good plan. A round of applause. Now about that no difficulty arc. Balls out hard can be fun. Oh I love a challenging game but this is just hard to be hard. Dont belive me? Remeber how in the first XCOM game there were two units that could scurry all over the map and pretty much instant kill you? Thats now most of the units. Psi powered badguys that can mind controll you? Available second level. Snake men that miss tonging you close from half a map away and then still be able to shoot poision at you? Check. Mind you this was on normal mode. Not the highest difficulty.Worse there is more stripping down of base mechanics. ow instead of an armory where you need to have more than one weapon or armor, you just research it once and BOOM suddenly everyone has it. As a rare plus, you can now place mechanics about to speed up projects and construction. There is no council to appease, so your mission decisions barely affect you. No worries about losing support now you stop ""bad events"" which really do not hinder you. If they do? I have not noticed. Blah blah blah. I know too many words. Here it is in short. Don't buy till on sale if you really want it. Ive had to break my save scrub code on this game and that pisses me off with all the promise it had. I see little replayablity and Ive honestly put it down and walked away from it for long periods of time twice now something a new game should never do.			"

For now, I'm thinking this is going to be uninstalled... wish I hadn't spent $80 on this♥♥♥♥♥♥I also want to mention the amount of androgyny in the game. It's too much. Most of my female recruits come in with boy hair cuts, male recruits with pony tails, all the ""female"" advent troopers. It's just too much and comes off to me a social engineering. How many thousands and thousands and thousands of years has humanity been around? And how many years are we now encouraging women to try to become men, and vice verse. Not natural, not wanted.

Although the gameplay itself and the wide variety of options avaialble make the game engaging, the game's instability makes its excruciatingly frustrating. The game crashes constantly despite the fact that my rig meets the recommeded specifications and despite the numerous amount of patches issued by the developer. It is really unfortunate that such an inherently good game is plagued with such issues.			"

												Now that the patches are out this game became a lot better. The infamous stuttering of the loading videos and the Avenger management screen has not plagued my machine that much, but it was looking a tad ridiculous. (I repeat, it appears to be fixed.)Disclaimer: I am a savescummer. There is no way in this Universe that I will ever try it on Ironman.XCOM, our beloved super secret organisation is back with a vengeance, this time as a terro... a resistance movement who engage in kidnapping, property damage (extensively so), murder, mayhem, research and development. It's faithful to the classic three-layer design (global strategy and expansion; base management, R&D, recruitment and training; actually shooting aliens in the face on a turn based tactical screen (where face is applicable)). It continues what XCOM:Enemy Unknown started and improved it.The good: - it's everything I love about XCOM- a lot more diverse set of terrains in the tactical layer- creatively redesigned classes (they are still good but different enough to think a bit- cool new weapons- finally you do not have to take the damn things alive- finally, faces- soldier customisation options through the roof- loot system- time limits that add a sense of urgency to the gameplay- concealment for all your ambushing needsThe mediocre:- acceptable storyline that somehow manages to wriggle out of the confines of XCOM:EU's ending- solid characters- decent ending- some soldier development options were useless for me (think twice before choosing extra armor for the Grenadier instead of armour shredding capability)- plenty of bottlenecks in the game, got to think three steps ahead (I like it but it can be frustrating at first)The bad:- ridiculous misses in the tactical gameplay (five missed shots in Overwatch, hell yeah!)- line and splash effect placements are wonky (double-check the affected area before launching a grenade)- the Hellish Stutter may still be present on some rigs, I dunno- solid surfaces can be seen through at times, ending in megatriggers (you will see what I mean).

												Overall, I love this game. I like that the mechanics didn't change much from the last one (it wasn't broke, they didn't try to fix it). I like the concept of us eing guerilla fighters with less resources. I like that they dropped the pretense of the crappy fighter minigame. I like the new aliens. I like the mission types, the maps, the character generation... so much of this game is right. But I would NOT be giving this game a perfect grade.First, lets talk bugs. Firaxis, I love you guys, but STOP releasing your games in buggy messes like this. My first playthrough failed because scanning for resources froze on two days left, while the Avatar Project kept ticking. My soldiers STILL get killed by aliens that shouldn't have line of sight. The Viper's constrict animation makes my soldiers and the Viper appear at random locations on the map (even though I can still shoot the Viper normally). Stahp eeet!Next, my biggest problem: Pacing. It's FAR too hectic. I'm certain some of the problems I'm having with being overwhelmed has to do with my unfamiliarity (shut up I make my own words) with the tactics of the new overmap; but I know that's not all. There's not enough supplies to keep upgrading, getting new troops (when you can't find them, which happens a lot), and building add-ons to the base. This makes me leap at every supply event I see, except I get interrupted several times during those scans by missions I really can't ignore. Not to mention the Avatar Project, which lights a huge fire under your♥♥♥♥♥ I would like that aspect, but on top of all the other craziness just makes gameplay on the overmap stressful. I don't want to feel stressed out by the game I'm playing, it sours almost everything else.I'm sure there's more I haven't found yet, but those two aspects of the current game need to be addressed I feel, and not with mods! Mods are great, but they shouldn't be used to cover up bugs or basic pacing problems in a game. It's still early yet, Firaxis, you have time to fix this.			"

												I was pretty exctied about this game and finally wanted to give it a go.   Unfortunately I couldn't tolerate the long, long, long, loooooong pauses between character actions and the painful process of waiting for your team's turn.  It took me 3 hours to progress through and beat the second mission.   Most of this time was the camera watching random alien soldier #64 run, jump over a low wall, and stand in place with a pause before watching random alien soldier #65 do the same thing.   Once you watch this 16 times per turn (2nd mission has you go against around 16 enemies at once)  you look down at your watch and realize that your life is ticking away as you are forced to wait 3-4 minutes between each of your turns.    Maybe you had to get this one at launch to really enjoy it?  I need a bigger return on my ""fun"" investment for my games these days.			"

												Xcom 2 is an incredibly addicting game and I've had just as much fun with it like I did with Unknown. That being said, two grips I have with it are some performance issues and the idea that not everyone will like the fact that the game is a little bit more streamlined. The game suffers from frame drops but an easy fix for this was to switch from MSAA to FXAA. Since then, I've had little to no issues. As for the streamlining, it's not so much of a problem with me persay but I know that series vets will have a bigger issue as base management is not nearly as big as it was with Enemy Unknown. Also, if you have played Unknown or Within, make sure to switch the difficulty to at least veteran (at times, if this mode felt a bit easy). Don't get me wrong, the game is still dificult but the first two difficulty options can at times make the game feel like a cake walk.With that said, I think this is one of the best ways to open the new year with because their are so many aspects I enjoy about Xcom 2. The direction of it's story, little changes with the classes, the unique enemy types, bigger focus on surprising foes through ambushes and so on. It's the reason why I keep coming back to it and it's already proving to be one of my favorite games this year.			"

												I like this game, believe me. But in the current state the game is in, i dont think its worth buying.Pros1. Incredibly challenging, as the game forces you to make decisions you may or may not like, which gives you a feeling that i cant describe to you2. Gameplay is solid, using turn based strategy and combat.3. Unique enemies to fight again, no longer copy and paste swarms of zerg, or crafty eldar4. An immersive story, which makes you feel like your actually playing and fighting for a cause5. Tons of customization options, make your soldiers look like friends and family6. The game is very moddable, and still lets you get achievements with modsCons1. The game runs like crap, even with people who have monsters of a computer. The game is very poorly optimized. Live through minimal graphics with twenty to thirty FPS to single frames per second with high graphic options2. The AI can sometimes be really unfair, or at other times a complete idiot, walking right into your overwatches3. The game has too much RNG, watch as a single ADVENT runt dodges almost every shot, and crits your soldier, gravely wounding them4. The game will sometimes stop after encountering a certain thing, and after a short pause it will tell you something you will mostly ignore5. Bugs and glitches galore6. It would be nice to have a 'Versus Mode' where one person plays as the ADVENT Coalation, and one as XCOM. XCOM would research new technologies, while ADVENT would be able to have aliens in their strike force.In Conclusion, i like the game, but i strongly suggest that you buy the game later in the year, when it will be more optimized, the bugs ironed out, and possibly rebalances in multiplayer.

												Bug-riddled♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with no coherent design vision. Long War 2 improves it, but you can't build anything truly great on a rotten foundation. All DLC packs except for Shen's Last Gift are a joke, filled either with gimmicky customizations that are visually ridiculous enough to feel out of place in a Mel Brooks movie, or crucial features or items that should have been included in the base game (icarus armor - this was in the original XCOM, but here you are extortioned into buying the total sociopathically xenophobic piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Alien Hunters DLC for it).And Pure Virtual Function crashes. Incessantly. Once you have installed a number of mods for this ""mod friendly"" game you will start to get CTDs so often that the game eventually becomes completely unplayable. Firaxis have had a year to track down and fix this, but instead they blame it on modders. As if any game of acceptable quality would allow mods to break it hard enouch to cause CTDs.If you're an X-Com fan and haven't played this yet, you are better off skipping it and looking elsewhere for you UFO Defense fix.

												Truly an amazing sequel for a brilliant reboot of XCOM. The gameplay is about what you'd expect from a turn-based game but of course with significant additions compared to Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. Although I do miss my squad of superhumans and MECs, the new revamped classes are worthy replacements. The combination of rangers, specialists, grenadiers, sharpshooters and Psi operatives make one hell of a squad. Guerrilla Ops is a nice change of pace in which you enter a mission concealed thus allowing you to set up an Overwatch ambush. Fantastic addition to say the least. Gone are the days in which you can send out your Firestorms to shoot at alien crafts, and that is something I do miss at times. I won't spoil anything about the story here, but one thing I can say is that it gave me chills from start to finish and all of it in a good way. After such a long wait, it is good to be back as the Commander.ps. Optimisation issues are still troublesome as the framerate dips almost constantly from time-to-time, not to mention the loading times can take a considerable amount of time. It can be painful to watch the cutscenes stutter at times but Firaxis is working on it from what I heard. Hopefully they release a patch real soon. Didn't stop me from completing it though.			"

												Another overhyped rip-off from a AAA company that uses the tech and IP from a decent reboot of a beloved franchise to make a lazy, uninspired and clearly untested $80 cash grab sequel. And all the media minions are so quick to proclaim this garbage GOTY because that's how the biz works.Anyone giving this game a good review is suffering from the reality distortion field of cognitive bias and wishful thinking. I get it, you paid $80 and anticipated XCOM 2 for months. You so deeply want this to be a good game. It's not. It's trash. Clearly none of the developers actually tried to play it.I am done buying AAA games. Any remaining faith in the game industry is lost. I hope the industry burns to the ground and something worth my time and money grows out of the ashes.			"

												I am giving this game a no, though it has huge potential it has been horrible squandered. It might be salvagable with heavy modding or masive alterations. i would have prefered to give it a average revew but that is not possible hereTHE BAD1.the only improvement they have made to the tactics is the timer (on arround 80% of the missions) that forces you to throw away tactics and simply run full pelt toowards the objective most of the time.2. enemys can shoot you and often do through solid walls and can see you no matter what the lines of sight are.3. Apart from the odd ocation the enemy runs away they are all predictably dumb following the same procedures no matter what the situation (most often heading to cover and shooting even if falling back would be better)4. The only time you can get a suprise round is at the beginning, and once that is done with as soon as you see an enemy they see you regardless of distance or positioning.5. These points mean that the combat is simply a re hash of x-com enemy unknown, with new units and equipment, and if you do not get the right resources on the world map you are totaly ruined. (no enginers when you need them ever)6. The huge amount of glitches, press the overwhatch button and fire at the enemy, press fire and reload. thankfully these dont happen that often. but the frame rate drops are horrible as well as the eternaly long load screens (The huge amount of time you spend watching your squad in the transport waiting to deploy is rediculous).7. Poor late game Story, The early story is good and brings you into the game well (play the tutorial mission) but the end game story tells you nothing, and explains even less. It is a blatent set up for anouther game or an expantion and ruins what little stroy there is.THE GOOD1. Widely customisable characters with changable languages voices and aperance as well as attitude means you care if they die (sometimes)2. When they are running well good graphics and battlefield sound (listening to wanted posters and good ambient aperance of missions)3. Potential masive potentioal, with steam workshop support from the off there is potential for the  combat issues t be fixed by comunity mods, and maybe if there is enough work make this the A Star game it could have been but only with a lot of wotk.In conclution, this game is alright not worth the full asking price by a long shot, and not as fun as X-com enemy within/unknown, or as tactical as the long war mod for said game. the only redeaming feature is that it could be made into a good game but that is really it.

												XCOM2 is a solid turn-based strategy game, and I really wish I could give it a full recommendation. However, as it currently stands there are a number of glaring issues with the game that need to be addressed before I can do so.1.) The game is a poorly optimized buggy mess. Frame rates are wildly inconsistent, and character animations are hilariously buggy (falling through the ground, breaking already-shattered windows, guns firing while on the back of the soldier, teleporting to another part of the map while being strangled by a viper ect...). The kill-cam is arguably even more buggy now than in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, especially when using abilities that initiate multiple attacks at once.2.) The UI is genuinely awful. Fraxis chose a concise and ""stylish"" look for all the important information in the game at the cost of the players. Damage estimates always show the highest possible outcome causing players to make poor attacks, what constitutes as flanking is completely unclear and not apparent before making a move, soldier skills are not viewable in the deployment menu,  the difference between ""one-time"" projects and ""for all soldiers forever"" projects in the workshop are not made clear, and information regarding the aliens outside of their health on the battlefield is never viewable by the player (what does ""battle frenzy"" even do?). No wonder many of the most popular mods are simply UI fixes.3.) Gameplay is enjoyable, but suffers from some minor issues.For the most part, the gameplay is enjoyable. If you liked the previous XCOM's gameplay, you will like XCOM2's gameplay. However, it carries with it the same problems of its predecessor. Firing angles are still bizarre and unclear; sometimes you can shoot through walls, other times your soldier cannot fire at an enemy clearly within range/view. Difficulty remains wildly inconsistent, with the early game being challenging, the mid-game unbearablely hard, and the end game being a bit too easy.The most controversial new gameplay decision is the addition of various turn timers to most of the missions. Whether you would like this or not really depends on how you play the game. If you like slow and methodical gameplay, you will probably hate it. Thankfully, not all missions are timed, so you still have some diversity in playstyle.In conclusion: unless you are a huge XCOM: Enemy Unknown fan, wait for a sale before buying this game. Right now it is an unpolished product that needs a lot of time and work before being worth full price.			"

I'd go back to playing X-Com: Enemy Unknown if only it would Play on Windows 10!And it takes too long to load a mission, or return to base from a mission...  Is it downloading the files each time?Since you only give a Yes/ No for recommendation instead of a maybe... I'll have to go with NO.			"

												units shooting thru walls, missing a shot when you are standing right next to his face makes it quite pointless to strategize around since often you lose the battle from shots or stuff that come out of nowhere.the story is very slow pased and although reviews say the replay value is high, i dont see it as such. 17 of being anoyed out of my head just because game behaves so random and unreal. the only important thing is not to ""wake"" to many enemies at once which lends the game to a repeat the mission till you know where all the oponents are, then repeat in next mission and so on.If you are looking for a decent challenge from finely crafted levels, this is not it.  like rolling dices? like moving tactically to get seen/shot thru walls? like to move right next to your opponent to blow his brains out only to miss just so he can shoot you dead next turn and you restart the turn? If you answer yes to this three questions theres something wrong with you, cause this is boring. "

												Give me all the downvotes I really don't care. I can't stand this game anymore. Changing my positive review to a negative one becuase it is still broken. If you don't mind dealing with constant bs bugs then buy it. The game is sooo good, but also so broken. The worst bug that I experience  literally everytime I try to play  is never ending turns where the enemy AI won't make a move and just sits there, and the crashing sucks as well. Reloading and doing different actions doesn't always fix it either. Can't beat Ironman becuase it bugs out in some stupid way and I don't feel I should have to compensate for the game being poorly designed by redoing what I've already done and hoping it replicates the good RNG I had. I loved this game so much but it's so frustrating having to deal with all the BS in it. I'm completely giving up on it, uninstalling as I write this. So sad.. The game would be like a 10 if it wasn't always crashing and bugging out on me. Maybe you'll get lucky and not experience these issues as commonly as I do.			"

												These were the longest, most intense 68h I've had. Starting on the day the game became available, I fought frustration, fear, anger and fatigue as my scientists studied new alien technology and deciphered important intel; my engineers built facilities to support the war effort; my contacts dabbled with the black market in a desperate search for needed supplies; and my soldiers fell on the battlefield, not knowing if their sacrifice would make a difference in this struggle, but certain no life under shackles was worth living.Yes, after that insane game marathon I have finally beaten the game. A moment of rejoice as my 4-day Carnaval break is endind and I have to go to work 4h from now. But I couldn't stop before it was all over. It is time to savour my well-deserved glory with my wife and the real world. That is, until the next campaign starts and I pause life for another 68h or so.10/10.			"

												This game is freaking terrible!  If you were a fan of the last reboot, and are wondering about whether or not to get this game, read this review!You start most missions in concealed mode, which allows you to creep around the maps and set up an ambush. In this mode, Overwatch no longer has an aim penalty, so you could set all of your soldiers but one on Overwatch, and have the last one attack, or run out in the open to trigger a 'pod'. (Group of enemies that are just stood there) Once triggered, they will most likely run for cover, and your soldiers will shoot them.  Concealed mode is an interesting addition, but during the timed missions, where you are given 8 turns to complete the objective, or you fail the mission, you cant really be messing around slowly setting up an ambush to deal with the enemies. In this way, the game comes accross as having multiple personality disorder. Because of the new abilities the aliens have, you have to be very careful, running away and looking for cover. But because of the round timers that the developers have, you have to be very fast, making sure to get there on time. The developers also saw fit to remove the ability to 'dash' to a door or objective and activate it in the same turn. That means that you have to move there, and use your second action point to activate the objective, or dash there, and activate it on the next turn. Nearly all of the 8 turn missions I have attempted have been failed with one soldier standing right next to them, ready to activate it! FOR GOODNESS SAKES! I failed 8 missions in the campain, and completed 4, (some of them tutorial missions) on the easy difficulty, even though I have played the other game on impossible.The aliens themselves have also been given much more power. Sectoids can now mind control, and appear just as early in the game as the last one. In the last game, only Sectoid Commanders could mind control, and you didn't encounter them until much later, when the research your scientists had done allowed you to manufacture advanced armours and weapons that leveled the playing field. Not only that, but Sectoids can also now raise the dead. So if one of your soldiers is unlucky (Literally, since the game is based around pseudo-random hit chances more than ever before...) not only does it hurt because you can attack the enemy once less per turn, but also it hurts because they can attack you once more per turn!  Killing the offending Sectoid will kill all the zombies as well though, but unfortunatly, it is rare that you encounter a Sectoid all on it's own. It is often accompanied by a pair of 'stun' troopers. These aliens are also encountered early in the game, and can dash AND melee attack your troops in the same move! Not only that, but they have a high chance to stun your troops, robbing them of their next move. It is hard to run away from these troops AND reach the objectives in time. Not only that, but while you run away for more cover, which is the only strategy in these Xcom reboots (everything else is random, positioning is the only certainty (and suppresion /explosives )...) you will invariably trigger another pod of deadly aliens, which will surely slaughter your entire team in the next go. What is also poorly explained, and completely ruined, is the geoscape. In the last game, you were given clear goals of what to do next, or what decisions you could afford to make. In this game, Everything is random. There are 11 continental perks, but there are only 6 continents. The game randomly picks your starting position, randomly picks 6 perks out of the 11 in the game, and randomly gives each continent one of those perks. I started in New India, in Asia.In the last game, you had a scan button, which would advance time. In this game, there are Scan buttons located all over the map. These buttons are essentially like bars, that get filled up as you choose to scan at that location, instead of another. once you have scanned it empty, you get the reward from it, what ever that was. Now, instead of monthly funding, every month, the funds you would have got are put down on the map somewhere, and need to be scanned for three days. You also need to build communications centers in your base to be able to contact more regions, and the regions are contacted in linear order.Research and base management works the same, with a list of upcomming events that get completed as you scan in the map. Manufacturing works similarly, but now once you have manufactured certain items (Like armour or weapons) You only need to manufacture one, and every troop can have one.There are certain missions in the game which advance the 'Advent' bar until completed, which when full, ends the game.  These missions don't disapear after a day like the others, and can be attacked at anytime. But only if you have contact with the continent that it is located in. So if you dont have access to that mission, you will have to build a communications center. But if you don't have enough power, you will need to build a power plant. But if you don't have enough money to do that, you will need to scan around to get some. While scanning, there is a risk a pick two, or pick three mission will pop up. You can choose to ignore it if you want, but there are 2 or 3 negatives associated with each of those missions, such as all enemies will have armour for the next month, or your funding will be cut in half next month. You can only pick one of those missions, and the other two negatives will happen anyway. But it will be difficult to beat those missions, with the new timer mechanics, and unfair enemy powers. If you dont have enough time to wait for all the building either way, then you will lose the game.There is no way to play the game like the last one in my opinion. Now, instead of being able to start a new playthrough and put on Ironman/Impossible, and follow through with a certain strategy you have been working on, the game does everythingrandomly, making it so you go in blind everytime. The old rules still apply to a deggree, elevation is good, blow up their cover, run away if you can to a more secure location, focus fire etc etc.But all of those rules go out of the window randomly. You rely on cover? Well what about if one of the humans running around on the map randomly turns into a giant monster, that can walk up to your soldier on a balcony, and swipe it's claws, and completely destroy the building your team is stood on, in one move? You always know you can run away from the aliens to secure a much better environmental advantage, like higher cover or a vantage point? Aww, well, too bad, you got a mission that expects you to kill 10 aliens and hack the box in 8 turns, with four rookies, and devastating consequences for failure. There are some positives though:They fixed the mouse lag, making for a much more enjoyable user experience. The game also runs well for me on my old rig, so I don't know why some users are reporting performance issues, but it may be a driver issue or something. The game looks pretty good as well. The game features well done randomly generated maps. The designs, the music, the sound are all great! One great moment I recall was a grenade knocking a soldier into a train, only to have a 'BANG' play, as his body hit the metal train! xD The game is also much more snappier than before, it's very responsive and less time-wastie to give orders and pan the camera. The game world and designs ooze atmosphere also. The tactical randomness lets the game down imo. You shouldn't have to mod the game to give you one or two more turns, that's something the developers should have anticipated.			"

												I REALLY tried to like this game.  I'd heard so many good things and I was anxious to play it.  BUT IT JUST WASN'T ANY FUN!The story line kept forcing me into missions I knew I wasn't ready for.  I was constantly running out of power, running out of COMs, running out of supplies, running out of scientists, running out of enginners.  Everytime I attempted to address these things, I was forced into another Top Priority mission, and I would get even further behind. Which brings me to the combat.  Losses and wounding are part of the game ... I get that.  But the same problem with physical supplies ... it would take DAYS for a soldier to recover, and everytime I tried to accelerate it I was forced into yet another mission.   On the High Priority Advent missions, there were waves and waves of enemy reinforcements and my fixed number of soldiers would just get shredded.  Fighting with inexperienced rookies was a nighmare, as they would routinely go into a panic and run away screaming, leaving you a man down.It was an endless circle ... can't train soldiers without Training Facilities, which you can't build without engineers, which you can't recruit without supplies, which you can't accumulate because you keep getting forced into missions.I read up on different tactics and approaches and I even tried starting the game over a couple of times.  The game was a big disappointment ... I like to play games for fun, not punishment.			"

												The game initially showed promise, but I quickly came to realise that it's so tied up in the designers' decisions for showboating and 'what-would-be-awesomes' that it isn't actually any fun to play.The core of the original XCOM game is there and they've added some really solid new features to it, such as the armour system and melee combat, but the bad decisions significantly outweigh the good. The amount of RNG (which on it's own is fine), combined with new status effects that essentially render your soldiers completely ineffective for a turn (and the sheer number the enemy can deploy them on you) can quickly render entire missions impossible to complete within the first turn of combat, potentially forcing you to reload the same mission over and over. Animations in combat take forever and sometimes pause for a second or two afterwards for no clear reason, completely removing the sharp and snappy combat aesthetic they were aiming for and making battles take forever. The camera seems to snap all over the place for no good reason, even occassionally missing important enemy moves, and if I have to see that pointing animation one more time I don't know what I'll do.The stealth system, while a nice addition, seems a bit ad-hoc and doesn't seem to explore its own potential fully. I'm not sure how I'd change it up but currently it just feels lacking.The additions to the overworld gameplay are really fun and add a lot to the game, the more guerilla style warfare gives XCOM 2 a suitably refreshing style change from 1 and I think it's the overworld that's the strongest part of the game. However, that doesn't really translate to the battle gameplay.Additionally, I'll be the first to admit my machine isn't top of the line (or even all that good anymore) but the amount of variation in the framerate, even with graphics settings dialled down from recommended only increase the frustration of trying to play this further.In conclusion, a promising game sorely let down by some terrible design decisions for the battle system that would turn an otherwise fun game into a mess of frustration and disappointment. A real shame, as XCOM 1 is among my higher rated games.			"

												Psuedo sense of urgency via forced turn limits, no contoller support except for non standard steam contoller (making back door deals with valve to exclude all other contollers is very anti consumer), Too high difficulty level at inital stages of game (mind control on the first mission? really?!). Xcom Enemy unkown was far and away a better game and much more balanced. If you must try Xcom 2, wait till it's on sale for 50% off. So disappointed.			"

												Xcom is a fascinating game, and if you like(d) it will motivate you.But the game is too unpredictable to be fun. If you come up with viable tactics it will somehow cheat on you, and break its own mechanics. This is frustrating, because your are not versing just Aliens. You are also versing the changing game mechanics artificially.			"

												played for 12 hours. tried and failed to get into it. as a fan of the original i hate the fact enemies move on your turn, often flanking you near the end of your turn which seems incredibly unfair. the same old gameplay is incentivized (you don't want to 'trigger' a new squad of enemies on the end of your turn)there's also a great deal of bugs, shooting and melee attacks through walls; i once had a dead enemy perform a reaction shot on me. this game chugs with the framerates when it has no right to, considering that the graphics are nothing spectacular.i was playing on commander difficulty and i found it very hard in a frustratingly random kind of way. i restarted about 5 times a few hours in trying to keep my soldiers alive long enough to get some extra health so they aren't dying in one hit. this in itself is not a complaint - xcom is that kind of game. however a lot of the random elements are completely nonsensical and unintuitive. combined with the timed missions you can find yourself in a corner very quickly if you lose one guy on a mission. i can't imagine being able to continue after losing an entire squad and the mission.

												VERY VERY good and addictive game, a worthy successor of the series. Probably you will not stand up until you complete it (this happens to all original classic XCOM games). However, there are cons:The main one:NO OPTION TO SKIP OR DISABLE CENTRAL. He will constantly disturb you and interfere with the gameplay and you can't skip him. You will have to listen to him until he finishes his speech and he will repeat the same words again and again. This is really painful.The second one: THE ♥♥♥♥ING SONS OF ANARCHY DLC. I don't even know what idiot came up with the idea to put this♥♥♥♥♥♥into XCOM 2. He should be fired immediately. DLC is completely unserious and simply doesn't fit the game. Even if you set their spawning chance to 0 in the options, your soldiers will have naked hands with spikes/LEATHER SHORTS/etc if you change the armor in the loadout.The third one:Lack of optimisation.

												     This game is what small team strategy is all about. Your squad being constantly under preasure and outgunned, Xcom 2 captures the Chaos of war as you must adapt and overcome a dynamic battlefield. Do not expect to bring everyone back home, Xcom 2 will punish you and test your limits with the loss of your highly custimizable (and  often named) characters.  Despite the frustration of loss, youll take your beating and keep coming back for more.     Multiplayer needs work, the servers are shoddy at best and there is no punishment for someone who just drops out mid match due to rage. Also blade master rangers in multiplayer are a little broken as they will quickly take advantage of untouchable after easily closing distance and slaying oponents troops.			"

It's so bad in fact that I have to not recommand this especially at this price point! Main issues are: Poor performances, poor optimization (never improved from day one)  and patches that destroys more stuff that it fixes... beside they are few and far between which in this case might even be a blessing.Essentially, You'll have to use mod yo fix most problems out.

												XCOM Is probably the most engaging game I've played in recent years, and XCOM 2 does great justice to the franchise. Let me break it down to pretty bullet points for you, in case you need help deciding whether to purchase this.PROS:- Strong theme and backstory, quite a mysterious plot.- Looks awesome, art direction is exquisite.- Tense! Some battles can really get your heart pumping.- Interesting mechanic for the strategy map.- Deep and fun soldier customization.- Diverse enemies and mission objectives add variety.- Long campaign!CONS:- Bad dice rolls can be cruelly unfair. Part of the game, tho! It's XCOM!- The first run (with the tutorial ON, that is) is too frantic for my taste. I like to be left alone.- Has some performance issues. Firaxis appears to be working hard on fixing them.- I've seen a few glitches and quirks. Bugs, that is.- Rather pricey, considering the above.CONCLUSION: 9/10, would name my gunner ""Silvester Stallone"" again.			"

												This is the best game I've played in a long time--it truly sratches the itch. There's always some great new, game-changing upgrade just a turn or two away; maddeningly challenging (but not unfair) battles, personality, and a scenario that you can really get into (alien occupation and human resistance).I really liked the previous XCom as well as the classic Xcom. If you enjoyed those games, I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. If you're not familiar with the franchise, imagine a turn-based strategy version of something like Deus Ex. Don't be put off by ""turn-based."" This game isn't boring at all, and you will APPRECIATE the time it gives you to plan each move, because each move counts. This game isn't about actions per second; it's about contemplating every possible move and choosing the most viable option. One last thing--most games, even ones I enjoy, I look forward to ending them and moving on to the next great game. With Xcom 2, though, I put off the story missions and tried to stretch it out as long as I could. I would've put quite happy to play for another 20-30 hours, and am already looking forward to whatever DLC is planned for it. In short: Great buy, even at full price. Money well spent!  "

												The animations gel well with the tactics. Positioning and well timed Overwatch moves are the keys to victory in this game. However, if one wishes a flawless victory every time, thsi game is not for that person. Also, be prepared to save after every move, because it could lead to a potentially bad situation that either kills off or cripples your choice soldiers. There are crash issues with animations freezing the game at times, and the framerate is choppy, but despite that, there is a mod for almost everything in this game, which makes the replayability go up by a factor of 10. Also, if one is not careful, he can get destroyed even in easy mode, something that sold the game to me, just like Divinity OS.If you have hours to spare, like customization and management, and are a fan of turn based combat, this is a must buy.Aku - Roku - Zan			"

												TL;DR: Way to buggy/glitchy to be worth. April 2nd, 2016, don't buy the game yet. Ever since the first patch my game has crashed multiple times on the same mission.The main flaw in the game right now is how buggy this thing is. For a game that was priced at $60 ( $80 for dlc), the amount of bugs is not worth it. Thank god for all the sales that are going on at this time, but even then I would say it is not worth it for how unpolished this is. After it is all fixed though I can definitely say this game is worth it. I loved X-com the first game. The gameplay in this one is even better with some annoying things gone such as the having to upgrade your own airships to takedown enemy cruisers, the new aliens are an interesting change. I wish they included more avatars for the later missions though rather than having only 4 in the entire game. The beginning is definitely challenging because you're limited on men and the aliens are so brutal, the mid game is kinda meh, and then the late game is a joke because if you research right and manage can manage your positioning you could take out hoards of aliens with ease especially when you get the soldiers with the right abilities. Hope someone does a long war mod of the game.			"

Posted: February 8, 2016
												So after several hours of gameplay, I can honestly say I recommend this game and love the new changes.  I played XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within as well so I will give an honest review of the game. Quick Overview of Pros and Cons:Pros:* Really really fun - Matters because reason we buy and play* Good solid graphics* Great strategic play - Well thought out - Better than XCOM: EU/EW* Lots of options makes for very diverse play* Lots of maps - Really good maps/variety* Extremely immersive gameplay - You feel like you are trying to save the human race/world* Surprises, twists, and mystery - Great story telling so far* A large range of different enemies to fight* Mobile base and travel is well done and you have to make hard decisionsCons:* Could take some learning for new players - you might die :)* I did find one bug in the game during play so far - It was while in base, under the armory tab, and happened during customizing my units.  When I clicked on the ""menu back"" button it would not back out of the menu.  I did eventually get back out by switching to customizing another player and was then able to use the menu back.  Have not been able to duplicate this bug, only happened once.I know some do not like the ""time limit"" or number of turns you have, but I really thought it added to the game and made it a lot of fun so far.  It is an immersive element, you need to accomplish some parts of some missions fast and I liked it.  It gives some depth and weight to your choices on the battlefield and it makes sense from a story telling perspective as well.  It is well done, should try it before you mod it out imo.I know some have experienced some performance issues, I have not.  My system is good, but not top of the line.  If you have a below average system you will need to upgrade to play this game.My system:* i7 4790k* 8GB Ram* 120 SSD (game not on SSD)* 1TB HD* AMD 280 with 3GB video memPerhaps the current AMD video card drivers are better for this game than the current Nvidia drivers - I don't know that, but perhaps that is why some are experiencing some lag/stutter issues.*I have not had a single crash or freeze with this game.Overall this is a great game and extremely fun to play!  Lots of ways to customize and it's just a blast to play.  I think it is well done.  There are some out there that say it is poorly optimized, however most are probably not programers or developers.  I have electrical engineering and computer science experience and it seems fine to me.			"

												In short this game is more or less XCOM 1.5. Though that is not necessarily a bad thing as the great gameplay from the previous one is still in there, the bad thing is that it feels as if many of the assets such as animations have been re-used from the previous game so it does not feel entirely fresh. And the graphics look sleek without being too good.Many of the new additions are great and since you are now on the offensive most of the time it means that many missions have timers, so you have to get your objectives done and then get out as soon as possible which creates tension and forces you to adopt new tactics compared to what you were used to previously. Though some of the missions have timers that either are too short or does not make much sense in relation to the objective. Such as the missions where you have to secure a supply stash, and even though you start the mission in stealth the enemy will still destroy the supplies if you take too long even if you were never detected.The endgame also feel a bit too easy, as there are no elite versions of many of the enemies, ADVENT soldiers of all kinds seem to level up and develop as time goes on, but many of the units such as the Vipers don't. Meaning that a once feared enemy no longer is a threat at all. So the pacing feels a bit off later on.Customization is really great, with many new ways to customize your soldiers, from a wide selection of hats and armours, even weapons and character personality animations can be changed to make your own squad more unique. Many of the classes also have been a bit more streamlined as well, and many skills feel a bit more useful and distinct. The specialist for example can now go down the skill path to become a medic or combat hacker. Both are useful so it is up to you how you mix and match character skills and builds.All in all I enjoyed XCOM 2, but I feel that they could have done more, it feels like a large expansion rather than a full new game. But if you liked XCOM: Enemy unknown, then you will probably enjoy this one, just be prepared that they are fairly similar while at the same time have enough differences. If nothing else there is always a steam sale later on. One thing is the same still though, RNG is still a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I just want to make a short list of good and bad things in XCOM 2. So here it is:GOOD* There's always something to do, whether it's an operation or simple supplies gathering. No more boring weeks with nothing on the hologlobe* Nice visuals and cut-scenes. It was a strong point of Enemy Unknown/Within and they don't disappoint in this area. * Variety of mission types. No more ""kill all the enemies to complete objective"". Now you have to do something more than that * Character pool and customizations. It was always about soldiers and I'm glad they improved those options.* Weapon mods* Interesting and good-looking enemies* More random maps with some interactive features (aiming at explosive things, soldiers appearing as WANTED on holo-ads) * Badass Bradford* More 'progression' objectives* Very nice soundtrackBAD* Poor optimization, graphic glitches, freezes, long loading screens etc.* Avatar progresses too fast, without good planning you'll end up lagging behind* Too big reliance on explosives. You'll end up grabbing more Frag Grenades than any other items, despite wide selection of them* Poor chemistry between Tygan & Shen. Remember Vahlen and Shen senior? It's not even close to those funny taunts and conversations.* No more individual weapon creation. Now you grab one and it's available for all your soldiers.* Still 3 tiers of weaponry/armours. It may appeal to vanilla XCOM players but after Long War, it's a downgrade.* Concealment mechanics could be improved (e.g. you re-enter the concealment after few turns without enemy in range)* Timed missions force you to go straight to the point, with enemies always on your path. You lose the advantage of the map design, since you can't wander around.OVERALL:Strongly recommended despite minor flaws. Some future patches will probably fix most issues, and mods will improve the gameplay even further.			"

												My first review on Steam and sadly a negative one.I bought XCOM 2 full of hopes, having read almost only positive reviews on Steam (I just noted that this has changed heavily in the last days, (lesson learned....) and with great expectancies for the Definitive XCOM Game.All vanished after just a few hours of playing:The MISSIONS are based almost purely on luck. Particularly in the case of missions with a limited number of turns, there is no tactics involved, only rushing and hoping not to stumble in the wrong place at the wrong time. Often the missions end up being a Die-ReloadLastTurn-Die-ReloadLastTurn-Die feast, which I hate and is a horrible way to play this kind of games (but the only effective way). I never did this in any other previous chapter of XCOM or UFO.But what I hated the most, was the complete lack of freedom of the original UFO series which is definitely lost: you have to follow the plot that the devs have planned for you, no matter what.This used to be a great game about tactics, resource managing and freedom of choice.All of this is dead now, what is left is a very standard mainstream game, with good techical programming and very poor gameplay.I am SO disappointed.

												So far, with five hours of gameplay, this game seems to be everything I ever dreamed of and maybe even better! The level of detail gameplay-wise is absolutely stunning to me, and it is bound to become even more stunning once the modding community gets up and running, which, as far as I can tell, will be very soon indeed. I do have a few quarrels though. The minimum requirements seem to a bit of an understatement as I, with the I-7-4790K(4 Ghz quadcore w/hyperthreading), the Geforce 760gtx with latest driver, which should be far above minimum requirements, and 8 GB of ram, is experiencing a significant amount of lag. I am certain it is just a matter of optimization, and I hope this will be fixed in a few weeks. Even with the lag this game is almost a ten out of ten'er, but untill it is optimized I can't give this game more than 9/10.Great Game!			"

												Contrary to other gamers I did not experience crashes and severe FPS drops but I can hear my computer on a heavy workload as if it were some high-end FPS game. Seriously, this game desperately needs some optimisation.And I get it: As a resistance you have to operate on a time limit but the constant turn timers force you into a certain play style. Gone are the days when you could position your soldiers for maximum effect. Snipers almost are a redundant class. Streamlining is one thing in a game. It is another matter entirely to artificially inject a sense of urgency with game play mechanics limiting your range of tactical choices. Thanks to some quick modders you can now set up longer timers or remove them entirely from the game which basically is a bloody cop out. The devs simply included too many of those timer missions early in the game which is rather unfortunate because that's when your squads are at their weakest compared to the alien opposition. Any mistake in keeping up concealment is punished mercilessly by this game. So you find yourself inching forward with the waypoint movement system. Even worse, this whole system of forcing you into quick movement tactics is counterproductive when you reach later stages of the game. The key story missions don't have timers and you'd be well advised to dust of your old EU skills of slowly advancing your front line.So what's the bottom line? Well, XCom 2 is a good game at least in theory. The enemies are varied and each species presents their own specific challenge. The timers are bloody annoying but you can get used to them. The real problems come from the bugs in this game. When you see your squad go to hell in an ironman game because one of those snake creatures can pull your soldier through a door and two floors, then you feel your frustration level rising because you were not defeated by a bad move but by a bad game engine. Sure, with some experience you learn to expect certain bugs and work around them but a truely excellent game would not force me to reserve some head space in order to avoid problems which shouldn't be in the game to begin with.pros:- interesting and varied enemies- a real tactical challenge- a good UI- a competent AI- tons of customization options- compared to XCom 1 a greater choice in missions- steep learning curve as the game is brutally unforgiving (if you want a challenge)cons:- still some performance issues- still some glitches especially with the detection and line-of-sight system- the game forces you to adopt a certain playstyle in order to succeed (at least early in the game)- melee enemies have unbelievable range- steep learning curve as the game is brutally unforgiving (if you are new to the game)			"

												After playing this game for 40 hours I figured i'd share my thoughts on it with you.Seing as it's been out a few days now, i figure most of you know the general story of this game, but just in case here is a short synopsis: It's 20 years after the events of XCOM. during that time, the aliens overthrew the human governments and founded their own. They are currently in control of everything. XCOM is njow little more than a  small group of freedomfighters, with very little to their name. The goal is to stop abductions, overthrow the aliens, and get the cake. Although not a very innovative story, it is certainly interesting enough to keep you hooked. Firaxis have let the story show through in some of its game mechanics-in both good and bad ways.  You are constantly on a timer, meaning you have to prioritize production of gear, research and facilities well. You may alos find yourself abandoning areas of the world to help out another. Every choice feels important, and this really helps carry the story forward.On the flipside of the coin however we have the idea of timed missions. In XCOM I enjoyed them as a nice little break from the normally slow phasing, But in this game they have taken it to the extreme. Practically every mission have some sort of mission timer, usually 8 or 12 rounds, but sometimes also 6, or via the use of a ""dont let the aliens blow up the computer"" mechanic. These timers are extremelly short for what you need to do, and you often find yourself forced to double move into unknown territories, just to keep up with the timer. This means you cant really react to what you find, and there's a big chance you put yourself in a flank. This mechanic would've been fine if Firaxis added a few turns  on each mission, but as it stand it is just infuriating.The game is also extremelly buggy. there are countless amounts of visual glitches, such as bladestorming a Viper as he is entangling you causing you to be stuck in the entangled animation for the rest of the mission, or falling through a recently blown up floor causing you to lose all your animations every once in a while. The list of minor bugs can go on practically forever. This however was probably anticipated as we saw similar issues with the release of XCOM.  There are however several game breaking bugs, such as falling through roofs and getting stuck in an enviromental piece, doors on the final mission not opening, or certain enemies on the final mission warping off the map. Enemy design is overall great. All enemies have a counterplay (although cryssalids are extremelly infuriating and not enjoyable in any way), and they all look great. They have all evolved in some way since XCOM, and it's always enjoyable to see Firaxis keeping their story at heart. The gameplay itself is just what you'd expect from XCOM, and with the exception of the timer, and classes being reworked it is near identical. The missions have different goals, and the game focuses more on destruction of cover.In short: The game is enjoyable, it plays mostly like XCOM EU/EW. It does have a glaring issue in the form of the mission timer, and it is absolutelly littered with bugs.  If you can overlook these two issues you will have a blast.			"

												Gameplay wise, XCOM 2 is a definite improvement over it's predecessor. A lot of the problems i had with XCOM:EU and EW are fixed here. The streamlined base building mechanics are also welcome over the confusing layouts in Enemy Unknown. The character customization is also very detailed, allowing you to create lookalikes of your friends as well as yourself. The story is genuinely interesting too, with the concept of Aliens runnning an oppressive government executed quite well, with high-quality cinematics too.However, the technical problems are very much present. Various animation glitches, crashes, terrain disappearing, aliens taking too long to respond in a turn, framerate drops etc. If this wasn't a turn-based game, i would have stopped playing a long time ago. i ran this game on an Intel 3970x @ 3.9 Ghz, 2x GTX 970s, 16gigs of RAM and the game running off a high-speed SSD, and the performance was pretty much the same, irrespective of whether SLI was on or off. And by that i mean the game runs poorly regardless of whether sli is on/off. In it's current state, i cannot recommend this game. My advice for a potential customer would be to wait until the problems have been ironed out before picking this up. Or maybe wait for a sale.			"

												XCOM 2 has such great game play and story. I was bumbed about this possiable future, but it was fun being the under dog. Level design are nice. Multiplayer is fun guessing what the opponent will do and countering. Being able to build a team and naming them helps make them seem more personal which makes you think harder to keep them alive. Its nice to see that this provided many new abilities and gameplay changes to keep it interesting. 94/100			"

												In XCOM 2 Earth forces have failed to stop the alien invasion of the first game and entered a pact with the invaders: most people now believe the aliens to have peaceful intentions and are happy to let them control most of their life. The XCOM project is still alive though and is trying to mount a resistance movement to find out the aliens' true agenda before overthrowing their government.The game is both an overhaul and a refinement of its predecessor and stands out as the finest XCOM game in recent times despite a shaky release.PROS:-the overall graphics are pretty good with nice effects and animations-good soundtrack-while pretty cliched the plot flows well and there'd a decent amount of mistery behind the aliens' plans-the new resistance-styled XCOM really has alot of character and charm-still sports some top notch turn-based tactical combat made even better by added mission types and better level randomization-the concealment mechanics are truly superb and provide good tactical depth-new soldier classes are excellent and great to use: said soldiers are also fully customizable in their looks, voice, stance etc-moddable weapons are fun-new alien types are quite interesting and can surprise you with some new abilities, their design and animations are also great-good length, each campaign'd last you at least 20/30 hoursNEUTRAL:-timed missions can be challenging or annoying, also depending on personal taste: still there's mods to make timers longer or remove them altogether-some missions can feel a bit unfair in regards to the amount of enemies thrown at youCONS:-uneven performance-long loading times-some line of sight bugs (like through closed steel doors) can be annoying and ruin your tactics-camera can be problematic at times-still has several bugs (a few crashes, audio desync in cutscenes, envirnment destroying itself for no reason etc...)

Going from a worldwide funded organization to a small resistance movement is quite a change and while I wasn't fully convinced at first I must say it works perfectly: you'll feel like a guerrilla squad operating behind enemy lines, facing overwhelming odds and slowly turning into a truly badass spec ops squad as time goes by and promotions mount up.The new mechanics Firaxis introduced provide an overall better game experience both in the field- with concealment letting you decide when and how to start going guns blazing, soldier skills providing many ways to get the upper hand over the aliens and synergizing well with each other, etc- and in the geoscape view- with mutually excluding missions prodiving different bonuses and drawbacks, POIs to explore, the Avenger to rebuild and so on. There's just so much to do, most of it is fun and well-designed and the game's brand of challenging, deep combat is simply as outstanding as it is engaging.There's a few dents into this great game sadly and most of them are due to a shaky release. There's some line of sight bugs where you can be discovered through solid walls and closed doors,a few AI hitches, shaky framerate, some jarring problems with audio in cutscenes getting messed up and the game can sometimes simply crash to desktop. Even after a patch things havn't improved too much so here's hoping Firaxis gets their act together and finally polish everything up.Even with all its blemishes XCOM 2 is simply an impressive entry in the franchise and a must buy for both long-time fans and newcomers: it's that good and it's only going to get better through patches, mods and DLCs.

												There's a difference between challenging and frustrating. XCOM 2 simply isn't fun to play anymore at the later stage of the game. The game is very unforgiving, and brutal which is fine. However, it also doesn't balance the risk/reward of the game well. Often we are forced to risk the lives of our soldiers for minimal gain, and if we fail, we lose much more than we can recover. This makes the game into a long and hard grind, and more often then not after a few hours of playing I stop because the game just makes me tired and frustrated at it.Frustating Issues:Constant Interuptions - The game makes us scan every thing for days to get anything done, and yet it constantly throws interuptions and urgent missions and all sorts of stuff at you whenever you try to get anything done. It forces the player's progress to slow to a crawl.Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned - The difficulty curve spikes insanely quickly after the first few missions, forcing us to always have to field high ranking soldiers if we want to have a chance at succeeding. Yet it makes it difficult to train Rookies, which in turn leaves us without a capable fighting force if we happen to lose our higher ranking troops. And we WILL lose them eventually.Timers - The game has too many missions with timers on them to play without the Disable Timers mod. Timers forces us to be reckless if we do not want to fail the mission, which in turn causes us to lose soldiers, which are expensive to replace.Overpowered Enemies Are Too Common - It's completely fine to have strong boss enemies. They make the gameplay fun and makes you feel rewarding when you manage to score a kill on them. One good example would be the first encouter with the Avatar. If done right, you could have your whole team fight the Avatar alone, and it made for some interesting and intense gameplay. However, one bad example would be the Sectopod. The first time meeting it was cool, but later on, the game simply spams the Sectopods and force you to fight one in almost every single mission, and they are often backed up by other units. By having these things be so common, it no longer a novelty to fight them. Instead it becomes a huge annoyance. Furthermore, some enemies are completely overpowered. Not only does the Sectopod have a insane amount of health, it gets to attack twice per turn AND overwatch after that. That is simply not fun. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Sure, this game might appeal to the veteran hardcore XCOM fans out there, but as someone who just wants to enjoy the game, perhaps it'd be better if they left some of those things for the higher difficulties and made the lower difficulties easier. For now, it feels like the developers did not put any effort into balancing the game, and instead thought ""How much can we frustrate and♥♥♥♥♥♥off our players so that they hate the game from now on?"" and designed the game based on that.

												Just can't give this one a thumbs up. It has strayed so far from the original vision of the game. The timed sprints through city streets are no comparison to the hour long marathons of assaulting a downed battleship in a farmers field.No tactics, barely any strategic thought on the world map, no interceptions, no UFOs. For eff's sake the first game was marketing as ""UFO: Enemy Unkown"".And the performance issues on my beast of a PC (980ti) are appalling. I go from the Witcher 3 maxed on 1440P to this steaming pile of code on 1080P on low settings and it stutters and locks up all day. Many of my hours in this one were taken up trying to get it to run properly.Huge disapointment. Don't buy it...			"

												As a veteran of previous XCOM titles, including XCOM, Terror from the deep, Enemy Unknown, and Enemy Within, I thought I'd love this game.  While it's not so hard it's unplayable, it is so hard its a chore, rather than fun.  The game maker's fetish with time limits makes the game much less enjoyable. 90% of missions have a time limit (and not a big one) and the entire game has a limited number of days until game over.Gabriel Garcia said it perfectly; That avatar project clock is a ♥♥♥♥ing pain.. i wanna upgrade my soilders and have better equipment before going into the harder story missions.. but what i fail to realize is that i dont have time to upgrade my soilders and build my base all nice and neatly.. i have to jump right into those missions as much as i can as fast as i can.. also i dont have enough radio transmitters in order to unlock more locations on the map so i can access the avatar project facility missions.. which means i have to build more.. which means i  have to clear debris.. by the time i finally build the radio transmitter beacon thingy.. two more advent facility buildings missions show up.. in even harder to reach places.. meanwhile im trying to keep up with ""whats my scanning priority right now"", and all the ♥♥♥♥ing dark emergency ""go ♥♥♥♥ yourself"" missions that appear every 4-8 days.. sigh.. what i do like is that it accurately shows whats its like to fight a losing battle against aliens that control the planet..﻿Also the ""Avenger Bug"" ruined my first and second playthroughs, so skip the tutorial.  And the game likes to crash once every mission or two, so save often.  A sad step backwards from the glorious XCOM Enemy Unknown.			"

												Pros-60 Hour Campaign-Many more alien types, creating more dynamic encounters.-UI Cleaned up from Enemy Unknown, quality of life improvements (reload only costing one action now, etc).-Far more soldier customization options, including weapon customization.-Game mechanics fit the Guerrilla warfare theme, having to contact cells, stay on the move, tactical insertions.-Improved story telling and cutscenes.-Ironman mode returns (requires tutorial to be disabled).-Graphically gorgeous settings and improved terrain.-Game now notifies you if you are flanking or being flanked by an enemy.-Smarter, more aggressive AI. They use their best abilities off cool down and flank hard and often.-Multiplayer is back and cleaned up/improved.-Sharing custom characters (can appear randomly through your play through, even as VIPs).-Weapon customization allows some counters, such as free reloads, increased crit or aim chance, and chance to kill outright.-Experimental weapon research allowing for random weapon unlocks, including flamethrowers.-More armor types.-Armor is now indicated in-game and indicates it's damage reduction, or if it gets shredded.-Classes redesigned but incredibly balanced with their talent choices, both trees are viable playstyles for all.-Permadeath-New event: Base defense, giving you access to ALL your soldiers over time while you defend the Avenger.-Can EVAC from any mission at anytime, but must deploy and reach your EVAC zone with each soldier.-Injured soldiers can be EVAC'd if you can't stablize them.-Line of Sight Indicator now helps tell you in advance if a move gives your soldier line of sight on what targets.-Concealment and Ambushes, incredibly powerful starts.-Potentional for PURE stealth missions (incredibly fun).-Buying Armor or new Weapons no longer require multiple purchases and are instead turned into default equipment.-High replayability.-Vast Modding scene.-Vipers <3Neutral-Can lose your 60 hour campaign at anytime (as in the Aliens can win).-Aliens don't wait around for you to tech up, deploying new aliens very often.-5x more missions than Enemy Unknown, you will get a ton of random side missions, only a few you can ignore.-Old mission types are back; UFO Landing Sites, Terror Missions, VIP missions, etc.-Terror Missions now require that you to save a minimum of 6 civilians out of 13-14, fixing the previous version's mistake.-Many missions now have turn limits (for objectives), forcing more aggressive play and less Overwatch spam.-Avatar Project: The Aliens final goal that can make progress incredibly fast if you wait around too long.-Injured or dead soldiers can be carried to an EVAC zone to return their equipment/weapons.-Weapon and equipment can be lost if the soldier carrying them dies and is not recovered.-Can slaughter civilians outside of terror missions with no reprecusions.-New Geoscape map takes a while to learn but is more streamlined.-Avenger base building is more streamlined, no adjacant bonuses (just need 1 of everything).-Can build PSI Operators much more early or rush for unlocking them.-Many aliens are mini-bosses (Sectoids, Archons, etc) more dangerous mechanics (Mind Control by mission 1).-Research for Science and Tech upgrades remains the same.-Only 3 Weapon Types; Standard, Magnetic, Plasma.-Soldiers can be lightly wounded, wounded, or gravely wounded, putting them out from 3-18 days or more (always occurs if any damage is taken, changed from Enemy Unknown).-Soldiers can become Shaken (Will reduced to 0), requiring kills or safe missions completion to remove.-Dark Events: A difficulty modifier where you chose 2 of the 3 debuffs that you want against you.Cons-Game difficulty can be overwhelming for new players, even on Rookie (the lowest).-Central nags at you very often on what needs to be done, even with Beginner VO turned off.-Missions occur very often, sometimes forcing you to stop scanning to finish something to go do them.-Avatar Progress can sometimes bump up drastically at random, even after destroying a Black Site.-Aim chances are lower all around and require heavy use of flanking to increase.-Hitting or Missing is now PREDETERMINED before you take the shot, and only rerolls when you move (crit not affected).-Early UFO missions are very overwhelming without more soldiers or equipment.-Some Launch day performance issues, v-sync, AA, and AO need to be disabled entirely to get or maintain over 60 FPS.Final Thoughts-Game is stellar and totally worth the purchase, but might be even more valuable on sale with the small season pass (which adds more customization, more weapons and armor, a new class type, and more story missions). Launch day issues have been very minor at best, my frame rate only seemed to drop during loading screens until the mission was loaded then returned to normal 60+. The customizations, difficulty, alien types all add to the vast replayability to the game and there are different paths you can take early on to determine how you want to play, instead of building satelites. Modding adds even far more to the game, and devs have given the tools they used to make the game to modders to expand upon that (name a dev that does that).			"

												Great game with many improvements over the previous XCOM: Enemy Unknown.I'll start by saying I did not experience any of the bugs or performance issues experienced by other players. I purchased on launch and my experience has been very smooth. I have a mid to high-end computer and the game runs flawlessly. I did experience some crashing but it happens infrequently. Users with low-end PCs may have issues until the game is better optimized. The biggest change that players seem to be complaining about is the timer. The whole campaign is basically on a timer and you have limited time to research, make contacts and hunt down supplies as there are constant alien interruptions. You would think the aliens would have the courtesy to leave me alone for 11 days while I research the plasma rifle that is going to triple their losses in battle. How dare they try to prevent me from destroying their race. All kidding aside, I enjoyed this mechanic as it forces you to make the most of the time you have available and doesn't allow you to rush through the research and create early super soldiers. There are many ways offered to halt and reverse the progress the aliens make essentially giving you more time for your own activities. The only real flaw (and it is a major one, in my opinion) of the game is the RNG, or more specifically the in-game indicators of RNG are completely inaccurate and frankly, make no sense. I seem to hit more often with 43% chance than I do with 91% chance. The terrain also effects hit chance in a really weird way and the whole cover system seems to be broken. Overall I'm 18 hours in and having a blast. I'll freely admit I've re-run some missions that have gone poorly for me in order to minimize the loss of a favored soldier, but half the fun in my opinion is seeing what happens differently during a mission by taking various actions.

												XCOM 2 is a straight sequel to the 2012 remake XCOM: Enemy Unknown.In his infinite wisdom, Jake ""Sid Meier is the dad I never had"" Solomon threw out the expected Terror From The Deep follow-up from the meeting board and offers us instead a ""what if ?"" scenario where the aliens won and left XCOM in shambles.Also you get snake girls with♥♥♥♥♥♥cause he swore to never put snakemen in the game. Meta as ♥♥♥♥ !The game is pretty much a refined version of the first one. If you only swear by the original trilogy and Xenonauts, you might be dissapointed. Still, there are some new nice features.With no United Nations to back you up and Alien backed EXALT forces trying to hunt you down, the game flow is a little confusing at first. With your mobile base, you need to scan Earth's various regions to find supplies, troops and more importantly make contact with local resistance cells. This new version of the satelite coverage will become crucial as you try to thwart ADVENTs plans. Indeed, the aliens have an endgame, a doomsday counter called ""The Avatar Project"", which can't be stopped. It's scarier than it looks as completing story objectives and blowing up facilities will slow its progress drastically.Apart from the cosmetic lifting and the guerilla vibe, two features I really loved are the global revamp of the soldier classes and the concealment system. Every class is back but with a new edge, assaults get a melee machete, supports a cool robot, snipers become gunslingers, etc. It's such a great way to spice up the existing classes and make them much more polyvalent. Since XCOM is now a guerilla warfare operation, every mission makes you start hidden. It's up to you to spot enemies and ambush them WHEN you want it. It's a great way to set up a mission, especially since most of them are now timer-based.I don't have many problems with the game. The sad motto ""Don't spot enemies on your last turn movement is still up or you are ♥♥♥♥ed"" is still true and some enemies are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (like the lancers). But most of these complains will probably be answered by a ""git gud, f4gg4t"".The unsung hero of the game is probably Tim Wynn, the new composer. I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at first that McCann didn't make the new score but now I realize it's for the best. XCOM was about mystery and unseen threats which matched the music perfectly. XCOM 2 is all about solemnity and the unshattered pugnacity of humanity. Music is so good it made me swallow a thesaurus.tl, dr: It's a new version of XCOM 2k12 with cool enemies, tons of customization and MOD supports.			"

(although with pollution and global warming it sometimes seems we're doing our best to change that).It's just as well Earth meets our needs so perfectly because we don't have the ability to travel anywhere else to set up camp anyway... at least not yet (unless you count the moon, but we haven't been back there in nearly 50 years, governments would rather spend their money sending planes to drop bombs on deserts than sending rockets into space to benefit all mankind.)Real-EstateOne day, we will have the technological capability to travel to the stars, which will come in handy when the Earth becomes a less hospitable place to live.It's inevitable, whether it's climate change, lack of resources or the death throes of the Sun itself, eventually, if we want to survive as a species, we're going to need  to get off this rock and find a new one.The problem is, even if everything works out for us, if we survive long enough and develop the technology to travel on mass to the stars, we're still going to need to find another Earth-like planet with all the amenities (running water, central heating, oxygen, etc.) that we're accustomed to.Whatever happens, however we ruin our planet, for the moment, we're all stuck here so we have to make the most of it..Squatters RightsDo you know why life evolved on earth?It was because we have all of those lovely luxuries here already.There's a chance that if we did manage to find another planet that can sustain oxygen sucking life like ourselves, that it is already doing just that, sustaining some alien oxygen suckers that are perfectly happy where they are and have no interest in moving out and letting us move in.Aggressive NegotiationsSure, we could ask nicely, but if they didn't want to share there's always another option.We've been turning sandy deserts into glassy craters on Earth for a while now, why not just use our military might to clear a path for our forlorn colonists? Desperate times call for desperate measures. We can justify anything if we need it badly enough.If the native nuisance is still trapped on their own evolutionary cradle and we have the capability to get there, we're probably going to be more technologically advanced than they are (we'll have bigger bombs) so it shouldn't be too much of a problem.Envious EyesBut what if the tables were turned?We're still happy here on Earth, things are ticking over nicely, we've still got petrol for our cars, food for our bellies and oxygen for our lungs, then some alien eyes start to peer greedily at our planet.We'd be unlikely to roll over and give it to them, no matter how big their bombs are.It'd be a fight we'd likely lose (unless Jeff Goldblum and his trusty laptop are around to save us with a timely upload of a computer virus).But assuming this technological war or the worlds fluke doesn't come to pass, we'd be screwed.It'd take a long time to eradicate all of us though and a submissive populace might fit better with the aliens plans, besides, why make war when propaganda can enslave a people just as easily.A New HopeThat's where XCOM 2 comes in.It's been 20 years since the brief ""war"" against the invaders was lost, their propaganda machine has been in full swing for decades brainwashing the masses. The aliens are entrenched and the people cowed.But there is still hope. Pockets of resistance strike against our alien masters, there are remnants from the war, from the group that was meant to defend us from this alien menace.The survivors of the original XCOM project haven't forgotten the world before the overlords arrival and they want it back.Viva La ResistancePicking up the pieces of the devastated XCOM initiative, you are tasked with the job of unifying a global resistance against the insidious interlopers.If you've played any of the other XCOM games, especially the excellent 2012 title ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" then you're going to be on familiar, if somewhat prettier, ground.Starting with a small band of rookie recruits and a bare bones facility which serves as your headquarters (It's mobile this time around too!) you'll need to send out your team to engage in various hit and run missions against the aliens.In Enemy Unknown you were defending Earth against the alien incursions, the tables are turned this time as you strike out against the entrenched invaders, attacking them where and when you think it'll hurt them the most.Humble BeginningsBefore each strike against the enemy you'll need to select your squad from the pool of able bodied recruits you have available.They're all pretty green when you first start out, but the ones that you manage to keep alive will learn new skills and become adept at using different weapon types.You'll end up with heavy ordinance specialists, medics, snipers, etc. all of which will play a vital role in the often punishing tactical battles that you're going to find yourself engaged in.Again, just as with ""Enemy Unknown"" there's a promotion system to reward your best performing operatives, they'll even earn nicknames (which you can edit to suit your tastes if you're the sort that likes to tinker with these things).Man MakingTalking of tinkering, the level of customisation and attention to detail with regards to editing your team is exceptional.You can edit their names and nicknames to make them more memorable (Duncan 'McBig' Donald for instance) , engage in a little plastic surgery to make them look how you want, customise the colours of each individuals armour (I like to use different colours to represent different skill sets, heavy weapons guys in yellow, snipers in black, that sort of thing.)You can even select their nationalities (Their nations flag is displayed on their armour) and the language they speak, which you'll get to hear whilst they're chattering (or screaming) out in the field.It's not limited to languages  (English, German, Spanish, etc.) either, there are also accents to choose from.Under the British voices for example, you'll find Scottish and Irish accents available to really personalise your resistance fighters.The First Cut is the DeepestOf course, this customisation serves to increase your attachment to the little guys, which makes it all the more painful when you inevitably lose one of them in battle, especially if it's someone you've come to rely on, some you've been watching climb the ranks for a while, someone like my first major loss in the game... (You're sacrifice will not be forgotten Sergeant 'McBig').As well as the emotional loss of losing 'McBig' to hostile fire,  (I'll make the alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s pay for that!) there's also the strategic loss of losing a seasoned vet and likely having to replace him with a wide eyed rookie who will take several missions to become useful or more likely, wet his pants and get shot the first time he sees an alien.Engineering Greatness The aliens have been busy in the twenty years following ""Enemy Unknown"" too, their genetic tinkering has continued so you're going to find new and improved alien types terrorising the down trodden humans, which means new specimens to capture and fresh autopsies to perform.Researching alien tech (and biology) found in the field is vital, you're...

												i was really looking forward to the xcom sequel.  i even pre-ordered which i quit doing long ago; now i remember why.  the gaming press is in the bag for the game companies.  I looked through multiple pre-release reviews and there was basically no mention of bugs or what is at times, completly illogical enemy behavior.  for example the game interface works fine on my laptop, right untill i dock it and use my mouse.  now when i mouse over a button it dissapears before i can select it. that's annoying but i can work around it until the hot fix but what i can't get past is the often completly moronic responses of the advent troopers.more than once they've advanced on my position to get a nominally better shot on one of my squad but expose themselves to another squadie.  several times i've had an advent trooper move from a firing position to a burning vechile, ensureing they die after taking thier shot from the explosion.  because they move with no hint of self preservation it's like you are fighting an OP zergling rush. Even that wouldn't be so bad but your squaddies fail about 80% of thier will checks, often creating a cascade failure that is irrecoverable because you're (seemingly) always fighting against a timer.I could probably even work past all of this but i get the stong feeling that failing at any one mission will start a larger failure cascade in the larger game and i don't think there is much of chance to recover once your (nominal) grip on the situation starts to slip.I understand this is supposed to be harder experience and i even embrace the idea but if failure is such a constant  the game becomes a chore.  I've got 6 hours into the game, and i've yet to see the fouth promotion skill for any class because none of the squaddies stay alive long enough.   There is no point in spending time customizing a squaddie if they are going to die in the next mission or two.  the only reward for good tatics in this game is that you might not get completly boned by the crazy enemy behavior, but i wouldn't count on it.The base control suffers from constanly haveing to stop one thing to go to another section to start a new research project, restart a scan that got stopped for the 3rd time, re-assign an egineer, move your ship, deal with a concil alert, and on and on and on.I'm going to table the game until the patch comes out, hopefully fixing the interface and nerfing the will checks a bit.  If it becomes fun i'll write a new review but right now it's just a gigantic dissapointment.			"

												tl;dr scores and tips at the bottom of the review.Xcom 2 is not for everyone, but if you enjoy learning through failure similar to that of a rougelike, this game is more than likely your kind of game. Xcom 2 is a turn based strategy game with some mild rpg elements (earning promotions that increase stats such as ""aim"" ""move"" ""hp"" and gives you two perk options per level.) Xcom 2 requires good tactical knowledge oa how to use and how to use your options. The appeal to the game itself is the amount of viable items, class builds, and even build orders there are to the game to form your coherent strategy. (This is enhanced tenfold with the mod support and the Long War 2 mod.)Xcom 2 is not a kind game, having perma death similar to games like Fire Emblem. You can not only expect to lose soldiers, and even the occasional mission, but sometimes even have to sacrifice a soldier to complete an objective on time or draw fire from a vip. This is ok in a game like Xcom, as opposed to Fire Emblem, because you do not have set characters, and can instead get more and more soldiers to replace your losses, instead only losing the expirence and any items the person was holding. Although smart use of tactics, abilities, and items can minimize these risks (such as using a flashbang to ""silence"" an enemy from using their psychic or physical abilities.) There are many different types of consumables, ammo types, armors, status effects, skills, psionics and classes to minimize the risk of death or to turn a death into an injury, making for a very intense game. In the end though, death will always happen, and is not always preventable. (As of right now I would always recommend an item called Mimic Beacon, as this item when used correctly can act as a get out of jail free card for the whole combat turn.)The expansion to the original 2012 Xcom, Enemy Within, added an incentive to speed along missions and stop the prevelant and honestly overpowered strategy of constant ""Overwatch Trapping"" which is when you would alert an alien on their turn and finish them off with overwatches during their scatter. In this game they remove the incentive instead replacing it with a requirement to move faster. Not all missions are about killing all the aliens, instead having to do an objective in so many turns and then get out. The turn limit, while being criticized by some, pushes against this strategy and calls for more risks to be taken (""Do I alert another squad of aliens and ADVENT to my position so that I can for sure complete the objective on time? Or do I risk not being able to do the objective and reduce the amount of foes I have to deal with this turn?"")The game, despite it's optimization issues, is wonderful, for even reasons I haven't mentioned such as steam workshop mod support. Overall here are my scores for the game:Music: 8/10 (Will fit the mood in game but outside of the game just listening to the soundtrack is lackluster in some songs)Story: 6.8/10 (The game has some interesting twists and has some weird honestly anime style cliches in it, but don't let the story dissuade you from the game as it's not the main focus, and for what it is it serves its purpose.)Gameplay: 9.7/10 (There are a few things that need to be addressed like melee falling off in usefulness after final tier of weaponry and the way hp values are shown, although these are already fixed in some mods. Don't worry, you can still easily miss a 97% shot.)Graphics: 8/10 (If the game runs smoothly it looks beautiful.)Severity of bugs: mainly visual (like breaking a window that has been broken already) and framerate.Overall: 9.3/10TIPS FOR NEWCOMERS TO THE SERIES:- Don't be surprised if you lose.- Have backup plans, a 97% shots can miss, and yes it is statistically possible to miss four 86% shots in a row.- Flashbangs silence enemies and reduce their aim.- Acid grenades are the best in the game at shredding armor.- You have to make choices and sacrifices in your build orders, such as rushing towards psionics and making connections in the resistance the cost of utility items and updating your armory.- Just because you have concealment doesn't mean you play the game like a stealth game, instead use it to wipe out the first squad you see. If you try to play it like a normal stealth game you will get surronded when you get detected.- You can set waypoints using CTRL+Right Click.- Disorient and Fire silence, Disorient and Poison reduce aim (20 percent and 35 percent respectivly.)- There are a couple of deceptively useful skills such as Blademaster and Volitile Mix (DoT from grenades also get the damage bonus.)- Don't get disheartened if you lose a soldier or the game. The game is balanced around casualties.			"

												Awesome game. An improvement I didn't think was possible from Enemy Unknown.The story is deep and the missions are ruthless.There clearly are some people whom are having trouble adjusting their play to the new timed scenarios but I'd say that they are without a doubt the best thing to happen to UFO/XCOM in a long time, especially so if you like playing on Iron Man. The reason is that they force your hand to action. You are no longer able to play ridiculously defensively going inch by inch through the level with all your guys always on overwatch but are going to have to make some really tough calls.Sometimes you'll make the wrong call, people will die, sometimes you'll make the right call and people will die anyway. Sometime leaving your guys to die is  the right call in the longer campaign. Previously Iron Man was simply an excercise in patience, since there were heavy consequences to having your guys shot at, the valid strategy was the one spent hammering overwatch and end turn never putting any of your guys at risk. If you never put anybody at risk, you don't need to load save games.In XCOM2, this is a luxury you seldom have. Usually there is something pressing you on, be it a beacon calling in enemy reinforcement, civilians getting eaten by aliens, a bomb timer ticking or just hordes and hordes of enemy reinforcements whittling you down. This calls for action and decisiveness, but if you over-extend and act too hastily, the game will still be there to punish your overconfidence.There are some missions where there is no timer or the timer will start very late in the mission or the timer might not start until you leave concealment (more about this later). These are usually the missions with the stiffest resistance as well. It allows you to revel in these occasions to really cheese the aliens as much as you can, pay them back for past transgressions, savor the ambush. (Un)fortunately these are also the missions where the aliens are the most well equipped to raise you on your cheese and give you a run for your money. The first such mission I ran into the only survivor was a sole rookie, objective in hand, runnning for her life from hordes of alien reinforcements. The mission was a success albeit a pyrrhic one as my best sniper, my best ranger and my last grenadier were left dead on the battlefield.Other pros:- The whole setting being insurgents against a state of dystopian alien opressors is awesome and surprisingly(!) fits the gameplay much better than the original secret government agency schtick that most other x-com games have had.- The new concealment system allows for some glorious ambushes though it doesn't hand it to you on a silver platter, you really have to be clever about it utilise it to it's full.- The game seems a lot longer and more content rich than previous Firaxis x-com games, that being said there is some heavy borrowing here and there especially on the gear side, but all in all more is more and there are few things without some new refinement.- The base building and management of the avenger (flying around doing missions on the map) feels a lot more refined and is more fun than in previous games. Also, it's no longer just about MOAR LABS, MOAR SCIENTISTS! Engineers are really nice and have a lot of versatility and tasks to balance.- There is a lot more verticality in the missions, allowing better and more varied level design.- Voice acting is good and the characters in your base have a lot of non-critical monologue/reflectections that are fun to listen to but easy to skip.- All aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sCons:- All aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s- The user interface feels very laggy at times, especially during combat.- The framerate will suffer at times, more so than you'd expect from a turn based game. With that being said though, since it's a turn based game it's not a game breaker, but somewhat of an annoyance.- The game has a significant amount of minor bugs, nothing game breaking or super annoying though- The line of sight system is supposed to be super simple, but it turns out instead to be very unpredictable at times as it sometimes allows enemies and players to shoot through walls (it at least makes holes in the wall when they do). Also, what counts as cover from what angles is kinda gamey and you can have situations where it looks like you can clearly see an enemy but it turns out he's in heavy cover. The rules for when they are or are not are rather simple, so you can learn them but it does take you out of the moment sometimes.- You can only rotate the camera in 90 degree increments and have very low zoom in/out capabilities. I suspect this is due to the line of sight thing, since trying to look down from where your character is looking won't actually help you tell if there'll be line of sight or not.- Sometimes, especially when fighting in enclosed spaces, the wall transparence effect that's supposed to allow you to see what you're doing even if there's a wall between you and your character will also make the wall behind your character transparent making it very hard to see what's where and where there are walls and where there aren't.Overall, great game. I was pleasantly surprised despite high expectations.			"

YouTube™ Video: XCOM 2 Walkthrough Part 1 - Introduction Tutorial and the New XCOM Base 

			Views: 170		

			XCOM was one of the hottest games of the year, and it was only supposed to be the first in a series of tactical shooters that never really took off.		

It was questionable as to whether or not they could make a game that is superior to the original.  The first game was really good and its expansion gave you more to do with the original game.  Without a doubt this game is... more of the same thing.  Which isn't necessarily bad.  It's different which allows you to play differently, but for the most part it's the same thing.Many of the enemies have had stats adjusted and have been reskinned, but for the most part all of the enemies are the same.  Some enemies can burrow now.  They've added stuns as a mechanic in the game.  They've removed some moves from some units and given some new ones to new ones.  The enemy unit composition although feels different, is roughly the same.Instead of having to worry about managing countries and slowly losing monetary support from countries you're instead building up a resistence network and can only lose support if you lose a defense mission for that area.  To keep you entertained there are 'pick ups' on the map that you can pick up over time while waiting for enemy attacks or waiting to progress down the rabbit hole of the game's storyline.I think if you've played XCOM before this game is worth picking up.  If you haven't played XCOM before you might want to just pick up XCOM instead and perhaps pick up this one after you're done with the first.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed XCOM 2. I plan to play a lot more of it when the performance issues have been (hopefully) fixed and when some more substantial mods are released.It should be noted that I played on Veteran difficulty. Commander might fix some of the issues I had.What I liked:+ FX+ Story (Plot, characters, missions, VO)+ Customisation+ Combat+ Stealth+ Loot became meaningless pretty fast but it was fun customising weapons.+ Classes+ AIMixed opinions:~ The randomly generated levels are hit or miss. Usually miss. I found myself fighting in streets and hiding behind chest-high walls and pylons most of the time. Everything that’s interesting in the level tends to not be in the B-line you have to make just to make it to the objective in time during a timed mission. ~ BLOOD FOR THE RNGODS. The RNG can get pretty crazy at times, which is both good and bad. Good when it’s funny and satisfying to hit a 30% shot + crit and bad when you miss two 94% shots then proceed hit a 43% shot.What I didn't like: - Overabundance of timed missions. Timed missions are too short to do any meaningful planning, recon, or strategy. You have to make a B-line for the objective. This was my biggest peeve and I’d say it hurt my experience the most. - OST. The tracks Lazarus and Out of the Ashes and the main battle theme are good. Everything else is pretty generic orchestral music and ultimately forgettable. I was really hoping for more heavy percussion and synth.- The setting isn’t interesting. I never found the ADVENT intimidating.- Atmosphere. I never felt one outside of the cutscenes.- The enemy variety isn’t great. A lot of the enemy types stopped being scary pretty quickly. The only ones to really be worried about are the ones with a lot of armour. Most of the time you just fight the MEC's from Enemy Within and ADVENT soldiers. I was really surprised at how I barely fought any Mutons. I only fought the Muton Berserker three times, one of those times being the final mission. - Performance issues. - Mission variety. There are only a handful of mission types. The most interesting and enjoyable ones like UFO capture and base defense only happened once each in my playthrough. Most of the time you're tasked with making a B-line to something you have to hack. I did enjoy the Avatar facility sabotage missions though.			"

												Just as good as the original. you'll still be hard pressed trying to keep your squad alive, your base afloat and still struggling with landing those 99% hit chances. If you are new to xcom, no need to have played the first one and their does come a difficulty setting. Great tactical TBS game with Great character customisation/upgrades aswell as topnotch story and cutscenes. Deffinately a game you will find yourself comming back to even when is all said and done.

												Hi!This game is good. Its not like xcom enemy unknown and xcom enemy within that was both great and well polished gems.I do miss the old xcom where there was more administration, but that seems to be replaced by good action.There is SOOO many bugs, can developers stop releasing games with a rush just so they can get out to the market?! Hire a good tester who can test the game and smake product owners for trying to releasing bad unfinished♥♥♥♥♥♥ please+ Great tacital combat+ Great graphics (if the fix the graphic bugs)+ Fun theme that is really in the swing 2016!-Bugs! (there are alot!)-Missing key elements like extra big mech or bio enhachment (like in enemy within)-MORE BUGS!-Pricey if u think about how small the game is-Expecting alot of pricey DLCs in the future			"

This calls for action and decisiveness, but if you over-extend and act too hastily, the game will still be there to punish your overconfidence.There are some missions where there is no timer or the timer will start very late in the mission or the timer might not start until you leave concealment (more about this later). These are usually the missions with the stiffest resistance as well. It allows you to revel in these occasions to really cheese the aliens as much as you can, pay them back for past transgressions, savor the ambush. (Un)fortunately these are also the missions where the aliens are the most well equipped to raise you on your cheese and give you a run for your money. The first such mission I ran into the only survivor was a sole rookie, objective in hand, runnning for her life from hordes of alien reinforcements. The mission was a success albeit a pyrrhic one as my best sniper, my best ranger and my last grenadier were left dead on the battlefield.Other pros:- The whole setting being insurgents against a state of dystopian alien opressors is awesome and surprisingly(!) fits the gameplay much better than the original secret government agency schtick that most other x-com games have had.- The new concealment system allows for some glorious ambushes though it doesn't hand it to you on a silver platter, you really have to be clever about it utilise it to it's full.- The game seems a lot longer and more content rich than previous Firaxis x-com games, that being said there is some heavy borrowing here and there especially on the gear side, but all in all more is more and there are few things without some new refinement.- The base building and management of the avenger (flying around doing missions on the map) feels a lot more refined and is more fun than in previous games. Also, it's no longer just about MOAR LABS, MOAR SCIENTISTS! Engineers are really nice and have a lot of versatility and tasks to balance.- There is a lot more verticality in the missions, allowing better and more varied level design.- Voice acting is good and the characters in your base have a lot of non-critical monologue/reflectections that are fun to listen to but easy to skip.- All aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sCons:- All aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s- The user interface feels very laggy at times, especially during combat.- The framerate will suffer at times, more so than you'd expect from a turn based game. With that being said though, since it's a turn based game it's not a game breaker, but somewhat of an annoyance.- The game has a significant amount of minor bugs, nothing game breaking or super annoying though- The line of sight system is supposed to be super simple, but it turns out instead to be very unpredictable at times as it sometimes allows enemies and players to shoot through walls (it at least makes holes in the wall when they do). Also, what counts as cover from what angles is kinda gamey and you can have situations where it looks like you can clearly see an enemy but it turns out he's in heavy cover. The rules for when they are or are not are rather simple, so you can learn them but it does take you out of the moment sometimes.- You can only rotate the camera in 90 degree increments and have very low zoom in/out capabilities. I suspect this is due to the line of sight thing, since trying to look down from where your character is looking won't actually help you tell if there'll be line of sight or not.- Sometimes, especially when fighting in enclosed spaces, the wall transparence effect that's supposed to allow you to see what you're doing even if there's a wall between you and your character will also make the wall behind your character transparent making it very hard to see what's where and where there are walls and where there aren't.Overall, great game. I was pleasantly surprised despite high expectations.			"

												Spent the first 3-4 hours creating soldiers, created Hanzo Hazashi and Mike Baker, they both show up as Engineers...Seriously though, the game is amazing. I am yet to come across any major bugs or performance issues. When I first booted it up it was running at 15 FPS, so I lowered the AA and bam, 120 FPS.  I both like and dislike the timed missions, I like them because it forces you to be on your toes. I dislike them when you have one turn left to extract and there is one trooper just sitting there on overwatch. Playing on Veteran and it's certainly a step up from Xcom EW (to me at least)			"

												Hi!This game is good. Its not like xcom enemy unknown and xcom enemy within that was both great and well polished gems.I do miss the old xcom where there was more administration, but that seems to be replaced by good action.There is SOOO many bugs, can developers stop releasing games with a rush just so they can get out to the market?! Hire a good tester who can test the game and smake product owners for trying to releasing bad unfinished♥♥♥♥♥♥ please+ Great tacital combat+ Great graphics (if the fix the graphic bugs)+ Fun theme that is really in the swing 2016!-Bugs! (there are alot!)-Missing key elements like extra big mech or bio enhachment (like in enemy within)-MORE BUGS!-Pricey if u think about how small the game is-Expecting alot of pricey DLCs in the future			"

												Just as good as the original. you'll still be hard pressed trying to keep your squad alive, your base afloat and still struggling with landing those 99% hit chances. If you are new to xcom, no need to have played the first one and their does come a difficulty setting. Great tactical TBS game with Great character customisation/upgrades aswell as topnotch story and cutscenes. Deffinately a game you will find yourself comming back to even when is all said and done.

												First of all, I love the xcom series.I was having a lot of fun in XCOM 1 and wanted to finish it before buying XCOM2. The sound in XCOM stopped working for me so I decided to go ahead and buy XCOM2.Well so far the game seems pretty good but I couldn't say much about it because of all the game breaking bugs.During the tutorial there came a time when it wanted me to go into overwatch mode.  I tried, and no matter what I couldnt get into overwatch mode.  I use the steam controlller and it already is kinda weird controls so I tried on my mouse and keyboard, still couldnt.  So I had to quit.  This time I skipped tutorial because I don't have all day to play games and just wanted to play before my wife came home from work.  It was pretty good for about an hour or 2 until at a mission screen my ship starts on it's way to the mission and just stopped.  The game wasnt frozen it was just as if my ship didnt want to go to the mission anymore.  But it was on its way so the game wouldnt do anything else.  I just can't pujt the time into playing a game thats going to stop working all the time I am at a point in my life where I just want to be able to sit back on the couch and enjoy playing a game without thinking about it.   This is not able to be one of those games for me due to all the bugs.  :(Also as I mentioned earlier the steam controller works for it but the controls are bad to me (unless I just have not found out how to change them) but it requires you to click icons with the ""mouse"" for your moves instead of being able to use  the controller to cycle them with buttons.  Any time I'm forced to use the touchpad on the controller to navigate to tiny buttons is annoying,So maybe one day I'll be able to play this when it's polished more.  Until then it's been a waste of $50			"

												It's got solid mechanics but for ♥♥♥♥ sake, it barely works. Constant glitches, some game breaking, or at the very least mission/campaign ruining. That you're completely at the mercy of dogshit coding for the entire game is an egregious fault that cannot be forgiven. Maybe in a more forgiving game this would be more acceptable, but I've had three very successful ironman campaigns killed at the last minute because some ridiculous bug got my best soldiers killed. And, on top of that, you might flawlessly and meticulously complete very long mission, only for the game to crash near the end or  afterward while it's loading the next screen, and now you've just wasted your time and effort. I can hardly believe they would even release this game in this state, let alone leave it largely unfixed even many months after the release.If they ever actually fix it, it's a great game, 8 or 9 out of 10. Until then though, avoid it.			"

												The game is good (I guess) but the experience is just killed by critical technical issues. I played for about 20-25 minutes and honestly it was unpleasant. The game was released for 6 months and still there are a lot of bugs. After 25 minutes or so the game crashed. While I was playing I had 4 freezes which longs for about 30-40 sec each (no jokes, I've never encountered such *** before in my life). I mean, in the past I could play 640x480 Oblivion on Radeon 9600 essentially with graphics turned off with average 20 FPS and 2-5 FPS while you're looking it the direction of stables of Imperial City (no probs -- just look in other direction), but here 60 FPS suddenly becoming 0.03 FPS. It's not just annoying, it makes game unplayable. Maybe it will be fixed -- who knows? BTW, I'm playing on Linux, maybe Windows version is more ok. It's the first game on the Unreal Engine for me with such troubles, I feel bad for Epic Games this game is so un-adverty for their technology:)			"

												Don't be fooled by the thumbs up - it should have a million asterisks next to it.While XCOM 2 is a definitive improvement compared to its predecessor in Gameplay, Audio/Visuals and Story, this game is very finnicky with AMD hardware and has the weirdest issues on that and some slower Intel CPU computers: explosion audio/visuals happen earlier than they should or are completely de-synchronized, model pop-in, texture pop-in, delays in output on very odd occasions, shots that appear to hit actually miss... None of these actually affect gameplay (especially since this is a turn-based game), but it is detrimental to the experience overall and inexcusable in this time and day - using Unreal 4, no less!Low-end/AMD owners, use extreme caution and make sure you're actually willing to pay for a game that WORKS and is REALLY FUN, but LOOKS broken as hell.the amd meme is real			"

												Excellent successor to excellent game.  Warning: worst optimized game in history of computer games? CPU and GPU temperatures are up to around the same as while doing benchmarks, even on main menu with 60 fps locked and settings lowered (how is that even supposed to be possible? did they do that on purpose?)So be sure your computer cooling is not lacking.  Edit: it seems that high temperature with GPU only happens when ALT-tabbing to windows, just played couple hours without ALT-tabbing and max temp was only 49℃ (previous record was 75℃).CPU temp was still high but at least that problem is partially solved.

												An absolutely fun game. Worth every dollar. Combat is great (if you like turn based), the game feels relatively balanced within the difficulties, and the story is pretty cool. I had forgotton what playing a game and enjoying the story was like. You might not like the pacing of the game. This isn't like the original where you could build up and turtle for extended periods of time. X-COM 2 has mechanics built in that prod you to continue do story missions and to make you less cautious during missions. Some people don't like it. I honestly didn't think I would, but I feel it adds an extra element of sheer panic to the game. You can't just sit there, build up and get to the ""steam roll"" part then play the entire game. Overall: Really delightful.			"

												XCOM 2 is absolutely great, 10/10. But still there are some broken things and should be done I hope they'll fix on XCOM3. Giving a single example; Psi-op is broken, seriously. It requires long time to unlock psi-op's full potential but when you get it, its just indescribable. There should be 2-3 types of psi ops in my opinion because it's really stupid to accumilate all psi-op skills on a single operator which I managed to get 3 fully trained maguses; after 2.nd magus, I didn't even move my finger, they're waaaay better than other classes and so IMBA (not just for psi-op, game lacks of classes and there's an unnecessary class for example blademaster is unnecessary and useless late game), there are different bullet types, vests and weapon upgrades which are great and this time you strike enemy forces so that means you get lots of chances to ambush enemy pods, there are dark events which slows your progress and buffs enemy or AVATAR project, you should know that you're race against time because AVATAR project cannot be stopped, you can only make it delay. Mimic beacons are nice to draw attention, forcing enemies to come towards you, finally they removed spastic Floaters off and replaced them with Archons which is my favourite alien, not just Floaters even Sectoids has changed, only alien you'll be seeing in XCOM:2 is the Elders but even they have changed apperience. Gameplay is quick, but you probably want to play again maybe on a harder difficulty, after experiencing and knowing all things you may install a mod, there are lots of great mods and developers do support them like Long War 2 and mods numbers are increasing every day.So if you're looking for a tactical challenge you might consider buying XCOM 2.

												Either everyone I know is astronomically unlucky or the game doesn't display odds correctly.Even if this game had odds relative to their display, it's still a wretched game. Extremely poor optimization, kamikaze AI, tacticless combat, unfair rookie/squaddie balancing for early game, AND less content with lower quality than their previous game. The story is laughable, considering Firaxis claimed to have a large focus on the story. All of the characters are very unlikeable, all talking over eachother with exhausting dialogues that have no relevance to anything. I'm guessing they'll also take the easy way out AGAIN and imply XCOM 2 was a string of failed missions to pamper their creative director's asses so they can reshah XCOM AGAIN and make another sequel.Look, I've never claimed to be lucky, but when you've pumped 55 hrs into a game, flawless it on commander, and literally lose the first three missions 50+ times on Legendary, I would consider someone mentally unstable if they DIDN'T despise this game.

												Very good game overall and the tactical battle is better than the first game. The base building and map is ok but depends on player's taste. You will get attached to your soldiers and you will most definitely enjoy this game. Also, you might break a keyboard or two as the game is challenging and sometimes even feels cheating.3 major problems in my opinion:1. The exclusive support for steam controller and NONE else.2. The most glaring problem for me is the god damn probability system. WTF is going on with the numbers? You will miss most of your 70-90% shots. It almost seems like EVERY shot is a 50-50 situation. The chances are either broken or they are not communicated cleary to the player. 3. Major performance issues although graphics don't look that demanding.			"

Sadly the majority of missions being timed in some way, graphical bugs, and lock ups make me regret my pre-order. Lesson learned I suppose. The timed missions may not bother others and that is fine. I expect something different in my tactical turn based games. It would have influenced my purchase if I had known. I know I can mod them out but when I pay full price for a game I expect it to be an enjoyable experience out of the box. Obviously other people are having fun with the game so if you buy it I hope you are one of them.			"

												XCOM2 is just extremly unfriendly to new player, even I am an XCOM EU/EW player before but it didn't help at all for me to play this game. I am just so frustrated  for some of the enemy types introduced in this game, namely the stunlancer and viper. Viper can grab you pretty much anywhere on your screen, though the grab fail rate is like 50/50， it can put you in really bad position when your other teammates are far away from the viper. And don't forget they can grab you through the wall and sunlancer and stun you through the war but your ranger cannot do the same by slash through the war. How fair is that!  "

												Don't be fooled by the thumbs up - it should have a million asterisks next to it.While XCOM 2 is a definitive improvement compared to its predecessor in Gameplay, Audio/Visuals and Story, this game is very finnicky with AMD hardware and has the weirdest issues on that and some slower Intel CPU computers: explosion audio/visuals happen earlier than they should or are completely de-synchronized, model pop-in, texture pop-in, delays in output on very odd occasions, shots that appear to hit actually miss... None of these actually affect gameplay (especially since this is a turn-based game), but it is detrimental to the experience overall and inexcusable in this time and day - using Unreal 4, no less!Low-end/AMD owners, use extreme caution and make sure you're actually willing to pay for a game that WORKS and is REALLY FUN, but LOOKS broken as hell.the amd meme is real			"

												Excellent successor to excellent game.  Warning: worst optimized game in history of computer games? CPU and GPU temperatures are up to around the same as while doing benchmarks, even on main menu with 60 fps locked and settings lowered (how is that even supposed to be possible? did they do that on purpose?)So be sure your computer cooling is not lacking.  Edit: it seems that high temperature with GPU only happens when ALT-tabbing to windows, just played couple hours without ALT-tabbing and max temp was only 49℃ (previous record was 75℃).CPU temp was still high but at least that problem is partially solved.

												The game is good (I guess) but the experience is just killed by critical technical issues. I played for about 20-25 minutes and honestly it was unpleasant. The game was released for 6 months and still there are a lot of bugs. After 25 minutes or so the game crashed. While I was playing I had 4 freezes which longs for about 30-40 sec each (no jokes, I've never encountered such *** before in my life). I mean, in the past I could play 640x480 Oblivion on Radeon 9600 essentially with graphics turned off with average 20 FPS and 2-5 FPS while you're looking it the direction of stables of Imperial City (no probs -- just look in other direction), but here 60 FPS suddenly becoming 0.03 FPS. It's not just annoying, it makes game unplayable. Maybe it will be fixed -- who knows? BTW, I'm playing on Linux, maybe Windows version is more ok. It's the first game on the Unreal Engine for me with such troubles, I feel bad for Epic Games this game is so un-adverty for their technology:)			"

												Either everyone I know is astronomically unlucky or the game doesn't display odds correctly.Even if this game had odds relative to their display, it's still a wretched game. Extremely poor optimization, kamikaze AI, tacticless combat, unfair rookie/squaddie balancing for early game, AND less content with lower quality than their previous game. The story is laughable, considering Firaxis claimed to have a large focus on the story. All of the characters are very unlikeable, all talking over eachother with exhausting dialogues that have no relevance to anything. I'm guessing they'll also take the easy way out AGAIN and imply XCOM 2 was a string of failed missions to pamper their creative director's asses so they can reshah XCOM AGAIN and make another sequel.Look, I've never claimed to be lucky, but when you've pumped 55 hrs into a game, flawless it on commander, and literally lose the first three missions 50+ times on Legendary, I would consider someone mentally unstable if they DIDN'T despise this game.

												Very good game overall and the tactical battle is better than the first game. The base building and map is ok but depends on player's taste. You will get attached to your soldiers and you will most definitely enjoy this game. Also, you might break a keyboard or two as the game is challenging and sometimes even feels cheating.3 major problems in my opinion:1. The exclusive support for steam controller and NONE else.2. The most glaring problem for me is the god damn probability system. WTF is going on with the numbers? You will miss most of your 70-90% shots. It almost seems like EVERY shot is a 50-50 situation. The chances are either broken or they are not communicated cleary to the player. 3. Major performance issues although graphics don't look that demanding.			"

												The frequency and repitition of timed missions really detracts from the game. It forces you to play only one way and throw strategy to the wind.  Many missions are only beatable if you flat out run to the objective.  They tried to turn XCOM into a Call Of Duty action game by forcing you to be on the move constantly and disregard mission planning.			"

												My playtime is miniscule right now but let me give my piece  on it anyway. The game itself first and foremost caters to the XCOM: Enemy Within fan, it not only refines the mechanics seen in the previous games but it added new ones as well. The classes are distinct from one another and gives you the player greater tactical choice in your gameplay. But by far the best new item added is the concealment option which pretty much means that your team is invisible to all enemies until they are either detected via patrol or more often than not via an ambush you have setup. The story and atmosphere from what I have seen in sublime, the game pulls in no stops from telling you that you lost the previous war and that right now, XCOM are considered terrorists, this is a huge step up both thematically and mechanically as well since the aforementioned concealment mechanic makes so much sense. The mods will also bring in so much life to this game, as of writing this, there are 3 main mods that can easily be added to the game via Steam Workshop.If I have one gripe I would point to the performance, it's not gamebreaking but it is a hassle and it is obvious, I struggle to get a smooth 60FPS with many of the filters turned off, I run an I5 3570K with a GTX680, not the top of the line setup admittedly but it should have handled the game better than it did.

												In my humble opinion, I believe that Xcom 2 is one of the greatest Strategy games of the last 10 years, and surpasses its predecessor in scale, ambition, story and player emotion and connection.Without the DLCs, the base game is packed full of content and the content that you want and expect from an Xcom game as set by Xcom: Enemy Unknown.The DLC is somewhat lacking to Enemy Within, but it is still very accurate to Xcom 2, and very enjoyable. I would recommend playing through with no DLC first, and then doing a 2nd run wit all DLC enable.This was my top game of 2016, and probably my 5th favourite game of all time.			"

												So far an excellent successor to the X-COM series, and has learned a great deal from the previous itteration. The procedural maps are a godsend, and the new overworld map is a lot more fun/interesting to be involved in. The game is much more difficult in some areas, but much easier in others. Early on, there is a huge amount of instant-death for your squad, and that's not a bad thing.Currently there needs to be some optimization for graphics performance. There are a lot of visual problems for the title.And for those crying about ""every mission having timers"", this is a huge hyperbole. Huge. Half, if that, have very long and easily-worked-with timers if you don't slowly overwatch crawl to your objectives. Try actual tactics, and cycling through your soldiers mid-actions to orchestrate a kill, rather than waiting for the enemy to stumble on your 5+ overwatch snipers.			"

												Pretty good! Worthwhile sequel. Addresses virtually every criticism of the last one. Handful of issues though:- Performance is all over the place! Seems like lots of developers have added so many postprocessing effects to UE3 over the years that it's getting difficult to optimize well... and using a wrapper rather than doing OpenGL builds for OSX and Linux doesn't help. There's also hilarious bugs like the game thinking 12 PM is midnight and 12 AM is noon as far as your savefiles are concerned -- of course, _only_ C++ doesn't have a standard library to handle this for you, but that does suggest a minor lack of polish.- The base-building optimization puzzle is a little too solvable, but it's the sort of thing you'll inevitably get wrong the first time through. This carries through to a lot of the game's design, where you seem to be encouraged to savescum or fail on your first time through, with neither option being particularly satisfying. There's no reason this game couldn't have borrowed Invisible Inc's autosaving-with-a-fixed-number-of-rewinds mechanic as an alternative to Ironman mode, and it'd have been better for it.- Late game has a bit of Civ syndrome where once you've seen all of the tech it's a bit of a slog to push through to the very end.- Narrative comes on too strong at the start with all of the military stuff and the power fantasy of repeatedly addressing the player as ""commander,"" though the mid-game scripted events are well-handled.- The starting swords are ridiculously anachronistic.This is already a good game, but I expect it will be much, much better in a year. It's probably fair to be frustrated by that in the meantime.			"

												So you have come to this page pondering if XCOM 2 is the game for you...If youre the type that tends to yell at your computer, dont buy it, unless you plan to drink gallons of stress relief teas and buy a 20 pack of pencils at the dollar store for the sole purpose of breaking them in half when your squad just got wiped out again all odds again.If you thought XCOM (+EU) was hard, definately DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you like a Dark Souls like challange, then go for it.While in XCOM you had to deal with thin men and sectoids that were one hit obstacles in XCOM, and you could develop advanced weaponry before enemys got too hard XCOM 2 doesn't give you a break like that. the sectoids have 8 hitpoints and can eventually mind control your units starting from mission one, aside from their other abilities.The plus side is, you too have some additional tricks up your sleeve, and especially the snipers and specialists are now more useful from the start while they felt like dead weight up to a point in old XCOM.Now you also have the ""Avatar Project"" instead of the ""Doom Tracker"" a mechanic that personally annoys me a lot more than the old one, where you felt generally more like it's related to your performance, while the Avatar thing just basically counts up constantly and you have to chip off some progress by doing certain things, which feels a lot more annoying in my opinion, especially because it feels odd with the story. The resistance has done resistancy things for 20 years while you were in a statis pod, and now all the the rush? Youre ""Mr. Save The World"" and are going to build a global resistance... I am sure there are more visceral ways to keep you on edge. Maybe its just me being reminded about work a lot when I see deadlines everywhere in the games.Oh yes another point, deadlines and racing around the clock in most missions, either for loot, mission objectives, the avatar project, enemy reinforcements...Another annoying part is the ""Shaken"" mechanic, while reversable contrary to the old ""critically injured"" it has one mayor flaw: You wont be told until the mission is over, so you cant reload and try again. And to get rid of it your twitchy Will=0, read: Every Psy ability will get them, and they will panic all the time, they need to kill an alien without being injured themselves...But aside from being really hard and often unfair and Deadline heavy, its a good game that really does a good job when it comes to the immersion part. You really feel like youre in charge of this ragtag band of resistance fighters, that you can customize to look like a bad♥♥♥♥♥version of your playground buddy or coworker.Would I recommend it? Yes, definately. Would I recommend to get a stress relief squishy ball along with the game purchase? YES DEFINATELY! *squeezes squishy ball and drinks some salvia tea* "

												Sheer brilliance.   This is the most accomplished version of the XCOM series yet. Some of the confusing game mechanics from the previous XCOM have been addressed. The DLC is nice enough, but it's a bit limited in scope and therefore not the greatest value for money.  The game had (past tense) some technical and gamplay glitches at first, most of those are gone and now only rear their head occasionally, which can  be annoying, but nothing insurmountable.  There's been many complaints about the performance - those issues are in the past. I play this on a 6 year old CPU (a i7-860 from 2009), paired with a GTX 660, it's very playable at 1080p if you tweak the graphics settings just right. Moving to a GTX 1060 (oc'd) gameplay is smooth with maxed out graphics setting at 1920x1200. Overall, a AAA title that delivers, with long-term replayability baked in.  I'm pretty sure I'll be playing this until XCOM 3 comes out.			"

												I suck.I am the worst commander ever.Aliens kicking my butt.And I like it.Edit1:As I'm a bit into the game now and people are complaining a lot about timers, I can say a bit about that:I played some XCOM EW but it never caught me to keep playing through it to the end, so I'm far away from being an expert. The game isn't easy, but the turn timers aren't horrible. For now I'm playing on the second easiest option and that gives me an okay challenge for learning without getting frustrating. I quite often restart missions because I just did some horrible mistakes and try again. But so far I never failed because of timers or anything, on most missions there is time to fight properly and after taking out the enemies still reach the target.Same with the avatar timer, at first it goes up and up, but at some point you get a grip on it. I had it go up to two blocks left while preparing myself for the missions and building infrastructure, but then I felt prepared and reduced it again. Some objectives take it down by three, so now I feel a bit more in control. I'm not done yet, so I might be wrong of course.			"

												Getting my a**e handed to me on ironman....more please....ive played all the x-com games, even back in the day on an old DX-66 rig and i love the direction the game is currently taking i.e the 2 move system i think is way better than the old time units one...now if you will excuse me Sgt. Blain Cooper from Predator must continue to lead his squad into certain death :)Well after the whole weekend on X-Com 2 i have experienced many of the tweeks to the game, loving the fact you can add more weapon attachments like laser sights, extended mags etc. very extensive custom look options, the general progress through the game is much improved from the first, more enemy variants and yes it could do with an optimization patch though my aging i-5 is coping ok with some of the fluff turned off.Me personally im only finding frame rate drops on the squad up screen and base building bit, missions run fine with a few bugs i.e some of the soldier skills dont seem to work properly on the odd occasion, its apparent the game needs patching, it seems to be the trend with most releases these days. If theres one thing ive learnt in my 25 years of PC gaming, its keep your rig optimized though this is no excuse for poor programming. Im enjoying the game experience so far but i am a hardcore fan of the series and dont mind the timed missions as i revel the challenge.Great game with a few creases that need ironing out, i tend to buy games now on pre order if there under 20 quid or wait till sales or GOTY editions as like many im not paying top dollar anymore cause you never know what your getting these daysI do recommend a can of man the F**k Up if you want to play this game though lol			"

												Let me start by saying XCOM 2 is a triumph. XCOM EU and EW paid homage to UFO Defence's difficulty and fear factor by making sure the game was truly difficult, but in a mostly rewarding way. In some ways they compromised on those principles - having your best squad wiped a few weeks in and losing a critical mission was basically game over, so half the time losses felt frustrating rather than just punishing and reinvigorating. In my first XCOM 2 run, that I consider to have gone fairly well, I've lost upwards of 10 soldiers in a few months, and I failed my first attempt at a blacksite, but I can tell I'm that I'm not doomed. Notably, in EU, there were a lot of safety net abilities like Run and Gun, Rockets and various Sniper abilities like Double Tap though that made the game at times laughably easy - so long as you had restraint. XCOM 2's biggest change to the formula, outside of the total revamp of the strategic layer,  is the fact that there are almost no safety nets in the early game. Rockets are gone, replaced with grenade launchers, which while incredibly useful, cannot wipe out a pod of enemies in one shot every mission.  The new Ranger class, which is basically like the old Assault, doesn't get Run and Gun until midway through the ability tree. The sword they get has effectively enormous range, but can't be relied upon to singlehandedly kill enemies unless you get bladesman at corporal rank, which loses you an extremely useful concealment abiility.  Specialists are about as underwhelming as supports were early on, but get just as deadly in later ranks, while Sharp Shooters are heavily situational due to the fact that a lot of missions are timed, but can now do some very interesting stunts like fire off pistols a couple times a round at different targets, or chain sniper rifle shots together if each one is a kill. The fact the aliens are now more specialised, and their gimmicks are more frightening (e.g, the basic sectoid gets the mind control ability in the first few months)  means that without safety nets, they're far more fearsome and worth being worried about. This makes the game more difficult obviously, but also more enjoyable in the long run once you know how to handle each type of enemy - Sectoids are easily killed by swords, Stunlancers either need to die ASAP or you need a flashbang/overwatch to shut them down from charging. The Faceless, meanwhile, needs to be spotted well in advance of triggering it, because it can attack on activation.  The variation in alien types and the threat they present means that XCOM 2 encourages a lot more tactical, outside the box thinking. The visuals in this game are incredible. The unit design for the aliens and advent hybrids is superb, and really adds to the intimidation when they're breathing down your neck. The environmental design is also great - the procedural generation is by no means a half baked gimmick and makes every area look interesting and refreshing.  There are cobbled together outposts, futuristic cities, slums, surreal alien bases and facilities.  Customisation is top notch - there is as a lot of freedom and oppurtunity for making your own narrative in your head, and in general things that make your troops more memorable, like random extra abilities, the memorial/bar and personnel areas you can view all add to the attachment you get to them. I want to quickly mention the multiplayer. This is a mixed bag - the extremely points heavy advent robot units are extremely hard to kill and can one-shot most targets. The Sectopod, ludicrously, can even fire twice, doing 10-11 damage each time.  The costs on units are very weird, as is some of the internal balance. Advent Troopers at 200 points have 3 health and a mag rifle, but for 400 points you get an Officer with 12 health, better stats, a frag grenade and the ability to mark targets. Since matches total about 7500+ points, you can easily fit these guys in.  There is an issue with stuttering as well which I'll touch upon in a moment.In terms of technical quality, you can tell that the developers didn't put their effort towards making a game that was very free of bugs, or that ran extremely well. The game is stable - the amount of disruptive bugs that will ruin your experience or progress is very, very minimal and rare it seems. The problems arise with the fact that XCOM 2 just simply doesn't run as well as it should on high end PCs- there are frequent FPS drops in missions unless you turn some settings down.  This obvously doesn't matter that much, since the game is turn based, but it is irritating. Perhaps the most annoying bug is the fact that the game occassionally takes a few seconds to register a buff/debuff/critical effect, or upwards of 10-20 seconds to end a turn in multiplayer and pass control to the other player. This is something that is bound to be fixed eventually though. I whole-heartedly reccomend XCOM 2 to anyone who was a fan of XCOM EU, and would also say that anyone who has an interest in a challenging and interesting game but has not tried the games before this one should give it a go at least.

												Sheer brilliance.   This is the most accomplished version of the XCOM series yet. Some of the confusing game mechanics from the previous XCOM have been addressed. The DLC is nice enough, but it's a bit limited in scope and therefore not the greatest value for money.  The game had (past tense) some technical and gamplay glitches at first, most of those are gone and now only rear their head occasionally, which can  be annoying, but nothing insurmountable.  There's been many complaints about the performance - those issues are in the past. I play this on a 6 year old CPU (a i7-860 from 2009), paired with a GTX 660, it's very playable at 1080p if you tweak the graphics settings just right. Moving to a GTX 1060 (oc'd) gameplay is smooth with maxed out graphics setting at 1920x1200. Overall, a AAA title that delivers, with long-term replayability baked in.  I'm pretty sure I'll be playing this until XCOM 3 comes out.			"

The AI is cheap and on the campaign map the avatar project points are usually in areas you can't even reach at the beginning of the game you've given a load of options to take, but only end up with time for maybe a quarter of them and are constantly interupted while trying to scan nodes, leading to your operatives being constantly outmatched. I get you're supposed to be on the back foot with this one, but for every step forward you make, the aliens take 2 more.			"

												70% rating? Come on, this game is fantastic. I've played 10 hours of this game so far, and I haven't enjoyed a game so much in this way since, well, XCOM EU.Let me explain what I mean: This game is terrifying. Every single mission is down to the wire. Every mission can and will go wrong. And the whole time, I'm sitting there thinking, ""Don't miss don't miss don't miss Oh ****""And that's great. Seriously. That's awesome, and that's where XCOM shines. Risk/reward is a huge part of what makes the experience as satisfying or compelling as it is.So if someone complains that the game is too hard, they're missing the point. I mean, jeez guys. We're liberating the human race from technologically superior aliens. Why did you expect it to be easy?Anyways, half the fun of XCOM is when everything goes to hell and yet, somehow, you scrape together a victory.Disclaimer: this game is harder than EU. Yeah, seriously. And so if you're considering getting this game, don't expect it to be a walk in the park. It's war. But it's incredible.			"

												Yeah, there are some crashes and bugs. Welcome to computers. So far I haven't run into anything that can't be solved by restarting the game.The mission timers take some adjustment and I've had to restart a few missions, but hey, new game new challenges. Figuring out how to use my team's abilities on the go has been fun - the same cautious tactics in every mission dominated in XCOM EU and now that's not optimal, thank god.The strategic layer creates a great sense of urgency and a real challenge to balance different research and development goals against maintaining your network and expanding to stop the alien plans before it's too late. If I lose, it won't be because my squad got killed and I didn't bother reloading; instead it will be because I didn't push fast enough to stop the alien master plan. Again, I like that caution is not rewarded: if I take forever building up my tech, the aliens will complete their doomsday project, The End.			"

												Incredibly tough, even on just ""Veteran"" setting. Much more like classic XCOM in that you'll be churning through legions of rookies. Contrast this to XCOM:EU/EW, where the loss of anybody during a mission feels like preventable odds--in XCOM2, some missions will leave you thanking RNGesus you managed to evac with anybody.Note that the guerrilla themes apply beyond just the aesthetics. A lot of missions will be on tight timer limits, forcing you to scramble. Fighters will also be affected by PTSD, and Will reductions are more frequent than the previous installment. They're hammering home the fact that you're making do with civilian volunteers, rather than trained pros, but this adherence to thematic cohesion does often come across as a gameplay burden.Finally, in terms of performance: until Firaxis provides an optimization patch, expect a lot of lag. Turning off anti-aliasing can help, as does canceling cinematics, but there's going to be a lot of unavoidable stall-outs as the game processes combat results. Once spent a solid minute waiting for a single grenade result to register--between the odd angles, the burn damage, and everything else, the enemy unit ultimately clipped through a wall. Weird.Past the optimization problem, the game is very pretty, very deep, and VERY fun. I trust Firaxis to do what they need to do to make it shine. In the meantime, there's bug-eyed alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to gun down.Good hunting, Commander.			"

												I waited till i finished the game before i wrote this review.When i had finished EU back in early 2013, i remember i craved for morecontent. And i got EW later that year, which was a good addon, and madethe original EU what is was suppose to be from the start.I was fairly addicted to EU, i simply could not put the game away. Andafter i finished EW, all i wanted for the next XCOM was more of everything.I wanted more content, more variation, more aliens, more story, bettergraphics, more customizations. More everything.And here we are finally. And Firaxis listened to the fans,What they have delivered is exactly what i wished for. A long detailedgame with a fantastic story, great music, great voice acting, awesomemaps... In short.. It has delivered everything!There are some dissapointments though, the game obviously havesome optimization issues at launch, i managed to fix those thoughby tweaking some settings, but others seem to not be able to playat all.The game also have some bugs here and there, but i never ran intogame breaking bugs.I finished the game in about 60 hours, I could have ended it earlierbut i decided to finish my PSI soldiers before i assaulted the lastfacilities. And the very last map was a blast, a map that took mealmost 2 hours to complete, with enemies off every sort in largequantities. Damn that was a fun ending.So what Firaxis has delivered is another great game, and this onecomes damn close to being a masterpiece. Some of the bugs areirritating, and brings the experience down a little bit. But as itstands, it is a great game with 50+ hours of fun.9/10 - Very good			"

												I want to like this game, I really do. I loved the ""first"" one. I played through the BS once when it first came out, and recently thought to myself, now that the dlc is out and they've had time to fix issues lets give it another go. But somehow its even worse off then before.What I'm talking about is performance and the regular crashes and freezes. The game just kinda skips along. Anytime anything happens on screen, any loading occurs, the frame rate is just.. disgusting. It drives me crazy, and nothing I do fixes the issue. I've dropped to the lowest settings, messed with every graphics option I could and am seeing the same issue. Do the drops in frame rate impact your ability to play? No, not really, its turn based after all. But it takes me right out of the game, makes me lose my train of thought and in a game where planing is key? that's very much an issue.And the freezing... I didn't have an issue with this the first time I played, but this time.. I just started this new game, not very far into it. I've already lost count of how many times I've had the game crash, even more so it's just frozen. Audio keeps playing fine but I can't do anything else. After a while it seems to have corrupted my save somehow. Eveytime I try to fire on an enemy the game just freezes, Bye bye my first iron man run.I looked past these problems at first and thought to give them time to fix things, sometimes unexpected issues pop up. It happens. But after all the DLC and 6 months? Not only are they not fixed but things have gotten worse.All I can really say is they took a great remake, a potential new life for an old series, and ruined it. Ruined it with garbage coding and worse still, ignoring the community's complaints.As it is, I cannot recommend this game. If they ever take the effort to actually fix this mess then I would absolutely love it. For when it dose work it's just fantastic fun. Unfortunately the fun is continually interrupted.			"

												This game is just dice rolls with fixed dice, in the favor of the enemies. No matter how cautious you move or how good your cover is,you will always get shot, and half the time the enemies get crits while you always miss. People saying that ""Oh, well it's a hard game so you have to get good, it's a fight against a way stronger force blah blah blah"" No, there is a difference between difficulty and unfairness. Dark Souls, that's a notoriously difficult game that is balanced beautifully and feels rewarding and satisfying when you win, this game feels like you are constantly losing, and not in a fair way. You get a 70% chance to hit but always miss, enemies get crits on half of their shots, Sectoids with mind control are in the second mission. That isn't fun, it's just obnoxious. You can tell the devs are absolute garbage because people had to come in after the fact and fix major flaws of the game through mods on the workshop. This game is terrible, especially when comparing it to Enemy Unknown. Oh and lets not forget the ever present time limits. 4/10			"

												Definitely a step in the right direction for the XCOM series and certainly a very fun one.  If you enjoyed the first one then you will like this one even more, but I can understand where the negative reviews are coming from.  There are certian elements that are simply copied from XCOM with seemingly no attention given to them (e.g., the indoor camera; many of the human animations; a lot of the sound effects) and while these are on the whole a series of minor elements, altogether it does put a tarnish on what is otherwise a great game.  TLDR; fantastic game to jump into XCOM with; great game but a tad lazy in some areas for those coming back for round two.			"

I really wanted to enjoy  XCom 2.After numerous tweaks and mods to elminate some of the more bothersome elements of this game; too many timers, nonsensical hit rates, constant interuptions from tasks, I still cannot finish a campaign before the game breaks and wrecks my PC with the RSOD.Honestly there is no excuse for a AAA game being this unstable. It is near Bethesda level of glitches and bugginess, but the hard crashes are beyond fustrating.As it stands, I can't reccomend XCOM 2 at this time. It's still an 8/10 game, but for gods sake don't spend $60 on this until this is fixed. I'll glady change my reccomendation once the issues are fixed, but for now, hold off.

												Pros:+Extremely detailed character and weapon models+Tactics are mixed up from XCOM 1 as now you can start out as the people hiding and the aliens are the ones defending+Improvements to the Geoscape and strategy within it as now you can choose different regions to expand to+Very detailed character customization and mods adding more and more each day+Cool new gadgets availible for research as well as ""experimental"" research. This can grant random armors, ammo, grenades, or utilities which is really neatCons:-Extremely obnoxious turn limit timers that sometimes make no sense. On one VIP mission I had 8 turns to get the hostage and leave, and there were about 15 aliens in the way to the exit and it also made no sense that the timer started ticking down before I was even discovered. I'm all for added dificulty, but not at the expense of reason, because there is no reason at all of why you would be limited in turns when the aliens already found you and reinforcements already arrived. You should be able to maybe fight off a huge invasion if you take too long, it shouldn't just end and not give you a chance.(There are mods to fix this problem however, as they increase turns)-On top of these turn timers, the Avatar project is constantly ticking away as well, though I haven't looked to see if there is a mod to slow it down, I am sure there is or will be one.Overall: 9.5/10 - Improved every aspect from XCOM 1 and there is in depth character customization for your characters that will probably be killed in a few turns.

												I thought the first game was great and I tried to like this second one but I can't get into the ""limited turns"" mission. I don't mind limited turns, for example the meld in the first game felt like I was rewarded for getting to the meld in time and losing out if I didnt, it was fair play but unfortunately in XCOM 2 the limit turn missions are most of the mission types and you will lose the mission if you dont achieve the objective in (usually) 8 turns.  I think in this case the limited turns take away too many options (and enjoyment) from the player and introduces frustration. In the end I became so frustrated with these missions and questioned why I was even bothering. I cant recommend XCOM 2, not even in a sale. Buying the game cheaper wont make it any less frustrating.			"

												Frustrating, repetitive, and tedious in the extreme.   I absolutely cannot recommend it unless it is very deeply discounted.1.  The developers need to learn some basic statistics.  When you are firing a weapon or hacking a terminal you are given a percentage chance that is always FAR higher than are the actual odds of success.  For example, I just did a trial (over several hours) of hacking a terminal where the odds were listed as 10% chance of success.  In 100 tries there were no successes (and each time it generated a different progress bar so it is not an issue of the outcome having been predetermined).  The odds of this is almost 1 in 38,000.  Why show the percent chance of success if it is so radically far off?2.  Too many times where enemies suddenly appear out of no where and shoot you through 4 walls and kill you.  Their shots almost never miss while yours usually do.			"

Even now, long after release. I cant recommend this to anyone, even the diehard fans of the previous game.			"

												""Xcom 2 is like that pretty girl in the bar who looks like a girl you really got on with but only hotter. Your thinking, shes fitter, and she must have the same personality. But does she ♥♥♥♥. Shes out for your Wallet and will leave you falling asleep after 15 minautes of ♥♥♥♥ all foreplay and playing dead the whole time""""Xcom2 in my opinion, A Horrendous♥♥♥♥♥♥Picking♥♥♥♥♥Receptical.""===========================================I recently mustered the courage to purchase this game despite cringing for my beloved yet light wallet. Ussually my purchases are very selective but I decided, having played Xcom 1 and adored many of the previous in the genre, this was a safe purchase. How wrong was I.My consensus playing this game leaves me lacking ANY form of excitement, I literally have to force myself to play it, let me break it down:Storyline: The story has completely failed to drag me in. Set in a world already conquered by aliens, It fails to establish any kind of emotional or empathetic connection with 'any' of the storyline characters and yourself. With no lack of attempts to drag you in, It just feels like they've attempted a mass effect/dragon ageish approach but completely ♥♥♥♥ed it up purely with a♥♥♥♥♥♥back story, no user customization/decisions making it linear and a one trick pony, then theres realism, your sat there thinking how the ♥♥♥♥ did all this happen, with little believable reason as to why. This theme that world has already been conquered and colonized leaves me feeling there is already no hope and humanity is ♥♥♥♥ed. Despite the fact there are already multiple Xcom storys flying from previous genres, they've reinvented the wheel yet spectacularly managed to make it the same as every title before. ""get base, kill aliens, save the world"" except in the EXACT SAME WAY AS ALL PREVIOUS TITLES. Jees, atleast have some forks in the road. -1Realism: None, there isnt any, the story is unrealistic, the setting, the tech, I know its a sci fi, but you need some realism factor in order for people to relate, and get pulled in. -1 Combat: Whilst vastly the same as previous Xcoms, has features implemented which frustrate my gameplay. UI has been reduced 'even more' like I didnt think that was possible before, with even less information on display allowing you to interpret the battlefield leaving you frustrated when your tactical decisions fail due to gameplay mechanics you simply werent aware of. The camera is god damned awful, with constant custscenes skipping in and increasing your wait time when all you really want to do is survey the battlefield, sure you can turn it off, but half of them still go on. Oh yeah surveying the battlefield, your camera is zoomed in only allowing you to see a short distance in your vicinity, to see further you have to mouse out, which gives what I'd consider a ""normal"" battlefield viewing distance, but once you release, it goes back to the previous camera. How the hell your supposed to think ahead tactically on this ""middle mouse and remember"" ethos is beyond me. It feels like this game has been dumbed down for console. Heavy modding will most definately be needed. -1Gameplay: The first couple of hours in this game, I felt like I had little or no influence over what was happening. No choices, just following a merry go round of ""click OK to do this"". It reminds me of a Web Based Strat where you spend weeks doing this♥♥♥♥♥♥only to get bored out of your ♥♥♥♥ing brain. The only choice I have are to click ""ignore"" then recieve a warning saying ""♥♥♥♥♥♥YOU BETTER DO THIS OR HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE"" and you feel like you'll miss something and succumb to fear mongering. -1Difficulty: The AI is a challenge, and the amount of options available to you in combat do present tactical freedom leaving you hanging on the edge of your seat. Gone are the ""guy 1 shoots misses, guy 2 shoots, misses, guy 3 shoots misses"". +1Graphics: Yeah great, but since when did looking at a nice picture captivate me for 60+ hours... That said, it feels like playing a frigging cartoon. Im giving it a +1 because it is beautiful in places, but its also getting a -1 because I think thats the reason im not dragged into this game, Its a fecking cartoon! +1 -1Experience: Whilst I enjoyed Xcom 1, it was already dumbed down as it was, and it was bearable, even fun, this didnt need to be dumbed down anymore. It needed more UI not less. More tactical options, not less. More User decision making not less. More Customization.... not... less..Conclusion: I really dont care for this game, its crap. Its a Cartoon graphicy console port.My Score: negs -5pos +2Overall, -3 Leaving Xcom2 in my opinion, A Horrendous♥♥♥♥♥♥Picking♥♥♥♥♥Receptical.			"

												XCOM no longer as government paramilitary organisation and instead being terrorist organisation fighting with government? That isn't same good 'ol XCOM - these were my thoughts when I first heard about changes made to the game. But when it was part of February 2017 humble monthly bundle, hell, why not? Turned out better than expected. This is a sequel to 2012s XCOM: Enemy Unknown. No matter what was outcome of the game, you have lost. World as you know it is gone. XCOM was dissolved and delegalised.20 years have passed. World's governments have been replaced by alien controled ADVENT Coalition. XCOM barely exists, Doctor Vahlen is missing, Doctor Shen is dead, Central Officer Bradford is alcoholic and depressed, whole resistance against alien rule is not coordinated, and former XCOM Commander is missing. All XCOM has is captured alien Aircraft as a base and few soldiers. That is, before resistance got a lead on Commanders whereabouts. Thats where you come in. You free yourself and take command over resistance. In gameplay, there are tiny changes, rendering this good 'ol XCOM. Turns out that shadowy Council member is still alive, so you have monthly ratings, you get money... i meant, supplies as they are known here every month as drops from the Resistance, there are heads of engineering (Lily Shen, daughter of late Dr. Shen) and scientific team (Dr. Tygan who used to work as a scientist for ADVENT), there are similar missions, for example Terror missions with saving civilians (here these are Retaliation missions, ADVENT attacking resistance safehouses). There are also changes, obviously. Enemies are similar to ones encountered. Government forces are mostly composed of human-like ADVENT Troops, Officers and so on. That means it will take a while untill you meet aliens. After 20 years, old alien types were enchanced using human genes, making them look slightly different than before, and have some new abilities. Some alien types are gone, other totally reworked, eg.: since aliens are now in charge, there is no need for infltration units, so Thin Men are only seen in retrospections. That being said, I wouldn't like to spoil the fun of meeting old enemies on the battlefield, so I will be quiet. Sadly, there is no option to capture alien specimens alive which I kinda miss. Soldiers can have one of 5 classes (4 regulars and Psionical unit): Ranger, equipped with words alongside with regular firearms, Specialists with their drones, hacking everything they can, Grenadiers with heavy weapons and sometimes useful snipers. In comparison to the old game, you have much more customisation options available, which is nice. Furthermore, on the missions enemy units can drop soldier enchancing items and weapon parts that can be given to soldiers. Very nice idea if you ask me. By the way, problem with attachments staying on old weapons after upgrading them has been solved: all if you unlock upgrade to the weapon, all weapons are upgraded, and modified guns stay modified. Engeenering and scientific research were slightly changed too. You have regular research and item building, but there are sidekicks: Shadow Chamber is one of the facilites available to build, and in it few of the research projects are conducted. Why make them there instead of lab, I have no idea (they definitely could, since SC researches stop regular ones). Similar problem exist with Item building and Proving Grounds facility for engineering. Two options with very similar results. One of the most altered parts of the game in my opinion is Geoscape. There are no countries that are funding XCOMs existence. Instead, you increase your income by making contact with resistance cells (there are total 16 of them) and building Radio relays to further increase your monthly income. Having contacted all cells on the continent and placing required amount of radio relays unlock bonuses, similar to ones gained on Enemy Unknown at the choice of base location: Experimental items finished instantly, weapons having more slots for parts ect. You can spend your time by collectiong random bonuses that appear on the map (require scanning over their location for set amount of days; you can get scientists, engineers, soldiers, supplies, allien alloys, elerium crytal or intel), destroying Avatar Project facilities (oh, yeah, since you cant lose countries funding, there is something different to make you try harder: AVATAR Project, for completion of which aliens need to finish Dark Events [they have additional effects like additional Chyssalid on each mission ect] and build research facilities. You can counter one event every month and decrease Avatar Project progress by destroying facilites and completing story missions). Also, to be able  sell your good, you need to find and unlock black market, and fly to in to trade. Okay, nothing is perfect. This principle also applies to this game. Most missions to counter Dark Events have timers: 8-12 turns to complete. Then you get 2-3 stong enemies on your way to the evac and it gets hard pretty fast. Some missions are unfair: had to defend relay from enemies, spawned on the other side of the map, while there was Gatekeeper (something like upgraded Cyberdisc from EU) spawned next to the relay. In 4 turns relay was gone. I had no chance to make it. Then there is Bradford and his notifications: useful at the beginning, but boring and annoying later in game (Commander, enemies scrambled interceptors, Firebrand wont be able to stay long, we need to hurry. I mean, i can see the remaining turns timer, no need for something like that). Proper Snipers are rarely fully used, since most of the missions require you to rush through the street with a VIP (Friendly or enemy) and escape, leaving no place for proper sniper usage, while their second skill tree focusing on pistols feels a bit too weak. Sure you can mix them but Jack of All Trades, Master of None, right? To be really honest, degree to which I enjoyed XCOM2 suprised me, given my lack of huge hopes regarding changes. Story works out, speeches of ADVENT Spokesman are amazing and these disadvantages dont break the enjoyment from the game. So if you enjoyed XCOM:EU and dont mind little changes here and there, you will like this one too.			"

												Before I start, SPOILER HEAVY REVIEW, although I feel I have good reasons for a negative review for a game I like.I will say that I enjoy XCOM, I have since the first one, and this kind of sadistic gameplay intrigues me. I love it, and I will spend many more hours in it, but there is a reason why I am not going to recommend it, especially over XCOM: Enemy Unknown.I am not going to focus on bugs/crashes/etc, since many of those can be system specific and not necessarily a general thing.1) TutorialThe tutorial is absolute garbage. It teaches you the base mechanics of the game BUT... Here comes a few points.    Point 1: It teaches you to not take cover while overwatching, also it teaches you to overwatch instead of engaging.    Point 2: It teaches you to go into positions where you have no cover.     Point 3: It only gives you a semblance of control, does not allow you to experiment with game mechanics, does not allow you to even try anything yourself, you are stuck on one specific path that will make any decent XCOM player grind their teeth from the decisions the game forces you to make. Probably one of the worst tutorials I have ever personally experienced (XCOM: Enemy Unknown had a tutorial that forced actions on you as well, but it did teach you about decent movement and didn't force you to do actions that were bad unless it got your trooper outright killed right away)2) ProgressionThe progression of enemies in this game is completely crazy, ESPECIALLY if you played the tutorial.If you played the tutorial you have very few decent troopers and you get dumped in to a mission where there will be a Sectoid. For new players being introduced to the game, they have barely finished a tutorial that didn't teach them anything, and they have to deal with a mechanic that can (without actually shooting a trooper) make a trooper inoperable for several rounds (panic), mind control them or make them near useless with a disorient buff... This is the ... ""second"" mission of the game, and if you did the tutorial you haven't even played one mission yet.Also a few enemies you encounter early on (within the first 6 missions), each having their own frustrating mechanic, especially if you haven't played XCOM before (and many of these mechanics are new to XCOM).ADVENT Stun Lancer: Can move incredibly long distances, which is in stark contrast to ANYTHING! you have encountered so far, rarely if ever shoots and deals an insane amount of damage early game which also has a chance to either stun your troopers (making them inoperable for X amount of actions) or outright knock them unconscious requiring you to carry them out of the mission if it is an evac mission. Despite them being this unique they don't stand out that heavily from ordinary ADVENT Troopers visually making them (especially for new players) harder to make out.Viper: These guys can PULL! your guys to them, and grapple them, making them inoperable until you shoot the Viper. It can BEYOND this shoot an AOE poison that will early game be able to almost kill your troopers. This is guaranteed damage and if you didn't bring a medkit, you are screwed because that is the only way to get rid of it (or finishing the mission)MEC: These guys are not as frustrating as the two others, but they severely limit your flanking abilities since they don't use cover as well as the fact they have 2 armor. The game has not taught you what armor is, or how armor works yet so some players may not have any idea how to deal with it (which will make these guys into bullet sponges early game) They also are the first AOE cover destroying enemies as well.This is within the first 6 missions, and 2 of these are earlier than that. All of these appear earlier than most of their (less frustrating) counterparts in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, screwing the progression of the game heavily.Just these things put together is one of the reasons I would probably never suggest XCOM 2 to a new player. Even more experienced players can get a lot of games ruined in the first couple of missions due to random frustrating control removing mechanics being introduced this early.3) Frustrating Mechanics / Enemy DesignThis ties a little into Progression but XCOM: Enemy Unknown in contrast to XCOM 2 did not introduce a lot of enemies that could outright take control away from you early game, while as I mentioned before this game introduces 2 of them within the first half hour to an hour of game experience. In a game already about RNG it speaks of the bad game design to have so many mechanics to take away the control of your characters (leaving you with less characters to deal with the threat) and some of these mechanics doesn't even have a real counter to them. Besides that I feel that they spent way to much time adding to many abilities on to their enemies due to them lore wise being an ""upgrade"" to the original troopers. Due to this addition of so many new mechanics to enemies, the enemies that were considered a threat (and didn't really receive an ""update"") in XCOM: Enemy Unknown are now incredible tame.These include:  Mutons: They are introduced so late into the game that their pitiful 8 health and 1 armor is laughable. A lot of your troops have more than that, and half your characters will be able to oneshot it.  Berserkers: Rarely if ever a true threat, due to it's ""frenzy"" mechanic. You just shoot it while it is far away, and it kills anything close by, including its own allies.   Avatar: These guys are... super... insanely... underwhelming... They are supposed to be the cool♥♥♥♥♥psionic dude you have to fear, but it gets introduced in a ridicolous manner because it comes out of the left field with no time to react. Despite this, the trooper itself has rather weak damage, the most annoying feature is every time it takes damage it teleports to a different location. This is easily countered with half decent positioning. When I encountered it the biggest threat on the field was a Gatekeeper, making these ""bosses"" extremely underwhelming.  The pacing of the progression is very very bad due to these guys.4) The Final ""Boss""The final battle in general is super super underwhelming. Surprisingly few enemies, and the enemies you do get to fight you can basically ignore if you have the chance to kill the Avatars.Basically kill the first avatar, then you just kill the next two avatars as soon as they spawn. The fights prior to that, you ask? Well you get handed a new character ""Commander Avatar"" which has a massive AOE Void Rift that deals quite good damage, the ability to easily mind control any organic or dealing upwards of 14 damage in a line to enemies. This is beyond your first 6 troopers... So you have 6 really strong troopers and a 7th overpowered one... Yeah guys, totally tough final battle.I don't think a lot needed to be changed in this game to make it okay. Introduce Mutons earlier, introduce Sectoids and Vipers later, and focus more on the simpler enemies early game, the ones that just throw grenades and shoot at you, instead of the ones that grapple/pull/mind control/panic your troopers.Side Note: If anyone is going to tell me that the reason all of the above is okay because ""This is XCOM""... Well, you may know how to play XCOM, you may know it can be frustrating and unfair at times, but that does not mean frustrating mechanics should be thrown at new players for the majority of the early game, which can easily feel uncounterable or straight up impossible to deal with. It is not an excuse for badly designed progression/game design.TL;DRIf you are a new player, I can not recommend you to stay further away from this game. XCOM: Enemy Unknown has a much superior progression and a hell of a lot better environment to experiment and learn about the game before it starts throwing insane mechanics in your face.			"

												Don´t get me wrong, it is a great game. Or rather it WILL BE, when it is FINISHED. I have just lost 3 hrs of gameplay, because, although the game was internally indicating it was creating my saves and also autosaving, it turned out it was NOT. The fix was easy and could be googled. But the simple fact that there can be a bug of this magnitude and taking into consideration the ´premium´ price, I CANNOT with good conscience RECOMMEND this game in this CURRENT state. I am hugely disappointed with 2K studios and the lack of their quality control. One day this will be an epic game. I hope this day comes soon...			"

												After having a great experience with XCOM EU/EW, I was eager to get my hands on XCOM 2. I can gladly say that it is a great improvement over its predecessor. Besides a few graphical issues and fps drops, the game itself is fantastic. I have seen people review it badly because of those sole flaws, however, let me assure you that the gameplay, is XCOM refined to greatness. If you liked XCOM EU/EW, prepare to have your soul crushed and prepare for one of the most satisfying games of your life. You should definitely buy it.			"

												I want to like this game but i can't ignore the things that ruins it.The worst part is the constant interuptions no matter what you do. being on the strategy map or in tactical gameplay.Your are not the master in this game. The master is the person who programed the Camera. There is no option to free the camera, allowing you to deside what is important.Everytime something happens big or small, Control is taken from you and the camera is moved.This is frustrating. Performance wise the game is lagging alot, this can manifest in a number of ways most notably you moved a trooper and you must wait until the game feels like selecting the next in line or simply to end the mission.Like I said I want to like this game, and I proberly will once they cleaned it up a bit. The camera needs a complete overhaul before I can say make a positive review. Combat wise it is satisfing. Especialy when a plan comes together and every alien in the ambush goes down.			"

												I want to love this game, but the accuracy makes no sense in this game. Sometimes you will have a better chance to hit someone you have no actual vision of than someone standing out in the open. These ""recruits"" have apparently never shot a gun because you will be about 10 feet from someone and have 50/50 chance at hitting the enemy. You will get shot through solid walls  over great distances meanwhile you will miss some point blank shots. I really do want to love this game, and I usually boot it back up and give it another go. There are just too many flaws with the actual gameplay for me to enjoy it though. I end up getting agitated by all the nonsense.			"

												Not recommended for the full price. The set of game features considering what XCOM : EW added to the original game makes it look like a completely dumbed down version  of the first opus.Maybe wait until they add gene troopers, mechs , and the Long War Studios do all the work for them.Other than that, the only thing they ADDED to the game which actually good and fun is the stealth mechanic.So basically you would be paying 50€ for your copy of XCOM 1, with 20% of the gameplay features provided by EU + EW + Long War, only to get the stealth gameplay.Your choice, but basically it isn't worth it for me.I've got 450 hours in XCOM 1 btw, most of it on Long War. I've played this 60H so there is actual gameplay and value for the price. But I'm a huge xcom nerd. Nonetheless, honestly, buy on sale only. I'm fed up with devs removing half the content of the game in their sequels. Where are the MECHS, where are the gene troopers? Why do Psi soldier do not multiclass anymore? So many things you would have to mod to get back the gameplay you are used to. Otherwise nothing really fun is added. The tactical map is a nice idea poorly executed.Level design is perfect though.Basically I spent 60 kinda fun hours on it ( most of it fun, actually, but frustrated by so many poor choices of their part ) but won't be coming back to it. I want to play Long War but with the stealth of XCOM 2.			"

												Game as a software: This program does not perform well. I have a good gaming laptop but still frame drops constantly. The application sometimes crashes. I have encountered auto-saves that the game cannot load. Game in general: I wish the one calling the shots regarding what to put in the game have played the previous xcoms. The old xcom have more content, more things you can do, more research, more vehicles, more facilities. •	What happened to the archangel suit? •	No more mec trooper•	Missing the laser weapons•	Not enough depth to the normal weapon you use in the beginning•	No more bases across continents•	No more interceptors•	No more base defense (inside the base, where aliens can kill your engineers and scientists)I mean if you want to change some stuff at least replace it with something better. I feel this is a trim down version. And still if the plan is to really trim it down at least make the game kick-♥♥♥ in the sense that it is sleek. But the game as it is far from being sleek. Why do I have to see that useless hologram of the globe every time I want to move my base? And by the way, you keep showing us that but what we can interact with is a map…. So lame… Talking about moving the xcom base. We could assume that the ship would be a big ♥♥♥ ship but how come throughout the game it was only intercepted once, with no damage I tell you! What happened to the big ♥♥♥ ship the aliens have? Only saucers flying around. And even if you fly pass them they would not attack the freaking flying xcom base.I can still say a lot of negative things about this game but to summarize. There is nothing in the game that was impressive. It’s a trim down version of its predecessor. No effort to impress the players. If they say they worked on the graphics, well they currently suck with that frame rate drops. Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing! I hope they earn a lot from this version so that they could do another one better. Come on guys, if you have to go back to the original game, please do so, there is a wealth of content there, you just need to use that as the base of your content and then improve some. (I still can’t forget that one time I sent an agent via motor bike to an alien site and “Rambo”ed the hell out of the aliens). I miss throwing those light stick to see the aliens… hayz…. Then *just thought of this now* you could have a research for night vision goggles so we don’t have to throw light stick so we can save mother earth while killing the aliens right?! I mean this game is supposed to be human vs aliens but this version doesn’t show enough human tech (if somebody will say because this version is in the future and alien tech is more advance then I would ask if we discarded our technology for alien tech then why does the resistance need to research alien tech again?). Anyway I digress, this is my first review here in steam and it is for a game that I love and played since the 90s and I am saying I feel there could be way more than what was given in this version. A very big room for improvement. Will I buy the next version of the game? hell yes :) but i might not pre-purchase anymore. I thought with the enemy within version being good this would be better but alas it is not, so next time I would not be as excited. "

												This game isn't playable.  You can get through the early missions ok, but after a few hours of game play the game starts crashing after 2-3 missions.  After a few more you crash after every mission and start losing saves to the memory leaks.  PLEASE FIX THIS!! or give us our money back!			"

												I'm conflicted on this. I adored Enemy Unknown/Within, and XCOM 2 improves upon those games in many respects. The customization is great, and (fixable) optimization issues aside, it looks amazing. The new takes on old classes makes certain parts of me tingly, and much of the gameplay is sublime.So why the thumb down? Simple. Timers. God... damn... timers...Simply put, I play strategy games to (shock) strategize. If the occasional mission warrants I move fast (bomb diffusal), okay. I didn't mind it in EU/EW, but here it's every freakin' mission. You're constantly encouraged to avoid detection and set up ambushes, while simultaneously having Central yell at you that, unless you touch the magic objective RIGHT F***ING NOW, the world will end. You have one, maaaaybe two turns if you're lucky to set up, and then you gotta go H.A.M. to make it in time.And it continues into the strategic overview as well. You're constantly bombarded with things to do, while being forced to plow through the campaign or be subjected to more aliens than Texas.I can't understand how anyone thought this was going to be a good idea. Some say it was to curb Overwatch, but that could be done by tweaking overwatch range/accuracy/damage. There was no need to take a legitimate mechanic for bomb diffusal or hostage rescue, and impose it on the entire game.			"

												Not recommended for the full price. The set of game features considering what XCOM : EW added to the original game makes it look like a completely dumbed down version  of the first opus.Maybe wait until they add gene troopers, mechs , and the Long War Studios do all the work for them.Other than that, the only thing they ADDED to the game which actually good and fun is the stealth mechanic.So basically you would be paying 50€ for your copy of XCOM 1, with 20% of the gameplay features provided by EU + EW + Long War, only to get the stealth gameplay.Your choice, but basically it isn't worth it for me.I've got 450 hours in XCOM 1 btw, most of it on Long War. I've played this 60H so there is actual gameplay and value for the price. But I'm a huge xcom nerd. Nonetheless, honestly, buy on sale only. I'm fed up with devs removing half the content of the game in their sequels. Where are the MECHS, where are the gene troopers? Why do Psi soldier do not multiclass anymore? So many things you would have to mod to get back the gameplay you are used to. Otherwise nothing really fun is added. The tactical map is a nice idea poorly executed.Level design is perfect though.Basically I spent 60 kinda fun hours on it ( most of it fun, actually, but frustrated by so many poor choices of their part ) but won't be coming back to it.

												After having a great experience with XCOM EU/EW, I was eager to get my hands on XCOM 2. I can gladly say that it is a great improvement over its predecessor. Besides a few graphical issues and fps drops, the game itself is fantastic. I have seen people review it badly because of those sole flaws, however, let me assure you that the gameplay, is XCOM refined to greatness. If you liked XCOM EU/EW, prepare to have your soul crushed and prepare for one of the most satisfying games of your life. You should definitely buy it.			"

												Absolutely amazing game. Just completed the campaign and man it is so much harder than the previous game. If you love EU/EW you will love this sequel. Although it launched with varied performance issues, and some... 'interesting' bugs, the performance is pretty easiliy tweaked and the bugs are not so much game breaking as they are... weird. Mostly visual delays during the alien turn that leave you pondering what is going on until the turn ends and animation catches up and normalness resumes. Deeply rich campaign strategy and very very satisfying tactical combat. The turn counters add just enough pressure to make sure you're not quite comfortable while giving you the time for intelligent decisions and ultimately, victory. Even though about 75% of the missions had timers for me, the ones without the timer still kept me on my toes with the very difficult combat. Literally improved everything we loved about EU/EW and added new features and combat mechanics.Highly highly recommend this game to fans of the previous installment. Though the difficulty has gone up significantly! New players be warned! This is not a relaxing game but a stressful challenge to put your wits to the test! (brutally difficult but very winnable). And oh so satisfying when you obtain victory against overwhelming odds. Looking forward to many playthroughs. STRATEGY GOTY.			"

												Almost one of the best games I\'ve ever played, hence why the let down for me is so bad. Like any XCOM game its got some really, too difficult enemies, thats all annoying, but its that horrible challenge that makes you want to keep coming back for more. Its brutal, its unforgiving, and its absolutely fantastic, with one of the most gripping stories I\'ve seen yet in a game.So you ask \'Why is it bad\'. Well, it seem Firaxis made a bit of an oversight. Towards the last couple of missions, the most important ones, it doesnt let you save the game, and there are no autosaves. This would be a good thing as it would force you to make every decision count. So why isnt it. The game crashed. I\'ve lost about 4 hours of gameplay, very important gameplay, that now I\'ll have to do over again. I dont even have a massive problem with the crashing, just the fact that they wouldnt even let me prepare for such an event by saving before hand.Really disappointing. Went from my best game of the year to my most disappointing in 10 minutes.			"

												Let's address the elephant before we push it out of the room.The sheer number of timed missions are a questionable design decision. I'm not entirely against them - it's new, takes some getting used to, and adds a sense of urgency to your missions. Despite how lovingly you remember it, creeping slowly across a map in full overwatch was boring in XCOM:EO. A simple fix would seem to be: start the time when concealment breaks. That way I can position my units accordingly and choose when to begin the countdown.Next is performance. I have a Core i7 and GTX 980 graphics card and the game runs abysmally on high settings. The nice thing about both of these complaints is that they can be patched and modded away.The game is otherwise fantastic. More of what you love about the XCOM series with some new additions. The procedurally-generated randomness is great and I enjoy that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. Looting upgrades and other items in the field is a wonderful touch. I look forward to finishing my first playthrough, and many more to come.			"

												I waited until the first ""performance patch"" was released (it didn't help) to write this review.  I haven't tried any of the mods.tl;dr version: So many great ideas, but the execution and performance issues make XCOM2 unplayable.Good:- The aliens are incredibly interesting.  Most enemies are basically improvements from EU/EW.  Sectoids and Mutons receive massive upgrades from EU/EW, and there are several new enemies that make you really rack your brain on how you are going to combat them.- New twists on some buildings.  The proving ground is fun.  It's mostly a random grab bag of weapons and armor.  The advanced warfare center gives you some pleasant surprises every now and then.- Overwatch AI is improved.  No longer will 5 dudes on overwatch shoot at the dead alien the 1st guy killed.  All successful overwatch shots are useful.- Everything looks pretty good.  The animation is much less cartooney than EU/EW.  - Dodge/Graze mechanic.  Pretty cool when it's in your favor, but heart-breaking when it burns you.- Enemy reinforcements.  They will really screw up your game plan and make you recalculate.  Much improved over the drop-a-thin-man-in-there-and-put-him-on-overwatch paradigm from EU/EW.- Weapon upgrades add another level to squad make-up.  - Psi-warriors are a unique class.  They are bad♥♥♥♥♥..  and probably even overpowered.  No longer just necessary to ""take one for the team"" in the final cinematic.Neutral:- Stealth ambushes were a good idea.  Triggering enemies with several squad members in overwatch commences a Boondock Saints-esque cascade of bullets.  However, overwatch is much less effective than EU/EW, and I end up following a procedure for conducting ambushes. *yawn*- Lots of turn timers on mission.  They do add to the urgency and difficulty of missions, but generally force your hand most of the time.  - Mission types are basically the same as EU/EW.  Base assaults, terror missions, VIP rescue, destry the device.  A few new tricks, but they definitely took the don't-fix-what-ain't-broke approach.- The Black Market.  It's an evolution of the Grey Market from EU/EW.  The Black Market can be useful, but I just don't get excited about it and it doesn't help out as much as the Grey Market did.Bad:- Performance.  Prior to the recent patch, I should have been able to play on max settings/resolution (including 4k) on both of my rigs as they are waaayyyy beyond the recommended specs.  However, max settings made the framerate drop to gamebreaking levels.  I was able to tweak the settings to make the game playable, but it never looked all that great.  I did not experience crashes before the patch.  THEN THE PATCH WAS BORN.  Post-patch, I experienced 1-3 crashes per hour of play (The last one I suffered occurred on the plane ride home from a terror mission on which only one civilian was killed).  The real insult is that the developer added an ""auto settings detector"" to help us all play at acceptable framerates.  The auto-detect simply dumbed down settings on my machines AND the framerate was much lower than pre-patch.  Just plain unacceptable- Some missions seem pre-determined.  I loved the difficulty of Long War.  It was transparent and tactile.  You always knew why you were getting screwed, and were generally rewarded by living by the rules of XCOM.  But the rules of XCOM intermittently get flipped upside-down in XCOM2.  I have played several missions where there are a large number of improbable misses (> 85%) that lead me to fail the mission.  Even after save-scumming with an all-new approach, the overwhelming missed shots lead me to believe that the seed is choosing against me.  This leads to an unwanted side-effect of relying HEAVILY on 100% weapons (mainly grenades) and laughing when my guys miss three 90% shots in a row to end a turn.  It's insulting, and eliminates the fun of having a diverse squad.Verdict: There is so much to like, but I can't enjoy it because the few things I hate are so very bad.			"

												Before I start, SPOILER HEAVY REVIEW, although I feel I have good reasons for a negative review for a game I like.I will say that I enjoy XCOM, I have since the first one, and this kind of sadistic gameplay intrigues me. I love it, and I will spend many more hours in it, but there is a reason why I am not going to recommend it, especially over XCOM: Enemy Unknown.I am not going to focus on bugs/crashes/etc, since many of those can be system specific and not necessarily a general thing.1) TutorialThe tutorial is absolute garbage. It teaches you the base mechanics of the game BUT... Here comes a few points.    Point 1: It teaches you to not take cover while overwatching, also it teaches you to overwatch instead of engaging.    Point 2: It teaches you to go into positions where you have no cover.     Point 3: It only gives you a semblance of control, does not allow you to experiment with game mechanics, does not allow you to even try anything yourself, you are stuck on one specific path that will make any decent XCOM player grind their teeth from the decisions the game forces you to make. Probably one of the worst tutorials I have ever personally experienced (XCOM: Enemy Unknown had a tutorial that forced actions on you as well, but it did teach you about decent movement and didn't force you to do actions that were bad unless it got your trooper outright killed right away)2) ProgressionThe progression of enemies in this game is completely crazy, ESPECIALLY if you played the tutorial.If you played the tutorial you have very few decent troopers and you get dumped in to a mission where there will be a Sectoid. For new players being introduced to the game, they have barely finished a tutorial that didn't teach them anything, and they have to deal with a mechanic that can (without actually shooting a trooper) make a trooper inoperable for several rounds (panic), mind control them or make them near useless with a disorient buff... This is the ... ""second"" mission of the game, and if you did the tutorial you haven't even played one mission yet.Also a few enemies you encounter early on (within the first 6 missions), each having their own frustrating mechanic, especially if you haven't played XCOM before (and many of these mechanics are new to XCOM).ADVENT Stun Lancer: Can move incredibly long distances, which is in stark contrast to ANYTHING! you have encountered so far, rarely if ever shoots and deals an insane amount of damage early game which also has a chance to either stun your troopers (making them inoperable for X amount of actions) or outright knock them unconscious requiring you to carry them out of the mission if it is an evac mission. Despite them being this unique they don't stand out that heavily from ordinary ADVENT Troopers visually making them (especially for new players) harder to make out.Viper: These guys can PULL! your guys to them, and grapple them, making them inoperable until you shoot the Viper. It can BEYOND this shoot an AOE poison that will early game be able to almost kill your troopers. This is guaranteed damage and if you didn't bring a medkit, you are screwed because that is the only way to get rid of it (or finishing the mission)MEC: These guys are not as frustrating as the two others, but they severely limit your flanking abilities since they don't use cover as well as the fact they have 2 armor. The game has not taught you what armor is, or how armor works yet so some players may not have any idea how to deal with it (which will make these guys into bullet sponges early game) They also are the first AOE cover destroying enemies as well.This is within the first 6 missions, and 2 of these are earlier than that. All of these appear earlier than most of their (less frustrating) counterparts in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, screwing the progression of the game heavily.Just these things put together is one of the reasons I would probably never suggest XCOM 2 to a new player. Even more experienced players can get a lot of games ruined in the first couple of missions due to random frustrating control removing mechanics being introduced this early.3) Frustrating Mechanics / Enemy DesignThis ties a little into Progression but XCOM: Enemy Unknown in contrast to XCOM 2 did not introduce a lot of enemies that could outright take control away from you early game, while as I mentioned before this game introduces 2 of them within the first half hour to an hour of game experience. In a game already about RNG it speaks of the bad game design to have so many mechanics to take away the control of your characters (leaving you with less characters to deal with the threat) and some of these mechanics doesn't even have a real counter to them. Besides that I feel that they spent way to much time adding to many abilities on to their enemies due to them lore wise being an ""upgrade"" to the original troopers. Due to this addition of so many new mechanics to enemies, the enemies that were considered a threat (and didn't really receive an ""update"") in XCOM: Enemy Unknown are now incredible tame.These include:  Mutons: They are introduced so late into the game that their pitiful 8 health and 1 armor is laughable. A lot of your troops have more than that, and half your characters will be able to oneshot it.  Berserkers: Rarely if ever a true threat, due to it's ""frenzy"" mechanic. You just shoot it while it is far away, and it kills anything close by, including its own allies.   Avatar: These guys are... super... insanely... underwhelming... They are supposed to be the cool♥♥♥♥♥psionic dude you have to fear, but it gets introduced in a ridicolous manner because it comes out of the left field with no time to react. Despite this, the trooper itself has rather weak damage, the most annoying feature is every time it takes damage it teleports to a different location. This is easily countered with half decent positioning. When I encountered it the biggest threat on the field was a Gatekeeper, making these ""bosses"" extremely underwhelming.  The pacing of the progression is very very bad due to these guys.4) The Final ""Boss""The final battle in general is super super underwhelming. Surprisingly few enemies, and the enemies you do get to fight you can basically ignore if you have the chance to kill the Avatars.Basically kill the first avatar, then you just kill the next two avatars as soon as they spawn. The fights prior to that, you ask? Well you get handed a new character ""Commander Avatar"" which has a massive AOE Void Rift that deals quite good damage, the ability to easily mind control any organic or dealing upwards of 14 damage in a line to enemies. This is beyond your first 6 troopers... So you have 6 really strong troopers and a 7th overpowered one... Yeah guys, totally tough final battle.I don't think a lot needed to be changed in this game to make it okay. Introduce Mutons earlier, introduce Sectoids and Vipers later, and focus more on the simpler enemies early game, the ones that just throw grenades and shoot at you, instead of the ones that grapple/pull/mind control/panic your troopers.Side Note: If anyone is going to tell me that the reason all of the above is okay because ""This is XCOM""... Well, you may know how to play XCOM, you may know it can be frustrating and unfair at times, but that does not mean frustrating mechanics should be thrown at new players for the majority of the early game, which can easily feel uncounterable or straight up impossible to deal with. It is not an excuse for badly designed progression/game design.TL;DRIf you are a new player, I can not recommend you to stay further away from this game. XCOM: Enemy Unknown has a much superior progression and a hell of a lot better environment to experiment and learn about the game before it starts throwing insane mechanics in your face.			"

												If you want to play XCom, just stick with the first game.  The second game has irritating bugs (you can be spotted when there is no red ""spotted"" tile), is filled with smoke and mirrors style difficulty (patrols know exactly where you are, so no matter how you approach a battlefield, they will ""just happen"" to walk in your direction), and just generally feels far more susceptible to random number generated nonsense, which limits actual tactics and preparedness.  XCom 1, meanwhile, had a much better balanced set of mechanics which allowed for tactical preparedness and limited the negative effects of RNG luck.			"

If you don't buy yet just keep your eyes open for news about fixes =)Update 29.07.2016:Now has good DLC additions adding a new MEC class and crazy boss aliens that break the main rules of the game. Lots of very high quality mods and haven't yet encountered any game crashing bugs atm, mostly FPS dips and with all my mods it has long loading times like CIV 5. SSD drive would optimize load-times.There is nothing really like ths game out there, so i threw money @ DLC willingly :)			"

												I am a new player into the world of XCOM but having seen the hype thought I would give it a go. It looked good.Sadly the looks are where the fun start and end. My personal opinion is that this game is truly utterly awful. I bought it this morning, played 4 hours of it and have now requested a refund as i am stuck on a repeatable and unavoidable bug that completely prevents me from progressing beyond the first mission. I only racked up 4 hours gameplay as I was replaying the first mission to try and get past the bug. The point at which you are tasked with recruiting an engineer and excavating a part of the base results in a screen you cannot get past no matter what you click on and what buttons you press on your keyboard. My only option was to force close the game and try again.Despite this though the game is lacking in so many ways. The most ludicrous is the chance to hit mechanic. I appreciate this is something you develop as you progress in the game but having manouvered my character to point blank range and still only gain a 48% chance of hitting with rifle shots is utterly nonsensical. Time and again I would focus on troop movements to gain a good line of sight only to be presented with a 34% chance to hit or something equally stupid. RNG gone mad makes for missions you know will be successful based on a dice roll rather than your skills in playing. There is online gambling offering better rewards for that sort of uncertainty.I'm an old git and have been playing games for a long long long time - this ranks as one of the worst gaming experiences I have ever encountered. Unless you are a die hard XCOM fan I would avoid this one like the plague it will dissappoint and frustrate in equal measure and there are much cheaper games offering much more enjoyable playability than this.

												Firstly I want to start of by saying this game has worse balancing than the r8 revolver when it was first implemented in CSGO. This will probably cause controvesy as it has in other reviews and there will probably be some fu** wit who comments saying ""lower the difficulty"", to that fu**cker I want to say ""youre a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot"" and this is why:On the second ""level"" (level as in ground team mission) in the game theres an enemy (sectoid) with a mind control ability that lasts as long as its alive, a panic ability that causes you to lose a turn with a trooper and cause him to do stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥and an ability that lets it reanimate the dead. You honestly cant say that is balanced. It also has a lot of health and unless you score a crit youre looking at 2 - 3 hits to take it out. 2 or 3 hits that are hard enough to score since youre out numbered, youre under ""staffed"" because a troop has been mind controlled and its in cover. Even if you score 1 hit it will most likely move and then you have to regain ground again.The third level the enemy have ""ADVENT stun lancers"". Their job is too run at you from dash range(about as far as you can see. The max distance you can move at) and attack with melee. The melee has a chance too 1 shot if it doesnt 1 shot it has a chance to stun you for a turn. The melee attack can also go through walls and floors. Don't even bother about overwatch(An ability that lets your troop cover an area and engage any moving enemies there), when youre on your 3rd mission and your troopers are still basically cannon fodder when you overwatch 90% they will miss at a target at dash range. Its not a matter of difficulty its a matter of balance. I've beaten enemy within on impossible using smart tactics, this game however just seems more random than strategy. No matter how you position yourself youll get screwed over by a sectoids mind control or by a shock troop running in and killing or pacifying a trooper. Honestly I dont care enough to play the game far enough to see if it gets better. The mutons seem average enough and so do the snake people. The next thing I wanna go over is the timed missions. Some of the timed missions literally have just enough time for you to reach the objective even if you dash all the way. This means if you fight you keep your troopers alive but fail the mission or visa versa. I believe they will probably get patched. If not there are already a ton of mods on the workshop but it bothered me enough to mention. Some people are complaining at the amount of timed missions but I'm fine with that personally.I have around 400 games in my library but none of the ones I have played have this much imbalance. I enjoy a challenge but when its more difficult on rookie than enemy within was on impossible you know somethings up. I'm just going to bide my time until mods or patches come out.Pros:Graphics are niceNew concealment system is pretty neatNew hacking mechanicModding supportReplayabilityCampaign map is much better than enemy unknownCons:Optimization as of this date is pretty terrible (will be patched most likely).Really bad enemy balancingTurn timer missions/ not enough time on turn timersAiming angles are often reaaaally dumbBad difficulty settingsTL:DR Has some really cool new ideas to expand on from enemy unknown/ within but its let down by numerous factors mostly to do with balancing. Could be easily fixed, mods may save this game.If you want to tell me I'm a dumbass then comment and Ill tell you that you're wrong XD			"

												First things first!I am a huge fan of the xcom series! I loved the last game for reviving the series and giving you immense opportunities and ways to play the game. XCOM 2 is all that just better!Why the thumbs down?It is the constant time preassure and overwhelming enemy  presence especially in early game. I like the concept of not having tons of time in a mission. If it's behind enemy lines it is realitstic that you just have a short window before they send reinforcements. Just having ten turns for extracting a hostage (even if you manage to stay concealed until you free him) is just not enough. What I loved about the xcom series so far is you could carefully position your soldiers to engage the enemy and in firefights retreat to a tactically better position to flank.But with that turn limitations before the mission fails you are forced to take unnecessary risks and the enemy (sometimes 8-12 enemies) swarms you, flanks you through their numbers. Also very annoying are the sectoids which seem to have become bigger and easily panick or mind control your rookie soldiers. They also can revive their and your fallen soldiers as psy zombies.Combined with the low stats and equipment of your rookie soldiers, this makes it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play those missions.The game has improved in all other aspects, the story is amazing and it feels home on the computer. I would have wished for an option to deactivate some (not all) of the turn limitations in order to get the option to take some more turns to cope with the enemy.Very sad that they limit you so much and for me it adds a lot of difficulty in the early game that is just frustrating and unnecessary.I will keep playing and adapt my tactics but non the less it's a thumbs down for the game. :(			"

												XCOM2 is an evolution of XCOM EU ideas, refining classes and abilities as well as adding a lot of new stuff.Nearly all abilities and items are usable in every mission, class builds are more versatile and fun, especially when boosted by the wide variety of items that are semi-blindly researched in Proving Grounds. To improve classes even more they have a random chance of getting the ability of another one when promoted thanks to Advanced Warfare Center - making some of your soldiers truly unique (and painful to lose).Maps are randomly generated this time, armor system is refined (not a bonus to HP but lowering damage instead, can be bypassed/shredded by grenades, psi powers and some weapons), soldiers can stay out of combat for weeks when wounded and even become shaken, being more susceptible to panic and enemy mind control - so you have to take care of them more than before.Weapons can be upgraded with gear bought from black market or dropped by aliens, soldier stats can be amplified by stims and various types of ammo and vests.XCOM2 also saw the addition of melee combat and concealment system granting you the ability to sneak up and ambush aliens. Aliens themselves are much more varied now, with more unique skills. Since you can mind control organic enemies and take control of robotic ones through hacking - combat becomes quite interesting.At the campaign level aliens have won and you are in charge of last remnants of XCOM organization fighting the occupation together with resistance. It's a race against time more so than before, with Doomsday clock ticking and you can only slow it down. This time there's truly never enough resources for everything so often you will find yourself literally running on fumes and will have to compromise.As a result some missions are timed now, which can be tough at first but becomes a lot more managable as your force becomes more skilled and on par with alien technology. This however rids the game of the infamous overwatch cheating that made the game easy in XCOM EU.And with all that said - there's a LOT more to see in this game that is impossible to mention here.

A bug from the patch 2 weeks ago introduced a memory leak. It hasn't been patched since. I haven't been able to play the game.As of the most recent update, the game is now playable. I've even noticed an increase in performance! Wow! Still not optimal, but it doesn't really dip into single frames as often, and crashes are way less frequent. Others are reporting more performance issues though. YMMV.Game is pretty damn fun. XCOM 2 is more streamlined than Enemy Unknown: Stripped down base management, removal of aircraft, and there are no longer country-specific panic bars, but instead a single global one.That's not to say that they haven't added in anything new. Some missions will start you off in a stealth-based concealment status. Instead of groups of enemies gaining a turn as soon as you spot them, they'll only trigger once you enter their line of sight (which, once you spot them, will be displayed on the map when you move your mouse around. Unfortunately, this is currently bugged, and enemies may be able to spot you outside of the visible zone). I really like this concept, but generally the missions you start in this condition will have a lower turn counter. It makes sense for some missions, but it's a slap in the hand to give you this freedom and being unable to utilize it. On the bright side, there are some mods that change the way the timer works.And mods for just about everything else, actually. XCOM 2 is miles ahead of Enemy Unknown when it comes to mod support. If you go on to the Steam workshop (or elsewhere, if you prefer), and you'll find new classes, cosmetics, weapons, enemies, gameplay tweaks, the works. Making this game so mod friendly may be the best change to XCOM 2. Firaxis definitely deserves some praise for their improvements. The only downside is that if you decide you no longer want a mod during a campaign, you won't be able to use that save. On the bright side, there's a mod that lets you bypass that! (though your save may have issues or make your game crash). It's just such a damn shame how buggy this game is. There are situations like this where I feel like I should have a flank, but instead the game disagrees[i.imgur.com] and says the alien is in full cover. Here's one where I'm right beside this guy[i.imgur.com]. The inverse also seems to happen- flanks at absolutely incomprehensible angles. Happens to both me and the AI. Some bugs I feel guilty about is stuff like this. That target is behind 4 walls.[i.imgur.com] It's not usually that extreme, but it happens more often than you'd think.My first playthrough was on Veteran. The global crisis meter was one bar away from being filled because I was pretty dumb with my build order (PROTIP build a Resistance comms facility early in your base). I was able to completely erase it in about a month's time, and they never remotely recovered from it. It was pretty much a win state for the final two months: I was just waiting for more tech to develop and only a handful of missions popped up. Very anti-climatic compared to how hectic the early months can be.I really like this game. Should you get this game? Definitely. When the Game of the Year edition is released. The bugs are still present and they'll likely be focusing more effort on making DLC (because this is a 2K game, of there's a season pass). May as well get a cheaper, less buggy game at a later point in time with all the DLC included and better, refined mods from the community.I'll change my recommendation to a yes when I can honestly tell others to pick the game up. Until then, stay away.PS why the ♥♥♥♥ can Advent Officers move, use mark (increases enemy accuracy against one of your soldiers) and fire in the same ♥♥♥♥ing turn?PPS bring two grenadiers, get them Heavy Ordnance, Volatile Mix, and Salvo. Develop them heavy armor. Give one gas and the other acid grenades. Blow up every single wall, floor, and ceiling.			"

												I enjoy the idea of this game. But honestly this game is really stupid in many senses. It's like I get it that this is simulated combat in a turn based sense. But for how many times i missed a shot when I literally right next to someone is just stupid. Not to mention having an enemy unit make a 15% shot chance from way down town, over and over again is ♥♥♥♥ing dumb. Good idea for a game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shot percentages. This is why you dont buy a game on release. You get stuck with a game you dont enjoy			"

												XCom Enemy Unknown rekindled an old love for turn-based games and XCOM 2 has reaffirmed it. The game created a very real sense of urgency in the first play through. Consecutive play throughs or restarts put me a little bit more at ease.The combat is once again very intense and even though the soldiers are randomly generated you form a very real attachement to them. Especially after you spent some time customizing them.I have had a ton of fun playing this game, high fiving myself for close wins, grimly trudging on after costly victories and of course raising my glass to the fallen.

												XCOM2 is an evolution of XCOM EU ideas, refining classes and abilities as well as adding a lot of new stuff.Nearly all abilities and items are usable in every mission, class builds are more versatile and fun, especially when boosted by the wide variety of items that are semi-blindly researched in Proving Grounds. To improve classes even more they have a random chance of getting the ability of another one when promoted thanks to Advanced Warfare Center - making some of your soldiers truly unique (and painful to lose).Maps are randomly generated this time, armor system is refined (not a bonus to HP but lowering damage instead, can be bypassed/shredded by grenades, psi powers and some weapons), soldiers can stay out of combat for weeks when wounded and even become shaken, being more susceptible to panic and enemy mind control - so you have to take care of them more than before.Weapons can be upgraded with gear bought from black market or dropped by aliens, soldier stats can be amplified by stims and various types of ammo and vests.XCOM2 also saw the addition of melee combat and concealment system granting you the ability to sneak up and ambush aliens. Aliens themselves are much more varied now, with more unique skills. Since you can mind control organic enemies and take control of robotic ones through hacking - combat becomes quite interesting.At the campaign level aliens have won and you are in charge of last remnants of XCOM organization fighting the occupation together with resistance. It's a race against time more so than before, with Doomsday clock ticking and you can only slow it down. This time there's truly never enough resources for everything so often you will find yourself literally running on fumes and will have to compromise.As a result some missions are timed now, which can be tough at first but becomes a lot more managable as your force becomes more skilled and on par with alien technology. This however rids the game of the infamous overwatch cheating that made the game easy in XCOM EU.And with all that said - there's a LOT more to see in this game that is impossible to mention here.

												I want to love this game.At it's core, the game is pretty good. Pretty solid base to work off of, it's pretty fun. Well what's the problem then?XCOM Enemy Within exists. Not even that, the Long War mod exists. The game feels like a step back from the first. There are less options, less enemies, and less depth. It feels like they took out a lot more then they actually added. Perhaps my biggest issue is that a good majority of the missions are timed in one way or another. Timed missions aren't bad, but too many of them is. It restricts tactics, which is not something you want to do for half the missions.I'll be interested to see what DLC adds, if it adds anything of interest. But when overall it feels like a step back from vanilla Enemy Within, and with the Long War mod in XCOM 1 which essentially transforms it into almost a new game, it just doesn't feel worth the price as is.

												Terrible, frustrating, and unfair are the words that come to mind most when I think of XCOM 2. I loved XCOM Enemy Within and have several play throughs logged yetI loathe the sequel: XCOM 2. The game lacks the charm and novelty of the first. The premise that you are a Guerilla makes the Command Center portion of the game annoyingly tedious. The game literally won't let you finish doing anything in one go. It'll send you to a region to ""investigate"" and you won't even get to finish your investigation before it throws a time sensitive event at you.  You're going to be juggling a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥instead of having a straight forward experience.Enemies are too powerful and have too many abilities. Mutliple enemies have the ability to perform several attacks in one go. Advent Stun Lancers can take out multiple soldiers by yielding them unconcious even though your troops have 3/4th health left. Tongues from Vipers literally travel through multiple walls to snag one of your soldiers away from your group. This is pure LAZINESS from the developer. Line of sight defintely affects your own hit chances but apparently does not effect the AI. Not to mention that hit chances for the most part are made much more predictably unpredictable. I've never missed so many 70% or more shots before, and this is a regular thing. You might miss these at crucial times and the FREQUENCY of missing these high percentage shots is incredibly high.  Also the route your soldier takes to get to an assigned destination is bizzare. For example your soldier could go around a building and up a ladder to get to a particular destination. Yet instead of using a logical route your soldier will smash through two glass windows, alert a group of enemies to reach that same destination.This game is literally the most frustrating thing ever. For the most part, I really enjoy challenging and tough games. Yet this game doesn't reward you AT ALL for your tactics, caution, or experience. I'm over 20 hours in and I've started a new play through with my new knowledge of the game. I've made no progress in improving my mission performance as the game doesn't reward you tactics. It's just a random pile of ♥♥♥♥ YOU. I wish I could get a refund and I don't recommend this game.			"

												!!!SPOILER!!! This might be a good TBS, but to me it's not a good Xcom. On the one side, you have a surprisingly restrictive mission design which, unlike older Xcom titles, won't let you experiment with different tactics and strategies much. It's either ""you're stealthy and have 10 turns to interact with some target"" or ""the enemy knows you're here, kill them"". You can't do fun stuff anymore like mindcontrolling and disarming the entire alien force, drive them all together, let your noobiest soldier throw in a nuke and watch him getting a crapload of XP. And those base defense missions are just a joke. Why not give us missions INSIDE the base where you actually have to DEFEND!!!! It worked over 20 years ago?! Laziness? Savings? Also the terror missions: almost all the civilians got killed. Rating: excellent. What the...?! On the other side, you have a ridiculous amount of overpowered stun mechanics and crowd control, which allow you to cheese all the way through the game once you figure it out (at least on normal difficulty, couldn't find the motivation to try the harder modes). The Flashbang e.g. can be upgraded to the radius of a tactical nuke if you train heavy gunners accordingly (prepare for heavy lag tho), then there are smoke greandes, Gremlins, suppression mechanics, overwatch and of course psi (which you really don't need in Xcom2 since all the cheeper stuff is good enough and available earlier). If you're not braindead, most of the time the enemies won't even have a chance to shoot back. I lost 3 soldiers in the entire game, and that was on the first couple of missions, before I got flashbangs. There are aliens in this game which I don't even know what their abilities are because they never had the opportunity to show them. In older Xcoms, you had aliens snipe you out of the darkness all the way across the map before you could even see them and you had to use your brain to advance. In Xcom1+2, you will mostly find groups of 3 enemies, which first get aggro'd once you get close, do their little freak show intro and then run for cover before they can do anything at all... and before getting stunned. That's just ridiculous and gets old quite fast. You could at least make them do a funny dance every once in a while, to round up the circus clown experience... ;)Then there's the underwhelming graphics and performance. I really don't see why this game is so demanding, it doesn't look much better than the prequel which didn't have state of the art graphics to begin with, but at least it runs smoothly! In Xcom2, even the cutscenes can be laggy, and I have a well maintained, powerful gaming PC with a GTX 1080. Guess it's just another poorly optimized console port. That would explain the horrible user interface as well, but I won't even start on that...And last but not least, there's this generic story of shadow government, the end of humanity, rebellion network, guerilla war... ""oh, and the prequel never happend, the aliens won, there's no terror from the deep. We wanted to do a new perspective.."" - You started promising with the xcom 1 remake, 2k, but this is close to heresy. I think you're getting too cocky. Remember: The prequel was a success a for you because it was based on a legendary game and KIND OF convinced the old fans... when I buy Xcom, I accept anything less then Xcom! This is not Xcom enough. Sorry.Positive things: - nice soundtrack - reaper ability - bought it in a bundle with the excellent steam controller.			"

												There are enough reviews our there on the performance of the game and how dodgy it can be.  There are reviews detracting the pace of the game and the forced time limits in the missions.  For those users who complain about the time limits of the missions think on this.  You are the resistance, you are deep in enemy territory and they have the advantage.  The game does a great job on pushing that on to the player.  You get the strong feel of being the underdog more so then in the pervious titles.  That being said this is where I start to have a problem with the game and the developers and the course this game took.What do I mean by this well lets start with the fact the game is 20 years later.  The resistance has been fighting for years against Advent and the aliens.  So why in the name of all that is holy am I still starting the game off with your typical rifles?  WHY has nothing in the pervious war carried over?  In what universe would a 20 year resistance that had some advanced weapons at the end of the last game AND genetic modifications be reduced to the starting point of X-Com EW.Does anyone else feel this is just a slap to the player?  Where is the intense story?  I spent 20 minutes just trying to find out exactly what happened at the end of the last game and I have gotten nothing that actually makes any sense.  Advent took over the aliens attacked and took over.  Really so what the heck happened to X-Coms war against the aliens and the launch on their home planet?  Why are we stuck with nothing at the start? No Psionics no Gauss no nothing we are basically naked against a enemy that has evolved in 20 years and X-Com has not evolved?  I can not believe this as realistic. The game so far is good but I am feeling let down by this game.  Lets be honest X-Com the LW makes X-Com better than this.  As far as games go I give this a 7/10 for graphics and feel but I have to give it a thumbs down still.*Additional Note here that has me a little annoyed as a modder, programmer, and a gamer.  Upon reviewing the game files at length I noticed within the game code alot of notes and options laid out for development of the game.  Why are these not live, why are they sitting there unpolished?  Simple because the developers and company in general don't give a dang about the players.  They want others to finish the work for them like Long War Studios.  IF anyone cares to look carefully they will see long war published the mods in December of 2015 for this game.  So not only do they get the first jump on putting mods out there they have have had the game files for over a month, have completed some in game tweeks the dev team should have done and are well ahead of any modder who now looks to tackle an advanced mod for this game.  Way to go on the developers and publishers of this game.  As a customer and fan of this series you have lost my bussiness.  Simply because of the tactics played with this one game, and if this is the writing on the wall for the future of gaming well gaming will no longer be a secondary pastime but not a pasttime at all.

												To clarify recommendation, I'm on the fence.  If you're into Xcom.. Buy it.  If you're not. Don't.As far as a follow on goes, it's good.  Good idea, quite a basic storyline, but it's fairly involving.The missions after awhile become quite samey.  But they're fun to complete.The big let down for me is enforced gameplay and timed missions.   I prefer open non linear games.  Xcom 1 was non linear, sure you have to take out aliens, do missions etc but it wasn't forced on you.In Xcom2 You spend a few days gathering intel, then a few days picking up supplies(money) then you're given a mission, which you can't ignore doing so looses you the game. In fact you can't really ignore any of the missions or you'll either loose the game outright or you'll loose the county you've spent a week getting. Then there's the avatar project, which even if you hold every country in the world, can still be completed by the aliens.  Your hand is forced throughout the game and during missions via the timer, forcing you to make moves you'd never make without the timer.  Forcing you to rush and loose essentially.  The game world is excellent, the ai in general is very good, sure there's issues with line of sight and some cosmetic glitches but overall the ""idea"" of the game is superb.It is just let down by poor balancing, poor performance issues and mostly by poor design.I've beaten the game twice on veteran difficulty.  I lost maybe 2-3 soldiers in each game.  I don't mind loosing soldiers if I'm outplayed, but at times the game just seems to decide that you've lost, it's predetermined this and there is nothing to you can to stop it.Is it value for money? Sure.  I expect with time at least by summer, when the dlc's are introduced it'll be patched and updated.  Will I still be playing it then.. I doubt it.If xcom 1 had random maps, intelligent ambush and overwatching, the ability to carry wounded soldiers there would really have been no need to even release xcom 2.   It's really just the same game with added insult.Games aren't about being frustrated and bored they're about having fun and winning. Xcom 2 is about loosing, it's about not getting to do what you want to do when you want to do it.   The physical game is replayable, but do I want to play it again and again. Nope.  There's just too many annoying mechanics in the game.  Where there's a great idea, it's just poorly implimented or they clearly, just don't care.7/10 I really tried to like this game, but overall, after everything, I just can't.  Everytime I think of something good about it, I remember 5 bad things.*Edit*I hoped the dlc would add more to the game, but it hasn't.  Missions that should appear in mid or late game are appearing almost at the very start, pitting you against insanely powerful boss aliens and you just don't stand a chance.   Without some heavy modding of the dlc to reduce the hitpoints of these bosses, the dlc is worthless.  The added weapons rubbish.   Essentially it's a joke dlc, it's insulting.   Jake Soloman should be fired from firaxis for making this mess.			"

												I did not enjoy this game. Currently im submitting for a refund. This game is not BAD, it may not run well on all PC's but this is a game you need to KNOW that you want to play it. It isnt a game to go, ""eh, idk, looks alright."" then spend $60. (IMO) The NPC's kinda wander around and make no sense to why they go to certain places. The first two levels, i had multiple people die on me. Im probably just terrible at this game but the hit chance it says in game is completely inaccurate. if its not, then i had the WORST luck in this game. The game fails to ease you into this style of gameplay. it just throws you in and says deal with it. If you KNOW this is a game you will like and you have played others in the past then go ahead. Apparently, the base management is alot more streamlined making you be able to get to combat quicker. The graphics for the game on ultra are kind of sub-par. Honestly, mid combat looks better than some of the cinematics. Which isnt a bad thing, it just should speak for how bad some of the cinematics are. TL;DRDon't buy it unless you KNOW you will love it. If you aren't sure youll love it, get the older version. It wont be as much of a risk.Have a powerful PC if you wanna run it on high.			"

												i've been playing this game most of today and from what ive seen this is what i've collected:pros:- its an xcom game- introduces many new features such as the concealment system which allows for you to set up ambushes and such- plenty of new enemies we have never seen before (also as the game progresses the enemies you have already encountered change)- this xcom has a larger emphases on the story- TONS of character customization- the map is great and the travelling base is as well- dark events are a ton of fun (for those of you who dont know dark events are things that happen in the game that have negative affects on your operation like being pursued by a ufo or enemies raiding your supply lines)- this game (in my opinion) offers a greater challenge to players who just enjoy having their crap kicked out of themcons:- there are some graphical glitches that can occur, mostly when you are in buildings and it shows you the wrong floor- this game could use some more optimizationoverall: this game is great fun and offers plenty of challenges for strategy lovers like myself9/10			"

												I have a couple issues with this wonderful game. Made characters, put them in a character pool with export. It's been intructed on many sites that I had to go in to the game files to character pool and then to importable, and I will find the bin file with my charcter pool I created in there. This was not the case for me, and I have found no explanation why or any fix to this annoyance. It happened both my windows laptops. Also trying to use the workshop mods. Not going well at all. I sub to the ones I wanted, closed out of xcom2 relaunched it again, didn't see any mods to click on the launch screen, Tried the same thing but restartted my computer, same miserable results. Again I could not find answers for this across the internet. Is it just me having these problems? I can excuse the glitcheness and poor optimization issues, they can be remedied with mods, but if I cannot download and use the mods to fix problem that chould have treated before launch, then why bother?

												This game is literally a ♥♥♥♥ing jokeProbability doesn't work the way it should. I should find a debug mode to check what the actual rolls are, because 70-80% is closer to 30-40% some of the time, and 50-60% most of the timeIt's not that I have a problem with risk management strategy. I have a problem with risk management strategies that outright lie to you about how much risk you are takingAnd when 100% chance to hit is almost never (shotguns and pistols are pretty much the only possible 100% to hit shots you can make. Shotguns are also more accurate than swords), having most shots be at about that 70-80% to hit mark, being closer to 50-60%.... it becomes less a tactical shooter and more a dice roll♥♥♥♥♥♥show. Like playing monopoly but with enemies almost never missingApart from sometimes when the enemies can't hit anything for a turn or two, even when flanking you at point blank... And also sometimes shots can never miss for you and your encounters run perfectly....? And now I have no idea what the hell is going on with the RNG. It's like playing monopoly on acidAND ALL THE MISSIONS BAR 4 TYPES OR SO ARE ON TURN TIMERSTHE CAMPAIGN IS ON A TIMERAND A FEW MISSIONS DON'T LET YOU LOOT ITEMS AND WHETHER YOU GET THOSE MISSIONS AS OPPOSED TO ONES YOU CAN LOOT IS ALSO ENTIRELY RANDOMTL;DR: The dice roller is broken and displays random values of what the probability of things happening actually is, though they did make some improvements on the base game....And also everything is on a timer			"

												I have been an avid X Com fan since the 2d version. This one is absolutely great. The graphics are good and overall strategy to the game is great. My biggest gripe is that the Veteran/Normal difficulty is insanely hard compared to its predecessors. It's difficult in a way that makes it more luck than actual strategy. All the strategy in the world on the Veteran setting will not  aid you as it 95% luck and 5% strategy. The enemies will score critical hits and kills on you in no time on Veteran while on rookie you can get really lucky and stand out in the open and they will miss you. I think it's best to start on Veteran and play through as far as you can multiple times and then play on rookie once you decide to swallow your pride. I peronsally started over on Veteran 7 times before I finally just wanted to see the story. There is an awesome story to this game but you won't see it on Veteran unless you want to reload multiple times. All in all beside the luck variables it's a great game worth playing.			"

												It's incredibly much like its predecessor, adding very little and mildly remixing or removing a lot of aspects that made Enemy Within such a balanced spread of fun and depth of strategy.  The ship's room-building strategy feels incomplete and profoundly unrewarding, basically a chore.  One room type seems to exist for the sake of a single mission (ship defense), without a clue that it's a one-off, so you can easily waste time and money building it in anticipation of a repeat which never comes.The story is PURE face-palm.  I was transfixed by the generic awfulness of the ending, I thought perhaps it was a parody of some kind, but the game takes itself far too seriously.Bugs also abound - enemies that do nothing except watch you shoot at them turn after turn until they're dead, and soldiers that sometimes can't move.  I'd swear one or two of the soldier advanced skills basically do nothing.Graphically it's mediocre and not much of a step up from its predecessor.  Outside of cutscenes, character lips don't move even if they're talking and looking right at you.  Creature designs are weak, partly being meh variations on its predecessor, partly being super-generic (sectopod!), and in one or two cases completely laughable (hi, breasty-snake!).Pick up Enemy Within for a cheaper, extremely similar but superior strategy experience.  Skip this one and wait for the inevitable XCOM 3. "

												Hello.Xcom 2 is fun, there is no denying it and that is probably the only reason why it has achieved so many positive reviews. What the reviews all seem to ignore are the incredible number of bugs and general instability of the game. Please find below my systems specs, a list of bugs which i have encountered and the relative frequency at which they fudge up my experience.Windows 10Gtx Titan x SC editioni7 3770k @ 4.3ghz16gb ddr 31tb samsung evo ssd960gb sandisk ssd1. Game crashing to the point that my pc either restarts itself or I have to hard restart. The game crashes 90% of the time i play it, this is not an exaggeration.2. Very poor performance - the fps are all over the place, the game is way more demanding than it should be - relative to how it looks and the amount of action taking place at any given point.3. My soldiers or the enemy shooting each other through solid cover and other line of sight obscuring objects.4. Action cam showing bullets actually hitting the enemy and then registering as a miss.5. Sound bug where only the music remains and all other effects are not played or are very muted.6. Stuck animations, i.e. the constricted animation not ending after constriction has been released.When Batman AK and BF4 launched they both released in better shape than this game and were torn to pieces by the media and gamers alike, somehow it feels like Firaxis have gotten away with it and I have no idea why. It is incredibly disrespectful to your fanbase to expect payment for such a poor quality release; goodwill doesnt come easy and it feels like Firaxis need a reality check.Bottom line - avoid hours of frustration and dont buy it until they stop alpha testing their game and fix it.

												I believe that the somewhat lower reviews for this game, comparing with the previous one, are just fair. This is simply not as good as the previous XCOM. It has a lot of performance issues, incredible long loading times even on SSD, and that 720p resolution looks simply awful - don't buy unless you can play in Full HD. There were some gameplay changes that made no sense: why to remove the pistols (except for snipers) ?, while others were well done: overwatching shots are not all spend on the first target that moves, like in the first game. Same thing for history. It wasn't as interesting for me as the one from the first game, but yet, they deserve credit for introducing variety and not making an entire equal game. Now the aliens control Earth, and our base is a airship that moves around the planet, which obviously also affects gameplay and gives a refreshed strategy experience.Another big difference is the difficult level. The previous XCOM was difficult, but this one is even worse. I played the previous one in Ironmode, but this one I had to use a lot of save and load ""cheat"" just not to get crushed, and I'm not sure if I even want to try Ironmode. However, the special missions are easier on this one (didn't need to load and save on neither and no soldiers lost - not even close). The base defense one was a piece of cake (while on the previously one was VERY difficult), and the final mission was not very challenging. Normal missions were way more difficult.Oh, btw, timed missions suck.But overall, it's still a very good game, because it's still the XCOM formula, with great mechanics and great gameplay.			"

												I love Xcom, and this is no exception. Sadly I can't leave a recommendation for Xcom 2 on the basis that I can't even play it. My system exceeds the requirements and it runs well when I am actually in the game however after roughly ten minutes or so after launching Xcom 2 it crashes to desktop with a message that ""Xcom 2 has stopped responding"" I then have to close out and restart the application. This has made the game entirely unplayable and a huge disapointment I wish I would have waited before purchasing.			"

												The Game is not well designed. It's quite easy to run into a status, where missions cannot be finished anymore, because the aliens are too strong. And then there is no chance to come back into the game - the last chance is to delete everything and start from the scratch. It's not a problem if it's hard gameplay and a mission requires to restart s few times - but if every mission is too hard ... sorry, the game design of the campaign should be better and avoid this kind of frustration!!! I played all parts of XCOM, from the real first one.			"

												Basically a $60 paperweight on my harddrive.Freezes more than popsicles in a sub zero environment.Crashes more than a drunk driverBut no seriously, getting down to the actuality of it. This game was made in November of 2015. We shouldn't still see reviews for ""buggy and glitchy""♥♥♥♥♥♥should've been fixed a long time ago. Currently having an issue with this game that causes a crash then a black screen and a persistant ""steam cloud sync is finishing"" message which causes all over games to crash when opening my computer.Customer support was of 0 help, I got robotic replies for almost a month (on purpose so i most likely couldn't refund it), then when I finally got help, I demanded somebody give me money back for this, then was immediately shafted by the customer service of 2kGames.Too bad I was a huge fan of the rest of their games. Would appear I no longer will purchase from 2kGames solely due to the way I was treated, and the way they handle themselves. The last response I got from a human was ""You may want to seek help from a computer professional with the issues you are having with XCOM2""...uhh isn't that why i'm asking you for help in the first place?8/10 for gameplay when it freaking works.but 1/10 overall, just an honest mess that shouldnt've been released.

												I would say overall I recommend this game, calls back to the old games in many ways. Fun engaging, flexibility in manuvering your characters, as as well as specific and general skills associated with classes makes the engagements fun and interesting.  It is also a beautiful game.However; the game is a bit buggy, and suffers from framerate dips. I have a 4.2 ghz 5820k 16GB ddr4 2667mhz, 980GTX and i was getting sometimes 15-30 fps at times. That is inexcusable. Combine that with the occasional graphical glitch or black screen with the UI overlay ""alien activity"" with sound the only indicator the game did not crash.Would I recommend it? Yes and no. Yes in the fact that its a good successor to the other xcom games, fun, interesting and engaging, deep complex combat, skills, and characters, challenging depending on the setting you put it at(set it at verteran or above be prepared to reload the game lol). And then No, for the bugginess of the game. I would say if you are willing to put up with the bugs, errors, and performance issues; Go for it, you won't be sorry. It is a great purchase. But for me I got a refund and I will come back to it when a patch or 2 resolves the issues plaguing it right now.			"

												XCOM 2 is a great leap forward, bringing a classic franchise to par with all the new AAA titles coming out in 2016. Everything that was annoying in the first ""new"" XCOM was fixed or removed, and anything that was awesome was improved even further. From basic combat mechanics, through incredible character customisation (which made me actually care for my soldiers) and great range of both familiar and new enemies. The game is a gem to every turn-based strategy lover, and its graphical fidelity surpasses many mainstream first person shooters (and every console game in existence). With interesting (but not too deep) plot, and immersive gameplay XCOM drags you into a world dominated by so-called ""Elders"" - an acient alien race wandering through the galaxy, conquering countless worlds in pursuit of new spiecies to ""cure"". You ever get this ""one more turn"" feeling?Then prepare for the new ""one more mission"" complusive disorder, cause XCOM won't just let you leave.XCOM 2 is a must-have for any strategy fans, and DLCs add a little bit of content (not a huge lot, by no means neccessary to fully enjoy the game itself, but provide some re-play value).

												It pains me to write this, considering that I'm a very huge fan of Enemy Unknown. I confess that I have not played any of the other titles, but that's an irrevelant point. While the core mechanics and gameplay are solid, as well as nice visual, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. As noted, there are many instances of hiccups and awkward in-game delays. For example, after a unit is killed, there is a rather lengthy pause. I also experienced clipping/invisible enemies on the map. Some of these issues are not entirely gamebreaking though, but it is rather jarring. The pre-mission loading screen takes too long, and if you read the other reviews, you'll find out more issues. It also doesn't help that the chance to hit relies entirely on RNG. I'm not sure where to begin. But the aim/hit system is incredibly inconsistent. Throughout the majority of the game, I lost count how many ""misses"" I experienced on our end. My sharshooter has missed plenty of ""90% hit"" shots. I also notice that enemies such as Vipers (from across the map) have better firing on my team than vice versa. I'm also not sure how the ""positioning/aiming"" system actually works, but there were instances where I would come around a covering, only to find that I would have a less than 70% chance of killing an EXPOSED enemy a few tiles ahead of me. I also notice that the game really throws everything at you from the get-go. More often than not, you'll be stuck with rookie soldiers on your first playthrough. I love playing tactically, and spamming my Overwatch just to be sure, but these time-based missions force you to rush against the constant assault by the enemy. It wouldn't be so bad, but they throw in these Sectoids of whom have an extreme high range of panicking/mind controlling your squad. There is certainly an unforgiving pace, but only for the wrong reasons. The first game had a perfect balance and pace, but this just seems to really throw the nuke at you when you're not careful. If it weren't for the mods adding a support class and allowing benched soldiers XP, I probably wouldn't have gotten as far as I did. Not only does the game need a technical patch, they really need to reevaluate some of the balancing in the enemies and allow current players some breathing room. I pity the ironmen out there.			"

												First thing you need to know, combat mechanics are pretty much copied from part 1. Same infuriating, pre-calculated RNG, same LoS issues. I'm not sure if there is flying armor in this one, but I bet it will be just as horrible as i remember it from EU.Second thing, the game is stupidly hard right out of the gate. You are playing bunch of hobos fighting alien military (with borderline cheating skills sometimes), and it will make you want to throw the monitor out of the window. Once you manage to claw your way to better gear and ranks, things will get more enjoyable. You will still get horribly wiped, but at least you will be able to return the favour.Technical issues are present, but they don't affect the gameplay, and in general don't make me want to tear my eyes out. They will be patched anyway.Notorious timers, while annoying, aren't too stressful - you can easily finish them with 3-4 turns left if you play aggresively. Global map timer, while intimidating, for now behaves pretty much as panic levels in previous game (including reverts).With all those things said, game improved in pretty much every aspect. Economy is more interesting, soldier progression is hugely improved. Fighting is definetely more ""interesting"" as well, for better or worse. Most of problems are either temporary, or inherent to the series. Highly recommend it.			"

I have roughly 1300 hours played on XCOM 2012, and perhaps 150 hours played on XCOM 2. I believe that should be enough to make a decent evaluation.The graphics are cartoony in its nature, with very basic shadow and modeling in general for a modern game. There are nice animations, though some are exaggerated (mostly rangers), and a lot of clipping issues. The air of the game is interesting, but very different from XCOM 2012, with a lot less creepy environments and a lot more clean shadowless surfaces.The game has an odd pacing build up, where the first parts of the game is much harder than the later parts. This was an issue in XCOM 2012, and it has not been addressed in this sequal. Quite the opposite, the game is even less forgiving now than it has ever been. Beside the odd pacing (which has no place in a modern game), some missions are badly built. As an example: there are missions where you are supposed to protect a certain device from being destroyed. In the early parts of the game, this device will last the onslaught of aliens for half a dozen rounds or more. In the latter parts of the game, you can end up being unable to reach the device in any way, before it's been destroyed. To be specific, these missions require you to move to the device, which may take several rounds, and the device may be destroyed in round 1, making the mission an autofail mission. That is simply bad game design. Fortunatley, there are mods in the workshp that takes care of such issues, but one has to observe that if players have to spend free time ""fixing"" a game, then the game was poorly made. These issues are accelerated by most missions being on a timer, giving you less time to make tactical choices that you prefer. Again: there are mods removing these constraints. But as I said, if a player made mod has to fix your game, then it was a bad game.LOS issues have not been addressed since XCOM 2012, and are in some cases worse in this iteration. Pods (groups) of aliens will spot you through concrete roofs, walls and floors, in spite of not having any abilities listed that would allow them to do so (humans will also spot you through roofs, walls and floors). There is a tool in the game, a small crosshair, which tells you if you can hit your opponent from a new vantage point. But the tool is also bugged and will give you false reports. Destruction of environment (such as razing a wall to the ground) may have the counter intuitive effect of making the target, who is now standing in the open, invisible to someone who previously had LOS. Aliens sometimes clip from one place to another, they fail to trigger overwatch shots even though they should. At times they are immune to grenades in spite of the in game tools telling you they were hit. Other times, your abilities will not function, or their effects will be ignored by the aliens, making it a curious gamble to use them.I could go on for some time, listing bugs. A quick google on ""XCOM 2 bugs"" will net you long lists of bugs, several which will ruin a mission (and on higher difficulties, a ruined mission may mean a ruined campaign) and none which are preventable by the game designers. Some features cannot be used properly. Example: The game features an ironman save, which means there is always just one save, and you have to own up to your mistakes. But the feature, much like in XCOM 2012, is unusable since the game is laced with so many bugs. If you are subject to a bug and the round ends, the game will save the results of the bug. The only way to prevent it is to force quit via task manager, which you as a player should not have to do.XCOM 2012 used a type of RNG called LCG, which is an obsolete and generally very bad type of RNG. The RNG produces bits of which some are more random, and some are less random. Both XCOM 2012 and XCOM 2 uses the least random bits. That means the game is prone to very long streaks of similar numbers. This in turn means that while a lot of rage towards XCOM is about cognitive bias... That is: the human mind having an easier time to remember failure compared to success, or assuming that previous results in an RNG effects the next result, which it does not. While this is certainly true, the game does in fact suck at creating random rolls. It will produce long streaks of similar numbers, and will do so on a regular basis. Over the course of a whole game, the hit chances will be correct. That is, 50% of all shots taken with 50% chance to hit, will hit. However, it will not have a random distribution of those hits, and they will streak often. That means one can expect the hits and misses to come in bursts, rather than distributed randomly.In XCOM 2012, just like in XCOM 2, game designers have decided to represent hit chances with percentages. This is in spite of many players not actually understanding how percentages work. There are numerous posts by people saying that it's odd that they missed a 90% shot. But it isn't. One in ten shots will miss, and you certainly tend to take at least ten if not more shots during a mission, never mind several missions. To represent hit chances in a way that many do not understand is also poor design, especially when the percentages lack an explanation. 85% chance to hit is roughly the same risk of missing as rolling a six on a normal die. Not at all uncommon, and certainly not a very likely shot when the soldiers life depends on it hitting.Now, as for my experience:Both XCOM 2012 and XCOM 2 give me the same pleasure. I am aware that the game may be very hard, and I am aware that I may fail. But the possibility of failure, and having to live down that failure, is the appeal for me. I like the game as long as I am challenged (I typically play until I have the best armor and weapons, then quit and start a new campaign), and I forsee this game (just as XCOM 2012) will provide me with a lot of fun.However. Do I recommend the game? I recommend the game to players who do not get provoked by bugs, and who accept failure when it comes with a sense of wish to push on. This is not a game for impatient players, or casual players in general. The game will demand your time and energy, and you will at times feel like the game is against you or that you are a bad player because you fail. But you're not. Losing that top tier sniper is part of the game, and a part of playing XCOM is to accept that there will be losses on your side. You may lose the entire game, and it might not be your fault (bad luck can end a whole campaign on higher difficulties).But a general recommendation? No. This is a poorly made game, with bad design choices, filled with bugs. This is not a game of quality, and certainly not of the quality one could expect in 2016. If I were to recommend it because I personally enjoy the game, I would be doing other players a disservice. I cannot in good conscience recommend a game which the developers have launched before it's been properly tested and fixed.			"

												I've only played this game for a few hours and I'm already frustrated enough to put it down. Most fights end up with incredibly unbalanced hit chances, it might say 60% but it's more like %25 hit chance. Also each fight is a rush to the objective, giving you no time to build a strategy. Don't try and think of a better way of going about the mission either, each mission is random, so no way to learn from your mistakes.			"

												Not long started playing the game (Family sharing with my Cousin)I'm on the second mission and already it crashes... The first one was prone to issues with freezing and crashing.I'm glad I had literally saved right before taking the last turn, else I would have lost the entire missions progress.So far, my views are mixed. Due to the crash, I'm going to not recommend this game.I'll continue to play and update my review much later.I'd also like to add that games that cut DLC out of a game to then charge us for it later is a real off put. This is why I've stopped buying and playing Call of Duty. Do not become like them. The fact the DLC was available for pre-order means it was planned with release. DLC should be content added much later down the line, a real expansion. Not just a few skins, couple of extra guns, one mission etc... It's ridiculous. Another reason why I don't recommend this game.			"

												Ok, Point one. The gameplay and graphics are solid and I loved the first game. This is a good sequel exept for one thing. It is WAY to f**king hard! I mean, I started the game on veteran (normal) and when i couldnt beat a mission without my entire squad getting massacred I decided to bump the difficulty down to Rookie (Easy). I spent TWO AND A HALF HOURS trying to beat the SAME MISSION ON EASY! Still havent beaten it. Its a good game, but PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, Turn off the perminant overkill of the enemy's and make it actually balenced. PLease. Im begging you, I dont want to have paid 60 f**cking dollars for a game I cant even beat. Please. For now, Im giving this game a thumbs down and I dont really reccomend it in its current state! So please, in the near future, fix this problem.			"

												Right now, I sadly can't recommend the game; there are simply too many bugs ,and a few design decisions, that make this game more frustrating than enjoyable. The random numbers are pre-generated whenever a new map is loaded. Meaning, sometimes your units WILL miss four times in a row. No matter how you position them, if it's overwatch or not, if the displayed chance to hit 100% or if the enemy is flanked, they will miss four times. So, if you use bad tactics and reload to try something different, you just wasting time because the outcome is already determined.And sometimes the aliens WILL hit, no matter what you do. Even through walls and floors, without them having seen your doomed units previously.Speaking of walls, it seems that they don't block the line of sight very reliable. It's very frustrating if you set up a nice ambush (in the rare case the map doesn't have a VERY tight turn limit), and the aliens notice your units through a wall or door, kill one or two, and poison the rest though the wall without even opening the door.Also, my first campaign save suddenly couldn't be loaded any more; it just crashed the game without any error.I hope Firaxis will fix them eventually, but until then you should better play something less frustrating.

												Im hardcore Ufo: Enemy Unknown fan and i do not approve new reboot. Its too bright, too plastic, too rpg. Difficulty is broken in my opinion, when you do wrong things its hard, when you do right things its easy. Its hard to find middle ground and you play against the dice. But at least its better than XCOM 1 and i admit i enjoyed this game sometimes.More details:- i think that in game like that small squad is a mistake, when you add soldier levels to that it makes losing soldier a big tragedy. In XCOM 2 at least squad size makes sense coz you use gorilla tactics, you do not have big army. Anyway in original you could send 14 soldier to a mission from the beginning of the game. When you lost few soldiers or even half of them during mission you still had plenty. In XCOM 2 when you send 4 soldiers, lose one and other two panic its almost like game itself force you to load save. One way to cancel temptation is play in iron man.- difficulty is artificial in my opinion, when you fight one pack at the time its easy, but when you spot more packs its suddenly hard. Also when you shoot and throw grenades unspotted enemies are ok with that, but look at them, just look, they freak out and attack you :D that makes no sense. Concealment in this game is a joke. Initiative and order of actions is too important. Spoting enemy with first soldier or last soldier often make difference between win or lose. Time mission also just force you to make mistakes. - game have many minor issues in strategic view that makes some game features pointless. For example engineers, important only in the beggining. Scientist are almost useless coz research end very fast. Production of important things is random just to make it longer. Workshop or labolatory is almost pointles, and building slots have buffs that are not needed. Its just busy work. And im spent. Maybe in future I add few more points.			"

A Screenshot of XCOM 2
By: [KRAG] Batman




Edit: After winning a 40 hour game. I will never play XCOM 1 again. They fix so many things in XCOM 2 I don't know where to begin. Abilities in the old game that I would never pick have been buffed to be actually good. If you are losing missions you can scan for supplies and still be making progress. The feeling of the game is really good. At first you feel week but because you are working in the shadows everything seems to be going fine. After you start doing misstions Advent starts uping it's game and it starts to really feel hopeless (I'm guessing this is where many will lose). At the end you feel verying powerful and start having a hope of winning the war. The story is great and feeds into these feeling well. All the soldier classes feel great. There wasn't a single class (exept phsyonics which I never even reaserched and still won) that I felt was not worth bringing. Each choice you when leveling up you charecter is really hard. Only 20% of the time did I feel like one of the abilities I would never use.Concealment really makes the beginning of each mission fun. You feel safer and can get into the action faster. You also feel very powerful when you can take out an entire pod with an ambush. The mission timers really fix the game and add some depth to mission types. Not all missions have timers and not all timers running out mean you lose. The UFO for example will just call another pod to come and kill you if you don't shutdown the distress call in time. The overwatch cam is the best thing ever. The character creator really helps the game be more fun the second time. Make sure to get the mod that lets you start with characters from your pool. It's in my list of must have mods in the comments.There are way more mission types and each one is really fun and different. The procedural maps also add replayability and work really well.My only problems are long loading screens and the occasional bug. If XCOM 1 was a 8/10 XCOM 2 is a 10/10If you want to watch my video review you can do so here. Sorry the video cuts off from time to time. My computer can't handle both XCOM 2 and Twitch at the same time.

												I love XCOM EU and the expansion, modded with several mods + longwar ...but...I can't recommend the game just yet. Seems fun and very mod friendly but that's sso far my experience due to a lot of problems:-poor stability-random CTD-bad performance in  high end system-large amount of memory wasted just in textures? ~32GB-no support for 32bit systems (maybe a possibility to avoid bugs in their UEngine?)When they deliver a decent patch to fix all the crashes and reliability I will update, so far is a waste of money in my library,Shame on you FIRAXISUpdate: I have played the game with the Long War mod and several other additions on my Rig with GTX1070 8GB. It works flawlessly and it is amazing once modded. I hope Firaxis update the engine at some point to be less demanding cuz it's nonsense (check the benchmarks all over the internet)			"

												Though it still retains some of Enemy Unknown's flaws, XCOM 2 is an improvement on its predecessor in almost every way.+ The tactical turn-based combat is as good as ever.+ Sometimes brutal difficulty keeps you on the edge of your seat even more so than the previous game.+ New enemies with new abilities create a threat that's more far diverse than before.+ semi-randomized maps means you won't be visiting the same battlefields over and over.+ Tuned-up graphics, animations and character customization make battles look great.- Planning movement across multiple vertical levels is still awkward and sometimes confusing.- AA options seem poorly optimised, cranking them up can give a huge performance hit.- Camera issues sometimes prevent you from seeing what's going on.

												I feel that writing a review before finishing a game is wrong, but in this case I will make an exception.  I am currently running this game with the following specs: EVGA GTX  980RAM 16gbCPU i5 4670kWIN 7 premium 64 bitMechanical HDD     I am currently playing with everything maxed at 2560X1440, and I honestly don't see any performance issues that are game breaking in any way. I have been reading so many negative comments from people that are experiencing low or inconsistent FPS. Turn off what ever you are using to record the FPS, and stop concentrating on these numbers. This is the biggest way to ruin a game for you. It hurts even more when you have a banging game machine. I used to obsess about FPS, and would beat myself over the head trying to run a game to meet a steady 60 FPS. I had to stop. I realized I was spending too much time worried about FPS, and not enough time actually playing the game.      This game is awesome, and is such a huge improvement over EU, and EW.  There are so many personal stories waiting to be told within this game. I played for only 3 hours, and already experienced some awesome moments, I can't wait to dig deeper.      Firaxis hasn't wronged us. They haven't come to our homes, and kicked our dogs. They just released a game. If you feel ripped off, get a refund. Meanwhile, I'll be mu♥♥♥♥in' save-spamming, and killing sectoids. Peace. "

												WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!The predecessor XCOM: Enemy Unknown might have been difficult to mod, but that's probably the worst thing that could be said about it. Once modded the gameplay was amazing. Especially with the Long War mod.Yes, there were still some things wrong with the predecessor, even after modding.But to call XCOM2 'weak' would really be a shame.Because that would waste the perfect application of the term 'abysmal' for this game.Why?1) The actual premise of shooting down UFOs (that's were the series came from, guys, it was originally called ""UFO: Enemy Unknown"") was totally and completely removed from the game.No more figher planes, no more interceptors, nothing. Simply gone.That's like taking city building out of Civilization. Stupid. Game breaking for me.2) The premise of a small resistance group being able to do what it does in the game is totally ludicruous.But hey, it's sci-fi, it doesn't have to follow logic, right?Wrong. For something that has turned into a terribly stupid economy- and turn-based-combat simulator the game logic is utterly ludicrous again.EVERYONE on the combat map suddenly becomes visible if even ONE soldier is spotted makes for some totally immersion-breaking moments EACH AND EVERY COMBAT MISSION. Why would I keep someone back from the frontlines only to have him suddenly become a target when somebody else who is nearly a mile away is spotted is beyond me.Because now there is NO CHANCE WHATSOEVER of leading the enemies on a wild goose chase by fleeing (visibly) with one soldier and dragging them behind me while the rest of the stealthed team moves in on the mission target. No chance for this basic maneuver. Due to some total balloney BS of a game logic.Strategic map:Yeah, ADVENT is in control of the world, we get it.We don't know anyone around the world who opposes them except our own little group. But we were the greatest force to oppose the aliens 20 years ago. Now we are nothing but a powerless group of gimps trying to get a F'ING HUGE ALIEN SHIP to fly again. Yeah, great logic.While we, as the resistance group on the 'strategic map' (hah, what is strategic about it, can anyone tell me?!?) can't simply broadcast on short-wave radio across the globe to simultaneously reach ALL resistance groups at once. Especially with a damn f'ing huge alien ship (where did it come from, anyway?) can't do a little radio building of our own. Naaah, too logical. Nah, can't be done.Sorry. Stupid logic does not trump sci-fi based logic.This list could go on for quite a few pages.3) A random number generator that generates a new roll every time the game is reloaded but still (and I checked) fails to come up with a number below 43% (which at that time was my chance to hack a heavy advent mec) after 50 (FIFTY) attempts is not a random number generator. Something is fixed there.Or my four failed attempts to successfully apply a dead-eye shot with a final adjusted to-hit percentage of 94% with my plasma sniper rifle, a superior scope, the aiming PCS, and tracer rounds. Yeah, very very likely, that chance.Nuff said, otherwise I'm gonna go random on some developer's a$$.4) A tech tree that is so shallow that you can have it finished after a mere two months game time?Merely three weapon groups (basic, magnetic, plasma). No more laser, no more REASON to have different weapons. Once you reach plasma the end is reached. No more advancement, not even the slightest increment after that. No matter how many scientists you have. No chance to apply your possibly dozens of scientists to upgrading the clip sizes, or the ranges, or the damage, or... or... or...Nothing.Especially the ludicrous game logic of loading electorinic warfare bluescreen BULLETS into a PLASMA rifle. Shouldn't the PLASMA rifle fire PLASMA? Which is a super-heated stated of atomic nuclei stripped of their electrons (therefore being UNABLE TO BE A BULLET ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE MOLECULAR COHESION?)Still only ONE grenade for every soldier except the grenadier who can (hold your breath) carry at best FOUR grenades.WOW! Now that is one hell of a grenadier, right? Especially as he carries an ancient ONE-SHOT grenade launcher design from around the 1940's. Wow, now that is really modern tech, isn't it?Still only ONE ammo type for each soldier. No choices of changing ammo during the mission.No mecs, no cyber-units. Upgrading of specified soldiers abilities of totally boring two choices each level.No adjustability AFTER the fact. Once you pick, you are stuck with it, even when the choice you made turned out to be totally useless (and trust me, there are quite a few really useless abilities in the game, such as all pistol skills for the snipers.)No useful avenger upgrades except those 16 few vertical slots. Again, a flat side-view.Scientists and engineers with as much personality as an Excel spreadsheet.Who would have thought that the original UFO: Enemy Unknown would still have a better base building technique than a game 20 years younger? Not better graphics, no, butter a much more intersting premise.Anyone still remember the 3d- building slots that allowed you to lay out your own base in the original game?With defensive stations that actually did something useful instead of simply upgrading your theoretical defenses. Especially because after the first UFO was evaded in this game I never ever saw another UFO again during my whole game. So what do I need those stupid defense stations for?Boooooring. Snooze-fest!5) A ranged game that has absolutely useless ranges for their weapons.Many weapons have the problem of being barely able to clear a street -across, not lengthwise.Sometimes you have problems of shooting across a room, as that already seems to be beyond the acceptable range for some weapons BECAUSE YOU ALREADY GAIN RANGE PENALTIES FOR IT!Even the sniper rifle is barely able to shoot along a street, much less along a street block of three houses.Come on, my slingshot at home has a greater range (and probably damage) than that stupid sniper rifle.Dito for other classes.The Ranger class that has amazing cinematographics for the first few times they strike down an enemy. After that the enemies become far too tough for that stupid useless toothpick of even the most advanced swordtype to do squat against virtually any enemy except the weakest. And the Ranger's shotgun requires the Ranger to be almost on top of the enemy. Yeaaaah, great. Why not give me a spear and a sling with stones. Maybe I would actually get a better range with that than with my shotgun.Psionic soldiers, errr operatives, that require a clear view of the enemy AND also nearly have to be up close and personal. Blaargh.Nah, don't make me go into more detail.The ranges and even the best upgrades in the tech tree totally suck.6) Bugs and balancing issues still riddle this crash fest of a game.I don't know how often the game crashed during my one play-thru. But I lost count at around 30.When did Firaxis subscribe to the current gaming industry standard of releasing seriously unfinished and untested product?7) And finally, an ending that was so anti-climactic that it nearly put me to sleep.Oh boy, are you guys gonna be surprised the first time you see it.It probably was one of the worst endings in the full UFO series I have ever seen.Nah, not worth it.Forget about this game. Maybe when, or rather IF, some of the Long War modders have finalized a full game overhaul of the complete logic then you might consider this game.But only once this game has landed in the bargain bin of Steam.Cause I wouldn't pay $10 for it in its currents state.But even the most amazing mod won't bring interceptors back again.Sad, sad state of afairs for the gaming industry.

												How should I put it in the simplest of terms...? X-COM 2 really likes to slap the player over his stupid face. If you are a little confused by what I mean, please understand that these words are not to be taken as a complaint or a sign of dissapproval from my part. I actually thoroughly enjoyed X-COM 2. It is – without exaggeration – one of the best, if not THE best turn-based strategy I played in this decade. It is thematically refreshing, cinematic where it needs to be and tactically demanding. And by 'tactically demanding', I mean hard as ♥♥♥♥. Yes, you heard me correctly; so if you consider yourself to be a rather casual player of strategy games, you should sit this one out. This game is cruel and unforgiving; I had to restart my campaign after 14 hours of gameplay just because I had made so many tiny mistakes along the way that, when accumulated, they created a scenario that was unwinnable. Nevertheless, if you take your time, learn from your past mistakes and never cease to improve your tactics, you will, eventually, experience one of the greatest feelings – beating the game for the first time. And for a while, you shall feel truly unvincible... I mean, until you try the Ironman mode and get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you all over again. TO SUM UP: If you love great strategy games with brilliant micro-management, complex systemics and you don't mind turn-based combat and a difficulty setting that will never give you a break, don't you dare waste another minute and go buy this master piece of modern gaming.

												Ok 30 hours of gaming later, I have one finished campaign. Overall opinion? Holy hell this is a GREAT sequel!!!What you WON'T get... Fighters, Skyranger Upgrades, UFO Intercepts, Gene tweaked soldiers, Tanks/Vehicles, MEC Troopers, EXALT, or The same 6 maps over and over and over again.What WILL you get? PLOT! XCOM 2 actually has a story to the campaign, the mechanics of it can make some elements frustrating, but overall this is a VAST improvement. Did you hate Meld timers in EW? Well brace yourself, XCOM 2 makes a LOT of use of timers, albeit much more generous ones. Aside from the elements mentioned, almost everything else traditional about ""XCOM"" and similar titles is here, and generally improved upon. Soldier customization, for example, goes beyond what most MMOs will allow you to do with your character. The game creates all the maps you play on right before loading so you will never see the exact same map twice. While awesome, this feature seems to result in load times that are just a hair on the longish side for modern games. Maps still generally take less than 1 minute to load and, imo, its WELL worth it to have different maps EACH mission. Which brings me to the next ""issue"" with XCOM 2, if you want to nitpick, this thing pushes your cpu cores and gpu FAR FAR harder than its predecessor ever dreamt of. I don't know if this is due to sloppy optimization or just that they crammed that much more under the hood, but my GTX 650ti still handled the game rather well, if on some seriously low end settings. Interestingly, the game still looks better than the previous title even on these lower settings. One thing I am on the fence about is that, in this title, you are pushed to move. Your enemy is working on its ultimate 'I win' project and it cannot be stopped by you during game play, only delayed. This removes the option to go everywhere, do all the side missions, and finish the ""Alien Menace"" at your whim. While, at times, it can seem that the enemy will finish long before you are prepared, 2K was very good about balancing out pacing, and your ability to reduce their progress. For example: At one point they were nearly 3/4 the way finished before I did several major missions back to back and pushed them back to zero. As normal, once you begin the endgame you no longer have access to most of the game features and you have to make do with your soldiers as they are with whatever gear you have in your inventory. On the upside, if you are REALLY short handed for some reason, critical missions will allow you to bring wounded soldiers. Construction order is a bit trickier in this title than others in the same vein, I nearly screwed myself by ignoring the radio room while pursuing psionic tech and soldiers. You WILL spend a lot more time thinking out the consequences of what to build and when. The developers did a fabulous job of simulating the difference between XCOM as a super-black op with funding from around the globe versus XCOM as a barely existent guerrilla force only marginally better equipped than a militia. There are tons and tons of little things in this game that make it an absolutely fantastic TBS, and entry into the XCOM franchise. The addition of a story and some very RPG elements bring the game to the next level, especially when combined with the amazingly robust modding tools 2K provided. The possibilities are mind blowing, and if the mod authors embrace this title, its one we will still be playing 10 years from now and enjoying new stories and user made content. Obviously this also lends itself to giving 2K a huge opportunity for tons of DLC which can help keep the game fresh, interesting and new for years to come.  This one is definitely a ""must own"" for fans of TBS or XCOM.			"

												I really didn't like this game. There's a lot of new things, and some stream lining elements that make some things outside of combat better. But at the heart is the tactical combat gameplay, and that's really gone another direction from the previous XCOM. I personally do not enjoy the timed mission element on every single mission. I know other people do and that's fine. While this change is different compared to the first XCOM, it becomes a pain when every mission is timed. You have to throw caution to the wind to complete the objective, and the game punishes you for that. And if you fail, then game punishes you just as severly in a different way.There's no slow and steady in this game, that tactic is gone. It's now balls to the wall rushing into bad cover and getting nailed. But don't forget to flank! Oh wait, you now can miss quite easily while flanking. Get used to missing even with good shots. I don't think there is even much point to flanking, as you easily get out flanked when flanking. So the risk vs reward isn't there at all. But it seems the AI doesn't have any issue hitting your troops and they will hammer you even when you're in full cover. This game is quite different to the first XCOM, and I honestly don't like XCOM 2 at all. I'm going back to the original which had the right amount of risk vs reward to it.			"

Posted: June 9, 2016
												TL;DR at the bottomIm gonna be totally honest, im giving this game a positive review because there isnt an ""its ok"" rating.  I absolutely loved XCOM: EU and I'm a huge fan of tactial combat and strategy games. Not only did i sink quite a bit of time into XCOM: EU, but i actually bought the iOS version so i could play it when im away from my computer. Like a lot of other fans of XCOM, when i saw XCOM 2 announced and i saw all the trailers for how the game looked and how much more stuff there was going to be in XCOM 2, I almost♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants in excitement. I preordered the game and I was so ♥♥♥♥ing ready to play this game. You can imagine how upset i was when the game launched and was practically unplayable because it ran like♥♥♥♥♥♥for so many people. I was willing to wait however, because i knew this game was going to be great. Promptly after the Launch Day issues were resolved, a lot of people were saying that the game was unplayable, and to an extent, it still is. XCOM 2 is arguably one of the most difficult and punishing squad-based tactical combat strategy games on the market today. When the game first launched and everyone was talking about XCOM 2, i heard a lot of statements that followed the general idea of ""XCOM 2 is the Dark Souls of combat strategy games"".  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY 100% TRUE. Much like dark souls, XCOM 2 does not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your precious little feelings. ""Im sorry to hear that you missed with a 99% chance to hit, but you're still going to die here""  Clearly, there is a lot of XCOM:EU still reminiscent in XCOM 2, but there also isn't. This is why i feel so torn about giving this game a positive review, because i cant give it a neutral review, but i don't think it deserves a negative review. Let me run through the pros and cons real quick.Pros:+Excellent turn-based strategy that you know from XCOM:EU +Abundant customization options (who wouldn't want to slice sectiods in half while wearing a top-hat and monocle?)+DIVERSITY (good lord are there a lot of different enemy types in XCOM 2, which is something that i wish XCOM:EU had. I get that there are elite type enemies in XCOM:EU, but in the end theyre pretty much the same enemies, but stronger. XCOM 2 has a large variety of completely different enemies that have their own seperate abilities, armors, weapons, hopes, dreams, etc.)+MELEE COMBAT (why wasn't this is the vanilla XCOM:EU?)+Mod Support (idk about you guys, but if you arent saving the world as Guy Fieri, Shrek, John Cena, and Hatsune Miku, i think youre playing this game wrong)~Unbalanced Gameplay (I love an uphill battle, and i totally understand that an uphill battle is exactly what the devs were going for when they made the game. After all, youre the resistance. You dont have military-grade stuff, so naturally the enemy will have better weapons and equipment. I put this as an iffy kind of thing as many people might be upset about the steep difficulty curve.)~Lack of customization options (?) (honestly im not sure if this is the right way to put this, but i wish there were more basic styles for faces and hair. I kept getting recruits with the same faces, and i like to think that the resistance were only recruiting people from the same bloodline, but since those people kept dying, i dont think their bloodline would have lasted very long.)Cons:-HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THIS GAME IS HARD (I like an uphill battle, but this game is unfairly difficult. There's the obvious 99% chance to hit situation, but there has been more than one time where i was directly adjacent to an enemy and i had a 35% chance to hit with a melee attack. Not a ranged attack, a MELEE attack. Honestly, the swords would do better to just be a decorative piece than an actual weapon.)-Unoptimized (don't expect to be able to run this on any computer that could just barely run XCOM:EU)-Unoriginal Story line (I really do want to like the story of XCOM 2, but i would have greatly prefered a situation where we did defend earth, but they came back in greater numbers, like the new independence day movie.)-Less than (inter)Stellar voice acting (I didnt find Tygan or Lily to be super interesting characters. Like, i understand that  XCOM:EU's Dr.Shen would have taken a major stand against the alien forces and died doing such, but I find it a little odd that his daughter, who apparently would have been a little girl during the events of XCOM:EU, grew up to do the exact same thing as her father, with the exact same, if not more, skill as her father. Also, where the hell did Dr.Vahlen go? RIP(?))I feel like a lot of the points I've made about the game's difficulty could be best sumarrized by the Best Friends Play XCOM 2 series. I believe there are 7 parts to the series, but im probably wrong about that. They do a great job of going into greater depth about a lot of the topics i've covered here, but then again, theyre considerably bigger losers than i am. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpAdhLcuSjkTL;DRIn the end i have to give this game a 7.5/10If you like games with a 90 degree difficulty curve, smashing keyboards out of anger, and beating your head against a brick wall until you or the wall falls, then you will love this game.Also it helps if youre a fan boy of XCOM:EU and Dark Souls like I am.

												Alright, roughly 14 hours in, I'm going to go ahead and throw in my two cents.First, everything you've heard about perfomance issues? It's true, mostly. XCOM 2 cannot maintain a stable framerate to save its life. Many of the bugs and other issues with visuals return from X:EW. This is true even on the highest end hardware, and its really dissapointing to see a dedicated PC game suffer so much right out the door.If you can get past these issues however, XCOM 2 is an absolute blast to play. The new setting and excelent evolution of the mechanics already established in Enemy Unkown and Within, as well as new featues like concealment and a robust melee system, and use them to form an all-you-can-eat buffet of turn based tactics. Yet despite the fantastic new abilites of your soliders and the rival aliens, none of it feels too unfair. The RNG is still merciless, but more options for garunteed damage and ways to get the maximum efficency out of your turn mean that you have to contend with it far less often. At the same time, it still definitelty retains the ""That's XCOM baby!"" feeling of having the odds suddenly flip for or against you in a single bold move.The only complaint I see some people having is the turn limit placed on some missions. And while it doesn't bother me personally, I can see some people who enjoy taking their time on missions struggling against it.Thankfully, XCOM 2 gives nigh-unrivaled access to its inner workings, thanks to direct access to the same tools used to build the game, downloadable for free with purchase of the game. Even without these, you have ready acess to easily manipulated INI setting, allowing you to change many aspects of the game with little to no experience necessary. And that's just day one. In a few weeks or months, people will probably be able to customize every aspect of their XCOM 2 experience.As such, I highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. If you're worried about performance however, it may be worth your while to hold back a while. After all, the game can only get better from here.			"

												Its got some issues, the optimisation is shocking it runs terribly, i personaly had to edit the .ini files to get a resolution over 1200X800 , certainly more work should of gone into it before release. how much you hold it against the game is up to you.Myself i give it a pass, why? well its been out for 36 hours and ive spent 24 of them in game, so more of a first impressions that a full deep review.The combats better, clearer , more cunstimisation , more gear choices the skills have been ramped up , height bonus got doubled, supression imposes a wopping -50 now over double its previous value. add in armour and all the skills the enemy uses and you end up with a much richer deeper tactical combat.The Geoscape is now a valid tactical level with real choices to make, sure there are time sensitive missions that need to be done as they pop up but between those your free to invest your time as you see fit, generating troops or resources to increase either your economy or to fight back, and a balance needs to be struck, be too aggressive and stall out , be too passive and the aliens can simply win. The base building options are at the same time smaller but also a bit more impactful. you actually have choice rather than being a slave to the satelite nexus spam. whats your first priority? get a guerilla school and some of the old officer training unlocks such as squad size , xp bonus and more loot, go for an advanced warfare facility (how you heal fast) so your troopers are unlocking bonus skills as they level? or maybe you want to push and get a psionics lab out early and get some psychers on the field. Timers! big bone of contention and there is a veritable hurricane of♥♥♥♥♥♥on the forums about it. myself i like them mostly , id like a round or two longer to do my guerilla ops and the defend teh civilian missions are a bit vulnerable to spawn rng. but with over 20 hours in i havent actually lost a mission to them, i have left a trooper behind just couldnt get everyone to da chopper in time.they certainlymake sense thematically , you are an insurgency now after all , take to long and the legions of the enemy will descend on you and swamp you. and they certainly address the issue of overwatch crawling so many relied on. dp you like this design choice? well its personal opinion and im sure there will be ods to remove them if there isnt already, but myself i like thier addition.its a much more agressive game , between the timers and the aliens actively winning the game infront of you and it might not be for everyone. but for me its a glorious breath of fresh air. the new faster pace really forces you to make the most of your troops and to push.im a big fan of 4x and turn based strategy games and i really like this new cranked up xcom. a strong contender for game of the year for me , but i love the genre and have adored the franchise since the release of the original i played back on my amiga , your mileage may vary, if in doubt watch some lets plays and see oh and dont skip the tutorial its full of story and feels!Welcome back commander its good to see you			"

												*I HAVE NOT FINISHED THE GAME SO THIS REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE CURRENTLY*Im conflicted on whether to say this is worth picking up at the moment. Several patches can easily fix issues that are gameplay related. Optimisation wise, there is somethings to be decided. So lets jump into the good, the bad and the ugly.The game picks up in a future where xcom lost in EW (roughly around the 3 month mark from memory). The story is intriguing and the lore is interesting. Some nice throw backs to EW, but nothing super necessary.Graphics -The game looks nice, has a nice 'feel' to it. Things look on point. Enemy pod reveals are cool, the camera can be a little clunky but does give a satisfying feeling most of the time.  Textures are appealing and soliders look cool. Alien designs vary but Xcom 2 does a great job of the models imo.Sound -The soundtrack on this game is stellar. The music gets you right into the spirit of whats going on, the tension exists. Sounds are all nice, game does a great job using audio to its advantage.Gameplay -This is where things get shaky. Starting with difficulty. The game itself is not 'Impossible' and this is very apparent on veteran and lower difficulty. I found commander was a fair challenge. Legend has me ripping my hair out, but thats what you sign up for. The issue is apparent in veteran and lower where the game is disgustingly easy until it spikes.Xcom 2 introduces constant mission timers. I found several issues with this. It seems very divided by players if its good or bad, it creates tension but I found timers were sometimes stupidly short and were too unforgiving. This is reinforced by procuderal generated maps. I have had missions come up where it is not viable for me to reach the objective or vip and get out in time due to the map generation. This is when I have a issue. There is nothing worse than coming into a mission and straight up accepting its a failure because you cannot reach a point in time. MODS CAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND EXTEND TIMERS/TRUE CONCEALMENT.Most of the aliens seem to be implemented well, with the exception of the faceless who punishes the player for doing what the game forces you to rush. Not a great system, but with time you can get strategy to get around these issues.Geoscape wise. Building is more streamlined, unfortunatley the early game is very forceful and you have to take a pretty forced build order. You have to manage time more effectively. Issues arise again from the avatar project and how quickly it can accelerate in comparison to how long it takes you to do things. Optimization -Yeah no. Its not optimized well and that impacts the game significantly. High performance rigs can struggle to pull decent frames when it is not something that appears to be all that demanding. Hopefully the game can be optimized and this fixed.Should you buy it?If you have played EU/EW you have a semi idea of whats going on. The game is a fun TBS with a cool premise and interesting elements.However, do not buy this game if you do not enjoy getting punished constantly. You can extend timers through mods or remove them entirely so dont fear them. I am enjoying the game a lot and am having a lot of fun. The game is in a state where its playable, but some fine tuning could really polish this to be easily game of the year.			"

												Named and customized a Soldier, spent an hour making sure every detail was correct, even got him on the first mission - one shot by sectoid.Will customize again. 5/7 Perfect Score ;) (Imgurians will get it)-----Real Review You Say? Okay.If you enjoyed the latest reboot of XCOM, you will find more of the same in XCOM 2 - the difference being that they actually improved on the reboots original formula. The Overwatch is slightly more intelligent, the enemies more diverse, the strategies you can employ change a bit as well (especially with the ""Concealment"" factor) - there's new mechanics such as the ""hacking"" system which can give varied bonuses, and the new soldier classes are definitely more interesting (even introducing the first melee class in the Ranger) - they definitely feel much more interesting to play with.This game however does move even further away from the base building focus, simplifying it even further from the first game - whether this is a pro or con really depends on your personal opinion of that aspect of the game (I enjoyed the classic XCOM's base building and invasion mechanics, the reboot's base building mechanics felt a bit tacked on, and XCOM2's feel like a 'refined necessary evil' approach has been used - they're nice, but may be too simple)I like the direction they went with the storyline as well, making failure ""canon"" is an interesting leap very few games go with (Halflife being another big one) - that also leads to a lot of interesting story opportunities. It is also a nice play on the fact that XCOM is notorious for its difficulty (this game is a lot more fair than the original XCOM or its Reboot though, at some points could be considered a pinch too easy by some)Overall, if you enjoyed the original XCOM, this game is worth the asking price - if you just enjoy tactics games, I would probably wait for it to go on sale ( possibly 15-25% off ) - as it is still a very solid performer in that regard.

												Release Day Review:While it desperately needs a patch to fix a few game breaking bugs and clean up the optimization, this game is really ♥♥♥♥ing solid. I've have never had something live up to its hype so well. XCOM 2 delivers what seems to be an objectively better gaming experience than Enemy Unknown/Within, while still keeping all of the things that make it the rage-inducing, totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG XCOM we all know and love.Overall, this game has lived up to my expectations and I'm proud as heck of 2K and Firaxis for pulling it off. Well done, devs. I'm impressed.UPDATE: In proper XCOM fashion, I beat the game on a 50% shot. GG			"

												I loved XCOM and XCOM EU; but the fact is that those games were significantly more fun to play, even on high difficulties and ironman.  The mechanics have been shifted past the point of 'frustratingly difficult' to simply 'unfun'.  The randomness generated is not balanced around Ironman or higher difficulties, much less both.  This can lead to, say, your third mission blasting you with three or four Vipers; opponents who stunlock your team one at a time.  When you encounter three opponents who can stunlock you in one pack, and you haven't gotten past a 4 man squad, you immediately lose.This isn't a roguelike where I have some option of variety in the first few levels.  RNG can just wipe out twenty hours.  The game is buggy, but more than that; it's just unfun.			"

												In 2012, an old strategy franchise returned from the dead and showed the gaming community just what real difficulty and real pain is. That game was XCOM: Enemy Unknown, rebooted from a series once known as X-COM and it went on to win not just the pleasure of old fans but gain new fans as well.XCOM 2 is the sequel to Enemy Unknown. Storywise, everything that happened in Enemy Unknown was a fake. The Commander was really a prisoner to the alien invaders and Earth has been conquered and ruled by the aliens with a faction of apparent human symphatizers called ADVENT. As the Commander, you're freed at the beginning of the game and once again, it's up to you to lead the forces of Earth against the aliens, only this time you'll be the attacker.From a gameplay perspective, XCOM 2 is mostly the same. You try your best to keep your soldiers in the best cover you can find and launch attacks on your enemies. What changes is that this time, you start out in Concealment mode. The enemy won't know where you are until you attack or get spotted by them, so this is where strategy comes in as you'll have to pick a perfect opportunity to ambush the enemy. Sounds simple? Well, it wouldn't be XCOM if it was simple now, wouldn't it? This time, certain missions also feature a turn timer which shows how many turns you can take before you fail the mission. With that in mind, you have to get to an objective as quickly as you can while also keeping an eye on the timer. While it may seem like a rush, the timer is mostly fair. You do have enough time to get to an objective, you just need to make the most of Concealment mode. Another new element to the game is the more destructible environment. Putting all of your soldiers on top of a building may not always be such a good idea.And stopping you from reaching those objectives would be the aliens now bolstered by ranks of so-called human volunteers. Some aliens make a return like the Sectoid and Muton but even the ones that returned have completely evolved or have been upgraded. Sectoids are no longer cannon fodder, Floaters have been upgraded to the angelic-looking Archons and the dreaded Sectopods return in a slimmer yet more powerful design. One way or another, the aliens are going to ruin your day, each of them with their own unique way.All is not lost however. Your soldiers may be outnumbered and outgunned, but they're no pushovers. The classes are both similar and different from Enemy Unknown. Snipers now known as Sharpshooters not only make use of Sniper rifles but can learn to use pistols like a gunslinger from the Old West. A new class called the Ranger employs a high-risk, high reward combat style to slash the enemy with swords in melee combat. With the destructible environments, the Grenadier basically becomes the most powerful and valuable class you can have in your squad as you can blow enemies off buildings or those hiding behind cars and other explosive objects. Most importantly, you also can blow up walls and obstacles so that you can reach a objective faster. Rest assured, you're going to have a lot of fun doing that.While XCOM 2 doesn't disappoint in its gameplay, it does in it's optimization. You'd think that having it as a PC-exclusive would make it easier for Firaxis to release a more polished game but nope, that didn't happen. The game is buggy like hell, at least it's mostly visual bugs  but still it can ruin the experience a little bit, especially for the last mission. There's also other weird problems like the aliens' turn taking too long, sudden framerate drops and the like but most players didn't experience anything game-breaking. Hopefully, Firaxis fixes the game soon.All in all, XCOM 2 is a fantastic game and is a textbook example of what devs should do when making a sequel (not the bugs though). If you're one for great turn-based combat and you can stand the pain of watching your men and women die horribly in combat, then you'll love XCOM 2. Just remember when you miss a 95% shot, that's XCOM, baby.			"

												This game is more buggy than XCOM: Enemy Within.Despite that, I feel that it is absolutely a superior game, especially when it comes to playing on the highest difficulty.PROS (compared to XCOM:EU)- Steam Workshop support- Procedurally generated maps- More varied mission objectives- Missions are not an Overwatch-fest- More opportunities to recover from setbacks, allowing for more risk-taking- Each soldier class has at least three builds useful for various purposes on Legendary, as opposed to XCOM:EU's one or maybe two. More builds become viable as the AWC endows soldiers with out-of-class skills. Except for psionic soldiers -- and I haven't fully explored the new SPARK class yet.- No useless options in strategic layer, which is more than I can say for XCOM:EU- Better strategic layer BY FAR despite what other reviewers are saying. Enemy Unknown definitely had a formula for the most optimal choices and was completely predictable from game to game. Impossible difficulty pretty much meant, ""always choose engineers, probably give up South America to the aliens."" In XCOM 2, even on Legendary, I may take completely different research paths depending on what resources I find, what AWC does for my soldiers, the distribution of alien facilities, whether or not my hacks pick up Insight or Enemy Protocol or reduced Scanning Times, where the power cores are located in the Avenger, what's available from HQ or Black Market on a given month, what Dark Events I have to contend with.... etc.- Game music better fits the tone and narrative. I also like how it cross-fades between an ""XCOM"" and ""Alien"" track.- More interesting and likeable characters with better-written dialogue and better delivery on the voice acting- Did they take out ""moving at the speed of death"" from Run and Gun? I think they did. Gah that was such a cringe-worthy line.CONS (compared to XCOM:EU)- Bugs, largely aesthetic. (Programmer-speak: I think when they pre-calculate the outcome of an action, they load stuff up into asynchronous queues that may get out of order, and the engine gets confused as they are dequeued. This leads to the world as the player sees it having incongruities, like windows or terrain being destroyed without any apparent cause.)- I cringe a little when soldiers say, ""What's over there?"" Haderp!- The music is better, but unlike XCOM:EU none of it gives me visions of my soldiers competing in a roller derby :((( lol- Was released at a point in life where I have less time for games ;_;			"

												Great game with many improvements from the game before it: enemy unknown. The idea of being in the resistance and actual resistance OPs and stealth are alluring and great fun. In my time I've finished commander and legend ironman and its been hella fun. The game does have severe performance issues which have not been adressed yet, although are being worked on by firaxis. The moddability in this game makes it a must buy for me though even through all of its performance issues.			"

												tl;dr If you're a fan of XCOM or tactical strategy games, you'll probably enjoy this. The difficulty is steep but for those who like hard games this may be part of the appeal. Performance concerns addressed below(zero spoilers) - For the record my rig is running a Radeon 380 GPU and FX6300 CPU, so nothing too fancy. Upper mid level at best. Now then...Little more in depth(NO SPOILERS): XCOM 2 goes the opposite direction of the first game in terms of plot. Rather than defending the Earth or, as Sid Meier put it, ""playing not to lose"", XCOM 2 puts you in the role of the resistance fighters after the aliens won 20 years prior. Some old characters return, with a cast of new ones as well, and the roster of enemies to kill has increased by quite a bit. Graphically the game looks pretty great. I had lag when I first booted up at the main menu but it was because the game defaulted to maxed out settings. Although my GPU isn't at the very top of the line, it is now running the game quite splendidly with all of the settings maxed except Anti-Aliasing. For some reason that's the only setting that seems to be giving my rig trouble. But it still looks pretty good with that turned down.Sound-wise, it's pretty standard fare. Dramatic music when the xenos spot you, triumphant orchestras when outfitting your squad. It does its work, sounds high quality, and is pleasant to hear but isn't spectacular. But not every studio can afford to hire Jeremy Soule. Performance(CPU) could be better. Considering this is day 1 of release I'm not surprised that the optimization is what it is. Loading screens sometimes lag, turns take maybe a second or two longer than you feel that they should, but overall it's not dreadful. I haven't had any freezing in game at all. Compared to some releases, XCOM 2 feels pretty smooth. My old FX6300 doesn't have any trouble with it, and that's a lower-mid AMD chip. Gameplay is what you would expect from XCOM. Fans of the last game will be able to pretty much jump right into the action. Start off with rookies and no special equipment, promote them as they gain experience and skills, cry when your favorite soldier gets killed by a rogue laser... good stuff. The chance to hit with each attack is percentile based, so bare that in mind. Some players may not enjoy that aspect. Difficulty can be adjusted however so if the game feels too hardcore you may still find a level you enjoy.Graphics - 9/10Sound - 8.5/10Gameplay - 9/10 "

												I have never written a steam review before but feel compelled due to the wave of negativity I have noticed and due to my experience so far!I have put around 14 hours into the game at the time of writing and am having an absolute blast, I love the game, XCOM EU/EW has been the game I have played the most over the last few years and I believe this game has impoved upon that in every way so far!A lot of negativity I have seen is about performance, I obviously can't speak for everyone and I am not a 'hardcore' PC gamer by any means, I bought an Alienware X51 3ish years ago and have not upgraded it in any way and would not know where to start if I had to, my PC is between minimum and recommended specs, i5 processor, NVIDIA GTX 660, 8GB RAM and the game runs fine for me.  I should say I have never looked at FPS counters in games and would only complain if the game was stuttering and impeding my ability to play the game and it isn't, I have noticed some stuttering in the cut scenes and a few times the camera pauses for a few seconds too long but that's it so far - I should also say I have not touched the graphics options so far and am just playing on what the game recommended for my PC on launch so I could probably improve the performance more so if needed.People have also complained about turn timers, I was unsure at first but really like them now, great feeling when you extract your squad with only 1 turn to go!  Makes the game more interesting for me - I used to camp and try to draw the enemy to me in the first game which artificually lengthened missions and did bore me occasionally, I cannot do that any more, at least on the majority of missions and I love it.  The timers also fit the 'guerrilla' theme of the game which I love.  I have noticed there are already mods available to remove and tweak the turn timers as well so this could help people who cannot learn to love the mechanic.Also, the fact modding is intergrated through the steam workshop is brilliant as it makes it more accesilbe to people like me and will only go onto enhance the game and increase it's longevity - which will be good anyway as this games is made to be replayed!Anyway, as I said, for me, I love the game and it is running fine on my PC. I would recommended you give this game a try and if bought via steam directly you can always get a refund if you cannot play!			"

												I really wanted to like this game but it quickly turns in to1. Don't ever get shot2. Kill everything on the first turn or get wrecked3. Reload or start a new game until this is figured outI don't understand how the pod/reveal system is a thing. It doesn't make sense that aliens don't try to attack you until you're close enough, it turns the game into guessing which square, it removes all the creepyness of the original xcom when aliens are opening and closing doors far away from you but you can't see them.It's too bad really.

												Aye, this bloody game, if it was developed properly, would be a masterpiece.

												Welcome to X-COM 2! Good Guy Terrorist Edition!In X-COM 2, you'll be freeing humanity from the clutches of our new alien overlords of 20 years! You play as the commander of the previous game, and with your track record of losing the planet to aliens, you were the first man they spent 2 decades to hire. God help us.But they probably recognise it wasn't your fault, since even the best tactician in the world can't win a fight with sub-standard troops. Which brings us onto 'Rookies'. Rookies are the mystical genetic blend of a stormtrooper's one night stand with a red shirt. Rookies could aim to breathe, miss, and then panic at someone doing it correctly as they are clearly a threat to their existence. Having a squad of rookies is asking for trouble, one panicky little♥♥♥♥♥♥can start a tantrum spiral that would make Dwarf Fortress revel in glee.But in all seriousness, X-COM 2 has been a solid improvement to EU/EW. Even with day 1 bugs it felt solid to play, has a lot of interesting lore and new mechanics, but retains the original X-COM charm of having troops miss stunned enemies at point blank range only to get mindraped by sectoids.

												XCOM® 2 is a 3D-but-isometric-tactical-shoot-them-aliens-up game. The plot boils down to this: extraterrestrial beings have taken over the world and it's your job to take it back. You need to dissect aliens and research their technology in order to find out more about them and come up with ways of defeating them. Positive:The game plays extremely similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Taking cover, shooting, researching, upgrading your base and many other things feel very similar. There are, however, new features that are all built upon that rock solid base that we, or I, know and love. My personal favourite and in my opinion biggest feature is a stealth mode. You can't Metal Gear Solid the game up by silently taking down enemies, but you can now avoid them, sneak around them to set up ambushes and create massive tactical advantages. The game also features a load of new enemies. Most old enemies from XCOM: Enemy Unknown have been genetically modified using human DNA, making for more powerful enemies than ever before, because YES, this game is HARD. I recommend people who aren't familiar with XCOM play XCOM: Enemy Unknown before picking this up.Something XCOM: Enemy Unknown was, in my opinion, already good at got massively improved: character customization! The higher the level of your character, the more you can unlock and the more unique your characters will become. I am a massive fan of extensive character customization and I absolutely love playing around with the customizer in this game. It has a load of options and features something for everyone's taste: wacky, tactical or whatever's inbetween, it's in there somewhere.Negative:I don't have many problems with this game, except for it's framerate. I recommend you watch out with this if your PC has low specifications, because I run it at 30 to 40 FPS, even though this PC can easily handle GTA V on some of the highest settings and still run it at a smooth 60 FPS. My verdict:A solid 8.5/10 "

												I have some experience with older Command and Conquer games, Final Fantasy Tactics: Advance, and Fire Emblem, but this is the first and only XCOM game I'll ever play. I absolutely hate this game, and wish I hadn't thrown away $60 on such an unpolished mess.My main problems with XCOM 2 are (in no order):The game does a very poor job of informing the player about vital mechanics.I hate all four characters: Tygan, Shen, the pilot, and Mass Effect's The Elusive Man after about 80 more years of heavy chainsmoking.The game is way too difficult during the first third, especially for a first-time player.Enemy abilities are never explained. Unless you know beforehand, you have to risk your pawns' very important lives just to know how to fight enemies you've canonically seen before in some form.Attack range is never explicitly shown. FF Tactics: Advance managed to do this beautifully 13 years ago on the GBA.To manually path around hazards, you have to waste a move rather than the game having a competent pathing system.There are too many things happening at any time on the overworld. I have like 6 things to scan, 3 dark events going on, a resistance raid, Avatar Project targets, monthly reports, and research all overlapping each other.The game never tells you that a sniper can't fire his rifle after moving.For some reason, a soldier will be gravely wounded after taking only 4 damage out of 17 health, and I've healed it with a medkit.Supplies are too scarce for the first third of the game. By the final third, I contantly had over 2000 that I couldn't spend on anything.Unless you've already played through XCOM 2, you will not properly lay out the additional rooms you can add to your ship unless you spend even more time and supplies fixing it.After you beat it, it plays some cutscenes, and that's it. No New Game + or anything.Soldiers' voices will often glitch, and play in a language, sometimes even gender, other than what's selected.It's often far too difficult to click on specific tiles when targeting abilities like melee attacks and grenades.It seems like Vipers can grab you from literally across the map.You can have your engineers build ""experimental"" armor, weapons, grenades, and ammunition. This actually means that you throw away at least one elerium core and wait 7-30 days for a random item in that category that you may already have. "

												I loved XCOM Enemy Unkown and XCOM 2 is just better in every way. I hate long reviews so lets keep this short. ProsThe new concealment mechanic is great and makes for some satisfying ambushes.The new soldier classes feel new enough to me ( Ranger & Sharpshooter being my favorite ).The game looks much better and the maps are more immersing. Cons The frame rate seemed to drop at random times and I am not sure why.The timers on most of the missions got old after the first couple. Make sure you save at the start and have auto save on to save you some headache later.To fix I would like to see just troopers in cities and aliens out in the country.  Final view If you are a fan, you already bought this game. If you are new to xcom, I would start off with enemy unkown to get a feel for this game.  "

												If you enjoy any kind of Turn-Based strategy games, or you've played Enemy Unknown. This is everything you expect and 100x more.Difficulty is up to 10, but not to the point where you get frustrated, but to the the point where you feel so motivated to complete the mission.The addition of time pressure to the game overall, as the Alien's secret weapon is in construction, time is of the essence, every second and every move you make in the World Map is crucial, don't waste time or you will feel the consequences. The graphics themselves are wonderful, nothing to write home about, but a definite improvement.The newly added character customisation also adds a whole new experience as you can create your own units or even escort units. The customistation is quite developed for a game like this.Overwatch ability can also create some wonderful moments which can either make you full of pride, as you witness your units totally wreck the opponent or leave you out in the open for attacks.But as always, games like these arent perfect. The whole chance to hit system still feels ♥♥♥♥ed, but not as bad as before. The whole 'you're next to a guy but you have 60% chance to hit' can be aggrevating. But for me atleast it didn't happen too often. Everyone's game experiences varies in how badly ♥♥♥♥ed they can get because of it. The story is a unique one, normally we're defending earth, but now we are trying to take it back from the aliens. It's loosely attached to Enemy Unknown, so if you havent played that you can still play this without knowing what happened before.			"

 JOIN US OR BECOME THEM  EDIT: Lack of optimization. The game is very poorly optimized. very. a lot. not good. I think I need to say this first, the game is awesome, but its optimization not. I press the ""automatically detect hardware recommendation"" the game set all the options on ultra... but the menus run with an important lag (10-15fps), when the ""action camera"" join the scene the fps experience a considerable decrease, about 20fps (but for example explosions or smoke looks perfectly during the game at 60 fps) so the game is poorly optimized at this point. I can run Wild Hunt for example on ultra on 60fps so... Think about it.This is XCOM Enemy Unknown ultra enhanced edition. This is more and better. This is pure XCOM turn-based strategy. XCOM 2 is all the good things the original had (as well as the bad things too) with a lot of new stuff.Now you are behind the enemies lines, XCOM becomes the underdog, acting furtively, in the shadows, they are now an organization declared criminal by the new order...  The time has come to reclaim our world. Now they are not fighting an invasion force, the XCOM project are now against a greater more organised force, with power and resources. And they are really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with you. The new concepts, guerrilla tactics, the implementation of stealth, new enemies, a good variety of mission types, the customization of the weapons (you can add ons like scopes, lanterns, silencers,  enhanced ammunition... modify many aspects), of your soldiers (now you'll miss 'em when they die, if the moment comes... and trust me, surely come), can modify their aspect in a very deep way (but all the male faces are ugly as hell) there's a high level of customization. Your headquarter is really badass now. The maps are open now, you can move about the map freely, until you either stumble into range of an enemy or decide open fire on them, so, this is the guerrilla aspect of the game, you can now prepare an ambush, seek for the better positions before a gunfire or even almost end a fight before the enemies can react at your presence. but the situations can become in a different, very bad for you, scenario in a heartbeat, so you need a plan B, always.  The combat feel so agil and natural. The game is very more dynamic this time. Fights are brutal, raw and complex. The game is really challenging and tough, doesn't forgive a mistake.The environments are procedural battlefields, high-quality procedurally generated maps, there is slums, city centres, forest, suburban spaces, all interesting, richly detailed, destroyable (explosions can start fires that propagate, for example), interactives... (at this point maybe you got your suspicions... the game is amazing in every aspect!)XCOM has a real evocative history now for the first time, with cutscenes, and remarkable characters with a backstory and its own opinions. People you want to save.There are now Dark Events, and will change the game in unpredictable ways. Dark events are ""counter-operations"" undertaken by Advent against XCOM.It's the more exciting turn-based tactical game ever made.Of course it has its minor flaws, soldiers firing the same enemy during overwatch, missing high chance shots with an average of 87.3%... but we're here to suffer, weapons through walls, some glitches, ""weird walls"" when you enter in a building... but nothing really remarkable.The graphics aren't spectacular neither the animations.It's true that the game needs much better optimization, quite. I can run The Division beta or The Witcher 3 on ultra and 60fps but XCOM barely runs, on menus (yeah weird), about 20fps, in battle runs fine.About mods and steam workshop. XCOM 2 has Steam Workshop support, this will improve the game in many ways and make it probably endless. Long War Studios (the team behind XCOM: Enemy Unknown's Long War overhaul) has already produced three mods for XCOM 2, all of which are playable from launch, highly welcome move! This feels like a free DLC because Long War Studios teamed up with developer Firaxis Games, and they've been working together!! so this mods perfectly fit with the core of the game, without problems or complications.Take earth back, commander.

												First of all, I loved the first XCOM, but this one is much of the same, though it seems as though they push you into expert mode from the beginning. (even if you set it to rookie) They pen you against enemies that are way too strong for the units you have available, and your units can't hit crap, (even when it is like 80% chance) I go so frustrated by the constant misses and mission losses due to the misses, that i just gave up on the game. The balancing on this game was poorly done, almost to the point that it is like 80% enemy against your 20%. again, i played and finished the first XCOM on higher difficulty levels, and yet this one is hard to get past first few missions without loosing all your troops.(edit) - I played a bit more, and some of the missions are impossible, and i have only covered four slots in asia, and im supposed to get more in all the planet. There is this countdown to doomsday which is almost impossible to stop since you keep loosing troops because they suck at shooting, and the enemy seems to get every shot dead on the money. (mind i set it to rookie, the easiest level possible.) -The game lags when loading missions, and freezes up on characters when they are captured by the enemy snake dudes. Not sure why it loads so slow since i have the game on a 2TB SSD drive, and I have 64gb of RAM. Honestly this game is crap as it is, and im surprised the devs never repaired the issues with the game.  -The game feels like one of those games that the devs DID want to finish, but the distributor didn't want to spend any more time on the game, so they released it early. We all know potentially awesome games have been ruined because of some suit in an office decided to get the quick buck instead of waiting to make the game right. It plays like a early access game, only there aren't any updates from what I have seen.Im really disappointed, because I loved the old game, and wanted something to fill the void.  Sadly this game is just too buggy and unbalanced to get a thumbs up, and I would give it more thumbs down if I could. Thanks 2k for ruining a franchise.			"

												 An absolutely awesome game that continues the great qualities of the first. Although in XCOM 2 the desperation is palpable, all of EARTH is occupied by the Alien menace that now uses human/alien hybrids called the ""Advent"". Right away the action is reminiscent of the original, which is a good thing! Each action looks like a short film, the firing of the rifles is absolutely beautiful, only multiplied by a rib crunching strike against an enemy trooper. XCOM 2 also puts alot of emphasis on the psychic and psionic threat of the aliens. While you may be safe at a distance from being turned into purple jelly by a plasma ray, an advanced alien might use a technique to make you panic, running maniacally into the enemy only to be slaughtered at close range.  Ive notice some people had complaints about lag, the only times I noticed the lag issues where in the pod before a mission, and I am hoping 2k can quickly solve this problem. Also the loading between each members turn can take awhile. This game has a much more ""Guerilla"" feel, you are trying to create a resistance team to finally crush the alien race. Did I mention Lore? Lore Lore Lore, especially if you were a fan of the last game this one will have you drooling at the mouth. 9/10 Great Job!

												In short summary: This game is glitchy for a AAA game of its status. The actual gameplay can be fun a times, but the player is CONSTANTLY racing againt the clock to finish a mission. Its fine to have a doomsday clock, but it is introduced into the gameplay of xcom much too early, to the point where all of your resources are being spent on expanding territory instead of on squad bonuses. At the time of this review, it will be my 3rd attempt at the game, already facing armored mutons with basic armor and weapons with no high ranking squad members (All the good ones are 20+ days recovery). Its fine to make a hard game, but even on the 2nd highest difficulty, this is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

												I loved the first game, played it on every port of it that was released. I want to love this game. Know what I want more? For it to have 30 FPS and menus that don't lag several seconds behind the mouse even with all settings at low and a machine well over the recommended spec. Simple functionality like rebinding your keyboard STILL hasn't been fixed and it's been almost a year. Do not buy this game, do not give it money.It's a damn shame. Was one of my most anticipated releases that turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments, even with the bugginess and spotty performance that the first game and it's mobile ports had braced me for.

												If you ever played XCOM enemy unknown, you know that many little strategic gameplay details are missing in this game.Things like: field of view, day/night and many more, made the old game challanging and fun.Those strategic gameplay elements are gone. This makes the current XCOM game much simpler and less chellenging.In fact, an excellent strategic game has been turned into an arcade style  game for casual players...Basically unc00l nailed it all in his review...- Timers force you to rush and limit your choices. This makes the game very linear and boring.- Chit chance 90% is in reality more like 20%. You feel cheated by the game all the time. - You don't really have a choice to accept a mission or not, You are allmost allways forced to do what the game tells you to do....- Not enjoyable, even with mods.

												I think I own every X-com title which ever been released so i consider myself a Fan.. This new incarnation of XCOM series is simply good. Its not a good old X-COM but its good. I will talk about single thing which disturbs my game experience so far, which is PERFORMANCE. Game graphic is nothing special (looks like Mass effect), though graphic is not key element of xcom games, but it is very demanding. Considering there are games which looks far far better and runs on average PCs smoothly (yes looking at you Geral of Rivia ala Withcher III) this is quite disappointment. Loading times are quite long even if runned from SSD.I really hope Firaxis will fix performance issues soon.			"

												*BUGS* how is this quality an industry standard now? Its unplanned last minute difficulty changes have completely unbalanced the game, characters will freeze, 100% shots miss (how) ? the reward for out menouvering your opponent is gone. oh and some of the time the enemy will freeze halfway through going somewhere then dissapear. when they reappear where they want to be your squad member takes damage and dies. Also its a pc game so badly optimized that your constantly jumping from 30fps to 3fps or 12 fps or no fps.I appreciate a challenge but ive always hated a cheat. after 35 hours, 4 restarts and more then 70 casualties im done.this would have been great as a demo but how is this the finished product? is it alpha and i dont know?im deleting it at the moment and im going to pursue a refund for this garbage. honestly go play xcom apocolypse or xcom e/w e/u. much better games then this one.how the reviews are so positive is beyond me. guess standards are alot lower in recent years of gaming. Firaxis dont care they have money but if there is ever a patch (even though it shouldnt have needed it) i may look at it again may even fix my review but as it is this game is a kick to the balls of xcom fans.

												Twas a pree fun game while it lasted. But, if i must be perfectly honest, the first XCOM was much better., and ill point out why.  In the 1rst game, the aliens invade the planet, and they have aliens dressed as humans, and there scouting and gathering information. In the 2nd game... somehow the humans are ""semi"" co-existing togheter, the aliens supply the police force known as ADVENT. For me,  XCOM 2 has a much weaker story, and way of a dire importance to missions you do. In the first XCOM, right off the bat, you get to pick which country you play, which gives you a specific perk through-out the entire game,  you get to slowly but surely gear up your weak soldiers, and you really felt there was a progression when you finaly beat a mission that would unlock various alien technologies that you would need for future combat. In XCOM2, altho fun, did not captivate me as much as the 1rst one. The researches were boring, weapons were mundane, and whenever i would research and get something ""amazing"" as they would make it to be, like a armor that makes you run through wall, i was already 3/4 done with the game, and i didnt really care about all the fancy new gadgets XCOM2 has over the 1rst game. Ill give this game a thumbs up, altho no bad, there is no sideways thumb for a 50/50. If you wana get into Xcom, just buy the 1rst game. You WILL be happy with it.6/10 eNjoY =^-^=			"

												Pretty tired of an 81% chance to hit actually being a 0% chance to hit.I have 175 hours into XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within.  I got a lot of play out of that one.  And I preordered the big special edition of this expecting that this one would surpass that.  Well, it didn't.  I finished my first playthrough of the game in about 24 hours and it was very frustrating.  This was before any of the content packs went live (as they were not at launch when I got the game).After seeing all the DLC had been released I loaded it up again eager to try out the new stuff.  But the new stuff, it really isn't that interesting at all.  With Enemy Within there were huge additions to the game.  Mechanized soldiers or bio enhanced ones added new depth to your strategies.  The ones for X2 here mostly added aesthetics, a few interesting but overall useless weapons, and robot soldiers, which is just a retread of the exact same robot soldiers from XCOM  Enemy Within.Here I sit at about 59 hours in a love hate relationship with this game, I actually want to play it again but then I remember all the frustrating things about it.One of the things XCOM2 does is have more urgent missions, which is fun in a way.  You can't overwatch creep through maps, you have to move quickly and you have to take risks.  Unfortunately those risks often end in really bad results.This is a puzzle game.  The puzzle is loading multiple times to get the correct execution so you don't lose any one of your soldiers.  I want to write them off, I really do, but I can't.  For one, I get attached to them since I can custom make my own roster, which is neat.  Jack Bauer, Bear Grylls, Duke Nukem, Lara Croft, it's a dream team.  But it takes so much to level guys up.  And they only advance on getting kills, not participating in a mission.  Support Units, guys with drones that are meant to buff and heal the party, they can't advance if they aren't killing aliens.  Doesn't matter how many missions they run, how many lives they save, if they don't get their kill quota they stay useless.So it takes so long to level up your squad, which means when you lose a guy, it hurts, it hurts a lot.  So you don't want to lose anyone, because there's so many things that put pressure on in the game.  In both playthroughs I could never get the Avatar Countdown to drop below 2 empty squares and ultimately fell apart in my second one. Losing good troops means losing the ability to mitigate the countdown.  And wounding times are so long.  Even when I try to bring along a couple of rookies to make sure I'm padding out my advancement, it's a battle with luck, since they need kills to advance.Some fights keeping a guy alive is all but impossible.  It's a puzzle game.  You keep reloading until you find the right combination of moves and attacks that keeps your squad alive.  And it doesn't help that the game pregens random numbers, meaning you will see the exact same result every time.  Which I find odd there was no option to change the random seed which iirc was added in Xcom (also exists in Civ 5 another Firaxis game).And I wish the devs addressed that, the need to constantly reload, because you have to keep your good guys alive, you can't lose them.  You can't run the end game with a field of rookies and survive without constant reloading.  And the load times are soooo loooonnng.After almost 60 hours, I'm done.  The new content just isn't enough to keep me playing, it's a waste of money.I've been gaming since my dad bought my fam a Commodore 64 in the mid 80's, so maybe I'm just too old.  The kids these days play their Dark Souls and talk about how awesome it is to die all the time and never make it past level 2.I like a challenge, but I don't like frustration.  And there's a fine line.  And I'm going to get a whole bunch of thumbs down because it isn't about whether a review is 'helpful' here, it's about whether or not you agree with someone's opinion.  And old gaming codgers like me are in the minority these days.			"

												Developers missed the balance between fun and frustrating by adding timers to missions. That one simple decision is what turned this game from fun to frustratingly unfun. Outside of the missions with timers, the difficulty is ramped up to a very fun pace due to mind control, swords, and unkown enemies  Quote from top negative review... Which I couldnt have said better. My review for Xcom Within & Uknown was an ""A+"" But this one is tuff for me to love...1.Commander level is like impossible2.Lengendary is like Impossible for sure...I have started over and over again trying to get pass the stage where my troops have some decent gear to surive the onslaught of opponents the ai throws at you and that damn timer clock...(yeah that F-timer clock lol). I even went to normal level vet. and ok I hit more often but cant seem to get over that steep unbalance the game throws at your ill-equpied troops. Yes I understand the human race has lost to the aliens but its still a game that needs some balance for fun. Most youtube vids Ive watched leading up to launch show game crits with ramped up gear and skills...which say once you obtain the game's AI gets kinda steamed rolled but thats not fun either. ;/ Hell I even tried the strategy guides to how to... and ive succeeded to the point I got some decent gear but my troops seem to run into those damn time clock missions and the death con to avatar goes higher do to failure to complete them because most of my squad are wounded from other missions...To sum up I do like the game but I wonder if the developers played this themselves for balance rather than handing out game crtitics skilled and geared up squads to test there game...I find Xcom2 unbalanced in its present state...I shouldnt have to keep fluxing game difficulty level to get passed certain missions...Would love constructive feed back on my review because despite my negative review I keep at it like an Abused Lover trying to make it work....lolEDIT: I have recently aquired some player mods. bellow thanks to ""Commander Cool"" in the comments section of my review and I believe this will turn my frown upside down on the game...I encourage the reader to check out these links...(hell if this works I might even change my negative review! ;)			"

												Will update this once I get home from work, review mostly written for old xcom players.+ The combat has been improved a lot because of small things that makes the game have a much better pacing. As an example they've added the ability to actually see if you have a line of sight on the enemies so that you wont have to worry about it when moving around.+ The new system in which you spawn invisible to the enemies makes the first part of every map more enjoyable because it means you're setting up ambushes instead of hoping for good rng with the pod openings.+ I for one like the new base building system even if it at first glance might look dumbed down. It feels like you wont have to play a certain way IE follow a certain building line that was always the same no matter what.+ So far the enemies have been fun and rewarding to face, and I'm eager to see what they will throw at me for the rest of the game.* Some graphical glitches like weapons or enemies clipping trough walls, pretty much the same as the previous game. It doesn't affect game play unless you really care about graphics.* Difficulty has been scaled down and it feels like if you would play on a difficulty level under commander(classic) it would probably be really easy compared to the previous game.- The AI has a habit of some times running into really stupid positions. As an example I've had two occasions now where AI ran into cars that exploded the next round, instantly killing them. Not sure if intented but I doubt it.- Terrible optimization makes the menu, cutscenes and base almost unplayable. I don't know if this is a common issue but my rig should easily be able to handle this on even the highest graphics. Luckily since it's a turn based game it doesn't affect game play that much.Easily recommend the game for now!			"

												This isn't turn based strategy, it's time management.Every mission has an objective on the other side of the map, that you'll have to retrieve/hack/destroy/etc. Standing in between you and that objective, is a large number of aliens. Sounds fun, right? Good news, it is!That is, until you realize that you're basically not allowed to strategize, due to the comically small time limit you're given to complete these missions. You have a very small amount of turns, to not only achieve your objective, but in some cases, kill off all the remaining enemies on the map. What does this mean? It means rather than sneaking around and being careful in order to achieve a successful attack (aka ""strategy""), you will be making a suicidal dive towards the objective in hopes of getting out in time. This makes gameplay extremely linear, and leads to the inevitable and needless death of countless squad members. Sadly, the time limit that plagues individual missions, plagues the entire campaign as well. I don't want to spoil it for those who plan on getting this, but there is also a very small window to achieve certain events, and failure to do so means campaign over. I also found the side quests overwhelming and not fun at all. They bombard you with a million things all at once, all timed, with zero explanation. Failure to do these things will put you behind in resources, which in turn makes you less prepared on the battlefield. And let's face it, you're gonna get fisted out there on a good day. This game has a lot of potential, but it's poisoned by the fact that you're constantly being shoved from behind, rather than being allowed to enjoy what is otherwise, a beautiful game. If a patch or mod comes along, that fixes this ridiculous time mechanic, then I highly reccommend you pick it up. If not, save your money, because as of now it's Diner Dash with guns.			"

												30~ hours, and a completed game later.I'm very sad to report that XCOM 2 is just not worth the hassle as the games state is right now, below this little essay i will list observations that i've made that will be useful to know prior to purchase.First and foremost I'm a fan of the series and both XCOM ORI and XCOM EW, but this one has, not captured the same fun elements of seemingly unending and important research, interresting buildings and the general planing between the team, the engineers and the scientists.Engineering and the building of facilities is extremely boring, no depth or intruiguing or important bonuses to adjacent rooms. Scientists are just exponentielly decreasing, yet flat, science speed upgrades with names. (Yes somewhat similair to XCOM EWs, I just personally expected more)The worst however is the boring absence of pre-planing required to be successful, and by the time you get anywhere with a plan, some random, un-ignorable, mission interrupts your work + plan.Worst of all though, is the extreme amount of animation time you will be wasting watching an AI doing nothing, before and after it has done anything, for no visible reason, as if it went afk to fix a lamp mid fight.Below here is a list of observations, one or two could be considered spoilers, but they're rather important.

												Woohoo! More alien killing! Time to go after their UFO landings, shoot up everything that comes out of them, and eventually go find some weird aliens with strange psionic powers.Wait... I lost the war? WHAT DO YOU MEAN I LOST THE WAR? I HAVE 100% COMPLETION IN XCOM ENEMY UNKNOWN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!Anyway XCOM 2 is both similar and different to it's predecessor. Similar because much of the gameplay mechanics are the same. You build and research stuff at yer home back, go out to beat up aliens on turn-based tactical maps, then return to yer base to look at all the alien goodies you captures and see if you can learn to make fancier toys to use against them. Different because, well, you lost the last war somehow and the aliens now rule the world, so now you get to be a GORILLA instead of the leader of a multinational special forces unit.The change in circumstances is shown quite nicely. Since you are the ""attacker"" this time, you always have targets to go after and places to go in order to help improve your resistance network. However, it also feels like you are pretty much always starved for resources and forced to make do with whatever you can scrounge together. Eventually this means, of course, that you will scrounge together some power armor and plasma weeapons, but that felt earned after dozens of battles where the technological odds were heavily stacked against me and I had to overcome the foe with superior strategy... or just legging it for the escape area if it was one of those kinds of missions. XDI'm going to play this game some more because there are achievements to unlock and more aliens to shoot and blow up. Also because, well, I had lots of funs doing it. Yes, it's very similar to it's precessor, but enough is different that it feels like a different game with a new experience, rather than just a remake of a proven success.Also you can decorate your characters to look completely silly. That's a nice bonus and even adds to the ""guerilla"" feel of the war you are fighting. Not everyone is going to be dressed up the same like it was some regular army, after all. Therefore, it is perfectly ok to lead your armies into battle under command of the moustached fellow with  a pink hat, purple clothes, and a yellow assault rifle! :PHave funs! Kill all the aliens! o_o			"

												Since the release of Xcom (which wasn't actually the first x-com), many games have tried to copy the turnbased gameplay that these guys did so brilliantly. Some were ok, some were just terrible, but none compared, let alone did any better, than Xcom.Now it's back again with the much anticipated new version with the turn based combat style.Instead of just doing another cookie cutter version though, it seems like they have looked at the tactics and added/changed some things so that players have a slightly new experience with the new tactics. Which imo is great.It has an updated version of that great artstyle and graphics from previously. But it does seem to want some quite high pc specs for a game engine that doesn't seem like it should require them. On my pc it seems to run ok but kind of does stutter/stall a little when switching from birdseye to aiming view just for a second, then goes back to good fps again (30+). Hopefully a patch or driver will help this in the future.So far all up I'd say a 9/10 should be pretty justified, with the slight performance issue stopping it from being 10/10, BUT I won't really know how justified until the end really. So fingers crossed it stays as good as it seems so far and that a driver or game patch helps with that very quick and slight yet noticable stutter/stall at certain times.update- I have noticed lowering some settings has helped with performance a little and it still looks really nice imo. 7 Hours in and oooohhhhhh man this is going to be addicitive for me LOL. Don't you just love digital crack? :P			"

												Finished XCOM 2 today and can't recommend the game enough to those who enjoyed XCOM:Enemy Unknown/Within, or turn-based strategy.Like the previous XCOM, the start of the game can be quite brutal and unforgiving if you don't keep pace with the aliens. I've only just recently played the previous XCOM, so i'd learnt from my mistakes in that game that you have to upgrade weapons/armour ASAP - otherwise you'll just be roasted. Because of that, I didn't have much of a problem on the normal (vertern) difficulty. If you do, don't be afraid to just restart the game and optimise your research/builds/combos better. Once you get past that initial hurdle and have a solid rotation of soldiers, the game feels like it goes down in difficulty. I didn't have any problems past the first 2 or 3 hours until the final level - which is challenging/completely insane IMO. I thought I had got better at turn-based strategy, but that mission just sat me in a corner and explained that this wasn't the case.I finished the game after 43 hours. I'm sure you can do it in less time, and replayability is definitely there. I'm also looking forward to seeing what mods/updates come out for this! Definitely worth the purchase, even at full price IMO.			"

												By now you must have heard about the Issues at launch. It's buggy as F*k is the only way to really describe the current state the game is in. To give you an idea on my final mission I played it in pictures pretty much. Now the game is a true master piece! Took me 58 hours to fully complete my first playthrough. Once it’s fully optimized this will be the most addicting game you’ve played. It’s wicked awesome! I did not have a problem with the turn based clock. I welcomed it and enjoyed it a heck of a lot. It forces you to think different then you do with EU/EW and not rely on overwatch so dam much. If you don’t want it there is a mod for that. It is a different game then EU/EW but with the same mechanics. So you can still go back and enjoy those two master pieces as well. Do I recommend you buy this game? Hecks yea! In a month or two once it’s fully functioning properly.  That’s my review and I’m out!P.S Firaxis if you read this I think the whole Xcom 2 community should get a new piece of DLC for free. Make something else up since I already own the deluxe version.  "

												So now that I've seen some improved performance through the most recent mods such as ""Stop Wasting my Time"" the game has vastly improved to where I now can recommend it. The reason it was a not recommended wasn't because of the gameplay reasons such as timers but due to all the buggy issues with the game.XCOM 2 is the next step in the Firaxis XCOM franchise. The game does a neat job of switching the roles where we are the invaders and some of these features really felt missing in the first XCOM. Concealmeant is without a doubt my favorite system in the game but I also love fighting against the high tier enemies. The thing about fighting a sectopod or a gatekeeper is that when you defeat one of those enemies, it feels great. There are some enemies that are very annoying that I think should've been scrapped and reworked (Stun Lancer for example) because they aren't fun to fight against early on. The story is a strategy game story, it's not supposed to have a Bioshock Infinite level of plot twists. There are a couple of references to the X-COM franchise (Terror From the Deep) but whether or not Firaxis will actually make a TFD I don't know.At $60 the game is currently enjoyable for XCOM fans but not so much for anyone else. The new player experience is pretty bad because they do not give you enough of an introduction to show you all the neat little things about the game. This will make it very hard for newcomers to actually play the game. Of course they can watch a tutorial which is what I would do but the game doesn't teach you how to play that much.Mods will also keep this game alive for a long time. I bet in about a year or so, we will see a Total Conversion Mod where the Rebels fight the Empire in XCOM Empire at War.			"

												Despite what the negitive reviews say, this isn't a half bad game. The only problems are the turn timers and lag but I am 100% sure a patch will fix the lag (Plus the game is moddable anyways so you could always make a mod to fix the frame rate.) and the turn timers make the game much harder which I personally like (However they should be higher on lower difficulties).Pros:Great Concept.Great Gameplay that improves on EU/EW.Much more at stake when playing it (No more sit and stay overwatch bait)Love the base building in this one.The aliens are much much cooler and tougher.Amazing Character Pool and Customization. ""Cons"":Huge FPS problems that will be fixed in a few days.Something that makes the game tough. (Again, no more ""I could move up, or I could overwatch for 5 turns and turtle"")Overall:I feel bad for Jake Solomon... Every bad review is either ♥♥♥♥♥ing about bad optimization (For crying out loud large amounts of games on release are like this, but they get fixed.) or saying that the turn timers ""take the skill out of the game and you just have to mad dash for the objective"".The turn timer isn't that bad for ♥♥♥♥s sakes!!!! Look at most of the YTers playing this, they keep their cool and ususally get to the objective with time to spare. You can mod the turn timers out if you really are that lame and just want to spam overwatch for years.			"

												XCOM 2 is an excellent follow-up to XCOM : Ennemy Unknown and XCOM : Ennemy Within. The game is tense and heavy while also giving you a realm of possibilities when it comes to killing aliens. This time around, your soldiers are on the offensive, and as such, the way you start a mission and set-up an initial ambush on your ennemies can change the odds of a mission. Fortunately or not, things do not always go as planned and the RNG makes for an entertaining but sometimes frustrating game. Ennemies are varied and all troublesome in their own, special way, but your soldiers also feel more resourceful and powerful then ever. The relatively easy to procure Psi Operative Class is so versatile and potentially devastating that you'll always want to have one in your squad. The game can be a little rough around the edges and the mission timers can be a big source of stress, but with the possibility to mod the game to suit your style of gameplay, this point is almost moot. With a few updates from Firaxis and an ongoing mod support, this game could easily be remembered as a classic of PC gaming in the years to come.			"

												Sometimes the 'Do you recommend this game?, Yes or No', really isn't enough. What I want is a 'Oh God Yes' button.This game is incredible. It's the most emotional game I've ever played. The elation you feel when you've had a perfect mission is equal to the depression when you lose half the team. The game is unique, at least for me, in that I constantly feel that the aliens are winning. This isn't a criticism, I'm loving every minute, I agonise about every build decision and every mission I choose.Plus it's nice to have a PC exclusive of this quality occasionaly.Absolutely love this game, (although it seems to enjoy making me suffer).

												Okay. It was patched, so now I can rewrite my review.I've never spiked so many hours into XCOM 2 than I have in any game before. The fact that it has said in the past that I'd played 100 hours total and 100 hours in the last 2 weeks should say something, but considering the absolute gravity and RNG genius this game is, I'm honestly not suprised.RNG strategy games have always been something I've enjoyed, such as the Fire Emblem series. But this was my first XCOM game. I could go on about how good this game is, but I'll keep it short and sweet; I can honestly say that if you are a fan of Fire Emblem or any turn based strategy game of any kind, especially RNG ones, then you will enjoy this game. So long as you have the reccomended specs, that is.			"

												Now it says I've only got 21 hours as of 09/02/2016 but if not for kids and a Job I would have likely had over double that since Thursday's 11pm release...Alien AI:The Aliens seem a lot more aggressive this time round, they will push for that flanking position not just hide in high cover taking pot shots. more melee chars and high HP of the soldiers (in the mid game) make choosing targets wisely the difference between a wounded squad, a depleted one or a dead one.The actual patrolling (Yes the aliens walk around the map when you are concealed not teleport) and reinforcements give extra flavour to the missions.Alien upgrades & Dark Events:These can give missions more much flavour. In EU/EW a sectoid always had 4 or 3 HP (Imp/Class) normal Advent troopers (The lowliest enemy) now have 8 hp when they start off at 4, gives the feeling that the aliens aren't just resting on their laurels while you bleed them.The Dark events are pretty nice too depending on which one you counter (You usually get the option to counter 1 a month) they can give the Aliens higher detection radius when you are concealed, give their troopers poison ammo or insert faceless ones into the civilians in normal maps not just terror sites plus many more that I really don't have the time to sit here and type up :)Customisations:Oh god yes, the basic amount you get for a rookie/squaddie already is more than EU/EW but they all unlock at Sgt level some people don't like this but me personally I only get invested in a soldier once its got a few upgrades and proven itself in battle so 4th rank seems like a fair point... Like I said though if you are one of those people that like customising your soldiers you already get more options for rookies than all the options in EU/EWMap Manipulation(Hacking and Destruction):The hacking is a pretty good mini ""game"" yes its chance based like firing a weapon but it can give a minor change to that map, like disorientating the enemy for 2 turns or it can raise your income on the continent you are fighting on permanently, it can also backfire and make enemy soldiers stronger too or alert all the aliens on the map to your position.Remember the invulnerable floors and ceilings from EU/EW that you wanted to make your soldiers armour out of! They are no more! You can happily waste your heavy ordinance on to bring them down... Pro tip, this is a good way to get rid of enemy turrets if you aren't going to hack them.I've read a few reviews now - just something to settle my itch for Xcom 2 between busy periods at work - and I seem to think people are playing an entirely different game to me.*Removed countering other peoples gripes as there is no point, other than fps issues, l2p*TL;DRProsAlien AI improvement over EU/EWDark EventsAlien UpgradesCustomisationsWeapon Mods Workshop Mods (This is a big one, don't like the timers in missions?

I agree that some gamemechanics could be better.But none the less I like it.I like it because of the stories. No not the main plot though it is good. I mean the stories you and your soldiers forge in the heat of battle. I'm talking about the Heroes that give thir lives for the mission. the friend ships they form in your mind the bon chilling moments when your troops can see the end for their comrades and you know that they went home thinking about how they could have saved them.The game may not keep track of these things but you do. You know which squad members work best together not because of complimenting skills but because somewhere in the RNG they are a team and being there with each other gives them strength.Some of you may see this as mindless ramblings but others know exactly what I speak of. They know the joy, the pain, the anger, and sadness that these soldiers can experience in their journy to protect their families and liberate the world.So I salute these virtual heroes whose lives we lead straight into the gates of hell.

You can't just take two steps and overwatch your way through every map (what some may call ""tactics"") and I enjoy the sense of urgency. People acting like Xcom is some detailed tactical simulator cracks me up, the only tactics in the game is cover and flanking. They're still there.

												Xcom is back and it's baaaaaad. Ok mostly baaaaaad with some bad. Apart from the optimization issues which are varied, your mileage may vary, this game rocks. Apart from performance issues, weird camera angles and riding that mass effect elevator. I've only had one crash to desktop. With regard to the game itself, my only one real criticism is that the game has a small design, pacing issue. It throws everything and the kitchen sink at you. Can't go past a couple of hours on in-game time without some notice popping off. That needs is small fix. Life is stressful enough, no need to butter your customers with more stress. We get it, defending the earth is hard. Missions are tougher than ever and it's thoroughly enjoyable. Timers shooting off? Missing at 97% with a minute on the clock? This game is one stressed round after stress round.9/10 you lose one point for making me look at a butt while skull jacking an advent officer.			"

												So now that I've seen some improved performance through the most recent mods such as ""Stop Wasting my Time"" the game has vastly improved to where I now can recommend it. The reason it was a not recommended wasn't because of the gameplay reasons such as timers but due to all the buggy issues with the game.XCOM 2 is the next step in the Firaxis XCOM franchise. The game does a neat job of switching the roles where we are the invaders and some of these features really felt missing in the first XCOM. Concealmeant is without a doubt my favorite system in the game but I also love fighting against the high tier enemies. The thing about fighting a sectopod or a gatekeeper is that when you defeat one of those enemies, it feels great. There are some enemies that are very annoying that I think should've been scrapped and reworked (Stun Lancer for example) because they aren't fun to fight against early on. The story is a strategy game story, it's not supposed to have a Bioshock Infinite level of plot twists. There are a couple of references to the X-COM franchise (Terror From the Deep) but whether or not Firaxis will actually make a TFD I don't know.At $60 the game is currently enjoyable for XCOM fans but not so much for anyone else. The new player experience is pretty bad because they do not give you enough of an introduction to show you all the neat little things about the game. This will make it very hard for newcomers to actually play the game. Of course they can watch a tutorial which is what I would do but the game doesn't teach you how to play that much.Mods will also keep this game alive for a long time. I bet in about a year or so, we will see a Total Conversion Mod where the Rebels fight the Empire in XCOM Empire at War.			"

												Xcom 2 is an awesome game and raises the bar in squad tactical combat genre.The game has a great story line leading you deeper into the plot as you progress learning new things about the aliens and why they have come to earth.What is unique about Xcom 2 is that your every decision has an impact on your progress to rid the aliens from earth. You will often find yourself making many value judgements of which is the greater evil or most needed benefit of multiple choices of actions. For example when you counter dark events, do you choose the dark event based on the need for what the reward offers you or do you counter the dark event based on stopping the aliens from acquiring a benefit that will make them stronger. Sometimes you get lucky and you get both. When you embark on taking down the dark event are you bringing the right combination of soldiers, experience and equipment to get the job done?Another unique quality about the game is you get an emotional attachment to your soldiers and you find yourself picking favorites. You find some soldiers survive many missions and become powerful veterans while others look like they will last a long time only to see them killed in action. When you experience a loss you feel it in the game and emotionally.  For example, seeing your psi-op solider who just trained for a good month or more get wacked within three missions. You are not paying attention to how many turns your extraction window is and you have soldiers going missing in action. Or how about that unstoppable ranger or that long range sharpshooter who has been dealing death mission after mission and one day his number is up. This is something you must accept when playing Xcom 2 that your soldiers will fall in battle and when they fall you got to pick yourself up and move on without them toward victory.Another unique quality Xcom 2 offers is a constant sense of urgency. You are constantly under pressure. I find myself cursing at the operations guy whenever he opens his mouth telling me the obvious. For example, you may be on a retaliation mission to save a resistance camp. On this type of mission you have to weigh the balance between speed to cover ground quickly (in order to rescue civilians which will easily expose your soldiers to enemy fire) and moving cautiously putting your soldiers in over watch as you hear alien gunfire taking down civilians during a turn. If you move too fast your soldiers may become isolated without over watch support. If you move too slowly you may have over watch support but the civilians are getting massacred. Another pressure mission are the ones I call the “8 turn wonder missions”. You have 8 turns to hack a terminal, escort a vip to an extraction point or to destroy a data relay and all hell stands between you and the objective. Meanwhile as the firefight ensues back and forth, the ops guy pops in reminding you the short window of extraction is getting narrow. These are very challenging missions which can be accomplished but you feel pressure mounting as each turn your soldiers miss their shots, get injured and remain in the same vicinity exchanging gunfire as opposed to moving toward the extraction point.Then there is the pressure of the avatar project. The aliens move very quickly to build the avatar project and if they are successful, then you lose and its game over. Your first assaults on the avatar facilities will be based on your efforts to make contact with local resistance groups in order to land there and blow it up. However there are only so many facilities that are found via making contact and the rest of them you have find via skulljacking advent soldiers. Skulljacking is a daunting task especially when it comes time to jack a codex. Making contact and finding these facilities Is not as easy it looks because you have to manage your intel and your supply between either:  1) improving your soldier’s weapons and gear, 2) improving the avenger or 3) expanding over world finding contacts. While you are busy hustling to gather up intel and supplies the aliens are stacking up the avatar progress quickly.  Then there are those glorious moments during the game when ambushes execute flawlessly. Your soldiers are in the right place with over watch hitting their targets. The terrain feels natural as you watch your sharpshooters take down targets at long range perching from building or hilltops. Your rangers evade enemy overwatch slicing and killing their targets on one hit. Your specialist hack those towers to gain an immediate benefit or you take control of mech unit. Your psy-op soldier takes control of an archon who then lays waste to a group of advent troops. Your skulljack attempts don’t end up costing you soldier or killing target with over watch fire as your ranger stuffs that piece of metal into an advent soldier’s skull.Xcom  2 is a great game. If you like squad tactics using different soldiers with a variety of skills and abilities to take down enemies on many different terrains and environments with all kinds of weapons, ammo, explosives, armor and gear, then Xcom 2 is a must have game. I highly recommend it.			"

												This is a very good addition to the XCOM collection. There are a few nods to previous XCOM games, including a few to the sequel to the original. If you are not a fan of XCOM, you are not likely to think much of this. If you wanted to have more power, you are likely to be disappointed. In general, you are a bit weaker than you were in the previous games in terms of raw firepower, though you have some advantages not afforded to you as wel. It is not an entirely new game, but it is enough of a departure from XCOM Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within to satisfy those who want a good, novel version of XCOM.			"

Was it worth the preorder, yes. Worth its price tag: absolutely.Best moment: final mission, super unlikely to win w/o losing some guys, get a 15% autokill weapon mod to activate on a 38% shot to win the game. Best moment in all of gaming.Only concern-sometimes lag after several hours of gameplay.99/100			"

												I have played the original UFO: Enemy Unknown, and love that game. I also have XCom: Enemy Unknown and have sunk many hours into that game too, and found it very enjoyable. XCOM 2 however is the pièce de résistance, the crème de la crème, and many other french-based metaphors! The game feels balanced, and interesting (even the DLC is well thought out and interesting! you definitely get bang for your buck!), and is just very satisfying for those of a strategic mind. Whether you play with little regard for your dudes (or should I say chumps), or whether you prize each and every one and play 100% risk free (where possible), this game is rewarding and thought out.If I was to say one bad thing about it?

												Now it says I've only got 21 hours as of 09/02/2016 but if not for kids and a Job I would have likely had over double that since Thursday's 11pm release...Alien AI:The Aliens seem a lot more aggressive this time round, they will push for that flanking position not just hide in high cover taking pot shots. more melee chars and high HP of the soldiers (in the mid game) make choosing targets wisely the difference between a wounded squad, a depleted one or a dead one.The actual patrolling (Yes the aliens walk around the map when you are concealed not teleport) and reinforcements give extra flavour to the missions.Alien upgrades & Dark Events:These can give missions more much flavour. In EU/EW a sectoid always had 4 or 3 HP (Imp/Class) normal Advent troopers (The lowliest enemy) now have 8 hp when they start off at 4, gives the feeling that the aliens aren't just resting on their laurels while you bleed them.The Dark events are pretty nice too depending on which one you counter (You usually get the option to counter 1 a month) they can give the Aliens higher detection radius when you are concealed, give their troopers poison ammo or insert faceless ones into the civilians in normal maps not just terror sites plus many more that I really don't have the time to sit here and type up :)Customisations:Oh god yes, the basic amount you get for a rookie/squaddie already is more than EU/EW but they all unlock at Sgt level some people don't like this but me personally I only get invested in a soldier once its got a few upgrades and proven itself in battle so 4th rank seems like a fair point... Like I said though if you are one of those people that like customising your soldiers you already get more options for rookies than all the options in EU/EWMap Manipulation(Hacking and Destruction):The hacking is a pretty good mini ""game"" yes its chance based like firing a weapon but it can give a minor change to that map, like disorientating the enemy for 2 turns or it can raise your income on the continent you are fighting on permanently, it can also backfire and make enemy soldiers stronger too or alert all the aliens on the map to your position.Remember the invulnerable floors and ceilings from EU/EW that you wanted to make your soldiers armour out of! They are no more! You can happily waste your heavy ordinance on to bring them down... Pro tip, this is a good way to get rid of enemy turrets if you aren't going to hack them.I've read a few reviews now - just something to settle my itch for Xcom 2 between busy periods at work - and I seem to think people are playing an entirely different game to me.*Removed countering other peoples gripes as there is no point, other than fps issues, l2p*TL;DRProsAlien AI improvement over EU/EWDark EventsAlien UpgradesCustomisationsWeapon Mods Workshop Mods (This is a big one, don't like the timers in missions?

												34 hours in, playing on Commander ""Classic"" difficulty.  I highly recommend this game.This is a great game, but you need to go into it like playing poker.  You are going to make bets.  A good player makes good bets but understands that sometimes you can lose even when making the ""right call.""  This is why good players do not simply know who is more likely to ""win"" in a binary sense, but what is an appropriate amount to bet.  Along these lines, you must know when to raise, when to go all in, and when to fold.  Preserve your chips for when the odds are highly in your favor, risk little when they favor your opponents.This is one of the only games I have ever played that actually has an organic concept of a ""phyrric victory,"" where you can literally lose the campaign by winning badly a couple times in a row.  A lot of people are complaining about the ""mission turn counter,"" but I would tell you not to listen to these people.  Tight turn limits are an essential element in forcing a very interesting decision of how much you want to risk to achieve victory, and at what cost.For example, I suspect many players (including me) immediatly go for all the ""output damage"" talents on their soldiers in all cases.  However, later in the game accidentally pulling multiple packs is a deadly mistake.  Using scouting talents or soldiers allows you to push quickly toward an objective while reducing the risk of engaging in an unintended large fight.  And if that fight does, unfortunately, happen (as it sometimes will), you have a choice to make: pull the squad out immediatly, or win the fight with heavy wounds?  This is not a game where just winning is enough.  How you win matters, and the tactical level is intimately tied to the strategic level in this regard.There are some annoying technical issues, but they have not impacted my play experience.  YMMV.This game is hard, but it is fair.  Furthermore, it is a game where the computer AI is a worthy opponent and doesn't cheat, which is IMO a huge accomplishment for a turn based strategy game.  If you are the kind of player who loves turn based games for their slower, ""thinking man"" style but is frustrated by the lack of fair challenge out there, you are in for a treat with this one. "

												I've been playing the X-com series since the origional was a demo back in the 90's, and couldn't wait to lace up my alien stompin' boots and save the Earth all over again.  I have to say I am very happy with the results.  From the new story line, to art direction, character customization and of course the workshop modding community, this is a worthy new chapter for the franchise.Until you experience the delicious joy of the Rube-Golbergesque chain of events following a perfectly executed (or horribly botched) ambush you can't even comprehend what you are missing.  Explosions!  Fires!  Collapsing buildings!  Alien Bewbs!  This game has it all.  As of writing this the game has been out for nine days, and this is the earliest I've been able to rip myself away from it long enough to write a review.  As with all X-com titles expect an inexhaustible level of replayability.  Saving the world from alien invasion is not the kind of thing anyone wants to do just once.  It begs to be played over and over again in ever stranger variations of play style.  Make a team of kill crazy explosive experts, or all snipers and one covert scout.  Maybe a team of unarmed psychics.  The world's your oyster, go crazy.This game is not without its detractors for sure.  Many are claiming to have problems with running the game on their systems, but aside from the Skyranger travelling to and from a mission in what seems to be real time, I can't complain on performance.  I beleive the delay is due to the computer building an entirely new randomly constructed map for the mission, so I find it hard to complain over something so cool.  Plus the delay isn't experienced if I load a save game mid mission, just on generation of the map, so small annoyance.  Keep a novel on hand, or take time to do those annoying human requirements like eating and visiting the little commander's room during these times.  Maybe you'd also like creating dialogue for the operatives as they sit on the long flight to and from battle.  If you are confident about your computer's performance specs you will probably be fine.  If you have any doubts about your setup there is a very real chance you will end up disatisfied until the inevitable patch release.  Personally I couldn't have waited any longer for this game to come out.  If I had to wait another month for full optimazion to be completed I might have gone insane.  For me any reservations I had were gone the first time I launched a tox-grenade into an unsuspectiong squad of Advent Troopers.  Oh sheer joy.			"

												Just kind of putting this here to counteract the bad reviews... game runs almost perfectly on my machine and it's one or two pegs lower then the minimum settings. Turn limits aren't in every mission but are frequent, although they do make the game challenging as you can't afford to rest on your laurels because you have to be actively doing something and progressing toward the mission. The turn limit does punish mistakes harshly so it does make me think a lot more on my decisions. Do I put my soldier at risk or do I play safe and fail the mission? If I make a poor move it will set me back a few turns which makes the situation a lot worse depending on how well I was doing up until that point.If anything it adds depth to game and so I welcome its presence. (Plus you can mod it out or have a mod for longer turn timers or timers that only start ticking down once you are revealed or both.)			"

												This is XCOM:EU but a lot better. They took the ""if it aint broken don't fixt it"" route but changed enough things to make the game feel fresh. The most interesting design decision in my opinion is that they made the combat mechanics more complex but at the same time they didn't overload the player with dozens of equipment choices. For every new piece of equipment that they added they removed an old one that wasn't that fun or balanced to use. This way the player doesn't feel like he is overburdened with choices and the game retains it's tactical but also calm gameplay that I love. On the techincal department, I didn't come across game breaking bugs but I did come across some slight performance issues (when using certain abilities that leveled buildings) but nothing too serious, I may be lucky.

												I’ve never played the former edition before, however, XCOM 2 drove me to embrace the gameplay so madly that I had to have both games. It is almost needles to say that they compencate eachother to be instant classics, It’s a testament to it’s high quality and altough XCOM 2 endures performance hiccups on a high-end PC, it is a Game with a lot of improvements compared to its former itteration!Although the game took a lot of time until now I was still not able to complete it. As a strategy lover, this game jumps up to my top 10 my personal best. The high-quality story graphics and sound is a great addition to this installment, the tactical decisions you have to make and the fast paced combat system will keep you engaged for a long time.Aside of the small irritations that I had to overcome this game is one of the best I've ever played in its genre and it was well worth the full price, in addition, you will have a great modding community to enhance your gameplay for a long time to come.This game earns an A for Amazingly good!!To read  the entire review, visit our website:  HERE[mygamexp.net] "

												I'll start this off by saying that I've not experienced any gamebreaking bugs or crashes while playing on this machine.  Performance is wierdly inconsistent but is playable.  I can't speak to the experience that others will have.With that out of the way, this is not a good XCOM game, it's a great game, truly fantastic, but it's not a good XCOM game.  That's okay though, the original UFO defense is one of, if not my favorite games of all time.  I own it on multiple platforms and play Openxcom to this day.Where UFO defense was heavily minimalistic mechanically, with most actions following the same set of rules, XCOM 2 has a great variety of additional features.  This gives this game many more areas in which it can fail or seem unpolished, the complexity and volume of unique mechanics being staggering. This isn't always a bad thing, although balancing certain things equally becomes difficult.  This gives you a greater degree of control and customization as regards units, equipment, and tactics.  Your XCOM is very much your XCOM.  In UFO defense your XCOM had very much a mind of its own, soldiers wouldn't advance how you would like, the missions were unfair as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the main objectives seemed to consciously evade you.XCOM2 does not have that personality, but as a game it is far more ""playable"" than UFO Defense.  You don't need a master's degree in patience and risk management to finish it, and some degree of randomness is removed.  XCOM2 is a handcrafted experience, like a fine Oak table, whereas the original is like a very nice tree that decides to grow through your living room.It is an excellent tactics and management game, perhaps the best of this generation.  I feel that it is almost a disservice to both games, UFO defense being the other, to link them.  This game is unique, well crafted, challenging, and playable.  I very much recommend it.			"

												ivey waited over half a year for this game and now that i have it.... im honestly disapointed, to start out with the game was 80$ and took up 25 gbs of storage, i thought that must mean the that the game was about 2 and a half enemy withins.... but the game was short and the levels didnt have that much varieity, i can look at this game and say that i dont see an 80$ game needing 25gbs of storage, i see a 8-10gbf game costing at most 50$, im still trying to figure out where the other 15gbs are in this game, another tjhing i didnt like was that you had to always play be the games time, in enemy within there were several points where you could do as you please and continue when you were ready, and dont worry about the roumers they are all true and i hate that, i mean its nice but unrealistic, there are also fewer enemies and fewer recearch to do, im pretty sure you can beat this game in under a day if you rushed, the psi operitives is also a bad touch because, personally i prefered it when it was an add on and not its own class because to fully train them it takes forever, this dosent mean i hate the game, it means that if i had to choose i would pick enemy within, with this game i expected about 7 classes, around 11 new alien spicies fighting alongside the original ammont, more unique soldiers, more unique missions, and more combat mechs at your disposial and an evil campaign where you play as the aliens, they dilivered almost none of that, in the end i say if they added more missions, got rid of the avatar project or at least have more build up to it and better ways to combat it, got rid of the constant timer, added new aliens, added an evil campaign and added more classes then the stock options then it would be a great game, but what was dilivered was a game that gose right between decent and good, nothing more, nothing less, if there was a neutral option id use it but im stuck with saying that its good.

												I must admit I was a little cautious about the new canon for this game coming from Xcom:EU but now it looks like a stroke of genius.  You get to stay rooted in earth based tech at the beginning and the path of discovery that is the core of the game is still intact but with new gear and new takes on familiar enemies.Apart from quality of life changes such as the LoS indicator when previewing move positions, buttons to make gear and weapons available when equipping soldiers pre-mission etc, there are also new mechanics such as the concealment system allowing you to start a mission on your terms (usually).  The soldier customisation is back and extensively expanded along with upgraded stylised graphics that really bring you into the dystopian version of earth in the not too distant future.The mission timers that most missions have are not to everyone's tastes but you can mod them out if wanted.  Personally I think they really do add to the game as they are carefully balanced to give you enough time but not too much, assuming you play in an agressive fashion.  If you try to spend your turns doing overwatch creep to try and spring the perfect ambush, yes, you're going to run out of time and pay the price.  Don't do that.  Watch Beaglerush on twitch or youtube to see the sort of approach you need to be taking.There are still some glitches left, but nothing that I've found to be game breaking so far even on Ironman.  Overall this is a legendary game and well worth your time, unless you really hate turn based games.			"

												The game is a nice upgrade of the previous X-Com. Some things they changed take some getting used too and aren't loved by everyone, but I liked most of it. And the easy modding can remedy pretty much anything you don't like about it. There are some performance issues and looong loading times but the game is well worth playing despite that.Some people seem to have issues with bugs but I honestly haven't expierenced anything game breaking.Just a great game overall			"

												Finished XCOM 2 today and can't recommend the game enough to those who enjoyed XCOM:Enemy Unknown/Within, or turn-based strategy.Like the previous XCOM, the start of the game can be quite brutal and unforgiving if you don't keep pace with the aliens. I've only just recently played the previous XCOM, so i'd learnt from my mistakes in that game that you have to upgrade weapons/armour ASAP - otherwise you'll just be roasted. Because of that, I didn't have much of a problem on the normal (vertern) difficulty. If you do, don't be afraid to just restart the game and optimise your research/builds/combos better. Once you get past that initial hurdle and have a solid rotation of soldiers, the game feels like it goes down in difficulty. I didn't have any problems past the first 2 or 3 hours until the final level - which is challenging/completely insane IMO. I thought I had got better at turn-based strategy, but that mission just sat me in a corner and explained that this wasn't the case.I finished the game after 43 hours. I'm sure you can do it in less time, and replayability is definitely there. I'm also looking forward to seeing what mods/updates come out for this! Definitely worth the purchase, even at full price IMO.			"

												XCOM 2 does everything that XCOM 1 did correctly.The problem with the game is that it doesn't do much else.The new classes are fun and intuitive. I enjoy the new mechanics. The story, as far as XCOM games go, is good. Better than the first in that regard.The issue is it just. doesn't. do. very many new things. It feels a lot like the first game. Which is fine, because the first game was great, and honestly I'm not sure what else they could have done.Overall, yes, it's worth the price of admission. You'll find yourself wanting to play this one over and over again, just like the first. I can only assume that once the DLC is online, we'll be getting a game that surpasses XCOM and it's expansion.			"

												Since it seems to be peoples main issue with this game, id like to say IM RUNNING A BUDGET PC AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS. The only thing that isnt 4 years old is the graphics card. I've got an i3 3.2 ghz, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ motherboard, 4 gb DDR3 and then a GTX 960 and SSD. The game did not crash a single time in my play through and the few times a weird situation came up that caused the animations to get confused, the game would time it out and recover beautifully. Back to the main review.XCOM EU/EW was probably my favorite game. The sequel didn't dissapoint in any way. That's a hell of a tall order. Intense and satisfying gameplay and story. It also manages to pull a half-life two and paint a picture of a fascinating new world after the world changing events in the first game. Most series just try and sweep those enormous events under the rug but XCOM 2 embraces them and does so very well.If I try hard i can come up with a few complaints. I miss shooting down and attacking UFOs, through the whole game I was only able to attack 2 but it was like christmas each time. It's a little hard on my 4 year old budget processor so the load screens take a little while. And every now and then a unit animation goes wonky (but then completely recovers every time). It's a beautiful game though, and it's turn-based nature means that it's pretty on even moderate hardware. I'm not sure that I could have come up with less consequential complaints. Maybe the fact that I wasn't a big fan of a main characters hair style. Or the fact that this one important alien suit has these weird mittens that bug me for no reason.I can't think of a game I'd recommend more than this one.			"

												If you have played Xcom: Enemy Unknown and enjoyed it then be prepared for a lot of the same intense fun with the old alian apocalypse. I personally haven't completed the game, but I feel as though I have seen enough to tell you folks that this game is surely worth the buy if you enjoy tactical games such as Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, and/or Chess.It is very deliberate with its ironman mode like fire emblem; it has percentage calculating ""to hit"" measures based off many variable factors like final fantasy tactics; and has great strategical appeal that rivals Chess. The pieces are mostly the same, but position and timing are everything. If you like the difficulty like that of dark souls, you can find it here. The only thing this game really needs now though is for the modding community to completely overhaul it to the terminator theme, just for added appeal. In Xcom2 it would really work. John Connor defeating the machines and all.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Entery date: February 18, 2016I felt this needed to be added. If you buy this game, be aware that the legendary ""to hit"" calculations are very false. Over the course of 20 games I calculated the probability of missing shots 50% or above. I found that on average I was missing shots at a 50% hit rate nearly 6 times in a row on a constant basis on the first mission sometimes happening twice in one play through. I was playing ironman and every game was a fresh start because the system requires that work around. The resulting probability of it occuring twice in the same game is roughly 10000 to 1. now keep in mind that these are misses 50% and above being calculated at exactly 50% so the probabilities of these kinds of misses are infact much much lower... Anyway, missing 6 times in a row was a common occurance but, before the odds become astronomically slim like my results are showing ill tell you the probability of missing 6 shots consecuitively on 4 different occassions: 99999947/53... That's next to a nill chance... however, this had occured a grand total of 15 times. So, either I'm the unluckiest person in the world or this system is completely broken and false at the legendary level.			"

												I am a big fan of the XCOM seires. From the origional with the TU, to the remake with AP.GAMEPLAY:XCOM2 is a refinement on the 2012 remakes origional intentions. The biggest change is that eveything has been rethemed with the idea that XCOM is now a rouge faction with limited support.This minor change makes most of the unpopular changes from the origional really cool. Enemy pods, limited mission selection, and smaller squads, make a whole lot more sense now. Not to mention that the stealth system got a complete overhaul.STORY:I also really did not like how the 2012 remake ended. This Game retcons a lot of that in some pretty cool ways.For the most part you are going to be creating your own stories. War stories.Overall a really solid game if you are a fan of turn based squad tactics.There are some bugs, but most of them are visual and dont affect gameplay.			"

It gives more variety for your missions over all. I'd bet no one can go through the game in it's entirety on their first play through regardless of the difficulty they choose without losing a troop... lol and restarting from a saved point doesn't count. ;)If that sounds like the kind of challenge you enjoy then it's def worth your time and inventment.

												A review for this game can be summed up with answering one question, ""Is this an X-COM"" game?""Yes. Yes it is.You will love, you will laugh, you will throw your mouse from the 10th story window of your appartment, and you'll stay up to late for just one more mission.There are a fair amount of bugs at this early stage, but I suppose those will be fixed with time. The performance is pretty bad right now. Be warned, do not attepmt to play on a potato.Difficulty is good. Which is to say the computer pulls off some serious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t antics at times.

												I'm gonna write two reviews, one for those who already played XCom-enemy unknown and one for all new players who have never heard about Xcom and want to jump in right into xcom2.For those who have already played Xcom1:The game is great! Gameplay speaking it's a wider, better XcomEU. There are a lot more game mechanics, finally the overwatch isn't broken and it's basically the same formula but with more breadth. If you loved Xcom1 you will love Xcom2. I admit the story is not as engagin as the first xcom, probably because it lost a lot of the ""mistery"" sorrounding the abductions and the discovery of your enemy. But you should absolutely get this game.For those who never played Xcom1:go play Xcom1, it's a great game, there is no point in jumping in Xcom2 if you never plaied Xcom1. Do yourself a favour and play Xcom1 first!Overall:- great game- a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking- a lot of hours of gameplay10 out of 10, must buy!			"

												If you enjoyed over watching your way to victory in Xcom Enemy Unknown then Xcom 2 will be something of a culture shock.  You really cannot afford to rest on your laurels when the resident alien force outnumbers and outguns you severely in the early stages. I found it surprisingly punishing on normal difficulty compared to its predecessor.The tactical game play remains intact; there’s better mission variety, a more involving narrative, better soldier customization, randomly generated maps, a wide variety of aliens and weapons and on the whole it’s shinier, prettier and more difficult. There’s already a substantial number of mods available on the Steam workshop so if you’re not keen on those timed objective missions (of which there were a lot) or fancy a new hat  your needs will be met.A word of caution however because the game really would benefit from some bug fixing and better optimization.

												Played through the campaign on commander difficulty in about 40 hours, very few reloads. Aside from some graphical glitches, I only encountered one bug: the chrysalid save game breaking bug (fixed in the first patch). Ive heard a lot about performance issues, but have not had any trouble. The game runs smoothly on my 2 year old game PC.I like most of the changes and new features. Missions with limited turns force you to adapt your playstyle (slightly) and the new classes are quite nice for this. The avatar project bar in the world map may seem threatening, but in reality, it's pretty easy to keep under control. The dark events, however, can have a big impact, which is pretty cool.			"

												If you have played any of the classic X-Com games, or XCOM: Enemy Unknown, give this game a try.  It is, in this players humble opinion, a worthy entry into the franchise.  I haven't played it with the Paid DLC, but have installed the mods from Long War Studio, which adds value but I'm starting to feel some of the mods dilute the experience.  Since I haven't actually completed the game yet (I move too slow on the critical campaign objectives,) my personal recommendation would be to avoid too many mods until you have finished a playthrough without them.  My earliest review of the game was a ""Not Recommended"" due to early technical issues simply getting the game to run (that was immediately after launch, and turned out to be an issue with Steam, NOT XCOM 2.)  All is well now :)			"

												I’ve never played the former edition before, however, XCOM 2 drove me to embrace the gameplay so madly that I had to have both games. It is almost needles to say that they compencate eachother to be instant classics, It’s a testament to it’s high quality and altough XCOM 2 endures performance hiccups on a high-end PC, it is a Game with a lot of improvements compared to its former itteration!Although the game took a lot of time until now I was still not able to complete it. As a strategy lover, this game jumps up to my top 10 my personal best. The high-quality story graphics and sound is a great addition to this installment, the tactical decisions you have to make and the fast paced combat system will keep you engaged for a long time.Aside of the small irritations that I had to overcome this game is one of the best I've ever played in its genre and it was well worth the full price, in addition, you will have a great modding community to enhance your gameplay for a long time to come.This game earns an A for Amazingly good!!To read  the entire review, visit our website:  HERE[mygamexp.net] "

												It's another XCOM game to the mix, the world mechanics are the biggest change as always but combat feel is more or less the same with some new gimmicks. So yes, if you like XCOMs, you maybe like this one too despite all the numerous glitches, bugs and stupidly lazy implementation of RNG. In the end the gameplay felt somewhat one-dimensional too (you sort of do the same kind of stuff with only slight variations here and there, research tree feels very flat etc), though i guess most XCOMs are pretty much on par with that.

												I loved playing this game, even with it's numerous glitches and performance issues. (i7 and 970 GTX, 16gb of ram and still struggled) It was a vast improvement over Enemy Unknown which I loved also, but there's one issue that is keeping me from writing out a long and glowing review. Hopefully it's fixed ASAP, because it was just a crushing turn of events for me. I get to the final mission, it's pretty late at night so I decide to save and go to bed, continuing my ironman campaign the next day. Wrong, I go to load the game this morning and it crashes every time I load the game. As this is Ironman mode I have no other saves, and I literally have to restart the game to finish it. Not sure what causes the issue, but to people that do buy it, be wary of saving on the last mission especially if you're on Ironman.EDIT 2/17/2016: First big patch was released today for the game, it fixed the glitch I had and my game was loadable! I had since moved on and started a new game, accepting it, but it's great to see Firaxis hard at work. My FPS seems to maintain at a steady 60 now as well on High settings due to the numerous performance fixes they deployed. 9/10 would recommend now that the gamebreaking bug is fixed.			"

												This is XCOM:EU but a lot better. They took the ""if it aint broken don't fixt it"" route but changed enough things to make the game feel fresh. The most interesting design decision in my opinion is that they made the combat mechanics more complex but at the same time they didn't overload the player with dozens of equipment choices. For every new piece of equipment that they added they removed an old one that wasn't that fun or balanced to use. This way the player doesn't feel like he is overburdened with choices and the game retains it's tactical but also calm gameplay that I love. On the techincal department, I didn't come across game breaking bugs but I did come across some slight performance issues (when using certain abilities that leveled buildings) but nothing too serious, I may be lucky.

												34 hours in, playing on Commander ""Classic"" difficulty.  I highly recommend this game.This is a great game, but you need to go into it like playing poker.  You are going to make bets.  A good player makes good bets but understands that sometimes you can lose even when making the ""right call.""  This is why good players do not simply know who is more likely to ""win"" in a binary sense, but what is an appropriate amount to bet.  Along these lines, you must know when to raise, when to go all in, and when to fold.  Preserve your chips for when the odds are highly in your favor, risk little when they favor your opponents.This is one of the only games I have ever played that actually has an organic concept of a ""phyrric victory,"" where you can literally lose the campaign by winning badly a couple times in a row.  A lot of people are complaining about the ""mission turn counter,"" but I would tell you not to listen to these people.  Tight turn limits are an essential element in forcing a very interesting decision of how much you want to risk to achieve victory, and at what cost.For example, I suspect many players (including me) immediatly go for all the ""output damage"" talents on their soldiers in all cases.  However, later in the game accidentally pulling multiple packs is a deadly mistake.  Using scouting talents or soldiers allows you to push quickly toward an objective while reducing the risk of engaging in an unintended large fight.  And if that fight does, unfortunately, happen (as it sometimes will), you have a choice to make: pull the squad out immediatly, or win the fight with heavy wounds?  This is not a game where just winning is enough.  How you win matters, and the tactical level is intimately tied to the strategic level in this regard.There are some annoying technical issues, but they have not impacted my play experience.  YMMV.This game is hard, but it is fair.  Furthermore, it is a game where the computer AI is a worthy opponent and doesn't cheat, which is IMO a huge accomplishment for a turn based strategy game.  If you are the kind of player who loves turn based games for their slower, ""thinking man"" style but is frustrated by the lack of fair challenge out there, you are in for a treat with this one. "

												I've been playing the X-com series since the origional was a demo back in the 90's, and couldn't wait to lace up my alien stompin' boots and save the Earth all over again.  I have to say I am very happy with the results.  From the new story line, to art direction, character customization and of course the workshop modding community, this is a worthy new chapter for the franchise.Until you experience the delicious joy of the Rube-Golbergesque chain of events following a perfectly executed (or horribly botched) ambush you can't even comprehend what you are missing.  Explosions!  Fires!  Collapsing buildings!  Alien Bewbs!  This game has it all.  As of writing this the game has been out for nine days, and this is the earliest I've been able to rip myself away from it long enough to write a review.  As with all X-com titles expect an inexhaustible level of replayability.  Saving the world from alien invasion is not the kind of thing anyone wants to do just once.  It begs to be played over and over again in ever stranger variations of play style.  Make a team of kill crazy explosive experts, or all snipers and one covert scout.  Maybe a team of unarmed psychics.  The world's your oyster, go crazy.This game is not without its detractors for sure.  Many are claiming to have problems with running the game on their systems, but aside from the Skyranger travelling to and from a mission in what seems to be real time, I can't complain on performance.  I beleive the delay is due to the computer building an entirely new randomly constructed map for the mission, so I find it hard to complain over something so cool.  Plus the delay isn't experienced if I load a save game mid mission, just on generation of the map, so small annoyance.  Keep a novel on hand, or take time to do those annoying human requirements like eating and visiting the little commander's room during these times.  Maybe you'd also like creating dialogue for the operatives as they sit on the long flight to and from battle.  If you are confident about your computer's performance specs you will probably be fine.  If you have any doubts about your setup there is a very real chance you will end up disatisfied until the inevitable patch release.  Personally I couldn't have waited any longer for this game to come out.  If I had to wait another month for full optimazion to be completed I might have gone insane.  For me any reservations I had were gone the first time I launched a tox-grenade into an unsuspectiong squad of Advent Troopers.  Oh sheer joy.			"

												Had a ton of fun playing through this game, the kind of game I was itching to keep playing and progress in. The XCOM games are highly unique in the way they make every decision absolutely crucial, which in turn makes it incredibly exciting. It's likely that the chance aspect of the game will tick you off at times, but after a while you'll learn how to keep the odds in your favor, and with a dozen missions under your belt, and wisely using the available equipment, you'll be killing aliens left and right without them even touching you.I recommend not abusing saves. This will substantially increase your immersion and enjoyment of the game, making you feel like your decisions are that more important. Stick with your decisions and your mistakes unless it's too devastating. For me personally, I only retried one mission twice, near the beginning, where my whole squad was either killed or MIA. Other than that I suffered through bad decisions, killed soldiers and unecessary injuries, when they occurred.I'm hearing a lot about technical issues with this game.. poor performance, bugs, glitches. When it comes to performance I frankly didn't expect much from my aging rig, with a GTX 660. So with the game running as well as it did, I was more than satisfied. This is also a game that doesn't need a high framerate, giving how it's played. Bugs, glitches or technical issues I hardly noticed, except for once, when there were so much happening on screen it brought my computer to its knees. Maybe I just got lucky, or the worst issues were patched before I started playing.All in all, I can't recommend this game enough. A really unique experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat, caring about keeping your soldiers alive like no other game does. For me it doesn't have much replayability right now, but the close to 50 hours I got out of it was a blast. I'll definitely be back if this game gets a significant expansion, the way Enemy Within was for the previous XCOM.			"

												There is nothing like a game where humanity must work together to survive some kind of apocalypse. In this xase its a small group of resistance fighters which most of you probably know as XCOM. This game greatly builds off XCOM: Enemy unkown, giving you much more options for customizing your squad, you can choose from a plethora of colors and camo's, the new classes are well designed and alot of fun to play. One of my favorite things about this game though is that i have been playing for 47 hours and i still havent seen the same map twice. Im sure this is due to the randomly generated maps. One more thing to love is the day one mods, which was released along with the game. XCOM 2 has your expected story and does it much better then any of the other games, with great cutscenes that are fun to watch.Some things i feel this game could improve on though, something thats not extremely bother but more of a nuisance is the loading times for some missions seems to take a bit. Then you have the problem with the extremely bad lag when playing multiplayer, you will end your turn and the next person will have to wait almost 30 second more before actually taking theirs. And one last thing i have noticed about this game is a audio bug that happens often enough to warrant a fix.All in all I have 47 hours in this game and with the few drawback i stated it dosent take away from the game enough to not pick it up. I expect to have many many more hours of great fun on this game. If your if about it and liked the older games this is definitely something your going to wanna get. "

												Basically a slightly better version of X-com EU/EW (which is already a phenomenal game) with a few new mechanics and a new story, and a lot harder across the board (I was only a few short days away from losing the game at one point).  If you haven't played EU/EW then play that first, but if you liked EU/EW, this is a must have.Some people have complained about framerate problems: I'm running it at max settings on a GTX 980 and I am having some small framerate issues, mainly during cinematics, but the game is completly playable.My biggest con is that there are no truely new classes, they just renamed the ones from EU and give them one or two new abilities.  The Specialist is the only exception, but its uniqueness doesn't really show until around level 4 or 5			"

												X-Com 2 hits all the right notes for a sequel to 2012's X-Com Enemy Unknown. It improves the combat, adds a ton of customization and the story is much more interesting.There were a bevy of bugs during my first playthrough though, including: Enemies just stop attacking until I restarted the game (even after going on to another mission), enemies shooting me through the floor and other LOS issues, and squad abilities not working correctly (the sniper's cone of fire ability just didn't work sometimes). Also, despite having a beefy computer, I ran into various performance issues at 1440p. What X-Com 2 does right, it does wonderfully. Tons of customization, improved combat, better classes with more defined (and varied!) roles, and a sense of foreboding provided by the story which ties the experience together.My first playthrough had a sense of desperation to it, I was barely holding everything together when  the Avenger defense mission happened. I lost a lot of soldiers, but it actually helped my rookies level-up, which became a turning point for me. I really can't wait to see what DLC they release, and I am even more excited for what the modding community has in store.			"

												Fantastic - a further improvement on the previous XCOM's wonderful tactical combat engine combined with a geoscape strategy perfectly hybridizing Terror from the Deep's alien base hunting and UFO: Aftershock's networkbuilding (and flying base!) There are still bugs that need to be ironed out (though I only had two in 50hrs of gameplay), and I'm hoping for a new set of Second Wave difficulty/gameplay customization options, but it's tuly great game.In fact, my only negative reaction is to the title! There are easily a dozen other UFO games, none of which have a number - shouldn't this one really be called XCOM: ADVENT or XCOM: AVENGERS?			"

												My first impressions of this game were mostly frustration given the countdown clocks on missions and the avatar meta-game timer. It drove me crazy. However, driving down that avatar clock piece by piece is one of the most satisifying ""triumph"" moments I've ever had in any video game. Same for the mission timers, nothing feels as good as getting a VIP and your soldiers out with only one turn left. I'm glad I gave this game a second chance, it is a masterpiece. It doesn't hold your hand and respects your intelligence. It can be unforgiving at times but it only makes your triumphs that much sweeter, if everything was a big win it'd get boring fast, getting knocked on your♥♥♥♥♥only to rise from the ashes and crush alien bones is just glorious.

												This game has good basic gameplay that can keep you entertained for quite some time. For anyone who played XCOM enemy unknown this is the same thing with only smaller changes. The changes that has been made however are not for the better. They have for example this turn-timer (you have a certain amount of turns to finish the mission). This takes away a lot of the tactics of going in slow to make a perfect surprise attack. It forces you to run and gun a lot. They’ve also made sure that you have to hurry with the story missions as well or you’re doomed. This makes the psi-soldiers nonexistent. I made only one and never used her. I saw when I finished the game that the overall amount of psi-warriors for a playthrough is 1. ONE! The game is too short and rushed to make you feel a good change (a big difference) in gameplay from beginning to end. It’s more or less the same throughout but with more grenades and more hits towards the end. The character creation has been developed a lot. Sadly it’s only cosmetic. They’ve stuck to professions instead of letting every character be unique with their own mix of abilities and weapons. Also, why not more fun abilities? Even if you want to keep the professions they should of made more of them.I will keep this short. Do you want a solid turn based tactics game and you’ve already finished enemy unknown, then this game is for you. It’s fun. Do however not expect a better or even equal experience as enemy unknown. PS: It works on Linux!			"

												If you enjoyed Enemy Uknown/Within, you're going to like this. It's more of the same but tweaked and changed so it keeps the best while improving on weakness and trimming the fat. It also introduces new elements into the old formula to spice it up, so being experienced with EU/EW is a false sense of security. It took me 58 hours and 3 failed games to finally win on normal difficulty.Familiar enemies have progressed and improved in the wake of the alien victory, presenting new challenges. World/base management has also stepped up consideradbly- where EU/EW boiled down to ""bum rush your satellite production, win game"", here you are more engaged by active counters, lurking UFOs and a doomsday countdown that will WRECK you until you've learned from your failures (more on that in a bit)Character customization and generation is more in depth than ever, so you'll feel even more aguish when your soldiers get critted by some jack-off Muton WHICH IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T BTWSo in my personal experience, I would reccomend it. BUT SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I find the new soundtrack somewhat lacking. It's not that it's bad,  I just think it lost some of the personality that Michael McCann (guy who did the Deus Ex HR soundtrack) brought to EU/EW. Mods can and will remedy this though.- The game can be buggy. For me it's mostly been inexplicable pauses that slow the pace, but some people report some serious issues with LOS. Your mileage may vary. - If you hate time limits...I got some bad news for you. Mods will remove these if they transcend 'challenging' and wind up just ruining the game for you, though.- BEWARE THE ""ALIEN HUNTERS"" DLC. This is my only objective complaint. This DLC is nonsense that at best will put a new player against an even more uphill battle, and at worst will render your game unplayable through game crashes. Save your 10$, you've been warned. -----------------------------------------------------------DEATH TO AYY LMAOS			"

												Can I recommend this game YES, can i highly recommend it YES.I wrote a negative review last time, but after about 10+ month of waiting for a patch that fix the shooting/looking though walls bug, then it seem like after latest patch that the game now play much better.Well If read this, then you properbly already know Xcom series and how to play this turnbased strategy game.But be aware this game work in a little different way.On the big world map you now have a flying base from start-end in the game. You fly from country to country setting up radio towers to earn funds for your operation of xcom. What is pretty cool is that everytime you start a new game then everything is random so the replay value is fantastic, also the battles never play out excactly like last time, since the enemys are also random selected depending on your tech level and how far you are in the campaign.You will without a doubt encounter enemys you already know from the series, but there are also some new ones that you love or hate.  ( properbly hate since they kill your men he he )All in all you will fly arround the map all the time completing random missions that variate from capture vip, to protect resistance HQ against enemy raid..  Sometimes you also get special missions that can alter the course of the campaign. Example you get 3 missions to choose from that all effect what you get out of it different.Example do you want a scientist in reward, you want money, or maybe you want that a hidden event will not happen.Be aware the game take a little time to understand how the new features work and how you move arround on the tactical world map, but once you learn the rules of the game and so on then it is actual pretty good if not excellent.The game AI i think is pretty good and is indeed a challenge. They will assult/run away or maybe flank you.The shooting animation and detail of the graphics are excellent as well.As you know the game is all about research and getting better gear to combat the aliens, and well you are in for a long journey.. There are allot of tech, and in this new xcom game you can even put extra gadjets on your weapons so they become more powerfull or precise.. Why not give you soldiers some armour that if enemy try to thouch you set them on fire... quite handy when one of the anoying snake aliens want to cuddle with you.I recommend that your first campaign will be the most easy level, even if you are experienced.. The game is quite tough, and there it take a little time to learn how the new game work.Well what are you waiting for, BUY IT..... 10/10.			"

												It is the final days of the resistance. Advent forces have discovered the location of the Avenger and have launched a full frontal assault. All XCOM operators defending the ramp have had their weapons disabled by a Codex. However, the resistance was not going down without a fight. They engaged the hostile forces with honor and dignity.Miraculously, the resistance managed to defeat Advent at the Battle for the Avenger without the loss of a single life. But there was still one more problem, the Avatar Project was nearing completion, and they had not made contact with the area where an Advent research facility was located, which would have to be destroyed in order to delay the project.Resistance Comms was constructed, supplies were received from a supply drop, and contact was made with Western Europe, the location of the research facility. But the aliens completed the Avatar Project, and the countdown to the end of humanity began. There was no more time to prepare, the Resistance had to act now.An elite squad of XCOM operatives, led by Colonel Lukas ""Junior"" Bekker, launched a covert operation with 1 objective; destroy the research facility. The squad of 6 soldiers deployed into the woods surrounding the facility, fought their way through Advent forces, and reduced the facility to rubble. Not one XCOM operative was lost that day. The destruction of the research facility dealt a major blow to the Avatar Project, which bought more time for XCOM to make contact with more regions to destroy more facilities. Will the resistance succeed in defeating the aliens? Probably not. But like they did in the Battle for the Avenger, they can hope.In XCOM 2, the real story comes from your own gameplay experiences. and everyone's will be different. "

												The second XCOM remake, while keeping with the themes and general setting of the originals, still manages to stand on its own with the increased depth of its tactical gameplay and considerably more fleshed-out story and characters. Not to mention the visuals alone make it a first-class title. There's definitely a lot more customization options now, and skill trees are a little less linear, with substantially more game-changing skills available per class: XCOM 2 is no longer the war of attrition of its predecessors, and to me that was very refreshing.All this being said, experience with the first remake or previous XCOM titles is recommended to appreciate the genre better and watch the progression of story and foes (indeed, you might be in for a surprise if you fight certain enemies without understanding of their previous forms, such as Viper, Crysshalid, or Sectopod), but is not required, as characters, reports, and general story progression synopse all the major plot points of Enemy Unknown.

												I'll start this off by saying that I've not experienced any gamebreaking bugs or crashes while playing on this machine.  Performance is wierdly inconsistent but is playable.  I can't speak to the experience that others will have.With that out of the way, this is not a good XCOM game, it's a great game, truly fantastic, but it's not a good XCOM game.  That's okay though, the original UFO defense is one of, if not my favorite games of all time.  I own it on multiple platforms and play Openxcom to this day.Where UFO defense was heavily minimalistic mechanically, with most actions following the same set of rules, XCOM 2 has a great variety of additional features.  This gives this game many more areas in which it can fail or seem unpolished, the complexity and volume of unique mechanics being staggering. This isn't always a bad thing, although balancing certain things equally becomes difficult.  This gives you a greater degree of control and customization as regards units, equipment, and tactics.  Your XCOM is very much your XCOM.  In UFO defense your XCOM had very much a mind of its own, soldiers wouldn't advance how you would like, the missions were unfair as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the main objectives seemed to consciously evade you.XCOM2 does not have that personality, but as a game it is far more ""playable"" than UFO Defense.  You don't need a master's degree in patience and risk management to finish it, and some degree of randomness is removed.  XCOM2 is a handcrafted experience, like a fine Oak table, whereas the original is like a very nice tree that decides to grow through your living room.It is an excellent tactics and management game, perhaps the best of this generation.  I feel that it is almost a disservice to both games, UFO defense being the other, to link them.  This game is unique, well crafted, challenging, and playable.  I very much recommend it.			"

												If it doesn't really redefine the saga (which is not needed), XCOM 2 succeeds with its alien oppression context to renew brilliantly the heroic tension that was set in 2012 with XCOM: Enemy Unknown. More customizable than ever, our units are facing an alien invader now in full control of the Earth. Gone are the days of the world organization supported by all governments, as we face the threat this time clandestine operations involving certain strategic and a more risky management of odds. XCOM 2 is overflowing with content and even paid the luxury to provide a staging more polished than ever, and hopefully if some bugs encountered are promptly corrected by Firaxis, this is surely on the path of becoming the 2016 strategy game of the year.

												Had a ton of fun playing through this game, the kind of game I was itching to keep playing and progress in. The XCOM games are highly unique in the way they make every decision absolutely crucial, which in turn makes it incredibly exciting. It's likely that the chance aspect of the game will tick you off at times, but after a while you'll learn how to keep the odds in your favor, and with a dozen missions under your belt, and wisely using the available equipment, you'll be killing aliens left and right without them even touching you.I recommend not abusing saves. This will substantially increase your immersion and enjoyment of the game, making you feel like your decisions are that more important. Stick with your decisions and your mistakes unless it's too devastating. For me personally, I only retried one mission twice, near the beginning, where my whole squad was either killed or MIA. Other than that I suffered through bad decisions, killed soldiers and unecessary injuries, when they occurred.I'm hearing a lot about technical issues with this game.. poor performance, bugs, glitches. When it comes to performance I frankly didn't expect much from my aging rig, with a GTX 660. So with the game running as well as it did, I was more than satisfied. This is also a game that doesn't need a high framerate, giving how it's played. Bugs, glitches or technical issues I hardly noticed, except for once, when there were so much happening on screen it brought my computer to its knees. Maybe I just got lucky, or the worst issues were patched before I started playing.All in all, I can't recommend this game enough. A really unique experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat, caring about keeping your soldiers alive like no other game does. For me it doesn't have much replayability right now, but the close to 50 hours I got out of it was a blast. I'll definitely be back if this game gets a significant expansion, the way Enemy Within was for the previous XCOM.			"

												There is nothing like a game where humanity must work together to survive some kind of apocalypse. In this xase its a small group of resistance fighters which most of you probably know as XCOM. This game greatly builds off XCOM: Enemy unkown, giving you much more options for customizing your squad, you can choose from a plethora of colors and camo's, the new classes are well designed and alot of fun to play. One of my favorite things about this game though is that i have been playing for 47 hours and i still havent seen the same map twice. Im sure this is due to the randomly generated maps. One more thing to love is the day one mods, which was released along with the game. XCOM 2 has your expected story and does it much better then any of the other games, with great cutscenes that are fun to watch.Some things i feel this game could improve on though, something thats not extremely bother but more of a nuisance is the loading times for some missions seems to take a bit. Then you have the problem with the extremely bad lag when playing multiplayer, you will end your turn and the next person will have to wait almost 30 second more before actually taking theirs. And one last thing i have noticed about this game is a audio bug that happens often enough to warrant a fix.All in all I have 47 hours in this game and with the few drawback i stated it dosent take away from the game enough to not pick it up. I expect to have many many more hours of great fun on this game. If your if about it and liked the older games this is definitely something your going to wanna get. "

												Since it seems to be peoples main issue with this game, id like to say IM RUNNING A BUDGET PC AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS. The only thing that isnt 4 years old is the graphics card. I've got an i3 3.2 ghz, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ motherboard, 4 gb DDR3 and then a GTX 960 and SSD. The game did not crash a single time in my play through and the few times a weird situation came up that caused the animations to get confused, the game would time it out and recover beautifully. Back to the main review.XCOM EU/EW was probably my favorite game. The sequel didn't dissapoint in any way. That's a hell of a tall order. Intense and satisfying gameplay and story. It also manages to pull a half-life two and paint a picture of a fascinating new world after the world changing events in the first game. Most series just try and sweep those enormous events under the rug but XCOM 2 embraces them and does so very well.If I try hard i can come up with a few complaints. I miss shooting down and attacking UFOs, through the whole game I was only able to attack 2 but it was like christmas each time. It's a little hard on my 4 year old budget processor so the load screens take a little while. And every now and then a unit animation goes wonky (but then completely recovers every time). It's a beautiful game though, and it's turn-based nature means that it's pretty on even moderate hardware. I'm not sure that I could have come up with less consequential complaints. Maybe the fact that I wasn't a big fan of a main characters hair style. Or the fact that this one important alien suit has these weird mittens that bug me for no reason.I can't think of a game I'd recommend more than this one.			"

												I'm gonna write two reviews, one for those who already played XCom-enemy unknown and one for all new players who have never heard about Xcom and want to jump in right into xcom2.For those who have already played Xcom1:The game is great! Gameplay speaking it's a wider, better XcomEU. There are a lot more game mechanics, finally the overwatch isn't broken and it's basically the same formula but with more breadth. If you loved Xcom1 you will love Xcom2. I admit the story is not as engagin as the first xcom, probably because it lost a lot of the ""mistery"" sorrounding the abductions and the discovery of your enemy. But you should absolutely get this game.For those who never played Xcom1:go play Xcom1, it's a great game, there is no point in jumping in Xcom2 if you never plaied Xcom1. Do yourself a favour and play Xcom1 first!Overall:- great game- a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking- a lot of hours of gameplay10 out of 10, must buy!			"

												I am a big fan of the XCOM seires. From the origional with the TU, to the remake with AP.GAMEPLAY:XCOM2 is a refinement on the 2012 remakes origional intentions. The biggest change is that eveything has been rethemed with the idea that XCOM is now a rouge faction with limited support.This minor change makes most of the unpopular changes from the origional really cool. Enemy pods, limited mission selection, and smaller squads, make a whole lot more sense now. Not to mention that the stealth system got a complete overhaul.STORY:I also really did not like how the 2012 remake ended. This Game retcons a lot of that in some pretty cool ways.For the most part you are going to be creating your own stories. War stories.Overall a really solid game if you are a fan of turn based squad tactics.There are some bugs, but most of them are visual and dont affect gameplay.			"

												It's another XCOM game to the mix, the world mechanics are the biggest change as always but combat feel is more or less the same with some new gimmicks. So yes, if you like XCOMs, you maybe like this one too despite all the numerous glitches, bugs and stupidly lazy implementation of RNG. In the end the gameplay felt somewhat one-dimensional too (you sort of do the same kind of stuff with only slight variations here and there, research tree feels very flat etc), though i guess most XCOMs are pretty much on par with that.

												Played through the campaign on commander difficulty in about 40 hours, very few reloads. Aside from some graphical glitches, I only encountered one bug: the chrysalid save game breaking bug (fixed in the first patch). Ive heard a lot about performance issues, but have not had any trouble. The game runs smoothly on my 2 year old game PC.I like most of the changes and new features. Missions with limited turns force you to adapt your playstyle (slightly) and the new classes are quite nice for this. The avatar project bar in the world map may seem threatening, but in reality, it's pretty easy to keep under control. The dark events, however, can have a big impact, which is pretty cool.			"

												If you have played any of the classic X-Com games, or XCOM: Enemy Unknown, give this game a try.  It is, in this players humble opinion, a worthy entry into the franchise.  I haven't played it with the Paid DLC, but have installed the mods from Long War Studio, which adds value but I'm starting to feel some of the mods dilute the experience.  Since I haven't actually completed the game yet (I move too slow on the critical campaign objectives,) my personal recommendation would be to avoid too many mods until you have finished a playthrough without them.  My earliest review of the game was a ""Not Recommended"" due to early technical issues simply getting the game to run (that was immediately after launch, and turned out to be an issue with Steam, NOT XCOM 2.)  All is well now :)			"

												If you enjoyed over watching your way to victory in Xcom Enemy Unknown then Xcom 2 will be something of a culture shock.  You really cannot afford to rest on your laurels when the resident alien force outnumbers and outguns you severely in the early stages. I found it surprisingly punishing on normal difficulty compared to its predecessor.The tactical game play remains intact; there’s better mission variety, a more involving narrative, better soldier customization, randomly generated maps, a wide variety of aliens and weapons and on the whole it’s shinier, prettier and more difficult. There’s already a substantial number of mods available on the Steam workshop so if you’re not keen on those timed objective missions (of which there were a lot) or fancy a new hat  your needs will be met.A word of caution however because the game really would benefit from some bug fixing and better optimization. No-one likes crashing to desktop Firaxis; not even the aliens.			"

The fact that it has said in the past that I'd played 100 hours total and 100 hours in the last 2 weeks should say something, but considering the absolute gravity and RNG genius this game is, I'm honestly not suprised.RNG strategy games have always been something I've enjoyed, such as the Fire Emblem series. But this was my first XCOM game. I could go on about how good this game is, but I'll keep it short and sweet; I can honestly say that if you are a fan of Fire Emblem or any turn based strategy game of any kind, especially RNG ones, then you will enjoy this game.

												Xcom: enemy unknown was honestly the game that made turn-based games fun for me. I have a solid 200 hours of JUST campaigning, most of it on impossible. I was honestly very surprised about how jazzed up the combat was on xcom2. It's much much different, the game forces you out of turtling and start running for dem objectives. Which i honestly don't mind, just gotta adapt abit. Xcom2 is also changed into a combat based game. Base management is less important but provides bonuses and fun stuff to play with. The game has alot of bugs, i feel they rushed the release abit. Gremlins fly underground, occasional frozen enemy turns. The worst bit honestly the intro and the outro for me the video was delayed and the voice appeared before the video :SIt needs a bit of modding tbh. WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE IT HAS MODDING SUPPORT! Which is honestly one of the highlights.MODDERS: Please make Anime faces, naked person decals, Asain language (Why doesn't this exist?) and sky combat. It's bound to happen so just be first :P Overall: I enjoyed it, it's pretty brutal good for dem xcom vets. As for new people, not too sure, maybe take off mission timers?

Seems like there's lots of room to improve upon, hope we get some fine♥♥♥♥♥modders on the case and they flesh it out. Would give solid 8/10			"

												XCOM 2 is a great game-having just finished it I have yet to decide whether or not I like it more than its predecessor, EU/EW. Honestly, if you are new to the franchise, go back to the original (from Firaxis) and give that a try: the games are awfully similar, and the EU is less expensive. Also, since XCOM has a pretty dedicated fan base, it will provide a good basis for questions and forums. Just like any other game, there are pros and cons. Fortunately, most of the cons are mostly bugs and will likely be addressed and fixed very soon. ProsMost of the pros are based of of EUa) enemy will have a crosshair if your soldier moves into targeting range, indicating whether you can attack from a specific locationb) more dynamicc) definitely more map variety-however, some of the missions do still seem pretty similard)good strategy level too-not just tacticale)good replayability-choices are always difficult and making different choices will lead to different resultsConsbuggya) small things that are also found in the EU like poor slowmo shotsb) larger issues like not being able to see another floor or move somewhere on the mapc) mediocre story lined) FPS drops and lag. e) long load times			"

												still the level of awesome you expect from Xcom.adding in modding is probably a big mistake, if you liked the overwhelming levels of badassery that Xcom was in the past just don't add 'em in.Edit:one year in from purchase:- still one of my top ten timewasters. - mods are iffy, some make the game too easy. others add a little flavour.... choose wisely- looking forward to more DLC like the moster hunter or Shen's gift. add quite a bit to the base game, though playing without the dlc added in is still a riot.wish i could add another ""thumbs up""			"

												Different enough from EU to be fresh yet keeps the same good DNA from XCOM:EU. Most annoyances from EU redesigned like overwatch all hitting a dead target. Lots of great new mechanics and assets. However difficulty a little too brutal. Was playing 1 above easy (Veteran) - it gets a little less frustrating with plasma and psi, but still having to reload a dozen times each level for the whole game while not making ""mistakes"" was not fun for me. When I finished EU I immediately wanted to start another campaign on a harder difficulty - this time ... not so much. Also, miss mechs and gene mods from EU.			"

												Pathetic!!!What else? Only playing it short while - really short and following bugs just put me off:* Linear story. There is no tactical or strategic about it. 1st mission, 2nd etc. cant just plan what and where you have mission.* 2nd mission you need to equip medi kit but it wont tell you. you may be stuck until you do. only found out with google for answer.* game crashed on 2nd mission already. Taking to account I have top class PC where Xcom 2 only using 40% of graphical memory - no reason for game to crash on its own.* will type more. Only will play with cheats now to see story line but dont enjoy normal game anymore.			"

												Unlike XCOM1, where you had a fighting chance, to beat this game requires save scumming (or modding). While Bentley will insist you need to 'review your tactics' at the end of a failed mission, no amount of tactical play will stop the aliens from one shotting your troops through cover. This is complicated by a buggy UI that will indicate one thing, but then something else happens. Like getting hit with status effects (running through fire, acid, poison) and being spotted are not always indicated. Also, a genade's damage radius can be often misrepresented causing you to destroy a mission objective. I've had a hack objective get destroyed because I threw a grenade over it. Camera transarency glitches and other things that cause your troops to move to locations you did not intend further this issue.The game seems to let you know from the very start that you should expect casualties. OK, Firaxis. If that's the case then why can't I get more troops? I start with 9, early in the game you can get recruits for free(I got 2). A few missions later (2 died to one-shot crits through cover, 1 died to burning that the game didn't tell me I would get when I moved, 1 got one-shot by an exploding car). Now I've got 7 total, with 4 wounded. Can't even field a full squad anymore and I'm only 5 missions into the game. The game is filled with design contradictions like this. Expect to lose troops, but don't have any good means of replacing them (50 supplies is a lot for a recruit, and more than you have to spare). Time the missions, but moving quickly almost always results in an unfavorable situation. Fail a mission? Now you get reduced income from the resistance in that area. Complete a mission? I hope it was worth the bodies you had to sacrifice. As you progress, the game just stacks the negative consequences against you repeatedly until you can just forget about even playing. Because now you don't have enough troops, don't have gooed enough weapons, and don't have troops leveled sufficiently.Parts of the game are tedious and time wasters. Bentley will constanly tell you what's blatantly obvious. The camera will constantly hover over the objective when you get near it (even though it's marked from the beginning). It's just dumb how much time is wasted and how irritating it is to have to listen to and watch pointless stuff when you just want to take your turn.I have also found that the game forces you to play a certain way. In XCOM1, you spammed satellites. Now, you have to spam communications upgrades. If you don't, you will end up unable to get to mission areas and losing. Also, certain classes are much better than others. I would put specialist as the weakest in combat (but they can provide nice bonuses). Snipers are versatile if you go the pistol route, but otherwise can slow you down. Grenadiers are epic and can do some great AOE. Try dropping an acid grenade on a flare before reinforcements arrive and watch the aliens stand in place for 3 rounds as they don't want to get the debuff for moving through those tiles. Rangers seem to do the highest single target damage and can be essential to take down high hp targets. I've heard that snipers can do really well with high ground.Yes it seems to be poorly optimized (disable bloom, SSAO and AA helps). I have yet to crash, though. I can live with some minor graphical glitches and a some performance slowdowns for reaction shots. The camera can act up as well, but that's just another annoyance. The thing that is frustrating is the incosistent manner in which some tactical notifications are given. The detection while stealthed for example, can incorrectly show a spot as being safe to move to (even though you can see the alien that spots you before you make the move). The notification icons for burning, poison can decide not to show up. I've had aliens be invisible on the map, even though troops can target them (also more irritating than game-breaking).Bottom Line: wait for some mods to come out that fix game balance a bit (I like the one where you get to start with 1 engineer and 1 scientist), wait for a bug fix patch, and then get it on sale.

Pessimo supporto lo avete provato lo avete dato a dei beta tester lo avete dato a giornalisti possibile che solo ora vengano fuori questi problemi mi spiace davvere tanto per il momento non  lo consiglio a nessuno almeno fino a che non faranno cio' che devono fare. per fortuna che firaxix si e' concentrato solo su questo prodotto pc ed ha abbandonato tutti gli altri progetti. nelle discussioni sentivo qualcuno che parla addirittuta di non aggiornare i driver amd, a me crashava sia con i 15 che con la versione 16 non è quello il problema è che qualcuno non ha lavorato bene. molto male firaxix al day one. falsa partenza.are six months waiting for this title that promises well, but unfortunately I can not play because he continues to freezarsi the screen. I have windows 7 and update your video drivers updated as well. most do not know what to do in order to play the game and open a few minutes later it stops at any point. Poor support you have tried it you have it given to the beta testers have it given to journalists who can only now be out of these problems sorry davvere me so for the moment I would not recommend to anyone until at least they will not do what 'they have to do. luckily firaxix you and 'just concentrating on this PC product and has abandoned all other projects. in the discussions felt someone talking addirittuta not update amd driver, I crashed with both 15 with version 16 is not the problem is that someone has not worked well. very bad firaxix on day one. false start.

												XCOM 2 is the successor of XCOM Enemy Unknown / Enemy Within, a reboot of the original X-COM game. XCOM EU/EW suffered from a few problems. In short, the game was too easy and too repetative. This was fixed by a mod called The Long War. With XCOM 2, the developer has listened to the community, they even hired mod developers. This game is exactly what you would want to expect from an XCOM game!Pro's:  + Random generated maps  + Wider variety and more complex mission strategies  + In-depth game strategy  + Great graphics and soundtrack  + Full customizable characters that can be saved, exported and imported. Make your friends and have them killed on the battlefield  + Highly moddable. Within a week of release over 200 mods were available. Mods do not disable achievements.Neutral  o High learning curve and high entry level. This is what is expected from an XCOM game (learning by trial and failure), and any hard-core turn-based strategy gamer (like me) likes it that way. But if you are more of a casual gamer, you may find the lack of information on how to play the game, and failing many missions, frustating.  o A lot of missions are based on a turn timer, i.e. finish the game within a limited number of turns. Not everyone may like it. If you don't like a turn-timer, you can disable it using one of the mods. Con's  - Poor game optimization. For best performance, turn of anti-aliasing, lower shadow quality and turn of action camera.			"

												Fantastic. So many improvments over Enemy Unknown/Within. Still the same basic gameplay with the squad and customization and stuff.. Speaking of, New customization is cool.. Added a lot more, Character pool is very hot.. But at the same time I feel it is missing quite a bit. I get that they cant give everything to everyone but I did feel there was quite a bit missing. Im sure people will mod more stuff in but yeah. New map is.. Interesting to say the least. I like having to contact people and stuff, Build little pylon things to reduce the intel cost.. All very nice.. But.. Near the end of the game I was kinda just sat at my HQ with nothign to do.. Scanning and waiting. The ending was.. Alright I guess. Last section was enjoyable, And the mission before the last where you only get 3 troops was fun. Would of been nice to see more missions like that where you get less troops. I felt the weapon progression could have been better. Maybe more types of weapons, More tiers or something.. But I felt I got to Plasma too fast. Ending cinematic was great. Had a massive grin on my face the whole time. Looking forward for what comes next with this. Be it an expo or a new game. Looking forward to getting the rest of the achis I am yet to get and also to playing it with mods that improve the game.. Or add more. (Not these stupid ones that increase the Avatar Project.. Make Swords OP or any of this dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥ mainly Long War devs I am looking forward to. All in all, I would say this is a better game than EU/EW.. But I feel it is also worse in some ways. No where near as much to say its a bad game, But, I feel the first one had some better things than the new one.If I cared about ratings and stuff I would probs say somewhere up at like.. 7.5/10. Maybe a bit higher later down the line with mods and an expo or whatever if they have any plans.			"

												It's XCOM2 !   If you liked XCOM EW you will like XCOM2.Graphically it is a much enhanced game.  Maps are more open, colorful, and varied with lots of sparkly effects. Some groups of enemies have patrol routes, which makes for a more interesting tactical experience. Timed objectives occur more often - though not with the frequency those complaining about them would have you believe.New soldier skills have been added, and some modified to liven up combat.  Rangers carry a blade for close combat and sharpshooters are now the only pistol carriers.  Both these classes acquire specialized skills for these weapons.Altering soldiers' visual appearance and history has reached a new high.  You can write their bio, change their country of origin, and accessorize - with more options opening up as they level.   You can even color and name their weapons.  On the down side, the base physical features of each race seem more homogenized and less country specific. Lots of attention to small graphical details has been taken throughout the game.   Soldiers have grim, tense expressions flying to a mission, and cheerful, relieved expressions flying back.  The intro loading screen will pick a soldier on your roster ( in their current gear ) and show them spying on an Advent position. You can give your soldiers cigars and cigarettes, earrings, scars and tattoos.  The downside of all this graphical goodness is that it comes at a price.  If you've been nursing along an older computer system with infusions of RAM and a slightly better graphics card,  you may not be satisfied with how the game runs. There are a lot of options in the graphics setup, so it is possible to find a setting that is bearable on an older system,  but it won't be pretty and frame rates will stutter on some weapon effects.Before XCOM2 i've been playing XCOM EW with the Long War mod.  While XCOM2 is definitely an improvement over the base XCOM EW, I have mixed feelings on how it compares to the Long War modded version.  Graphics aside, more different than better. ProsGraphically improved.More varied maps and missionsNew soldier skillsInvolving storyConsHefty system requirementsNot fully optimized for performance.If you liked XCOM EW  and your computer can handle the system requirements, definitely give XCOM2 a go.

												I've beaten the game. Awesome!  I love it.....but I am a fan of x-com since the original Ufo: Enemy unknown in the 90's came out.Let me be absolutelly straight with you. If you're a new to X-com, this will be a brutal experience. You will likely lose your first campaign, or three. And I'm not talking legendary difficulty. You'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed over to you on normal. You will watch your soldiers die and missions fail.But that is the point. This is the dark souls of the strategy games. It is a challenge. A true gauntlet testing your will, resilience, ingenuity and ability to learn. It is always an uphill battle. You will never be in comfortable position of power. Enemy has more troops, stronger units and economy.This game will not pamper you as they are trying to tell you straight in the tutorial sequence. I will reccommend the game but the final decision is yours - do you have what it takes to save humanity?			"

												XCOM 2 is actually a terrific game, I at first was not sure if I was going to enjoy it or not, the timers being part of it, and the lack of individual targeting areas, and the different if not also similiar format. After playing the game for several hours, I realized that I did in fact love the game, the combat is enjoyable, the upgrades are fun, the story is exciting, and to be quite honest, I actually like the timers now that I have played with them on. Rather then taking things slow, becoming incredibly risk adverse, and loading up on medkits like I did in XCOM: Enemy Unkown, I've had to change my playstyle up.Now every single person has some sort of explosive, with my specialists using their gremlin heals, Snipers, being almost the worst class in the first XCOM of this decade, have made a come back with some really amazing abilities and tactics, and every class has a use now that can't be replaced in this very aggressive and high-risk high reward combat style that I have been forced to adopt.XCOM 2 is an amazing game because of what it is on it's own. The game itself is different enough from XCOM that it doesn't feel anything like an expansion, yet nearly everything in the details has a comparable element in XCOM, the gameplay, even though it's based on the same concept and same rules, is entirely different, yet it is still so fun that I personally can't stop playing the game.Performance wise the game runs well for me, and it runs on max settings for me with only minor framerate losses in various cinematic parts. I heavily reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys XCOM style gameplay, as long as they are open enough to understand that just like in real life, tactics have to change with time and the situation.

												In comparsion to its predecessor this game is for me clearly an improvment, with a few drawbacks.I restarted the campaign 2 times, because I made some early mistakes. But now I am pretty late game, fighting against monstrous Sectopods and Gatekeepers with an almost fully equiped Squad (altough i do hope i did not reach the end of the research  tree, with one research left). The good things:For me each time a new enemy appeared was like a new challenge (besides the avatar that one was strangely easy).Each with their own strenght and weaknesses.This games rewards Tactics. Ive read that some ppl complain about timers. And i do agree the first time I saw those timers i rushed and almost lost my entire squad. Now I take some time in the beginning (obvious not too much) for a good positioning and a good engage which gives you enough time to finish the rest of the mission leisurely. Now i almost always have 2-3 sometimes even 4-5 rounds left before finishing those missions. Lots of customization, not just looks but gameplay changeing. Want a heavy front line ranger with heal? Get those heal armor with a w.a.r suit bladestorm and untouchable. Or a more stealthy approch with Wraith Suit its crappling hook and Phantom?  Change weapons parts for extra shots bigger mags higher aim and so on.Psi. I love psi. and its OP. Mindcontroll those heavy Gatekeepers? check.And i love those new Specialists. In my opinion one of the biggest changes to xcom. Ranged heal and hacking.Heavy Sectopod killing your squad? Hack it!Ranged heal allows for a more spreaded approch without being in risk that your frontline warrior cant be healed.Great replayability. Each playthrough will have other missions/strarting place so you need to adapt to what you get.The not so good:Lack of freedom. I would love to have really easy and really hard missions from the beginning. Right now Enemy strenght evolves with your own, which doesnt make sense for me. It would be much better if there would be lightly guarded remote post to attack. Or those big Strongholds with many guards and advanced Defenses and the player would have the choice when to attack which place.Now i have my standard squad and if one gets hurt 2-4 reserve Soldiers to swap out, greatly reducing my power, You could say thats my fault because I focuesed too much on my squad. but on the other hand, i knew each mission will be harder and i picked the best for it. If i would have the choice to attack an place that isnt that much of a problem i could use some rookies to give them expirience. And not to forget you cant really decide were to attack. Mostly you get 3 choices from which you can choose one and thats it. And mostly you choose those mission because of their reward. And late game you most likely will pick Supplies because thats what you need most.No optional fights. Ok you could say you dont need to fight each mission but not doing one is in general a really bad idea. Loosing supplies/scientists/engineers/intel no exp gain and so on. And if you cant do mission because all you soldiers are hurt i would strongly suggest you restart the game.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game! I have not beaten the game yet so I can't say anything about the rest of the game/story that I have not yet experience. However, this game is amazing, I have been having a blast so far. It really bugs me to see so many negative reviews just because of minor performance issues. Yes I have had minor performance issues, but my computer isn't the best but still pretty decent. For people having major issues probably have a crappy computer in which case its their computer's fault and not the game. Any performance issues that is the fault of the game are minor and easily fixable with updates. People who give a game a negative review and say the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥just because of small performance issues, really shouldn't be playing games.			"

												I've beaten the game. Awesome!  I love it.....but I am a fan of x-com since the original Ufo: Enemy unknown in the 90's came out.Let me be absolutelly straight with you. If you're a new to X-com, this will be a brutal experience. You will likely lose your first campaign, or three. And I'm not talking legendary difficulty. You'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed over to you on normal. You will watch your soldiers die and missions fail.But that is the point. This is the dark souls of the strategy games. It is a challenge. A true gauntlet testing your will, resilience, ingenuity and ability to learn. It is always an uphill battle. You will never be in comfortable position of power. Enemy has more troops, stronger units and economy.This game will not pamper you as they are trying to tell you straight in the tutorial sequence. I will reccommend the game but the final decision is yours - do you have what it takes to save humanity?			"

												It's XCOM2 !   If you liked XCOM EW you will like XCOM2.Graphically it is a much enhanced game.  Maps are more open, colorful, and varied with lots of sparkly effects. Some groups of enemies have patrol routes, which makes for a more interesting tactical experience. Timed objectives occur more often - though not with the frequency those complaining about them would have you believe.New soldier skills have been added, and some modified to liven up combat.  Rangers carry a blade for close combat and sharpshooters are now the only pistol carriers.  Both these classes acquire specialized skills for these weapons.Altering soldiers' visual appearance and history has reached a new high.  You can write their bio, change their country of origin, and accessorize - with more options opening up as they level.   You can even color and name their weapons.  On the down side, the base physical features of each race seem more homogenized and less country specific. Lots of attention to small graphical details has been taken throughout the game.   Soldiers have grim, tense expressions flying to a mission, and cheerful, relieved expressions flying back.  The intro loading screen will pick a soldier on your roster ( in their current gear ) and show them spying on an Advent position. You can give your soldiers cigars and cigarettes, earrings, scars and tattoos.  The downside of all this graphical goodness is that it comes at a price.  If you've been nursing along an older computer system with infusions of RAM and a slightly better graphics card,  you may not be satisfied with how the game runs. There are a lot of options in the graphics setup, so it is possible to find a setting that is bearable on an older system,  but it won't be pretty and frame rates will stutter on some weapon effects.Before XCOM2 i've been playing XCOM EW with the Long War mod.  While XCOM2 is definitely an improvement over the base XCOM EW, I have mixed feelings on how it compares to the Long War modded version.  Graphics aside, more different than better. ProsGraphically improved.More varied maps and missionsNew soldier skillsInvolving storyConsHefty system requirementsNot fully optimized for performance.If you liked XCOM EW  and your computer can handle the system requirements, definitely give XCOM2 a go.

												If you've played a X-Com game on anything above easy or normal, keep in mind that the difficulty is increased for X-Com2. The difficulty on Veteran level is closer to Classic. If you liked Long War, you'll find the combat to be more challenging. The four initial classes are diversified based on soldier perks to more resemble the eight class system of the long war system. This is a refined mechanic that allows you to customize your soldiers greatly.Performance wise, on two year old built computer, the game ran smoothly with no hiccups.The shooting through walls animation issues have been greatly reduced between 1 and 2. Tactically, you have far more options than X-COM EW or EU. Waypoints are essential for sucess. You can use them to avoid many situations that would otherwise break your squad.Overwatch is still a key mechanic but there are many times you will take the risky option to get to the objective and you will fail. Every shot will miss, beause of the order you took them in. This is okay, the war is not over yet.There will be the one time everybody makes the shot against incredible odds and you go home with a everyone alive. Treasure it.This game will make you sob when your squad gets wiped out in one turn because you misjudged pod locations and triggered four of them. But your small squad of soldiers will go down fighting, and the war against the aliens will go on.Your small band of soldiers is doing their best to save the planet and there will be casualties along the way.

												Story20 years have passed since the events in XCOM: Enemy Unknown and humanity has fallen under alien control. The once supportive council nations have sided with the new alien government during the height of their invasion. Using an administration known as Advent to become a disposable source of manpower, the aliens make an aggressive campaign to earn obedience and loyalty with earth's population. Harsh crowd control tactics and an abundance of Advent propaganda are utilized to invoke fear across the globe. With immense government funding they are a force to be reckoned with, in regards to both manpower and military equipment.XCOM has become an almost forgotten remnant of the past, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for the human race. However, Resistance forces have burrowed themselves into small pockets of the world, working tirelessly to overthrow Advent and fight for what was once their's. With little resources and time, a small squad of resistance forces act on newly provided Intel. This lead suggests a possible location for a tremendously important figure that is being held in an Advent facility, the Commander. Once rescued and revived from a medically induced cryo-sleep, the player (taking on the role of The Commander) is briefed on the current state of Earth. With a shell of what XCOM once was, you must gather resources and individuals loyal to the cause and restore XCOM to it's former glory. Technological advancements and utilizing your soldiers abilities to the fullest are the foundation for success, but strategic planning and careful military tactics are what it's built on. Expand the reach of the Resistance by aiding smaller Resistance forces, and set back Advent's development of a mysterious weapon known as the Avatar Project by completing important assignments and destroying key Advent facilities.GameplayXCOM 2 is a turn-based tactical strategy game that is in a league of it's own. Never before have I played a game that has bestowed so much weight in every decision you make. On masterfully designed multi-level maps that are almost entirely destructible, soldiers are controlled like chess pieces with a limit to how many actions they may perform, or tiles they can move. With limited vision of your surroundings, every enemy encounter can be in the players favor through already established defenses, or brutally devastating by enemy flanking maneuvers and abilities. The presence of perma-death only adds to the tension of enemy engagements, and ending your turn pits your tactics against an intelligent and equally lucky AI.Concealment is the latest and greatest feature, allowing you to enter missions undetected and grants you the ability to ambush your enemies. Solid defensive placement and foreknowledge can be the difference between a devastating blow to Advent forces or a fatal backfire. In addition, a multitude of weapons, armor, and utility items are at your disposal, assuming you researched the necessary criteria and had the required supplies. As well as new and useful abilities that give your soldiers a major advantage on the battlefield, granted you use them correctly.What flaws are to be found in XCOM 2 however are incessantly apparent. (For Enemy Unknown veterans they may come at no surprise.) These include shots and abilities making contact through walls and objects, hanging animations in certain circumstances following Overwatch shots or soldier placement, numerous instances of clipping, and obscure lines of sight that are both infuriating and laughable. Now these are not game-breaking by any nature but they are certainly a nuisance. Furthermore, they work both ways so while you may be victim to some quite frankly BS shots, you too may find yourself with the same unfair advantage.User interface and camera controls work well throughout the majority of the game, in small instances though they can be incredibly temperamental. One wrong click can mean the difference between short or high cover, spotted or concealed, dead or alive, so it's aggravating when action keys are click-through if a friendly soldier is nearby or when travel routes get finicky when rotating the map.When not in combat, time is of the essence as Advent will make slow but steady progress to completing their Avatar Project. If they do, you have a short amount of time to attack a facility or complete specific objectives that stagger it's construction. A great deal of missions are time sensitive as well, requiring the player to make aggressive advancements and react accordingly to enemy reinforcements. Even without a turn/time limit, every action and choice comes with a reward or consequence and XCOM 2 does a great job at making you aware of the result. Tense combat situations, challenging AI and enemy variants, and an immense amount of player freedom and customization. SoundXCOM 2 offers as much depth in the sounds and music as it does in it's gameplay. Music is triumphant in success and shattering in defeat. Sound effects are appropriately fitting to each circumstance whether it's gunfire and explosions or destruction and animations. Aliens come to life with intimidating battle-cry's and soldiers express their panicked state or wounded cries in disconcerting fashion. Dialogue and voice acting is dramatic but not over the top. A satisfying blend of military criticality  as well helpless emotions when things take a turn for the worse. Cinematic scenes are enjoyable both visually and aurally, however (and maybe this was a bug) facial animations noticeably lacked movement when soldiers communicated their understanding of each order.GraphicsFor a game that doesn't need to be graphically beautiful to attract strategy enthusiasts, XCOM 2 is stunning. The amount of detail in the environments, models, armor and weapons, visual effects and lighting are astounding. In what's simply an isometric plane comprised of tiles and levels, it is filled with so much character and tone that it comes to life the moment you touch down. Combat animations resemble movies in the re-positioning camera and the surroundings crumble and shatter from forceful explosions or enemy movement. Unfortunately, detail like this comes at a price. My gameplay experience maintained solid framerates for the majority of the play-through. Key word majority, guess-timating that atleast 30% of my time was spent wtaching frames drop to as low as 24FPS and then right back up to 60. These occurrences were almost always during cinematic moments, whether it was in or out of combat didn't matter. Destructible environments make for a great gameplay mechanic but when it's framerate teeters back and forth regardless, more ground clutter and visual effects only hurt performance more. Luckily these instances don't take away much from the gameplay itself, but become immersion breaking with frequency. (Ultra on 2560x1080 - i7 6700k / GTX 980 ti)Replay ValueArguably infinite, nearly pattern-less. While most missions follow a similar formula for enemy locations and objective markers, the breadth of possibilities is so vast that you're never experiencing the same fight twice. On a global scale and even inside combat enemies behave intelligently and pose a threat to your entire Resistance. (And existence!) Procedural map generation and spurts of luck make for endless possibilities both good and bad. The options for squad loadouts and soldier variety can be the difference between a flawless victory or crushing defeat.Wrapping UpA must play. XCOM 2 delivers a challenging experience that leaves you tugging your hair when things go South and exhaling massive sighs of relief when they go right. Despite it's buggy nature and clunky performance, solid strategic gameplay kicks it into sixth gear to overshadow it's imperfections. In a genre polishing checkers, XCOM 2 is reinventing chess.			"

												Upfront TL;DR: I recommend XCOM2 to anyone who is remotely interested in strategy/tactical rpg games and does not mind a few hiccups in optimization.It is like a sci-fi Fire Emblem without anime cutscenes and support convos (all that waifu♥♥♥♥♥♥ and adds good graphics and destructible environments. XCOM2's plot is the classic Good vs. Evil with some philosophical drops of ""we are becoming what we set out to destroy"".The real story, however, is the success and failure of XCOM agents under your command. BTW If you can't play a game without your precious waifus then download a voice pack for them and add them to your character pool. Pretty sure there are a bunch of neptunia heads and voice packs in the workshop. See, everyone's happy. Introduction:     This review is tailored for those who have not played any iteration of XCOM, so that it better informs those interested in trying the game out. Before continuing, I want to say that mods are a double edged sword in this game. They enhance play and decrease performance at the same time (subscribed to 300 atm). I cannot deny the fantastic additions graced to XCOM2 by the modding community, but I hope to review the ideas and concepts that the vanilla version succeeded/failed to accomplish on its own.Specs: i7-6700K @ 4.00GHz (4.36GHz)16 GB RAMGTX 1070 Pros: +The ability to extensively customize your soliders contributes a sense of attachment to  soldiers you are ordering around, something most games cannot emulate. +Map generation is very well designed/balanced so that the same tileset/area can offer many different avenues of play. +Configurable settings via the xcom ini can further modify play, leading to more replayability. For example, you can change the base stats of every character/item in the game if you wanted.+There is some base management, but it is not too extensive and does not feel tacked on just because ""every other game has some form of it"" (the original XCOM had this too).+Combat is interesting and offers different approaches to problems through the soldier class system, plethora of researchable gear, and destructible environments. +The emphasis on limited time (in combat and on a macro scale) to rebel against Earth's alien overlords provides a sense of urgency that many games strive for yet miss. +Your soldiers and the aliens become stronger as the game goes on, which creates a sense of each side trying its hardest to defeat the other. +Countless workshop mods offer something new and exciting to experience through multiple playthroughs.  +There is an ironman mode (Only one save state) for tryhards. Variable difficulty as well, which is good for new players. +A game that discourages facerolling over every button on your keyboard. Cons:-You have to realize this game has its optimization issues.  -Loading screens can be long, depending on your settings and how many mods you decide to download. I think the base game does not have this problem as much as a heavily modified one. -Frame rate drops slightly when discovering enemies, unloading from your transport, and initializing props to customize your soldiers with. These frame rate issues, however, can be easily ignored since they only occur at specific points in the game and do little to hinder the gameplay itself.-Do not play at max settings, even the best rigs will have trouble stabilizing at that golden 60fps.-Due to the nature of XCOM2, it being quite a long game, these problems seem to be more apparent later on when there are simply more characters in a given mission (larger squad size, more enemies, etc.). -There are not many gameplay elements that I feel XCOM2 failed to deliver on, but indeed there are many annoyances within the vanilla version that have either been patched already or allieviated by the free mods inside the workshop. Conclusion:     So if you do buy the game and see something that is offputting, check out the workshop to see if a solution has already been distributed.More than likely if you see something as a problem, someone else has too.      This concludes my review of XCOM 2. If you made it this far, then congratulations on either scrolling fast or reading.			"

I do want to adress a few things from other reviews tho:1. Bugs - I read a lot about bugs, glitches, crashes ect. but to me, not one bug ever ocured. No glitch, nothing.2. Difficulty - I mean... where do I start? When has Xcom ever been easy? If you realy have that much trouble just switch the difficulty... you can do that anytime in the game. I myself got through the game twice, with a maximum of failed missions of two. First playthrough on normal, the second one on hard.			"

												XCOM 2 is a mixed bag. On one hand, it offers deep customization, plenty of workshop content, and battles that actually make you think. On the other, XCOM is unoptimized, repetitive, and boring. Each map claims to be ""randomly"" generated. This may be true to an extent, but in the end, they all feel fairly similar (but still seem realistic). This game kept me occupied for about 80 hours, but after that, it felt like a strain to keep playing.Pros: A new game for me that actually made me think about my actions + consequences.         Deep amount of customization         Good atmosphere         Good progress systemCons: Unoptimized          Fights and missions seem repetitive after a while          Fights obviously biased in favor of the aliens and make it near impossible for you to win some without save scumming.

												In the beginning, this game and me had...issues. Now we've sorted it out though, and...well, I have other games.Anyway, this one differs from the first game in the sense that here you're gonna be under time preassue for some of the missions. Move with haste and you're all good. This game also plays out on the assumption the aliens pulled off their invasion of earth, and now it's time for ""Le resistance"" (say it out loud with a french accent).Come the higher difficulty levels, you have to realize you have to beat the game. Relying on 90% hit chances to save your day (or night) won't work, what it'll do is give you an actual headache instead. When things come together though it's beautiful, Once you manage to sort that out, your beefy operatives will slice through aliens as there was nothing to it, and this is one of the true joys of this game:It starts out tough, just like you'd imagine it would be to start a resistance movement, but once you've gained momentum, you really get the sensation you have them on the run. You put them on their heels, you're at their rear nagging, and just waiting for them to shout out the all familiar ""E.T. phone home"" in dispair.On top of that, it's very nicely made, a beauty to watch. I strongly recommend this game, and urge you to give it some time. Don't worry, it won't mind you having other games on the side.			"

												In the desert of a year filled with misleading marketing, broken releases, and disappointing games, XCOM 2 is an oasis.  When people look back on 2016, most of its titles, inde and AAA alike, will have been forgotten either for their mediocrity or out of the shame for having purchased them.  But not this one.Those who enjoyed XCOM: Enemy Unknown will find XCOM 2 well worth their money, time, and attention.  If 2K can continue to do work this good with the series, then it will take its place among the best franchises of gaming.  They really have done that well with it.The continued story remains true to the franchise, the objectives structure is familiar yet novel enough to entertain, the worst of the bugs and awkwardness from the last title are gone, the expanded mechanics and features are flawless.  It is a rare treat to get to play a game like this, and an absolute pleasure to praise work of such high quality.			"

												XCOM 2 is a good turn-based game -  I recommend it!GameplayYou race around a map in a very massive aircraft, collecting resources, and taking on missions.  These missions involve shooting aliens.  A large number of missions have timers (which adds a level of difficulty).  If your dudes and dudettes survive, they get more beastly.  You spend lots of time researching and building gear for your soldiers and watching them mend in the hospital after they got shot up in the last mission.  In said missions, Sometimes your soldiers really suck and you get so incredibly furious.  Other times, they totally rock and you well with pride.  There is also a big timer that works against you all game, but I found it pretty lax.  The Proving Ground (a buildable facility) throws an element of randomness into the game by never knowing what the heck those engineers will actually come up with for you (special ammo, grenades, body armour, etc). SquadI really got attached to the squad members in this game. I loved customizing them, changing voice sets, nationality, gender's, etc, to make the right set of killer dolls.  The number of reloads due to key team members biting the bullet was high.  I like the classes available for squad members, of which there are five, each with two skill options to decide between on level up.  The psionic class (unlockable by building a facility), has a nice feeling of power and can really rock the alien's world when fully trained.DifficultyI have played all the XCOM's to date and feel that perhaps XCOM UFO Defense (the oldest) was harder, but not by much (and my memory may be failing me, that was a while ago).  I played it through on normal, but had to turn it down to easy on two missions (which felt like cheating, but it was easier!).  Good on ya if you can play it on harder modes, although I didn't try them.BugsIt certainly has a few bugs, but none prevented me from accomplishing anything and at worst made me reload a save.  Mostly, they ocurred in the form of odd misclicks with the UI, a team member not getting off the dropship at mission start, terrain issues, squad members looking but not acting alive when they had been nuked by an alien, etc.  Nothing too important.Time to WreckI took my time, but it was around 35 hours or so from start to finish.

												If you like fighting aliens and if you like the idea of being the leader of a small Resistance growing in numbers with every good deed you do, then this game is the one you are looking for.After taking over the new old X-Com you not only fight for your own survival on a home planet that is not yours anymore. You also fight for the truth and the freedom mankind needs now more then ever.While playing you will very fast get this ""Just one more turn ..."" moment which can cost you several hours without noticing it.

												First of all you should watch the Youtube video titled ""XCOM (Honest Game Trailers)"" which tells the truth: ""One commander will rise and lead humans to victory by - constantly reloading a save file"" :DThis pretty much sums it up. Game is really interesting and if you like original X-Com series, Xenonauts, the previous X-Com, you will also like this game. It´s in many ways better than the previous title and the only real complaint is the fact sometimes the game is just too unfair with the odds and your whole team is wiped out in critical spot of the scenario. If you play Ironman mode this easily means you will have to restart the whole game.Some people might enjoy this but rest of us will use this ultimate tool called ""Load previous Save"" and try again. I would recommend X-Com developers try out a great game called Hard West which has replaced the traditional probability system with a ""Luck of the Draw"" combat mechanism which turns the previously random events into actions where player can influence the odds.... just an idea			"

												I used to play almost everything named XCOM since the very beginnig while Microprose was issued the first game. Deffinately this game is the best one up to now. The gameplay is quite similar to previous games and according to me is improved. Also the story line is quite interesting. The only thing that bothers me is that the game is quite demanding and I cannot push the graphics to see the maximum beaty of the details, also there is plenty of time for loading before / after the missions. Well my machine is not bad at all, but also is not the best only, so probalby a bit more powerful machine will do the job.Anyways - I am highly recommending the game to all gamers, who are fans of XCOMEnjoy !

												Different enough from EU to be fresh yet keeps the same good DNA from XCOM:EU. Most annoyances from EU redesigned like overwatch all hitting a dead target. Lots of great new mechanics and assets. However difficulty a little too brutal. Was playing 1 above easy (Veteran) - it gets a little less frustrating with plasma and psi, but still having to reload a dozen times each level for the whole game while not making ""mistakes"" was not fun for me. When I finished EU I immediately wanted to start another campaign on a harder difficulty - this time ... not so much. Also, miss mechs and gene mods from EU.			"

Taking to account I have top class PC where Xcom 2 only using 40% of graphical memory - no reason for game to crash on its own.* will type more.

												XCOM 2 has a soft space in my heart. I've tried the first XCOM, I mean, the REAL first XCOM. As much as the die-hard fans rave like rabid dogs about how amazing it is, my simple, casual, millennial mind simply can't sit down and grasp how it works or how to put up with god awful graphics (and trust me, I've played stuff like Populous, so I've got some resistance compared to my generation.)When I first found XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, I had literally no idea what I was in for. What I found was a great ""Dress up these people and make them fight aliens"" strategy game I immediately fell in love with. Making everyone look like celebrities was my best choice, and having secret agent Ben Affleck kick doors down whilst Jeremy Renner did wierd magic stuff was just hilarious.So, I was stoked for XCOM 2. Despite my usually harsh view on the videogame industry, I even pre-ordered a couple of weeks early, I was so damn excited.On launch day, I was... satisfied?XCOM 2 is buggy, feels somewhat unfinished in some areas, with some oversights included and overall loses a couple of elements of strategic depth for more ""Pfft, that's XCOM""-ness I was growing somewhat tired of. That being said, I still adore this game. The graphical upgrade is immense, and my soldiers look sillier than ever thanks to the impressive range of mods available for this game. Even in vanilla, this game still entertains me. XCOM 2's take on top-down strategy gets me immediately feeling like a strategic genius when I manage to get a grenade thrown through a wall to tear down cover for someone else to take a shot. Despite it's bugs, flaws, and it mistakenly thinking that everyone who plays it will spend six hours on every mission like some sort of chess grandmaster, playing on a lower difficulty to get to grips with the game and just having some fun with the characters makes XCOM 2 a worthy sequel to it's predecessor, building on the lore and gameplay of the first, elevating the stakes and making you feel that much smarter when grenadier Michael Bay blaster launchers an entire house to dust.MICHAEL BAY!

												Unlike XCOM1, where you had a fighting chance, to beat this game requires save scumming (or modding). While Bentley will insist you need to 'review your tactics' at the end of a failed mission, no amount of tactical play will stop the aliens from one shotting your troops through cover. This is complicated by a buggy UI that will indicate one thing, but then something else happens. Like getting hit with status effects (running through fire, acid, poison) and being spotted are not always indicated. Also, a genade's damage radius can be often misrepresented causing you to destroy a mission objective. I've had a hack objective get destroyed because I threw a grenade over it. Camera transarency glitches and other things that cause your troops to move to locations you did not intend further this issue.The game seems to let you know from the very start that you should expect casualties. OK, Firaxis. If that's the case then why can't I get more troops? I start with 9, early in the game you can get recruits for free(I got 2). A few missions later (2 died to one-shot crits through cover, 1 died to burning that the game didn't tell me I would get when I moved, 1 got one-shot by an exploding car). Now I've got 7 total, with 4 wounded. Can't even field a full squad anymore and I'm only 5 missions into the game. The game is filled with design contradictions like this. Expect to lose troops, but don't have any good means of replacing them (50 supplies is a lot for a recruit, and more than you have to spare). Time the missions, but moving quickly almost always results in an unfavorable situation. Fail a mission? Now you get reduced income from the resistance in that area. Complete a mission? I hope it was worth the bodies you had to sacrifice. As you progress, the game just stacks the negative consequences against you repeatedly until you can just forget about even playing. Because now you don't have enough troops, don't have gooed enough weapons, and don't have troops leveled sufficiently.Parts of the game are tedious and time wasters. Bentley will constanly tell you what's blatantly obvious. The camera will constantly hover over the objective when you get near it (even though it's marked from the beginning). It's just dumb how much time is wasted and how irritating it is to have to listen to and watch pointless stuff when you just want to take your turn.I have also found that the game forces you to play a certain way. In XCOM1, you spammed satellites. Now, you have to spam communications upgrades. If you don't, you will end up unable to get to mission areas and losing. Also, certain classes are much better than others. I would put specialist as the weakest in combat (but they can provide nice bonuses). Snipers are versatile if you go the pistol route, but otherwise can slow you down. Grenadiers are epic and can do some great AOE. Try dropping an acid grenade on a flare before reinforcements arrive and watch the aliens stand in place for 3 rounds as they don't want to get the debuff for moving through those tiles. Rangers seem to do the highest single target damage and can be essential to take down high hp targets. I've heard that snipers can do really well with high ground.Yes it seems to be poorly optimized (disable bloom, SSAO and AA helps). I have yet to crash, though. I can live with some minor graphical glitches and a some performance slowdowns for reaction shots. The camera can act up as well, but that's just another annoyance. The thing that is frustrating is the incosistent manner in which some tactical notifications are given. The detection while stealthed for example, can incorrectly show a spot as being safe to move to (even though you can see the alien that spots you before you make the move). The notification icons for burning, poison can decide not to show up. I've had aliens be invisible on the map, even though troops can target them (also more irritating than game-breaking).Bottom Line: wait for some mods to come out that fix game balance a bit (I like the one where you get to start with 1 engineer and 1 scientist), wait for a bug fix patch, and then get it on sale.

Pros:Engaging turn-based combat. It's easy to pick up but you quickly realize how important every single action is. One wrong move could easily result in a dead soldier. There's also a good variety of classes (4 base classes, 1 unlocked via a ship upgrade, and another is part of Shen's Last Gift DLC.)Layers of strategy: I really like the tension the game maintains. Having to choose between squad or ship upgrades, or what continent you should help first. The game has a surprising amount of depth to it.Mod support: This game has a wonderful modding community behind it. There is a huge selection of content: character customization props, addition terrain pieces, quality of life fixes, additional classes, and campaign overhauls. (On a side note: avoid any character props/races that have ""empty"" face placeholders. I.e. they only have eyes, teeth, and hair. The game will still use those for randomly generated NPCs, engineers, and scientists. That♥♥♥♥♥♥is nightmare fuel.)Character customization: Honestly, I think I spent 8 hours just making characters. There is a pretty decent selection just in the vanilla game. Add mods that allow for additional layering and more pieces and you can do pretty much anything.Replayability: Very high. Trying out different mods, different play-styles, randomly generated events and battlefields, and different upgrade priorities. No two games will be the same.Graphics & sound: The game has respectable AAA graphics and sound. Plenty of options, and runs smoothly. While the game does look good, it probably won't blow anyone away.Neutral:Story: It won't blow your mind by any measure, but the story maintains a good focus and the cut-scenes, characters, and voice acting are all well executed and maintain a good production quality.Environmental destruction: Walls, trees, and clutter items are all destructible, I just wish buildings had more dynamic destruction. Like if you took out some support beams the whole building would go down.Difficulty curve: The game goes from ""walk-in-the-park"" to ""this game is horse♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; difficulty real quick. Though, once you kind of know what your doing it's not so bad.Cons:Line of sight issues: even with mods that provide some additional feature and bug fixes, this is probably the most frustrating part of the game. Nothing will generate rage like getting one-shot through the floorboards when on your turn your character couldn't even see them.The game is still pretty buggy. On a totally vanilla game I've ran into bugs like: enemies don't take actions, and SPARK units don't end turn after using overdrive, and all their actions. Hacking mechanic: Rewards are sometimes nonsensical, and usually don't warrant the risk/reward until you get a higher level technician. I just didn't find the mechanic fun.Computer Specs: Intel i7 5930k, EVGA GTX 1080ti FE, LG 34UM95 (3440x1440, 60hz), 500GB Samsung 850 Pro SSD. "

												9/10( i have an i5 2400 3.2 ghz , 8 gb ram , amd radeon 7770 1 gb  )always liked the Xcom games and this one didn't disappoint me. it kind of started with a bad optimization launch and eventually they released a few patche to fix it . but giving that i have a low end pc, i wasnt really able to tell the difference as i got around 40-30 fps with some stuttering in the mission loading times .the main thing i like about this game is  :It had mods support. that alone is a great boost to any game. In addition, they also collaberated with the Long War team that created an amazing mod for Xcom enemy within and released a few great mods that gave more variation to the core game . There are like hundred of mods already in the workshop and they all make this game more enjoyable to play and repeat. When it comes to the story, i found it a nice change from the usual defend the earth from invasion and rather take back earth from them. and i can say for sure, every time i start a new playthrough, its always a different experience , as nothing is the same when it comes to the map layouts. with a +100 hours into this game and hopefully more into the future , i would totally recommend this game if you like strategy turn-based games ,  with a lot of customization options for your soldiers and many repeatable playthroughs.

Pessimo supporto lo avete provato lo avete dato a dei beta tester lo avete dato a giornalisti possibile che solo ora vengano fuori questi problemi mi spiace davvere tanto per il momento non  lo consiglio a nessuno almeno fino a che non faranno cio' che devono fare. per fortuna che firaxix si e' concentrato solo su questo prodotto pc ed ha abbandonato tutti gli altri progetti. nelle discussioni sentivo qualcuno che parla addirittuta di non aggiornare i driver amd, a me crashava sia con i 15 che con la versione 16 non è quello il problema è che qualcuno non ha lavorato bene. molto male firaxix al day one. falsa partenza.are six months waiting for this title that promises well, but unfortunately I can not play because he continues to freezarsi the screen. I have windows 7 and update your video drivers updated as well. most do not know what to do in order to play the game and open a few minutes later it stops at any point. Poor support you have tried it you have it given to the beta testers have it given to journalists who can only now be out of these problems sorry davvere me so for the moment I would not recommend to anyone until at least they will not do what 'they have to do. luckily firaxix you and 'just concentrating on this PC product and has abandoned all other projects. in the discussions felt someone talking addirittuta not update amd driver, I crashed with both 15 with version 16 is not the problem is that someone has not worked well. very bad firaxix on day one. false start.

												This game is amazing, heartbreaking, rage inducing and euphoric. It will have you by the edge of your seat the entire time; and it's turn action based. The difficulty is punishing. Make a wrong move and it could mess up the entire mission. So you have to be very strategic, and difficult as it may be, sometimes you just have to make some sacrifices. Do you go for the missions objective even if you could loose your best guy? Do you risk carrying out a wounded brother in arms -or just saving your own hide fleeing?Who will be the hero? Who will crumble under pressure, leaving the the team exposed? X-COM 2 is one hell of a game, well worth the coin. Maybe it has some issues with bugs, but on the whole I have no critique. The learning curve might be a little steep, and as such it might discourage new player.The way to play is to use your wits and intellect to outmaneuver the brawn of the aliens. This means that this game is not for the casual gamers looking for something to pick up and play.  If you like these types of games, this is the one for you. Look no further.			"

												I played XCOM: EU and EW on PS3 a few years ago, and was enthralled immediately. The stories, the connections you make with your soldiers, it was all so organic and it was phenomenal. The game had a handful of issues that were annoying, but were minor enough that I'd give the game an 8/10. (Enemy Within, however,is such an improvement it's a 9/10.) Now, after logging in more than a few hours into the sequel, I'd say it's as good as Enemy Within. The feeling of being a guerilla force fighting from the bottom is a great change and the timer on some missions, while occasionally annoying, ramps up the intensity. Seriously, if you're coming from a different genre and are unsure how you'll like turn based tactics, give it a try. It's more intense than almost any FPS or fighting game there is in spite of it's slow pace. 9/10			"

												-Transmission incoming- Hello Commander.  XCOM 2 is a strategy game, and is incredibly fun and rewarding. The Game takes place after XCOM: Enemy Unknown, when aliens invade and in this timeline, succeed. its up to you to save the world from its oppressors. The game is fun, and challenging, as every decison is very important. However, it does have one flaw....a big flaw. The Avatar Project, not saying any spoilers about it, but if it completes, game over. You are working against the clock to complete your mission before it completes. Its tough as nails. So tough.....too tough. Well with Steam Workshop, there is a mod called No Avatar project, if you get this game, go ahead and do it or suffer the misery called the avatar project. I love this game though, and i reccomend it to both new-comers like myself and old veterans of previous XCOM games.   "

Swapping character pools is a neat feature they put into the game, as well as story backrounds (which was another 20 hours writing the stories of 50 characters. Mod support has been amazing! It has slowed down as of recently, but there is a lot of content with the DLC out now. All in all, this game i find, is a must buy, it was one of the few games i will ever purchase day one, and i have no regrets of doing so.			"

												The game suffers from performance problems galore and odd bugs every now and then. Despite that, its a good sequel to Enemy Unknown with improved gameplay, better maps and customizations and an overall better plot with more sense of urgency.			"

												After reading a few negative reviews for this game I was worried. I'm one that hates being timed. I like to take my time to get the best possible outcome. However, this game gives you a sense of being under presser without actually feeling like no matter what you do you'll never have enough time to do anything. If you love X-COM 2 than this game is a must buy			"

												It's overall better than XCOM:Enemy Within. Maintains the general design, but refines it a lot and addresses a big chunk of the criticism. Plus it's moddable! There's quite a few interesting mods out there.It's less stable, still has quite a few bugs, but mostly related to animations and the interface. I haven't encountered anything game breaking.It's a lot more balanced, with difficulty that is coming from the high amount of alien types and their special abilities, as opposed to being able to one-shot your guys like in the previous installment. The game feels challenging, but fair, on a Veteran playthrough (difficulty 2 of 4). For comparison, the original XCOM difficulty 2 of 4 was very easy, while 3 of 4 had a very big difficulty spike due to aliens one-shotting XCOM soldiers easily in the first one third of the campaign.In my oppinion it's the best squad-focused turn-based tactical strategy game out there at the moment.My only complaint is that the end game is pretty short and you don't get that much of a chance to use the shiney last tier equipment or the most powerful abilities at your soldier's disposal. But there's a long war mod for that :P (the Partisan War mod).EDIT: A Long War 2 mod made by the original team behind the XCOM1 LW mod and backed officially by Firaxis has been launched. It's really good, brings a lot of new content (missions, research tree options, utility items, 2 whole new weapon tiers, maps, aliens, etc.) and an overhaul of the strategic (geoscape) layer. Two thumbs up for XCOM2 just because of this mod - it increases the replay value of the game hugely.			"

												Whilst I long for a faithful recreation of the original XCOM or UFO from the 90's, with its seemingly endless campaigns, huge tech trees, full environmental damage and sprawling bases, this will more than do.The world is under alien occupation and, as the resistance, it is your job to quell the alien threat.The game has two halves. Firstly, there is the planet-wide base building and mission finder, where you plan your global strategy, build up your base, choose missions, find resources and research new technologies. Secondly, there is the strategic combat element, which occurs when you send the troops in on missions and focuses on moving individual soldiers around a finite area. This works a bit like a game of chess - albeit over multiple levels and scenarios, with various targets or objectives and, of course, aliens to seek and destroy or humans to find and protect.One negative for me is the timers on missions; some are quite strict. I understand they are there to induce a sense of threat - which works if you like that - but I prefer to play slowly and methodically, coving all corners and such. With such strict turn time limits, you can't play like this as you are up against the clock! But the timer can be patched out with a mod if you so choose.With that minor gripe out the way - this is strategic and unforgiving. Just the way it should be.			"

												Since release I checked in on the critical and user reviews across the webz about this game many times. I could not help but notice its retail price had not dropped in like.. a year (how long has it been since launch?). Crappy games don't do that - the price goes down usually and fast. So i picked it up. Man oh man I have not enjoyed XCOM this much in a long time. It is not the same formula as the old XCOM so don't come in expecting that. Don't pick it up unless you have a gaming rig because it is demanding. As a point of reference, with some tweaks I am running comfortably on High and it looks and runs great. 3-year old MSI mid-range gaming laptop with a 970m gtx card - hardly groundbreaking there, and was only considered mid-high-end when it came out, awhile ago. The quality of the port is top notch. All the settings you'd expect are there, the menus are execellent, everything is bindable, no mention of a controller, no changes require a restart or reload, no crashes or technical issues at all. The atmosphere, music, sense of urgency and the gravity of each mission is awesome. I find myself actually caring about the outcome and having something actually at stake. The VIP rescue mission that you'd think I would hate actually resulted in an awesome emergent drama of sorts, a tough decision, and a major risk that paid off in full. Satisfaction, and it easily could have gone the other way. But it didn't, because I'm baf. I am playing on normal, with ironman mode (constant save, no undoing anything) and for me the ironman mode is essential, I recommend that because the stakes are 'real' and things matter more. There are more great things I could say about it such as solider progression and how that already feels so satisfying and I instantly got attached to one of them that I'm now trying to keep alive, but that covers the essentials for now..

												Really great game, if you ever played the first game you will love this one. It's just about as same as the previous but everything is improved. It's like they looked at every single aspect of the game and improved upon it. This is a big recommendation for me.Only thing that bothers me is the weird occasions where you can shoot through walls and standing exactly infront of your target with your gun literally inside their head and it's like  64% chance of hitting -.-			"

												strategic challenges have never been more present than in XCOM 2 - perhaps more so, with a constantly see-sawing balance of power and time restraints that often force you into desperate action. This isn’t a game where the heroes always win - it even assumes a canon; that you, XCOM’s Commander, failed to defend Earth in the last game.XCOM 2 is set two decades after the aliens quashed mankind. With Earth now under alien rule, Your choices matter - from what research you tell your scientists to develop, to what facility you ask you engineers to build. It is this sense of agency that makes even micromanaging your base, or deciding where to send the Avenger next, truly exciting.Most missions have a limited amount of turns in which to accomplish them, meaning a slow and careful advance is generally out of the question. It is a clever, cruel way of coaxing you into misjudgment, eking out risks when you should be patient. Sometimes you’ll be forced to send a soldier sprinting into the Fog of War just to get a grasp of the procedurally generated battlefields, but be that at your peril - they may end up toe-to-toe with an entire enemy squad and all out of moves.That being said the game is very poorly optimized and i had to do a plethera of .Ini file changes in order to get a stable 60fps, While i did manage this the task was certainly time consuming. TL/DR  Xcom-2 was an amazing purchase i got it for £10 from a humble bundle, I would not recommend paying full price but on a deep discount it certainly will net you a good few hours, I may be slighty biased being a veteran of this genre of games Xcom-2 has a vast learning curve and a immese difficulty spike, But never the less the game is endlessly enjoyable, That and with the addition of online multiplayer and steam workshop support you cannot go wrong. I give Xcom-2 an 8/10 - Definitely Worth Buying "

												Xcom 2 is a great follower to Xcom Enemy Unknown. And with the whole workshop intergration everything is nice to enable and disable when it comes to mods. The game also offers great replay abilities as every mission is different in it's own way due to the ammount of maps the game comes with (You can even find map expansions on the workshop if you do get bored of the current ones) Along with the mods the 2 last DLC's have been really great and added lots of fun to the game when it introduced back the Mech class. And the other added more dangerous aliens that makes the game more challenging just when you think you got the hands on things.There are ofcourse a few flaws as there are with many games. Nothing too major in my opinion. Most comes down to gear sometimes not loading proberly when changing it. I don't know if that is just me having that issue though. The alien turns or player turns sometimes take a long pause before switching to the next turn for some odd reason. Other than that there are few issues i am not gonna adress as they are not game breaking in any way i have noticed.I will gladly recommend this game to people! It is a great game and there are as said many possibilities whitin it! "

												There is so much that this game has going on for itself.It is a successful remake of a magnificent game series. Granted the original xcom was a true tactical and strategic game, that required hours upon hours of micromanagement to actually get ahead of the aliens. But that was then and this is now. Granted this game is not a ""true to heart"" remake of the original. But they got the original idea of the alien invasion and created a game from scratch, with a breath of new ideas coupled with stunning graphics.The only downside I can find is the technical problems that arise. However, they have a dedicated support that tries to solve issues and a little online search can fix most issues.Added on top of that a thriving workshop and modding community and you got hours of replayability.I can't but recommend that game.

												Well, Firstly I say that this game is not for the faint of heart. You will see your dreams crushed, and your men and women under your command shot, burnt, panicked and generally trying not to die in spite of your bad decisions. I still havn't beaten the game and I will likely try again here very soon. There is a nice collection of mods avaliable here for you to choose from to fit your fancy. The story behind this game is pretty solid, I have enjoyed it so far. One of the cons is the additional DLCs but I coughed up the money and was pleased by the results.I am now daring to try the Long War 2 mod for XCOM2! I will be updating this review as the tale of the war continues.The Second Long War has been lost. Shen was lost in a final desperate battle trying to take down the final sectopod in a desperate gamble to begin adding new SPARK combat robots to my flagging combat teams. The start of the war was marked by desparate skirmishes against superior forces, while XCOM was forced to fight on the move. In the process losing good men and women to mind control, explosions and bullets. The only bright spot in a grim and dark war was Delta Squad, lead by the commando ""Boss"", with Sev, Fixer and Scorch. Delta Squad was 100% successful with no fatalities among the four of them. At each battle the going was worthy of a epic poem. If you needed to slip in undetected break out a VIP and scoot before ADVENT knew what hit them, Delta was the answer. The Roughneck Moccasins were completely wiped out on thier first mission. The Avengers managed to survive thier first mission, but at the cost of 85% casualties. On the Avengers second mission they were destroyed to a man by the new viper units being deplyed by advent across africa and india. The Black Night's Watch faired better at first, three successful mission in a row with under 65% casualties each mission was still a grim fair, but at least they got the job done. With the fateful mission comeing to my attention I decided to run with the Black Night's Watch. I regret that decision. We went in with a full complement of six soldiers. No one came out... With Shen lost, the XCOM project could not continue and humanity was doomed. Final ReviewXCOM2  - 4 of 5LongWar2  - 5 of 5 Mod Support  - 5 of 5In a few words: Gritty, Rewarding, Captivating, Hellacious. I would do it again.			"

However, SO MANY attacks happen during that time, you cannot properly pick them up. It's non-stop, CONSTANT raids. Other players have mentioned this, but I will too: the game is extremely buggy... as in LOTS of bugs. This was a rush job and a shoddy game. The devs should be ashamed of themselves.			"

												Very good gameIts a board game in a video game, and if you like boardgames or the idea of board games like this but dont like roughness of the miniture board games that just needs streamlining with line of sight and hit chance ( which is hard to do with miniture games) This is the game that will scratch that itch			"

												First of all you should watch the Youtube video titled ""XCOM (Honest Game Trailers)"" which tells the truth: ""One commander will rise and lead humans to victory by - constantly reloading a save file"" :DThis pretty much sums it up. Game is really interesting and if you like original X-Com series, Xenonauts, the previous X-Com, you will also like this game. It´s in many ways better than the previous title and the only real complaint is the fact sometimes the game is just too unfair with the odds and your whole team is wiped out in critical spot of the scenario. If you play Ironman mode this easily means you will have to restart the whole game.Some people might enjoy this but rest of us will use this ultimate tool called ""Load previous Save"" and try again. I would recommend X-Com developers try out a great game called Hard West which has replaced the traditional probability system with a ""Luck of the Draw"" combat mechanism which turns the previously random events into actions where player can influence the odds.... just an idea			"

												Awesome game!!! I played a lot of the XCOM before and XCOM 2 it's even better!Sound, art and all design it's well made. A lot of customization for the character and many new combat features.I haven't found any of the bugs mentioned in the reviews. I played once for 5 hours straightforward and no FPS drop.Tip: If you played XCOM before, beware: XCOM 2 throws Sectoids (which have a lot of HP and can mind control) in your face right from the beggining. This is RIDICULOUS UNFAIR, but you will like the challenge.			"

												Sent Bob Ross to fight a war against aliens that look like Shrek and the cast of the teletubbies.-10/10 Skyrim with lazersGood:-Great Gameplay, still as good as Xcom but with more detail and new things to do.-Great Steam Workshop-Immersive Story, follows  up the events of Xcom but it can still be played without any previous knowledge.-Amazing Character Customization, not only that but there are several great skins in the Workshop, which brings us to the next point.-Massive Workshop, from everything to new maps, guns and skins to making your soldiers look and sound like Bob Ross.-Challenging, however there are some BS moments in this game this game is hard because it takes good planning and execution for every mission, not only that you need to learn how to properly manage your base and how you spend your time, time in this game is precious as there is a limited ammount of time in between missions where you can decide to research new technologies which will help you on your road to victory.-Much Longer than the last game, it took me 40 hours to finish my first playthrough of Xcom, im 42 hours in and im still not halfay through the story.-Just plain good fun, there is nothing more satisfying than perfectly executing a mission (that is after you reload 12 times)Bad:-Can be Frustrating, If you easily rage quit because of minor things this is not a game for you, you will find yourself reloading previous saves due to some BS like missing a crucial 99% chance shot and then gettin instantly killed from the other side of the map.-The DLC is not great, dont get me wrong it does adds a couple of new things and more gameplay but the alien rulers DLC is just bad, the ""Rulers"" are stupid overpowered to the point that it makes the game unplayable in the early stages, not difficult, just bad, if you start the dlc in the late game it is pretty cool and you wont have too much trouble getting through it. The other DLC however is just more character customization stuff but you can get better in the workshop for free. Shens last gift however is a pretty cool dlc which adds the option of sending robots instead of troop to missions just like in the previous Xcom.Overall i would really recomend this game to hardcore Xcom fans and people who haven't played Xcom before, it is a great challenging experience.

This game doesn't look any better than Enemy Unknown and that game would run smoothly at max settings for me.			"

												The following is my experience after a few hours of playing Long War 2 (the XCOM 2 Total Conversion), and the reason I remembered XCOM 1 as a better game than XCOM 2 felt at release. Long War 2 is simply the way the game must be played:""It looks like the game I remember xcom1 being, and the reason why I didn't really play much xcom2, it felt too easy and less like a war and more like a series of little skirmishes. In war, people die, often.So, I went into LW2 feeling pretty confident with my skills. Of course I lost 2 soldiers on gatecrasher and had to restart. After that I found out about the infiltration thingy, and looked it up. Pretty simple, and anyone who does not understand it, simply look for 100%+ infiltration, if it is not possible then simply avoid that mission.Had 3 squads of about 8-10 soldiers with 2 casualties after about 12 missions, thought I was doing really good. Then, Mutons and Vipers (and their new variant) started appearing, as well as MECs. Had to abort a guerilla op which in turn gave the enemy a UFO looking for me.Got hit around australia and the next scenario is a total nightmare. I sent my less leveled team, thinking I would get reinforcements if I lost people and thinking that I WOULD get hit really hard. But I was extremely underestimating the enemy.Holding the line became something like an inverse D-day for a couple of turns, hitting the enemy and them dropping like flies. Then it started to go to hell, my soldiers dropping left and right, stun lancers and vipers picking off soldiers. mecs dropping misiles on my positions, and I couldn't even leave the ramp to look for the disruptor.After about 10 turns of madness a gap appeared and I sent a shinobi to go kamikaze on the disruptor while what was left held the line. The battle was 36/42 for the aliens and I lost 6 soldiers KIA and 6 WIA (3 left behind)With a squad crippled, Advent now attacked a Haven. Barely held the line with 3 more casualties and 2 wounded.In just 2 missions, the game told me to sit down and cry as I only have 1 squad left (of badass soldiers from all 3 squads) and about 6 guys wounded and no replacements at all. Loving it.""			"

												Great Game the first few months , but now that I've revisited it after some time, the damn thing crashes every 20 min. or so.  Nothing has changed as far as my rig and it's more than adequate to run this game, as it proved itself early on with little to no issues. It ran a solid 60FPS with my CPU temps at 40-50 and GPU never above 60.  I do recall a recent patch  last week and I have little doubt thats what jacked up a fine game.  I still recommend this game aslong as they fix what did'nt need fixing.			"

												The sequel of the best acclaimed Turn Based Strategy Game and I hope... really hope we are gonna get XCOM 3 :)This game is good... not as good as previous XCOM IMO... Having played them side by side...The camera is a bit weird... LOS is broken in some places...The difficulty scaling is better but the end games enemy is just annoying and/or broken rather than challenging... Having played this the moment I finished XCOM 1... At first this game is not as good as it's predecessor... and gonna feel like a bad game at first... but the longer you play it... the more you are gonna appreciate it that it is actually a sequel and a good XCOM game...The stealth mechanic is broken... literally... the longer u stay undetected is actually better for the enemy... so guns blazing all the way...Avatar time is just not good... It kills the diversity of how u want to play the game your own way... the timer on the mission is not that bad thoughThe mod... Oh the mod... XCOM 2 make the mod actually legal from the get go... and there is so much QOL mod you really want to install into the game without breaking it...IMO the mod make a good XCOM game into great XCOM game...If u already finished it... or if you want a challenge or want to play this game in a different and good way... I recommend the long war 2 mod... It makes a 8/10 game into 9/10 game... Very nice mod to hav			"

												OK, after perusing a number of threads, I'm convinced this was more user error than design flaws.  The biggest mistake I made was to start with all DLC active.  Anyone playing from release would have had a lot of experience before even seeing that.  I unchecked Alien Hunters at the start of the new campaign.  I'm also going to rethink my base development, research and mission choices, and try to connect more quickly with other regions.Since I have had a lot of fun playing until recenlty, it is kind of unfair to not recommend.Let's just call it a moment of weakness.

												Save your money on this one, even at half off. After downloading the game and waiting for the launcher to apply all the patches, I was very dissappointed when I clicked ""Play"" and was presented with an error message. I tried a couple more times with the same results. I Googled the error and found many other posts of others having the same problem. I applied for a refund but somehow, between the Launcher's patching and the troubleshooting I've done, Steam says I've ""played"" for over 5 hours. I tried a second time explaining I've not ""played"" the game once but apparently time sitting in the Launcher counts as ""playing"". Yeah, I really enjoyed that ""play"" time. Shame on you Steam!

												As a huge fan for XCOM EU, I have to say my expectations for this game were pretty high. XCOM 2 exceeded those expectations as it only added to the greatness that was found in the previous game. The only downgrade in my opinion would be the atmosphere. In EU there was a slight sense of fear but unfortunately in 2 they didn't really hit that mark as that had before. Overall it's one of my favorite games of all time, right next to XCOM EU, highly recommend (on impossible ironman of course lol).			"

												In the beginning, this game and me had...issues. Now we've sorted it out though, and...well, I have other games.Anyway, this one differs from the first game in the sense that here you're gonna be under time preassue for some of the missions. Move with haste and you're all good. This game also plays out on the assumption the aliens pulled off their invasion of earth, and now it's time for ""Le resistance"" (say it out loud with a french accent).Come the higher difficulty levels, you have to realize you have to beat the game. Relying on 90% hit chances to save your day (or night) won't work, what it'll do is give you an actual headache instead. When things come together though it's beautiful, Once you manage to sort that out, your beefy operatives will slice through aliens as there was nothing to it, and this is one of the true joys of this game:It starts out tough, just like you'd imagine it would be to start a resistance movement, but once you've gained momentum, you really get the sensation you have them on the run. You put them on their heels, you're at their rear nagging, and just waiting for them to shout out the all familiar ""E.T. phone home"" in dispair.On top of that, it's very nicely made, a beauty to watch. I strongly recommend this game, and urge you to give it some time. Don't worry, it won't mind you having other games on the side.			"

												In the desert of a year filled with misleading marketing, broken releases, and disappointing games, XCOM 2 is an oasis.  When people look back on 2016, most of its titles, inde and AAA alike, will have been forgotten either for their mediocrity or out of the shame for having purchased them.  But not this one.Those who enjoyed XCOM: Enemy Unknown will find XCOM 2 well worth their money, time, and attention.  If 2K can continue to do work this good with the series, then it will take its place among the best franchises of gaming.  They really have done that well with it.The continued story remains true to the franchise, the objectives structure is familiar yet novel enough to entertain, the worst of the bugs and awkwardness from the last title are gone, the expanded mechanics and features are flawless.  It is a rare treat to get to play a game like this, and an absolute pleasure to praise work of such high quality.			"

												Awesome game...it surpasses the first Xcom in every way in my opinion. Although the previous version is awesome, this one just feels like a more complete game.I also bought the DLC, but I'm not sure I made the right move there...one of them simply added enemies to the game which are super tough. They spank you while you are in the middle of a mission, then they leg it through a portal, only to return another time to slap you around some more. Rinse and repeat until you eventually kill them, which then allows you to research them to get new armour etc.  I personally found this just added frustration to an already difficult game.All in all however, the base game is definitely worth getting. 9/10			"

												It's XCOM2 !   If you liked XCOM EW you will like XCOM2.Graphically it is a much enhanced game.  Maps are more open, colorful, and varied with lots of sparkly effects. Some groups of enemies have patrol routes, which makes for a more interesting tactical experience. Timed objectives occur more often - though not with the frequency those complaining about them would have you believe.New soldier skills have been added, and some modified to liven up combat.  Rangers carry a blade for close combat and sharpshooters are now the only pistol carriers.  Both these classes acquire specialized skills for these weapons.Altering soldiers' visual appearance and history has reached a new high.  You can write their bio, change their country of origin, and accessorize - with more options opening up as they level.   You can even color and name their weapons.  On the down side, the base physical features of each race seem more homogenized and less country specific. Lots of attention to small graphical details has been taken throughout the game.   Soldiers have grim, tense expressions flying to a mission, and cheerful, relieved expressions flying back.  The intro loading screen will pick a soldier on your roster ( in their current gear ) and show them spying on an Advent position. You can give your soldiers cigars and cigarettes, earrings, scars and tattoos.  The downside of all this graphical goodness is that it comes at a price.  If you've been nursing along an older computer system with infusions of RAM and a slightly better graphics card,  you may not be satisfied with how the game runs. There are a lot of options in the graphics setup, so it is possible to find a setting that is bearable on an older system,  but it won't be pretty and frame rates will stutter on some weapon effects.Before XCOM2 i've been playing XCOM EW with the Long War mod.  While XCOM2 is definitely an improvement over the base XCOM EW, I have mixed feelings on how it compares to the Long War modded version.  Graphics aside, more different than better.

												I've beaten the game. Awesome!  I love it.....but I am a fan of x-com since the original Ufo: Enemy unknown in the 90's came out.Let me be absolutelly straight with you. If you're a new to X-com, this will be a brutal experience. You will likely lose your first campaign, or three. And I'm not talking legendary difficulty. You'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed over to you on normal. You will watch your soldiers die and missions fail.But that is the point. This is the dark souls of the strategy games. It is a challenge. A true gauntlet testing your will, resilience, ingenuity and ability to learn. It is always an uphill battle. You will never be in comfortable position of power. Enemy has more troops, stronger units and economy.This game will not pamper you as they are trying to tell you straight in the tutorial sequence. I will reccommend the game but the final decision is yours - do you have what it takes to save humanity?			"

												How come this turn based strategy game is excessively choppy when set to ""very high"" graphics on my overclocked Intel i7-4790K /SSD drive/ overclocked 16 GB RAM / GeForce GTX 970 system? This is not a high FPS 1st person shooter game where I might tolerate that.What have you (Firaxis) guys done to the multiplayer game over WAN, again? The timer clock ""slips"" all the time, skipping several seconds. It very frequently re-sets to the past, counting again. There is a HUGE wait time for the opponent turn. I am talking anywhere between 2 minutes and 10 !!!! yes 10 minutes wait time for my turn again. A single multiplayer game can easily last 2 hours, 80% of which is wait time. You call this acceptable?[EDIT // 10 March, 2016]: Patch 2 today brings the game to where it was supposed to be on day one.

												This game is set in present day Madagascar and you play the role of a middle aged, quick witted roguish like character (whos devilishly handsome by the way). Nolan North's voice acting once again stuns as his quick wit and impeccable delivery coupled with his masterful acting ability. The gameplay is as you'd expect, third person, coverbased, keeps you right in the action at all times as you run swiftly between cover barely escaping the depleted uranium flying over your head. The story is serviceable, nothing spectacular but gets the job done. I'd recommend this action packed cover shooter to any gamer in the gamerverse whether it be a seasoned veteran or a rook looking to wet his whistle. 3/10			"

												In comparsion to its predecessor this game is for me clearly an improvment, with a few drawbacks.I restarted the campaign 2 times, because I made some early mistakes. But now I am pretty late game, fighting against monstrous Sectopods and Gatekeepers with an almost fully equiped Squad (altough i do hope i did not reach the end of the research  tree, with one research left). The good things:For me each time a new enemy appeared was like a new challenge (besides the avatar that one was strangely easy).Each with their own strenght and weaknesses.This games rewards Tactics. Ive read that some ppl complain about timers. And i do agree the first time I saw those timers i rushed and almost lost my entire squad. Now I take some time in the beginning (obvious not too much) for a good positioning and a good engage which gives you enough time to finish the rest of the mission leisurely. Now i almost always have 2-3 sometimes even 4-5 rounds left before finishing those missions. Lots of customization, not just looks but gameplay changeing. Want a heavy front line ranger with heal? Get those heal armor with a w.a.r suit bladestorm and untouchable. Or a more stealthy approch with Wraith Suit its crappling hook and Phantom?  Change weapons parts for extra shots bigger mags higher aim and so on.Psi. I love psi. and its OP. Mindcontroll those heavy Gatekeepers? check.And i love those new Specialists. In my opinion one of the biggest changes to xcom. Ranged heal and hacking.Heavy Sectopod killing your squad? Hack it!Ranged heal allows for a more spreaded approch without being in risk that your frontline warrior cant be healed.Great replayability. Each playthrough will have other missions/strarting place so you need to adapt to what you get.The not so good:Lack of freedom. I would love to have really easy and really hard missions from the beginning. Right now Enemy strenght evolves with your own, which doesnt make sense for me. It would be much better if there would be lightly guarded remote post to attack. Or those big Strongholds with many guards and advanced Defenses and the player would have the choice when to attack which place.Now i have my standard squad and if one gets hurt 2-4 reserve Soldiers to swap out, greatly reducing my power, You could say thats my fault because I focuesed too much on my squad. but on the other hand, i knew each mission will be harder and i picked the best for it. If i would have the choice to attack an place that isnt that much of a problem i could use some rookies to give them expirience. And not to forget you cant really decide were to attack. Mostly you get 3 choices from which you can choose one and thats it. And mostly you choose those mission because of their reward. And late game you most likely will pick Supplies because thats what you need most.No optional fights. Ok you could say you dont need to fight each mission but not doing one is in general a really bad idea. Loosing supplies/scientists/engineers/intel no exp gain and so on. And if you cant do mission because all you soldiers are hurt i would strongly suggest you restart the game.			"

												In the beginning, this game and me had...issues. Now we've sorted it out though, and...well, I have other games.Anyway, this one differs from the first game in the sense that here you're gonna be under time preassue for some of the missions. Move with haste and you're all good. This game also plays out on the assumption the aliens pulled off their invasion of earth, and now it's time for ""Le resistance"" (say it out loud with a french accent).Come the higher difficulty levels, you have to realize you have to beat the game. Relying on 90% hit chances to save your day (or night) won't work, what it'll do is give you an actual headache instead. When things come together though it's beautiful, Once you manage to sort that out, your beefy operatives will slice through aliens as there was nothing to it, and this is one of the true joys of this game:It starts out tough, just like you'd imagine it would be to start a resistance movement, but once you've gained momentum, you really get the sensation you have them on the run. You put them on their heels, you're at their rear nagging, and just waiting for them to shout out the all familiar ""E.T. phone home"" in dispair.On top of that, it's very nicely made, a beauty to watch. I strongly recommend this game, and urge you to give it some time. Don't worry, it won't mind you having other games on the side.			"

												Most has already been said. I'm pretty annoyed with the game and it's unpredictability.The only way you can keep your squad alive is by inching your way forward - and even then you suddenly get 2 poeple poisoned by a viper through a solid wall...The hang after mission completion is especially annoying and the known bugs and support pages are pretty much a joke.The last patch was a quarter year ago, but the dev does not really seem to be interested in actually supporting the product.Whether you like the design is up to taste, of course, I happen to disagree with the 'chunky' and clumsy feel of the combat dynamics and the camera always doing stuff on its own to zoom at some event for ages during combat.It rarely is where you want it to be and gets ripped out of your control for seconds befor you get it back.Enemies gratuitously gesticulate around while the camera is glued to them - in the middle of a heated battle. It kind of creates a ridiculous full stop of the battle dynamic.Just like with the camera you get a felling that you are not in control how the game develops. I always feel that I don't have any significant decisions I can even make - it's all so closely constrained that it feels pretty limited and therefore boring.This is a real pity, because I quite liked several aspects, but they get smothered in above mentioned problems.

												Xcom: Enemy Unknown was my first turn based strategy game that I really put any time into. I thoroughly enjoyed the first one which was a surprise since I'm usually not too fond of turn based anything. So to keep it short, if you liked the first one you will definitely enjoy the second. If you haven't played the first one I'd highly recommend it, it will make your experience with xcom 2 a whooooole lot less frustrating. There's a lot of innovative enhancements to the original gameplay to keep it fresh and interesting but still has the core Xcom feel. I really like the new skills they added and the more in depth class system. Also the character customization is awesome, I thought I wouldn't give a damn about character appearance in a game like this but there's a lot of options and it makes you that much more inclined to try and keep your favorite soldiers alive. Another thing, I've seen quite a few reviews complaining about bugs and glitches interfering with gameplay. There are definitely some AI bug issues, but in my case nothing interfered with my gameplay other than the occasional pause because the game gets stuck on the enemy turn for a few seconds. The rest were pretty small and easily ignorable bugs. (Again, this was my personal experience) I don't have too much negative feedback to give on this game other than certain missions feeling way too hard for your current progress and some lag and pauses during the enemy turn. NOTE TO NEW PLAYERS: PERSONAL SUGGESTION, DON'T DO IRON MAN ON YOUR FIRST PLAY THROUGH. I WOULD HAVE SMASHED MY WHOLE COMPUTER TO PIECES.The good:-great new skills-MOST of the time the difficulty feels balanced as you progress-in depth customization-longer story, more hours of fun gameplay-great for players new to strategy games. Easy to learn, but it keeps you challenged-story is more interesting than the first-looks goodThe bad:-painfully frustrating at times. Some might consider this a good thing for a strategy game, but a lot of those times I felt like I had been cheated instead of outplayed-shot percentages feel like they are always way less than what they say (60% feels like 40%) maybe I'm just a ♥♥♥♥♥-some of the countdown missions feel way too rushed and next to impossible to come out with a success and a full crew. Then again that may have been the intention. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-Small bugs and glitches-long loading screens8/10			"

												Morbo says,""THIS GAME IS LOTS OF FUN, EXCEPT WHEN MORBO'S FRIENDS DIE!  I WILL DESTROY YOU!""But seriously, this game is excellent.  I've always been an X-Com fanboy (so read everything I say with suspicion), but they've done the series a service with both this and the XCOM (1) games.  I can't wait for the next game.What's great:The combat system has been seriously upgraded in my eyes, even from the first XCOM game.  The addition of new classes and their own special skills has really changed how you play...in a good way.  The battles are more fluid and I think they're more difficult than they've ever been.  The difficulty is offset by capability, however.There's no management of the mundane.  No, I don't have to reload ammo on my troops.  No, I don't have recruit hundreds of scientists and allocate them all to different labs.  No, I don't have to waste time.The storyline is excellent.  I love the continuation of the original storyline and the way it plays into the story of this game.What's not so great:Little bugs here and there with my system and the graphics.  Nothing that's caused the game to crash yet, so this is really not a big deal.All in all, this is an excellent continuation of the XCOM series and might be my favorite yet.			"

												Upfront TL;DR: I recommend XCOM2 to anyone who is remotely interested in strategy/tactical rpg games and does not mind a few hiccups in optimization.It is like a sci-fi Fire Emblem without anime cutscenes and support convos (all that waifu♥♥♥♥♥♥ and adds good graphics and destructible environments. XCOM2's plot is the classic Good vs. Evil with some philosophical drops of ""we are becoming what we set out to destroy"".The real story, however, is the success and failure of XCOM agents under your command. BTW If you can't play a game without your precious waifus then download a voice pack for them and add them to your character pool. Pretty sure there are a bunch of neptunia heads and voice packs in the workshop. See, everyone's happy. Introduction:     This review is tailored for those who have not played any iteration of XCOM, so that it better informs those interested in trying the game out. Before continuing, I want to say that mods are a double edged sword in this game. They enhance play and decrease performance at the same time (subscribed to 300 atm). I cannot deny the fantastic additions graced to XCOM2 by the modding community, but I hope to review the ideas and concepts that the vanilla version succeeded/failed to accomplish on its own.Specs: i7-6700K @ 4.00GHz (4.36GHz)16 GB RAMGTX 1070 Pros: +The ability to extensively customize your soliders contributes a sense of attachment to  soldiers you are ordering around, something most games cannot emulate. +Map generation is very well designed/balanced so that the same tileset/area can offer many different avenues of play. +Configurable settings via the xcom ini can further modify play, leading to more replayability. For example, you can change the base stats of every character/item in the game if you wanted.+There is some base management, but it is not too extensive and does not feel tacked on just because ""every other game has some form of it"" (the original XCOM had this too).+Combat is interesting and offers different approaches to problems through the soldier class system, plethora of researchable gear, and destructible environments. +The emphasis on limited time (in combat and on a macro scale) to rebel against Earth's alien overlords provides a sense of urgency that many games strive for yet miss. +Your soldiers and the aliens become stronger as the game goes on, which creates a sense of each side trying its hardest to defeat the other. +Countless workshop mods offer something new and exciting to experience through multiple playthroughs.  +There is an ironman mode (Only one save state) for tryhards. Variable difficulty as well, which is good for new players. +A game that discourages facerolling over every button on your keyboard. Cons:-You have to realize this game has its optimization issues.  -Loading screens can be long, depending on your settings and how many mods you decide to download. I think the base game does not have this problem as much as a heavily modified one. -Frame rate drops slightly when discovering enemies, unloading from your transport, and initializing props to customize your soldiers with. These frame rate issues, however, can be easily ignored since they only occur at specific points in the game and do little to hinder the gameplay itself.-Do not play at max settings, even the best rigs will have trouble stabilizing at that golden 60fps.-Due to the nature of XCOM2, it being quite a long game, these problems seem to be more apparent later on when there are simply more characters in a given mission (larger squad size, more enemies, etc.). -There are not many gameplay elements that I feel XCOM2 failed to deliver on, but indeed there are many annoyances within the vanilla version that have either been patched already or allieviated by the free mods inside the workshop. Conclusion:     So if you do buy the game and see something that is offputting, check out the workshop to see if a solution has already been distributed.More than likely if you see something as a problem, someone else has too.      This concludes my review of XCOM 2. If you made it this far, then congratulations on either scrolling fast or reading.			"

												My first review so bear with me. I've put a lot of time into this game, with and without mods (highly suggest you play with cosmetic mods) This game is amazing in both a challenging standpoint (If you play on harder difficulty) and strategical. If your a fan of turn-based strategy games, this is a must have. It makes you think about the long term (If I place this guy here will they be able to flank him if so and so misses) and you will miss, those 90% shots have failed me many of times. The story ins't very immersive but what it lacks in story is makes up for in customization to each character, letting you make their own story as to why they are fighting and for who. The one thing I DO NOT like about the game, is that a lot of the missions have timers. Some timers I don't mind but to have them on as many missions as they do takes away from the strategic planning, although in increases the difficulty a lot especially newcomers to the game or genre.

												XCOM 2 is a great game. With the workshop support I kept coming back to get new experiences every time I run a new campaign. Although the game up to today is still in my opinion very buggy. But not losing hope that one day it would be smooth as a baby's bottom because the devs are still patching the game today and have some communication with the community, which is great considering XCOM 2 is a coouple of months old now. Overall the mods are what kept me going back and for me, the modding scene is still a bit young and I havent seen any much of a huge overhaul yet like the long war did for the previous title. Definitely worth buying.			"

												XCOM returns, and it is back with a resounding bang. I won't give away any plot details, but X2 offers a deeper look into the various supporting characters (not your soldiers) than its predecessor; while  maintaining the general overall feel of Enemy Unknown/Within. With improved game mechanics and animations, X2 truly feels like the next step in the franchise.However, there are some performance problems with the game at launch (especially on lower-end machines); including various memory issues and slow-down as the game progresses and more enemy units start to flood the screen. At the time of this posting, 2K has stated they will be addressing these issues in forthcoming patches so be assured that the problems are temporary. A big boon is that XCOM 2 is mod-friendly. This is fantastic because, for me, there are a few glaring negatives that can be ""ModFixed"". The default camera control is terrible and can be utterly frustrating- especially if you want to see from floor to floor of a building or get an over the shoulder view of your soldier without having to spend far too long fiddling with the controls. Another negative, (or positive to some) is the mission timers. IMO, most instances of their use are out of place and rehashed in order to create a sense of urgency. But thankfully, there are mods out there to add either a set number to these timers, randomize the time to keep things interesting, remove them all together- or my favorite; have the timers not start until your group is revealed from concealment. Go Go Mod Community.In the end, XCOM 2 is a great game with high replayability and is worth every dollar per hour for the purchase price. If you love Sci-Fi and strategic/tactical combat buy this game; you won't regret it.9/10 ... 10/10 Modded.			"

												First thing, the difficultly level, for me, is fine at the default. Perhaps I just suck.  ;) I love how many of the old systems from the last Xcom have been carried over but in some cases improved. Having reload of your weapon not end your turn for example.Somethings, I'm not sure about.The will loss (from taking damage?) that recovers from doing well at a future mission is annoying. Thankfully panic is much less of a mission ender. The aliens start with some pretty powerful abilities from the get go this time. One thing that I didn't like, is the early mind control. When you have a squad of 4 it's a big deal. You hardly ever resist it. It can even end your mission if your entire squad is mind controlled. The only saving grace is that the aliens won't damage mind controlled teammates, so sometimes it actually saves you. (when a surprised flanked unit gets taken for example) edit: actually, they will target mind controled units if they have nothing else to shot at.My biggest beef with the game is how the timed missions with random maps work. You will have X amount of time to do something and get to a certain point. However, because the maps are random, sometimes that point can be so hard to get to that even if you ignored the aliens and dashed right for it your cutting it close. I don't mind the rush effect sometimes, but I like to take my time and do things systematically. They need to have at least one more turn added to them across the board. Moving units to different levels is STILL a pain. I have had units run to the wrong point because it's hard to tell exactly what level your selecting your space on. A couple of pods activated through walls too.It's overall a good game. It needs to be tweaked somewhat however. Thankfully it's supposed to be super mod friendly, so we will see. I suggest to anyone who loved the last XCOM, to get this one. It is good game overall.			"

												Story20 years have passed since the events in XCOM: Enemy Unknown and humanity has fallen under alien control. The once supportive council nations have sided with the new alien government during the height of their invasion. Using an administration known as Advent to become a disposable source of manpower, the aliens make an aggressive campaign to earn obedience and loyalty with earth's population. Harsh crowd control tactics and an abundance of Advent propaganda are utilized to invoke fear across the globe. With immense government funding they are a force to be reckoned with, in regards to both manpower and military equipment.XCOM has become an almost forgotten remnant of the past, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for the human race. However, Resistance forces have burrowed themselves into small pockets of the world, working tirelessly to overthrow Advent and fight for what was once their's. With little resources and time, a small squad of resistance forces act on newly provided Intel. This lead suggests a possible location for a tremendously important figure that is being held in an Advent facility, the Commander. Once rescued and revived from a medically induced cryo-sleep, the player (taking on the role of The Commander) is briefed on the current state of Earth. With a shell of what XCOM once was, you must gather resources and individuals loyal to the cause and restore XCOM to it's former glory. Technological advancements and utilizing your soldiers abilities to the fullest are the foundation for success, but strategic planning and careful military tactics are what it's built on. Expand the reach of the Resistance by aiding smaller Resistance forces, and set back Advent's development of a mysterious weapon known as the Avatar Project by completing important assignments and destroying key Advent facilities.GameplayXCOM 2 is a turn-based tactical strategy game that is in a league of it's own. Never before have I played a game that has bestowed so much weight in every decision you make. On masterfully designed multi-level maps that are almost entirely destructible, soldiers are controlled like chess pieces with a limit to how many actions they may perform, or tiles they can move. With limited vision of your surroundings, every enemy encounter can be in the players favor through already established defenses, or brutally devastating by enemy flanking maneuvers and abilities. The presence of perma-death only adds to the tension of enemy engagements, and ending your turn pits your tactics against an intelligent and equally lucky AI.Concealment is the latest and greatest feature, allowing you to enter missions undetected and grants you the ability to ambush your enemies. Solid defensive placement and foreknowledge can be the difference between a devastating blow to Advent forces or a fatal backfire. In addition, a multitude of weapons, armor, and utility items are at your disposal, assuming you researched the necessary criteria and had the required supplies. As well as new and useful abilities that give your soldiers a major advantage on the battlefield, granted you use them correctly.What flaws are to be found in XCOM 2 however are incessantly apparent. (For Enemy Unknown veterans they may come at no surprise.) These include shots and abilities making contact through walls and objects, hanging animations in certain circumstances following Overwatch shots or soldier placement, numerous instances of clipping, and obscure lines of sight that are both infuriating and laughable. Now these are not game-breaking by any nature but they are certainly a nuisance. Furthermore, they work both ways so while you may be victim to some quite frankly BS shots, you too may find yourself with the same unfair advantage.User interface and camera controls work well throughout the majority of the game, in small instances though they can be incredibly temperamental. One wrong click can mean the difference between short or high cover, spotted or concealed, dead or alive, so it's aggravating when action keys are click-through if a friendly soldier is nearby or when travel routes get finicky when rotating the map.When not in combat, time is of the essence as Advent will make slow but steady progress to completing their Avatar Project. If they do, you have a short amount of time to attack a facility or complete specific objectives that stagger it's construction. A great deal of missions are time sensitive as well, requiring the player to make aggressive advancements and react accordingly to enemy reinforcements. Even without a turn/time limit, every action and choice comes with a reward or consequence and XCOM 2 does a great job at making you aware of the result. Tense combat situations, challenging AI and enemy variants, and an immense amount of player freedom and customization. SoundXCOM 2 offers as much depth in the sounds and music as it does in it's gameplay. Music is triumphant in success and shattering in defeat. Sound effects are appropriately fitting to each circumstance whether it's gunfire and explosions or destruction and animations. Aliens come to life with intimidating battle-cry's and soldiers express their panicked state or wounded cries in disconcerting fashion. Dialogue and voice acting is dramatic but not over the top. A satisfying blend of military criticality  as well helpless emotions when things take a turn for the worse. Cinematic scenes are enjoyable both visually and aurally, however (and maybe this was a bug) facial animations noticeably lacked movement when soldiers communicated their understanding of each order.GraphicsFor a game that doesn't need to be graphically beautiful to attract strategy enthusiasts, XCOM 2 is stunning. The amount of detail in the environments, models, armor and weapons, visual effects and lighting are astounding. In what's simply an isometric plane comprised of tiles and levels, it is filled with so much character and tone that it comes to life the moment you touch down. Combat animations resemble movies in the re-positioning camera and the surroundings crumble and shatter from forceful explosions or enemy movement. Unfortunately, detail like this comes at a price. My gameplay experience maintained solid framerates for the majority of the play-through. Key word majority, guess-timating that atleast 30% of my time was spent wtaching frames drop to as low as 24FPS and then right back up to 60. These occurrences were almost always during cinematic moments, whether it was in or out of combat didn't matter. Destructible environments make for a great gameplay mechanic but when it's framerate teeters back and forth regardless, more ground clutter and visual effects only hurt performance more. Luckily these instances don't take away much from the gameplay itself, but become immersion breaking with frequency. (Ultra on 2560x1080 - i7 6700k / GTX 980 ti)Replay ValueArguably infinite, nearly pattern-less. While most missions follow a similar formula for enemy locations and objective markers, the breadth of possibilities is so vast that you're never experiencing the same fight twice. On a global scale and even inside combat enemies behave intelligently and pose a threat to your entire Resistance. (And existence!) Procedural map generation and spurts of luck make for endless possibilities both good and bad. The options for squad loadouts and soldier variety can be the difference between a flawless victory or crushing defeat.Wrapping UpA must play. XCOM 2 delivers a challenging experience that leaves you tugging your hair when things go South and exhaling massive sighs of relief when they go right. Despite it's buggy nature and clunky performance, solid strategic gameplay kicks it into sixth gear to overshadow it's imperfections. In a genre polishing checkers, XCOM 2 is reinventing chess.			"

												My first review so bear with me. I've put a lot of time into this game, with and without mods (highly suggest you play with cosmetic mods) This game is amazing in both a challenging standpoint (If you play on harder difficulty) and strategical. If your a fan of turn-based strategy games, this is a must have. It makes you think about the long term (If I place this guy here will they be able to flank him if so and so misses) and you will miss, those 90% shots have failed me many of times. The story ins't very immersive but what it lacks in story is makes up for in customization to each character, letting you make their own story as to why they are fighting and for who. The one thing I DO NOT like about the game, is that a lot of the missions have timers. Some timers I don't mind but to have them on as many missions as they do takes away from the strategic planning, although in increases the difficulty a lot especially newcomers to the game or genre.

												Upfront TL;DR: I recommend XCOM2 to anyone who is remotely interested in strategy/tactical rpg games and does not mind a few hiccups in optimization.It is like a sci-fi Fire Emblem without anime cutscenes and support convos (all that waifu♥♥♥♥♥♥ and adds good graphics and destructible environments. XCOM2's plot is the classic Good vs. Evil with some philosophical drops of ""we are becoming what we set out to destroy"".The real story, however, is the success and failure of XCOM agents under your command. BTW If you can't play a game without your precious waifus then download a voice pack for them and add them to your character pool. Pretty sure there are a bunch of neptunia heads and voice packs in the workshop. See, everyone's happy. Introduction:     This review is tailored for those who have not played any iteration of XCOM, so that it better informs those interested in trying the game out. Before continuing, I want to say that mods are a double edged sword in this game. They enhance play and decrease performance at the same time (subscribed to 300 atm). I cannot deny the fantastic additions graced to XCOM2 by the modding community, but I hope to review the ideas and concepts that the vanilla version succeeded/failed to accomplish on its own.Specs: i7-6700K @ 4.00GHz (4.36GHz)16 GB RAMGTX 1070 Pros: +The ability to extensively customize your soliders contributes a sense of attachment to  soldiers you are ordering around, something most games cannot emulate. +Map generation is very well designed/balanced so that the same tileset/area can offer many different avenues of play. +Configurable settings via the xcom ini can further modify play, leading to more replayability. For example, you can change the base stats of every character/item in the game if you wanted.+There is some base management, but it is not too extensive and does not feel tacked on just because ""every other game has some form of it"" (the original XCOM had this too).+Combat is interesting and offers different approaches to problems through the soldier class system, plethora of researchable gear, and destructible environments. +The emphasis on limited time (in combat and on a macro scale) to rebel against Earth's alien overlords provides a sense of urgency that many games strive for yet miss. +Your soldiers and the aliens become stronger as the game goes on, which creates a sense of each side trying its hardest to defeat the other. +Countless workshop mods offer something new and exciting to experience through multiple playthroughs.  +There is an ironman mode (Only one save state) for tryhards. Variable difficulty as well, which is good for new players. +A game that discourages facerolling over every button on your keyboard. Cons:-You have to realize this game has its optimization issues.  -Loading screens can be long, depending on your settings and how many mods you decide to download. I think the base game does not have this problem as much as a heavily modified one. -Frame rate drops slightly when discovering enemies, unloading from your transport, and initializing props to customize your soldiers with. These frame rate issues, however, can be easily ignored since they only occur at specific points in the game and do little to hinder the gameplay itself.-Do not play at max settings, even the best rigs will have trouble stabilizing at that golden 60fps.-Due to the nature of XCOM2, it being quite a long game, these problems seem to be more apparent later on when there are simply more characters in a given mission (larger squad size, more enemies, etc.). -There are not many gameplay elements that I feel XCOM2 failed to deliver on, but indeed there are many annoyances within the vanilla version that have either been patched already or allieviated by the free mods inside the workshop. Conclusion:     So if you do buy the game and see something that is offputting, check out the workshop to see if a solution has already been distributed.More than likely if you see something as a problem, someone else has too.      This concludes my review of XCOM 2. If you made it this far, then congratulations on either scrolling fast or reading.			"

												I've never been into turn based games, the format couyld never get me to invest or get excited about what was happening. Somehow, by some strange witchcraft that I blame aliens for, Xcom has changed that. Although it is currently the only exception to the rule, it is fun and exciting. I started playing and the next thing I knew it was three days later.There's a child in me who loves the idea of kitting out my squad. Chuck Norris, The Terminator, John Rambo and Snake, then sending them off to shoot aliens and save the world (again). You can't help but become invested in the charcters, and when one of them eventually dies there is a real loss, both for the character you watched go from raw recruit to seasoned alien hunter and in the game as losing a skilled character can be a serious set back.So even as the Terminator was dismantled, and Snake bleeding out, Iron Man and Lara Croft were waiting in the wings for their chance to leave their mark on the genetically enhanced faces of the Aliens.Great game, loading times can be a bit long but to be honest that's the only real complaint I have. Even if you have never played a turn based strategy game, give it a try, it will surprise you.Squad honourable mentions: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Conan the Barbarian, RoboCop, Robin Hood, Ghost Rider, Alice, James T Kirk, Neo, King Leonidus, John McClane, Bruce Lee, Achilles, Boba Fett, Bane, General Zod and Selene.Good huntin'			"

												Fighting on your heels!XCOM 2 is a master stroke in the reboot of the series that started with it's fantastic predecessor. Whereas the first game worked to recreate what made the original XCOM so beloved, the sequel set out to stand on its own, and in that it succeeds brilliantly. As the story goes, we lost the war in the first XCOM. The Aliens have taken over Earth which has become a dystopian, assimilate or be destroyed hell of oppression. You, The Commander, have been put in charge of the remnants of what used to be the world supported UFO defense force. The once global operation has become a small, unorganized resistance against the alien occupiers. The first handful of hours absolutely captures this element brilliantly. You have to choose your strikes carefully, find where you'll do the most good while slowly building your struggling resistance. The feeling you get as you begin to turn the tide in the war is unlike anything i've experienced in a game before, you can't help but cheer. Graphics: Beautifully done, action camera angles and features from the previous game return, and are made better. Sound: Also top knotch, every weapon and creature sounds unique and varied. You can also flip a switch and have your squaddies actually speak the language of the country they're from, a really nice touch that helps you become attached to your precious resistance fighters. Challenge: Tough but rewarding. You will literally spend the first half of this game on your heels, barely surviving your engagements and looking eagerly for your next supply drop. You will hit a point where you can start to breathe a bit easier, but that's when the game ratchets up the Avatar Project, and the clock starts ticking. Overall: Get this game if you enjoyed the previous one, XCOM 2 is even better. When you've played through the game and won the campaign, I HIGHLY recommend The Long War 2 mod. It's free, a total conversion and adds a TON of content to what was already a brilliant game. I do not recommend the mod until you've beaten the main campaign and understand and are comfortable with XCOM 2's pacing, because TLW2 kicks that up to 11 with a resistance management layer. Brilliant game, logged tons of hours into it, and i recommend it to all fans of the series.			"

												Amazing experience. Became one of my personal classics.I've felt like i was commander. I weeped for my fallen soldiers, I cherished with them when we've done a flawless mission. This game really makes you care about your soldiers with massive amount of customization from armor to their biography. I've seen some people who played only 40 hr-20 hr, saying this game is not an awesome game or worse; ""it's a bad game"". Let me tell something to you. This is not a game where you can spent 50 hours and decide whether it's good or not. Because you have to spend time with the customization, you have to do different things, try to look from different angles. Learning it's combat mechanics and properly using them may take some time as well. And also finishing the game and seeing it's suprises (they are really good). Doing those in my opinion takes at least 70-80 hours if you rush it if not you have a safe 120 hours of gameplay. I may rushed it a bit. 106 hours.I like playing strategy games. I thought i liked them because i could play them in a relaxed mood. But XCOM 2 proved otherwise. I was always on my toes. I felt the pressure of those soldiers and the earth's survival. And there is never a dull moment. There is always something going on around the world forcing you into an important decisions. And all decisions matter something. You feel like all your decisions combined got you where you are. Bad or Good.And there are hidden mechanics which i will not spoil them to you. Even after 100 hours you can be suprised. And realise you still haven't seen the whole game.Difficulty can be really frustrating for a people who rush their decisions and are new to the game. But once you die couple of times and you specify your mistakes or figure out how enemy react to those actions, you'll know how it works, you'll feel like you are an experienced commander. Game is challenging but yet it is immensely compelling. And after everything works as you intended and game rewards you for it, that moment you'll know how 'flawless' XCOM 2 is Commander.  FOR THE RESISTANCE! "

												I really enjoyed XCOM 1 and the XP. That being said, this game is an improvement. The only thing I did not like about this game was the amount of timed missions you must play. I don't mind a few but this has a lot of missions that are timed.That being said, I still had a lot of fun and it adds an element of necessity to a good portion of maps. Would you like to explore and pick up everything, probably. However you don't have time so you must prioritize, which leads into many different ways to complete the levels.All and all its a very good and and i recommend it completely.			"

Love it!If you enjoyed EU and EW then you will most definitely enjoy XCOM 2. The soldier customization is so in depth this time around, I wish there were more customization options available out of the gate but the mod community is part of what helps keep things fresh. I'm glad that Firaxis added mod support this time around.There's nothing like having a soldier survive 20 plus missions only to have him/her mind controlled by a sectoid and giving his squad mates no other choice but to shoot him/her down cause he or she is on the verge of killing another squad member. Then there are those moments where you set up the perfect ambush with all soldiers on overwatch and your recon set with Killzone and a superior extended clip. Then there are those moments where your squad is overwhelemed and caught off guard which lead to the most intense moments.Some of my favoirite missions are the retaliation missions, the base defense missions and assasinate/capture missions cause they truly test your skill; during some of these missions you may need to complete them with a certain amount of moves, if you fail then your soldiers end up being captured. I have yet to deal with any of my soldiers being captured so I am not sure if we can rescue them down the road but these are the missions that will put your skills to the test.Visually the game looks more appealing than the previous entries, as for frame rates, I get the drop every now and then but never too bad. load times are what I dislike the most and I've noticed that the more mods you have active then the longer it'll take for the game to load.Either way I highly recommend the game... DLC may be a bit overpriced but it is still worth it in my opinion. "

												This game has good basic gameplay that can keep you entertained for quite some time. For anyone who played XCOM enemy unknown this is the same thing with only smaller changes. The changes that has been made however are not for the better. They have for example this turn-timer (you have a certain amount of turns to finish the mission). This takes away a lot of the tactics of going in slow to make a perfect surprise attack. It forces you to run and gun a lot. They’ve also made sure that you have to hurry with the story missions as well or you’re doomed. This makes the psi-soldiers nonexistent. I made only one and never used her. I saw when I finished the game that the overall amount of psi-warriors for a playthrough is 1. ONE! The game is too short and rushed to make you feel a good change (a big difference) in gameplay from beginning to end. It’s more or less the same throughout but with more grenades and more hits towards the end. The character creation has been developed a lot. Sadly it’s only cosmetic. They’ve stuck to professions instead of letting every character be unique with their own mix of abilities and weapons. Also, why not more fun abilities? Even if you want to keep the professions they should of made more of them.I will keep this short. Do you want a solid turn based tactics game and you’ve already finished enemy unknown, then this game is for you. It’s fun. Do however not expect a better or even equal experience as enemy unknown. PS: It works on Linux!			"

												If you enjoyed Enemy Uknown/Within, you're going to like this. It's more of the same but tweaked and changed so it keeps the best while improving on weakness and trimming the fat. It also introduces new elements into the old formula to spice it up, so being experienced with EU/EW is a false sense of security. It took me 58 hours and 3 failed games to finally win on normal difficulty.Familiar enemies have progressed and improved in the wake of the alien victory, presenting new challenges. World/base management has also stepped up consideradbly- where EU/EW boiled down to ""bum rush your satellite production, win game"", here you are more engaged by active counters, lurking UFOs and a doomsday countdown that will WRECK you until you've learned from your failures (more on that in a bit)Character customization and generation is more in depth than ever, so you'll feel even more aguish when your soldiers get critted by some jack-off Muton WHICH IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T BTWSo in my personal experience, I would reccomend it. BUT SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I find the new soundtrack somewhat lacking. It's not that it's bad,  I just think it lost some of the personality that Michael McCann (guy who did the Deus Ex HR soundtrack) brought to EU/EW. Mods can and will remedy this though.- The game can be buggy. For me it's mostly been inexplicable pauses that slow the pace, but some people report some serious issues with LOS. Your mileage may vary. - If you hate time limits...I got some bad news for you. Mods will remove these if they transcend 'challenging' and wind up just ruining the game for you, though.- BEWARE THE ""ALIEN HUNTERS"" DLC. This is my only objective complaint. This DLC is nonsense that at best will put a new player against an even more uphill battle, and at worst will render your game unplayable through game crashes. Save your 10$, you've been warned. -----------------------------------------------------------DEATH TO AYY LMAOS			"

												Can I recommend this game YES, can i highly recommend it YES.I wrote a negative review last time, but after about 10+ month of waiting for a patch that fix the shooting/looking though walls bug, then it seem like after latest patch that the game now play much better.Well If read this, then you properbly already know Xcom series and how to play this turnbased strategy game.But be aware this game work in a little different way.On the big world map you now have a flying base from start-end in the game. You fly from country to country setting up radio towers to earn funds for your operation of xcom. What is pretty cool is that everytime you start a new game then everything is random so the replay value is fantastic, also the battles never play out excactly like last time, since the enemys are also random selected depending on your tech level and how far you are in the campaign.You will without a doubt encounter enemys you already know from the series, but there are also some new ones that you love or hate.  ( properbly hate since they kill your men he he )All in all you will fly arround the map all the time completing random missions that variate from capture vip, to protect resistance HQ against enemy raid..  Sometimes you also get special missions that can alter the course of the campaign. Example you get 3 missions to choose from that all effect what you get out of it different.Example do you want a scientist in reward, you want money, or maybe you want that a hidden event will not happen.Be aware the game take a little time to understand how the new features work and how you move arround on the tactical world map, but once you learn the rules of the game and so on then it is actual pretty good if not excellent.The game AI i think is pretty good and is indeed a challenge. They will assult/run away or maybe flank you.The shooting animation and detail of the graphics are excellent as well.As you know the game is all about research and getting better gear to combat the aliens, and well you are in for a long journey.. There are allot of tech, and in this new xcom game you can even put extra gadjets on your weapons so they become more powerfull or precise.. Why not give you soldiers some armour that if enemy try to thouch you set them on fire... quite handy when one of the anoying snake aliens want to cuddle with you.I recommend that your first campaign will be the most easy level, even if you are experienced.. The game is quite tough, and there it take a little time to learn how the new game work.Well what are you waiting for, BUY IT..... 10/10.			"

												Out of all of the strategy games I've played, XCOM 2 has been the most difficult and addicting. I constantly found myself cursing at the screen and and asking it ""why?!, but you will adapt quickly and soon every victory fills you with a feeling of success. As your strategic skills grow so will your army and soon find yourself overpowering the skinny assshole mutha fukas that ♥♥♥♥ed up your squad on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3rd mission!The customization of said squads is broad and soon you will become attached to different members. The timed missions are a pain but the fun is learning how to overcome them. If you’re looking for a challenge with an interactive gameplay, and progress you can enjoy then I seriously recommend XCOM 2!P.S. Play Legend you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												It is the final days of the resistance. Advent forces have discovered the location of the Avenger and have launched a full frontal assault. All XCOM operators defending the ramp have had their weapons disabled by a Codex. However, the resistance was not going down without a fight. They engaged the hostile forces with honor and dignity.Miraculously, the resistance managed to defeat Advent at the Battle for the Avenger without the loss of a single life. But there was still one more problem, the Avatar Project was nearing completion, and they had not made contact with the area where an Advent research facility was located, which would have to be destroyed in order to delay the project.Resistance Comms was constructed, supplies were received from a supply drop, and contact was made with Western Europe, the location of the research facility. But the aliens completed the Avatar Project, and the countdown to the end of humanity began. There was no more time to prepare, the Resistance had to act now.An elite squad of XCOM operatives, led by Colonel Lukas ""Junior"" Bekker, launched a covert operation with 1 objective; destroy the research facility. The squad of 6 soldiers deployed into the woods surrounding the facility, fought their way through Advent forces, and reduced the facility to rubble. Not one XCOM operative was lost that day. The destruction of the research facility dealt a major blow to the Avatar Project, which bought more time for XCOM to make contact with more regions to destroy more facilities. Will the resistance succeed in defeating the aliens? Probably not. But like they did in the Battle for the Avenger, they can hope.In XCOM 2, the real story comes from your own gameplay experiences. and everyone's will be different. "

												Lots of great changes from EW/EU.  XCOM Project is more detailed and challenging to manage, specialist class is great, soldier upgrading/equipping are managed more easily, and the storyline is compelling.The only downfall is that comat almost always feels rushed.  XCOM 2 puts a time limit on practically every mission in one way or another (either by limiting turns or looping enemy spawns until the party is extracted).  If you played EW/EU in a slow, methodical way, you're gonna have to change your style significantly.			"

												This game gets better and better.  I'm inspired to write a positive review.SummaryXCOM2 has very good to amazing graphics, an excellent story and very good character development with a deep variety of strategically complex skills that keep me coming back for hours on end to try different play styles.GraphicsThe board itself, the trees, the water, the destructible environment are beautiful.  The animations, partially due to their small scale, are almost lifelike.  Kills are awesome.StoryThe story is interesting, makes sense and lends itself well to the variety of missions available.  The only downside (if you can call it that) is having to hear Bradford say ""we're losing people left and right"".  The voice acting is very good.  Every time I hear him say that I want to ♥♥♥♥ing strangle him.  What's interesting and true is that those negative emotions contribute to my interest.  The anger, the challenge, that element is critical to how much I like this game.GameplayI imagine this is what chess with real people would feel like.  The different skill sets and character development options are what keep me returning.  I like snipers.  Developed snipers are worth the initial agony.  The agony comes from missing.  ...missing.  The horror.  ..luckily my desk is made of hardwood.  Surviving in spite of missing, surviving in spite of the relentless onslaught of missions, surviving in spite of losing your entire squad, another challenge that makes this game great.  And once you're more savvy to using your team strategically you're free to experiment.  How would I fare with a team of all concealed rangers?  All PSI Ops?This is where I am now.  Starting over again and again.  Trying different styles and building my base slower/differently.  I anticipate many more hours of this.I eagerly anticipate the next generation of XCOM. "

												Bought in Dec 2016 for Mac Pro (2014 model). Worked fine. Didnt find any performance issue people have complained about. Its a bit CPU heavy though. There were a few glitches, once a muton went outside the playable area and I couldnt kill it and had to do premature evac to continue. The objectives were partially completed but the mission showed failed status. A couple of times the keys would freeze and wouldnt jump to the next character on pressing tab or esc wouldnt work. An exit and restart solved it. Overall a very good sucessor with many WTF moments as new alien units drop on you for the first time with little warning or awareness of their weakness/strengths. You soon learn to butcher them though :) Starts a bit slow and you are always on the backfoot at first but you get OP at the end. The end mission is pretty interesting and doesnt disappoint like EU. However would have liked a chrysaild like tense mission from enemy unknown. overall 8/10			"

												I`m a long time fan of the series, have been playing them since the first entry. About Xcom 2:PROS:- fresh take on the x com's formula - Nice colorful graphics- fun and varied missions- MODS available on Steam Workshop (some of them are REALLY important, like the one that let`s you see the health bars into numbers)- Reasonably difficult, but without all the punish from some of the early games (you may think that as a CON, but I think it worked well)CONS:- some minor glitches (as it`s always been with xcoms)- field of view bugs, in overwatch commands for example (as it`s always been with xcoms)- some missions may seem unfairly difficult, but if you're familiar with Xcom, that shouldn't be a problemThere are a lot of new aditions and differences from the previous games, but those may be good or bad, depending on your opinion. For me, it all seemed like a good, solid, and fun Xcom game.			"

												I invested in the Deluxe Version of this game and it was well worth it.  New customization options and new units are available; as well as new armor, missions and a few new enemies.  There is a timer mechanic but instead of making things annoying, it keeps them moving and intense.  You can push back the timer with certain missions as well, which is nice.  The turn limited missions can get somewhat annoying in the way that it pushes you to the objective but it makes sense with the premise of this game.Upon beating the vanilla version of this game, I was left satisfied but curious.  The ending was akin to a movie ending with room for a sequel.  Easily one of my favorite games, even beating out the previous games; of which I adored.  Overall, excellent game.			"

												While I'm not generally drawn to turn-based tactical games, during the last Steam sale I noticed the price drop and upon a recommendation from a close friend I decided to drop the 30 bucks and have barely regretted it since. I've never played the first XCOM, so I couldn't make any comparisions there. First impressions: Hard. Very hard. Why is everyone dying? Why do I keep missing?But now, I'm a firm convert for XCOM 2.         This game is an absolute blast to play. Once I got the hang of the tactical combat I really began to enjoy every battle, the suspense you get after signalling and ambush and praying for the destruction of the enemy.But, there are some points I don't like. For one, the stragey aspects that come with the Avenger are pretty hard. True, it does recreate the feeling of fighting an entire alien force with limited resources and time, but all the same, it makes the game real ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when you have to turn down major (time sensitive) missions because everyone except your lowly recruits are wounded. And once you get behind the AVATAR project bar it's almost impossible to catch up again.All in all though, a good 7/10.			"

												EDIT: The latest patch is now allowing your soldiers and enemies to completely ignore walls / ceilings when firing, sighting and dropping reinforcements if you quickload mid-level.  I don't know how bugs this bad passed testing.  Based on this I'm revoking my recommendation until these issues are addressed.The game improves on the original XCOM in every way except for ridiculous line-of-sight bugs that mean I will never play on Iron Man.  I don't understand how a solved problem in the first game is such a source of glaring errors in the new engine.  I miss stuff like gene therapy letting me leap tall buildings and cloak everywhere but it's rare when every change a developer makes to the core design is such an improvement.			"

												I played the original Xcom and thought it was good, so I bought xcom2.   But, the reality is that xcom 2 is just not that much fun.   There isn't much in the way of AI.    And make up for this, the developers have handicapped the players to make it artificially hard.   But, really its just frustrating to play.   I absolutely hate having squad members die due to pre determined factors.   I can't say how much I hate that.   I think that sucks.    Firaxis has really gone off target on a bunch of their recent games.   Instead of making fun games and trying to improve the AI, they just continue to handicap the players more and more, creating a level of artificial frustration.   I just don't get it.			"

												100 hours into the game.  I know this game has a soft spot for many players but the facts are the facts.  This game isn't ready for prime time.  It's basically a polished XCOM.  The developers have not spent 5 min updating the basic mechanics of this game.  If you play this game I garauntee you will hit at least 5 bugs in a hour, every hour you play. In my first hour of play I ran into the following bugs.   1.  Enemies get high cover bonus despite being in the middle of flat open ground.2.  Unable to select promotion skills on the right side of the selection screen.3.  Grenade explodes on enemy and does no damage.4.  Invisible enemy area of affect attacks.5.  Unable to move to squares despite the game showing it's a valid option.6.  Soldier visually moved to adjacent square but is actually in the original square you put them in.And I run into these bugs repeatedly over and over.  There is absolutely no freaking way the developers sat down and played their own game and didn't see these.  I bought this on sale for $40 and I regret it.  When you run into so many bugs on basic play, you begin to dread booting the game up and this is where I'm at now.			"

												This game could have been awesome.It does not give nearly enough time to complete anything without failing critical missions. If you do focus on critical missions and skip most upgrades and research, you will be vastly outnumbered and far from powerful enough. I do not have a whole lot of turn-based strategy gaming experience, but even on the EASIEST setting (which is suggested in-game for non-experienced players), the difficulty scales way too fast with your progress and quickly becomes impossible. The tutorial gave hardly any hints and tips, leaving the player to figure everything out on their own whilst getting their butt kicked. There are also strategy-critical BUGS throughout the game that tilt to the enemies advantage (for example, enemies shooting through two walls before they are destroyed, or enemies slashing your squad members from below you). A 4-man squad is absolutely ridiculous when you have many more soldiers to spare, especially when going up against 10+ enemy units. The Dark Events are also relentless and make the enemy much too powerful. It is also frustrating that there is no way to take the time to counter all the Dark Events. In fact, you can't ""take the time"" to do much at all. The entire game rushes the player through everything, interupting progress with side missions that are far too detrimental to lose. There are also several aspects that don't make sense and uselessly inhibiting of a good game experience. Now that I've got that off my chest, here's what I find amazing about this game. The platform is easy to use. Graphics, landscape, splash art, the alien concepts, these are all beautiful and very attractive. This game has a unique blend of action and story progression, which I find very enjoyable. The aliens themselves are decently authentic and fun to discover and fight. All of this alone ALMOST makes up for the rest of my frustrating experience. Conclusion:This game was a complete joy to learn about and explore for several hours, but became a complete mess of failure and frustration rather quickly. I have a bit of regret paying $60 for this. I'm sure there is a very specific way to play this game and do quite well, but it is not obvious at all. I do not enjoy having to go research how to actually play to feel as though my purchase is worth (which I will do now) and would much rather be able to learn and explore everything myself with a successfully challenging experience. Perhaps my review will change once I do some digging.4/10			"

												I have the same problem with this game, as I had with the first one.  Once you figure out your base build order, the game becomes 100% RNG.  Nothing the player does, no strategy or tactic you can employ, has any real meaning in the game.  Fights are absolutely determined by the RNG.  This is made worse in the second installment, because you are always under the effect of a timer pushing you to hurry.  At least in the first game, you could set up a kill zone and try and pull aliens into it, or split them up.  There was at least the pretense of strategy.Sadly, the game is best played on the easiest setting, as it has the least amount of RNG destroying your party.I'll give you a perfect example.  One mob left with 3 hit points, my entire party has at least 60% to hit, my sniper has 93% to hit, EVERYONE misses....mob of course one shots one of my soldiers that's in full cover on the next round.  Uninstall.The real problem is, especially early on in the game, you don't have enough hit points, to offset lousy runs of RNG.  Given that it's *very* easy for your soldiers to be one shot, especially early on, and it's a rage inducing formula if you're playing on any of the higher difficulty levels, or ironman.At the end of the day, the worst design descision was the timer on every mission.  It strips the game of any kind of tactics, and makes every single thing you do at the mercy of the RNG.  Why this game gets so much praise I'll never understand, to me, it's shallow, and frustrating.			"

Was playing 1 above easy (Veteran) - it gets a little less frustrating with plasma and psi, but still having to reload a dozen times each level for the whole game while not making ""mistakes"" was not fun for me.

												XCOM 2 has a soft space in my heart. I've tried the first XCOM, I mean, the REAL first XCOM. As much as the die-hard fans rave like rabid dogs about how amazing it is, my simple, casual, millennial mind simply can't sit down and grasp how it works or how to put up with god awful graphics (and trust me, I've played stuff like Populous, so I've got some resistance compared to my generation.)When I first found XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, I had literally no idea what I was in for. What I found was a great ""Dress up these people and make them fight aliens"" strategy game I immediately fell in love with. Making everyone look like celebrities was my best choice, and having secret agent Ben Affleck kick doors down whilst Jeremy Renner did wierd magic stuff was just hilarious.So, I was stoked for XCOM 2. Despite my usually harsh view on the videogame industry, I even pre-ordered a couple of weeks early, I was so damn excited.On launch day, I was... satisfied?XCOM 2 is buggy, feels somewhat unfinished in some areas, with some oversights included and overall loses a couple of elements of strategic depth for more ""Pfft, that's XCOM""-ness I was growing somewhat tired of. That being said, I still adore this game. The graphical upgrade is immense, and my soldiers look sillier than ever thanks to the impressive range of mods available for this game. Even in vanilla, this game still entertains me. XCOM 2's take on top-down strategy gets me immediately feeling like a strategic genius when I manage to get a grenade thrown through a wall to tear down cover for someone else to take a shot. Despite it's bugs, flaws, and it mistakenly thinking that everyone who plays it will spend six hours on every mission like some sort of chess grandmaster, playing on a lower difficulty to get to grips with the game and just having some fun with the characters makes XCOM 2 a worthy sequel to it's predecessor, building on the lore and gameplay of the first, elevating the stakes and making you feel that much smarter when grenadier Michael Bay blaster launchers an entire house to dust.MICHAEL BAY!

												9/10( i have an i5 2400 3.2 ghz , 8 gb ram , amd radeon 7770 1 gb  )always liked the Xcom games and this one didn't disappoint me. it kind of started with a bad optimization launch and eventually they released a few patche to fix it . but giving that i have a low end pc, i wasnt really able to tell the difference as i got around 40-30 fps with some stuttering in the mission loading times .the main thing i like about this game is  :It had mods support. that alone is a great boost to any game. In addition, they also collaberated with the Long War team that created an amazing mod for Xcom enemy within and released a few great mods that gave more variation to the core game . There are like hundred of mods already in the workshop and they all make this game more enjoyable to play and repeat. When it comes to the story, i found it a nice change from the usual defend the earth from invasion and rather take back earth from them. and i can say for sure, every time i start a new playthrough, its always a different experience , as nothing is the same when it comes to the map layouts. with a +100 hours into this game and hopefully more into the future , i would totally recommend this game if you like strategy turn-based games ,  with a lot of customization options for your soldiers and many repeatable playthroughs.

												If you enjoyed Enemy Uknown/Within, you're going to like this. It's more of the same but tweaked and changed so it keeps the best while improving on weakness and trimming the fat. It also introduces new elements into the old formula to spice it up, so being experienced with EU/EW is a false sense of security. It took me 58 hours and 3 failed games to finally win on normal difficulty.Familiar enemies have progressed and improved in the wake of the alien victory, presenting new challenges. World/base management has also stepped up consideradbly- where EU/EW boiled down to ""bum rush your satellite production, win game"", here you are more engaged by active counters, lurking UFOs and a doomsday countdown that will WRECK you until you've learned from your failures (more on that in a bit)Character customization and generation is more in depth than ever, so you'll feel even more aguish when your soldiers get critted by some jack-off Muton WHICH IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T BTWSo in my personal experience, I would reccomend it. BUT SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I find the new soundtrack somewhat lacking. It's not that it's bad,  I just think it lost some of the personality that Michael McCann (guy who did the Deus Ex HR soundtrack) brought to EU/EW. Mods can and will remedy this though.- The game can be buggy. For me it's mostly been inexplicable pauses that slow the pace, but some people report some serious issues with LOS. Your mileage may vary. - If you hate time limits...I got some bad news for you. Mods will remove these if they transcend 'challenging' and wind up just ruining the game for you, though.- BEWARE THE ""ALIEN HUNTERS"" DLC. This is my only objective complaint. This DLC is nonsense that at best will put a new player against an even more uphill battle, and at worst will render your game unplayable through game crashes. Save your 10$, you've been warned. -----------------------------------------------------------DEATH TO AYY LMAOS			"

												Can I recommend this game YES, can i highly recommend it YES.I wrote a negative review last time, but after about 10+ month of waiting for a patch that fix the shooting/looking though walls bug, then it seem like after latest patch that the game now play much better.Well If read this, then you properbly already know Xcom series and how to play this turnbased strategy game.But be aware this game work in a little different way.On the big world map you now have a flying base from start-end in the game. You fly from country to country setting up radio towers to earn funds for your operation of xcom. What is pretty cool is that everytime you start a new game then everything is random so the replay value is fantastic, also the battles never play out excactly like last time, since the enemys are also random selected depending on your tech level and how far you are in the campaign.You will without a doubt encounter enemys you already know from the series, but there are also some new ones that you love or hate.  ( properbly hate since they kill your men he he )All in all you will fly arround the map all the time completing random missions that variate from capture vip, to protect resistance HQ against enemy raid..  Sometimes you also get special missions that can alter the course of the campaign. Example you get 3 missions to choose from that all effect what you get out of it different.Example do you want a scientist in reward, you want money, or maybe you want that a hidden event will not happen.Be aware the game take a little time to understand how the new features work and how you move arround on the tactical world map, but once you learn the rules of the game and so on then it is actual pretty good if not excellent.The game AI i think is pretty good and is indeed a challenge. They will assult/run away or maybe flank you.The shooting animation and detail of the graphics are excellent as well.As you know the game is all about research and getting better gear to combat the aliens, and well you are in for a long journey.. There are allot of tech, and in this new xcom game you can even put extra gadjets on your weapons so they become more powerfull or precise.. Why not give you soldiers some armour that if enemy try to thouch you set them on fire... quite handy when one of the anoying snake aliens want to cuddle with you.I recommend that your first campaign will be the most easy level, even if you are experienced.. The game is quite tough, and there it take a little time to learn how the new game work.Well what are you waiting for, BUY IT..... 10/10.			"

												It is the final days of the resistance. Advent forces have discovered the location of the Avenger and have launched a full frontal assault. All XCOM operators defending the ramp have had their weapons disabled by a Codex. However, the resistance was not going down without a fight. They engaged the hostile forces with honor and dignity.Miraculously, the resistance managed to defeat Advent at the Battle for the Avenger without the loss of a single life. But there was still one more problem, the Avatar Project was nearing completion, and they had not made contact with the area where an Advent research facility was located, which would have to be destroyed in order to delay the project.Resistance Comms was constructed, supplies were received from a supply drop, and contact was made with Western Europe, the location of the research facility. But the aliens completed the Avatar Project, and the countdown to the end of humanity began. There was no more time to prepare, the Resistance had to act now.An elite squad of XCOM operatives, led by Colonel Lukas ""Junior"" Bekker, launched a covert operation with 1 objective; destroy the research facility. The squad of 6 soldiers deployed into the woods surrounding the facility, fought their way through Advent forces, and reduced the facility to rubble. Not one XCOM operative was lost that day. The destruction of the research facility dealt a major blow to the Avatar Project, which bought more time for XCOM to make contact with more regions to destroy more facilities. Will the resistance succeed in defeating the aliens? Probably not. But like they did in the Battle for the Avenger, they can hope.In XCOM 2, the real story comes from your own gameplay experiences. and everyone's will be different. "

												Out of all of the strategy games I've played, XCOM 2 has been the most difficult and addicting. I constantly found myself cursing at the screen and and asking it ""why?!, but you will adapt quickly and soon every victory fills you with a feeling of success. As your strategic skills grow so will your army and soon find yourself overpowering the skinny assshole mutha fukas that ♥♥♥♥ed up your squad on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3rd mission!The customization of said squads is broad and soon you will become attached to different members. The timed missions are a pain but the fun is learning how to overcome them. If you’re looking for a challenge with an interactive gameplay, and progress you can enjoy then I seriously recommend XCOM 2!P.S. Play Legend you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Lots of great changes from EW/EU.  XCOM Project is more detailed and challenging to manage, specialist class is great, soldier upgrading/equipping are managed more easily, and the storyline is compelling.The only downfall is that comat almost always feels rushed.  XCOM 2 puts a time limit on practically every mission in one way or another (either by limiting turns or looping enemy spawns until the party is extracted).  If you played EW/EU in a slow, methodical way, you're gonna have to change your style significantly.			"

												This game gets better and better.  I'm inspired to write a positive review.SummaryXCOM2 has very good to amazing graphics, an excellent story and very good character development with a deep variety of strategically complex skills that keep me coming back for hours on end to try different play styles.GraphicsThe board itself, the trees, the water, the destructible environment are beautiful.  The animations, partially due to their small scale, are almost lifelike.  Kills are awesome.StoryThe story is interesting, makes sense and lends itself well to the variety of missions available.  The only downside (if you can call it that) is having to hear Bradford say ""we're losing people left and right"".  The voice acting is very good.  Every time I hear him say that I want to ♥♥♥♥ing strangle him.  What's interesting and true is that those negative emotions contribute to my interest.  The anger, the challenge, that element is critical to how much I like this game.GameplayI imagine this is what chess with real people would feel like.  The different skill sets and character development options are what keep me returning.  I like snipers.  Developed snipers are worth the initial agony.  The agony comes from missing.  ...missing.  The horror.  ..luckily my desk is made of hardwood.  Surviving in spite of missing, surviving in spite of the relentless onslaught of missions, surviving in spite of losing your entire squad, another challenge that makes this game great.  And once you're more savvy to using your team strategically you're free to experiment.  How would I fare with a team of all concealed rangers?  All PSI Ops?This is where I am now.  Starting over again and again.  Trying different styles and building my base slower/differently.  I anticipate many more hours of this.I eagerly anticipate the next generation of XCOM. "

												Bought in Dec 2016 for Mac Pro (2014 model). Worked fine. Didnt find any performance issue people have complained about. Its a bit CPU heavy though. There were a few glitches, once a muton went outside the playable area and I couldnt kill it and had to do premature evac to continue. The objectives were partially completed but the mission showed failed status. A couple of times the keys would freeze and wouldnt jump to the next character on pressing tab or esc wouldnt work. An exit and restart solved it. Overall a very good sucessor with many WTF moments as new alien units drop on you for the first time with little warning or awareness of their weakness/strengths. You soon learn to butcher them though :) Starts a bit slow and you are always on the backfoot at first but you get OP at the end. The end mission is pretty interesting and doesnt disappoint like EU. However would have liked a chrysaild like tense mission from enemy unknown. overall 8/10			"

												I`m a long time fan of the series, have been playing them since the first entry. About Xcom 2:PROS:- fresh take on the x com's formula - Nice colorful graphics- fun and varied missions- MODS available on Steam Workshop (some of them are REALLY important, like the one that let`s you see the health bars into numbers)- Reasonably difficult, but without all the punish from some of the early games (you may think that as a CON, but I think it worked well)CONS:- some minor glitches (as it`s always been with xcoms)- field of view bugs, in overwatch commands for example (as it`s always been with xcoms)- some missions may seem unfairly difficult, but if you're familiar with Xcom, that shouldn't be a problemThere are a lot of new aditions and differences from the previous games, but those may be good or bad, depending on your opinion. For me, it all seemed like a good, solid, and fun Xcom game.			"

												XCOM 2 Is very 50/50 for me. I love it, but I also hate it.Pros: - Very dedicated and talented workshop creators- Challenging and fun combat system- Good soldier customization for those like me who love just creating badass looking soldiers- Can be pretty immersive- Decent replayability to the game since workshop mods can change everything.Cons:- Mods always have a huge chance of just breaking your game, it's inevitable- Very pricey DLC for a VERY pricey game.- The story of the game is not interesting at all, don't play this game for the story. - The RNG in this game will make you cry yourself to sleep- Developer support is barely there. The only content you're getting is DLC, no patches, no bug fixes.- Noone plays the multiplayer, don't even try- The game has a crash dump and bug finder built into the game, but it really doesn't help at all- This game is just being kept alive by the workshop.Summary: Xcom 2 is a wonderful game that could be enjoyed forever. A very amazing collection of awesome workshop mods make this pretty stale and bland game into something pretty fun.If you plan on buying this game, I will give you a list of mods that I definetly reccomend checking out. The game is hard to manage with over 10 mods installed, so keep that in mind. Mods:Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered Weapon Pack  This mod features about 33 new weapons you can use in the game that all have different functions. Why buy a $5 for a few guns when you could get 33. Please note these weapons are SEPERATE in the workshop. There isnt one big pack.A Better Advent 1 & 2 These mods give you dozens of new enemies to battle against, making missions more interesting Music Modding System A mod that allows you to add custom music the game. My personal favorite is the Halo 3 Music pack. 10/10 More Maps Pack Gives you more maps of course. WHO DOESNT WANT NEW MAPS!?!? Capnbubs Accessories Pack Some really cool looking accessories for your soldiers, very well done and detailed. Additional Mission Types Self Explanatory Military Camouflage Patterns Definetly one of the Top 5 best mods on the workshop, this mod gives you what I think is 60 new military camoflage patterns for your soldiers and their weapons. More Cities Adds more cities to fight in. Yup More armor colors Self Explantory x2 Expanded Mission Names Just a mod that makes sure its unlikely to get a name of a mission repeated. Adds immersion.  Uniforms Manager Great for people like me that like to organize their soldiers in one specific uniform.  "

												First thing, the difficultly level, for me, is fine at the default. Perhaps I just suck.  ;) I love how many of the old systems from the last Xcom have been carried over but in some cases improved. Having reload of your weapon not end your turn for example.Somethings, I'm not sure about.The will loss (from taking damage?) that recovers from doing well at a future mission is annoying. Thankfully panic is much less of a mission ender. The aliens start with some pretty powerful abilities from the get go this time. One thing that I didn't like, is the early mind control. When you have a squad of 4 it's a big deal. You hardly ever resist it. It can even end your mission if your entire squad is mind controlled. The only saving grace is that the aliens won't damage mind controlled teammates, so sometimes it actually saves you. (when a surprised flanked unit gets taken for example) edit: actually, they will target mind controled units if they have nothing else to shot at.My biggest beef with the game is how the timed missions with random maps work. You will have X amount of time to do something and get to a certain point. However, because the maps are random, sometimes that point can be so hard to get to that even if you ignored the aliens and dashed right for it your cutting it close. I don't mind the rush effect sometimes, but I like to take my time and do things systematically. They need to have at least one more turn added to them across the board. Moving units to different levels is STILL a pain. I have had units run to the wrong point because it's hard to tell exactly what level your selecting your space on. A couple of pods activated through walls too.It's overall a good game. It needs to be tweaked somewhat however. Thankfully it's supposed to be super mod friendly, so we will see. I suggest to anyone who loved the last XCOM, to get this one. It is good game overall.			"

												I absolutely loved the first game, Enemy Unknown/ Enemy Within and I love this one too. Of course there's some different mechanics that can be debated but it's basically a very solid continuation from the first game, although it doesn't really add anything other than nostalgia if you've played the previous one. Gameplay: 8/10Could have been more but some minor annoyances and mechanics brought it down a bit. First, the mechanics are pretty much the same as Enemy Within. Obviously some additions like specialized unique armor and some extra soldier customization. Just about when I felt the missions started getting really repetitive and annoying the game was really close to the finale, which is almost perfect for me. Some things like stupid camera movements during solder actions and the ability to save and load whenever you want brought this score down as well as a weird bug that crashed the game whenever I made a certain action within a mission. The mechanic of losing took a while to get used to and I had to reload near the beginning, but it's nothing complicated. If you liked the mechanics of Enemy Within, you'll like this game and probably its new additions too. (WARNING RANTING AHEAD)One mechanic I really didn't like was the Kings/rulers. Although I managed to defeat them without major repurcussions, I had to cheat the system by saving and loading between actions to ensure nobody died, which nullified the feeling of victory. Basically there are 3 special super mutants of different alien species that appear randomly after a certain mission. When you fight them, they get a free action whenever any of your soldiers makes ANY action, including movement. Certain abilities that don't count as an action won't activate this (thankfully). Meaning it's pretty much impossible to kill one of these things without someone getting major damage, unless you have multiple locking techiniques like freezing or stun and you have everyone positioned to hit them without moving once spotted. Luckily, they made them easier by making them retreat at about half health despite repearing randomly later on. Story: 6/10Granted, these games were never really about the world in which it takes place in. It's solid enough to introduce new players and you don't really have to pay attention to it to enjoy the game. For people coming from Enemy Within, this is set in an alternate universe where the XCOM project didn't actually succeed. It's an interesting premise, but the core mechanics remain the same regardless. There's a bunch of background text involved with every single research you complete, but of course that's not necessary and I never read any of them. The overall storyline is also decent. Not complex and kinda cliche, but it fits the bill. I personally really liked how the characters actually talk directly to you and that you can personally participate in the last mission.Peformance: 9/10Like I mentioned before, the camera can get real weird during soldier actions like running and shooting. There's some consistent minor visual glitches, but I didnt encounter anything that affected the actual game. Overall, I can recommend this game. Although maybe not for the full price, i would definitely wait for a sale in order to get the DLCs as well.			"

												I'd like to start by one of the main-points of TotalBiscuits review: ""If you didn't like the first remake of Xcom by Firaxis, you won't like this one either"". However... if you liked that first one, you might love this one.It very obviously is a follow-up, and a tiny bit of ""more of the same"", but the devs really managed to improve quite a few things and added some new mechanics. Graphics and performanceWhile graphics might not be as essential in a strategy game, it surely doesn't hurt if the game looks nice, and this one does. The chars don't look as beautiful and detailed as, say, in W3, but the game does look really nice, and you get to see quite a lot of the details you put in when you create your characters.Performance-wise, this might need a patch or two to improve stability. It didn't crash, but there are some framerate-drops, and some laggy moments, where, at the end of a turn, there is a weird delay, or sometimes, the game ""stops"" on the ""fly to mission loading screen"". Again, no crashes.Gameplay (mostly about the changes compared to the previous game)It works pretty much like the first Xcom. Turn-based, overwatch, etc, all the stuff is still there. However, Firaxis added quite a few new abilities, some of them really helping to turn the tide in an intense encounter. I really wasn't excited about melee, seeing alien-hunters swinging swords. I thought it was pretty silly, not making sense. However, the rangers are great for stealthy approaches, their attacks can be very powerful, and with some upgrades, you can move them out of harms way once you have slain an alien. The game is set in the future, a few years after the first game, so it makes sense that you get new gear, new abilities and tech. Some of the new suits and special abilities (like items that create mirages of your guys, which will draw the enemies attention) are pretty dang cool.However, the aliens did do some research too and did get some upgrades. The thin men now have a new look and abilities, and there are some all new heavy units which will give you quite a fight (I especially hate the AT-AT-like ones...gosh, those are tough).Some people have commented that the game is a bit more balanced, as in no more unfair and pretty much impossible moves by the aliens. However, I didn't notice too much of that in the first Xcom, even though I played that a lot, too. So there is no ""god powers"" for the aliens, they also miss shots quite often, and there is some room for error. If you do mess up or are too bold, you might just survive without losing a soldier... or you will get annihilated.Some cool new abilities, like hacking (even mobs, disabling them for a while or even mind-controlling them), the drones that specialists use are cool etc. One thing I love is ""serial"", a sniper ability. If you activate it and then manage to kill an enemy with your snipe-ability, you don't lose action points. So you can eg. weaken some mobs with a grenade on one guy, and when it's your snipers turn, you can kill them one by one in just one turn.The game does feel a bit tougher than the first one, yet not to the point where it is frustrating (I heard though that the final mission is VERY VERY tough, you will probably lose a bunch of your guys). Just like in the previous game, losing one of your soldiers, especially those you might have named after a rl-person, hurts, especially if they have reached a high rank.You decide how you progress. There is a doomsday-clock-device, adding some urgency, but you have choices... pick up more supplies, research a lot of new technology, focus on doing everything to slow down that Avatar-project? Yes, you eventually have to do certain missions and you better try to expand your network, but there is quite some choice here.What people seem to dislike, and one thing I am not fond of, is the amount of timed missions, with a limited amount of turns. There were some in part 1, and that was ok,... it was a nice change of pace, was a challenge, and made sense. However, having TOO many of them is... not always fun. Sure, it can be a blast to beat those, but if you really like to approach stuff tactically, try to keep your guys safe, set up perfect ambushes etc, well those timers will make that tough.You may wanna consider download a mod from the workshop which will extend those timers.I enjoy this a LOT. Wasnt sure whether I'd like the even more futuristic setting and look and the sword-class, but it turns out that this is a carefully crafted, improved take on the first remake. If you liked that one, definitely check this one out!Pros: - Looks great- Fun new updates and tech and abilities for both you and the aliens- Said techniques and abilities allow some all new strategies- Some nice new missions and progression/choice system (world map)- Challenging- Apparently, more variety in the maps you play on and the way things are set up- High replayability (had to start over twice, once to make up for mistakes I had made and apply stuff I had learned, and the second time because of a savegame broken by a mod that was removed from the workshop, and I didn't mind restarting at all!)- SOme weaknesses of Xcom were removed- Workshop enabled, with mods on day 1- ChoicesCons:- Some performance issues (my system: i4790, 16 gb ram, GTX 960 with 4 gb, W7)- Too many timed missions, ymmv			"

												I didn't have a chance to finish XCOM Enemy Unknown, but I'm afraid I'll never get to because XCOM2 has ruined it for me. The sequel is better to it's already great predecessor in every way imaginable.What I like most about this game is that it makes you really care about your team of resistance fighters though the skill specializations and cosmetic customizations of your individual characters. Plus the turn-based combat and meta-game strategy are all top-notch. This is one of my favorite games ever.			"

												This is an interesting game.And I do like that you have more choices in team members.so you can make the team you like.The story and gameplay is okay. Nothing to write big amounts of praise over but not bad.However I have got to say the game is glitchy. I have had crashes a few to many times witout running mods.And I have a good PC so that is not the problem I should be able to run all on max witout a problem.as for gameplay.The game has some what were for me anoying things.squad members that are wounded stay that way for way to long.and believe me they will get wounded a lot. longest wait time over 30 days shortest I have seen 6 days.that is game days BTW those can go by pretty fast.But usaly not before the next curcial mission.An other thing that annoyed me was when you are moving the character will continue its movement.Even after spoting an enemie alien. right into it's field of few. bye bye atvantage.Also for some reason after the first shot all aliens will move even if it's still your turn.for me that was also a minus when setting my squad ready your only real option is to put them all into overwatch.But it does not give you controle on who they will shoot.Does that mean the game is bad.No, The game itself can be pretty fun. but also a whole lot fustrating.Well these are my toughts on the game.hope it helps you dicidde.

												I got this game in the recent steam weekend sale for £19.99 and can honestly I would have been happy paying full price for it.First of all I am not a guy who plays a lot of strategy games however the notion of fighting back against alien occupiers appealed to be greatly. When I finally jumped in I was met with a great story and amazing gameplay mechanics which keeps me coming back. The game can be brutal, but I feel this adds to the sense of achievement you feel once you do actually complete a mission (with at least one person alive ha!).I would say to anyone who is in the same boat as me to give it a try, at least when it comes back on sale again. You owe it to yourself. "

												All the claims of turn based strategy go out the window when 2/3 of your missions are auto fails in 6 turns or less.  If you dont risk sprinting across the map you'll fail, of course if you pull a group of aliens you also fail as your time runs out before you can deal with them and reach the objective. The percentage chances of shots are meaningless because no matter  how high a chance you have to hit its still 50/50. I missed 17 85% chance to hit shots IN A ROW.  Also poor camera angles when your troops act out your orders. Great view of the inside wall while my soldiers take their overwatch shots. This game feels rushed even though its been out for quite sometime as I write this review. Camera issues and graphic stutters really ruin the immersion.			"

												The game crashed while trying to play the tutorial, so I dont recommend this game...After a while of playing I can say this game makes me sad. I LOVED the original Xcom and after years of technological advances and a huge increase in computer capibilities, they manageed to make a game with less features and options than a game made in the 90's. Its as if the designers had a picture (""picture"" as in a single literal picture) of a tactical combat game then built the game backwards. Then its as if after a couple years of development someone told the designers, ""Hey there is this old game called Xcom made in 1994. You guys should make your game like that one.""** Edit #1 ** Crashed again while loading a save. Even after the game ""shutdown"", Steam still thought it was running. The game had a file running in the background and Steam wouldnt budge  until I manually closed that program the game still had running (it was crash dump something exe).			"

												TLDR Version: Buy ItI have limited time to game, so when I clock over 100 hours in one game, partway through a year, that is a very good sign.Base game is very good, loved the DLC's additions, and the modding community has already churned out a ton of awesome gameplay/cosmetic things. In particular, the Long War team is back, and making free content of very high caliber.If you've ever enjoyed turn based tactical type gaming, you'll like this. I had honestly forgotten how much I enjoy these types of games, and XCOM 2 has reminded me.			"

												Why have I not written a review for this game yet? Eh. Here goes my usual wording of 'OMG GLORIOUS GAME'.So! XCOM 2 makes the assumption you f*cked up XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the world is now under the rule of the 'ADVENT Coalition' who are a puppet of the ethereal from Enemy Unknown. The game kicks off with as it usually does: A tutorial where people die! (At least it's none of your precious soldiers you've made!) But anyways!Once that’s done this is where you begin to create your own soldiers! (*Squeal of delight! *) Or be boring and do the game with the pre-generated soldiers. But if you bother to turn your best friends and yourself into operators you will get SO much more attached to them as you go through the campaign! Just imagine your best friend being under fire from several aliens while you: The glorious sniper of the crew has only one shot to save him! It's up to you to take that risk of 55% to kill one of the units trying to flank him to end his life.Now the missions in this can be a little repetitive (Shoot aliens, Grab item, evac and such forth) But the environments you fight in will feel oddly different when you do (Random map generation is glorious :D) And doing the monthly Op's can add a decent bit of variety. However, this game REALLY puts you under pressure with the turn limits, which I personally think is complete BS compared to the last game. I've had many scenarios where I've just wanted to wait the enemy out and sneak to the objective but NOPE! Three turns left on the clock so I gotta grenade and run my ranger up to the objective!And that brings me to something else: Classes! There are 5 types of specialisations/classes/operators and they are as follows:Ranger.Grenadier.Specialist.Sharpshooter.Psi Operative(6 if you include the SPARK from Shen's last gift DLC)Each of these operators was in XCOM: Enemy Unknown but under a different name and now they have received a major overhaul in skills, balances and abilities. (The ranger has a ♥♥♥♥ing sword! I'm not complaining!) The Psi operative is no longer a special person with 'The gift' it's now a trained-from-rookie unit, I don't like this myself but the masses of new abilities is awesome!I'd spoil the story and go into more detail but I have one last thing to say before I conclude this the graphics in this game... Beautiful... I honestly love the look of this game.But anyways: Get this game if you loved XCOM: Enemy Unknown and yes! I did diverge from some points but anyways! So, what are you waiting for? "

												Can't currently recommend, though bet on becoming great.Disregarding the technical problems, which haven't been too bad for me really, the gameplay itself has too many BS elements in it. Some say it's too easy, others too hard. I say that the difficulty level is too damn erratic and nonsensical. Add to that many things that the game doesn't tell you that should have been explained either in the basic tutorial or in the mission briefing. I've played all the XCOM games that ever came out on the PC, and yes XCOM should be hard. But this is more simply erratic than difficult.So no, at least not yet.			"

												4 Turns Left to Evac     My sniper is badly wounded, my Drone Rigger is keeping pace, two rookies are holding their own, and we have a scientist in tow that was busted out of an ADVENT prison cell. The problem is there isn't enough time to get to the evac. A sectoid and trooper are in the room with us. We have to make a decision. We blow up the wall nearest the evac. The civilians run.3 Turns Left to Evac     We barely survived the onslaught, we are legging it into the opening, we can taste freedom, but it's still too far. The sectoid chases, the advent chases, the scientist runs, everyone is running.2 Turns Left to Evac     We're almost there, the evac zone is in sight. A line of park benches provide cover for us to run. We've made it. We've made it. We just need to get to the LZ and we'll have survived. The scientist runs, everyone runs... the Sectoid mindspins.1 Turn to Evac     The Scientist makes it to the evac, the rookies make it barely alive, but still hanging on. The sniper limps there, barely avoiding a plasma round in the back of his skill. The rigger sits there. He is filled with fear, the invader in his mind. We leave him behind. The Skyranger runs.			"

(You only have so many turns to complete some missions before you are forced to evacuate). The mission timer for me I greatly enjoyed as it forced you to think on the spot and change your tatics far more often.Unlike EU/EW where move to cover and then place your soldiers on overwatch was all that you needed to win a game			"

												This game is full of game breaking bugs, wait until it gets patched before you bugs it. :(- EDIT -Ok so the bugs or at least almost all of them can be worked auround by saving the game at the point it is broken and immediately reload that game. It isn't pretty since the loading times are not exactly short but it kinda works. All that remains now are the usual glitches like aliens spotting and shooting you through walls and floors, game freezes because of stuff like units taking damage from falling damage and ending up in some kind of furniture, etc. etc.I believe there's an entire redit XCOM 2 Megathread where all the bugs are listet but those are the ones that will be encountered the most.Other than that it's actually a nice game. Not as good or fun as the original, mind you, but still nice.But, if you are not a fan of the new series, I'd suggest you wait for the next steam sale until You can pick it up at a cheaper price.- EDIT 2 -So why am I still not giving it a thumbs up? Easy, it's not worth 49 bucks. Right now it's worth  maybe 40, 35 would actually be a fair price. But not 49 that's just plain too expensive.			"

Firaxis seems to have spend most of their time improving what already worked rather than reinvent the wheel, and that is a great thing.More options, more strategy, more enemies... simply more XCOM.

												There are very few games I've come back to seeking that vicious cycle of: glory, hubris, pain, regret, dread, and glory again and again. I don't see myself as a masochist, but since XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I've found myself hungering for games that remind I'm not that I'm king of the world, but still make me feel like it whenever I conquer it's mounting challenges. Even after Enemy Unknown's initial launch in 2012, I found myself playing it again and again even after beating it the first time, not to mention with the equally exciting Enemy Within expansion in 2013. I didn't think another game would give me that same sense of accomplishment and make me fight to attain it, but I was wrong.In 2016, XCOM 2 reminds me again and again why I love this franchise.XCOM 2 is not XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Sure, it cover-based shooting and powerful alien weaponry mixed with dice rolls and failed 96% shots, but this game more than Enemy Unknown keeps you constantly wishing you were everywhere at once. XCOM 2 doesn't run you through every single system like EU, and some systems won't be as apparent the first time around, but failure and learning are one and the same here. I died a little when I realized the plate armor upgrade carried over to my entire personnel after several hours of playing and several more casualties had already transpired. But I realized how deftly X2 ripped off the training wheels when I couldn't simply sell off my wares to the Gray Market right before a crucially timed mission across the continent. That being said, some additions to the game make combating the alien-infested earth a much more attainable task. I was unsure of how much the concealment mechanic would change my playstyle, or if I would take advantage of it at all. But there is almost nothing more satisfying than setting up an overwatch ambush and seeing the aliens drop from your well placed death-nest of sniper shots and cannon fire.I can ramble on and on about this game, and once I have finished the game I'll be able to confirm if my mad ravings are more than just a fanatical sales-pitch or rose-tinted ad libs. Until then, it's good to be back. I for one will be playing this game for a very long time, and enjoying the regretful deaths and mistakes every step of the way.			"

												4 Turns Left to Evac     My sniper is badly wounded, my Drone Rigger is keeping pace, two rookies are holding their own, and we have a scientist in tow that was busted out of an ADVENT prison cell. The problem is there isn't enough time to get to the evac. A sectoid and trooper are in the room with us. We have to make a decision. We blow up the wall nearest the evac. The civilians run.3 Turns Left to Evac     We barely survived the onslaught, we are legging it into the opening, we can taste freedom, but it's still too far. The sectoid chases, the advent chases, the scientist runs, everyone is running.2 Turns Left to Evac     We're almost there, the evac zone is in sight. A line of park benches provide cover for us to run. We've made it. We've made it. We just need to get to the LZ and we'll have survived. The scientist runs, everyone runs... the Sectoid mindspins.1 Turn to Evac     The Scientist makes it to the evac, the rookies make it barely alive, but still hanging on. The sniper limps there, barely avoiding a plasma round in the back of his skill. The rigger sits there. He is filled with fear, the invader in his mind. We leave him behind. The Skyranger runs.			"

												As a big fan of the original (THE REAL ONE) I find the AI to be broken and quite poor....In order to ""feel more dificult"" the AI cheats ..for instance concealment in certain missions(in which it isn't supposed to know you're there) homing directly on your squad  , this ""feature"" completely destroyed the immersion for me...  Thumbs down...			"

												Recently finished the game on Commander.I like it a lot and see it overall as a big improvement.Short summary:-Big Step up from Enemy Unknown in difficulty, a lot of people are going to have trouble with it because Enemy Unknown was a cake walk in comparison. It's not as hard as the Long War mod for the original, but its definately up there, just less mindless grinding than long war had is the greatest difference.-Poor preformance issues all round, I turned down the big killer AA, but otherwise had everything else on high. I have a medium-high end rig, nothing amazing. I had around 40 fps constant, but sometimes it dipped pretty far. Annoying, but will probably be patched. Some people can't play at all which obviously needs to be fixed. The min specs are way below what they should have been given though.-Much more action packed and tactical than Enemy Unknown, people hate the timers, theres a mod that removes it or gives you four more rounds. Personally I didn't have a problem with it, made me seriously tactically consider things far more than the orginal. I lost three people to timers, holding the line while my squad escaped. Love it. Some people will hate it becuase they want to go 100+ rounds spamming overwatch, doesnt work anymore I'm afraid.-There are bugs, most definately. And then there are ""bugs"". The glass window two tiles over from your evac zone breaks due to ambient destruction and your evac point gets moved accross the map causing you to lose the mission. Thats a bug. The Vipers pulling you through walls but they can logically 'target' you and you them is not a bug people, get over it, you positioned poorly. Knocked out units been uncarriable so you lose them in evac is another big bug, happens fairly rarely though in my experience.Overall I think its a huge leap forward and I really enjoyed it. A few patches for performance and bug fixing and it will be extremely solid. They could 'perhaps' tweak the difficulty on lower settings but I found Commander competitive and hope Legendary will be even more fun.I'd give it a 8.5/10, 9/10 with a few performance patches.			"

												Short review ITS AWESOMEReal review WHAT IS X-COME 2 ?X-com 2 is a stratagy game that has 2 layers (and a bit now). 1 layer is the levels / battles where you control a squad of your troops too ambush and defeat alain troops and compleat objectives all in a turn based stratagy setting. The other witch is your base / antfarm where you perform research, staff parts of your base, train/ upgrade and equped your troops, upgrade your wepons and armour and finally manage resources like space suplies and energy. The bit is the map where you chose where to travel what leads to follow missions to undertake and so mutch more. Something else to add is the custimisation for troops i could spend all day makeing up there storey lines tweaking how the look and it really brings the universe to life.COMPARED TO 1X-com 2 is a step forward for the series. Now dont get me wrong with about 140 hours between console and the pc vertion of x-com 1 i really loved it but it had a few things that became anoying. X-com 2 fixed all that for me. Also if you don't have x-com 1 i really advise getting it whenever its on sail as i doubt you regret it. After 1 playthrough of x-com 1 you pretty much know what you need to do to win and ever campaign plays out the same. In e-xom 2 i am constantly altering my plans and reacting and improveing on them the 3 campaings i am in the middle of are all very different. you never need to change your stratagy or plan (Ant farm part of the game). In x-com 2 there is no go to stratagy and you have alot more intarations with the staff really makeing your base feel even more alive that it was before.On the blue map of the world in e-com 1 you just sat there in scanned and waited now in x-com 2 there is even stratagy to be had here .... do i want to go follow that info i got on some reasources over here in canada or do i want to add the rebels in this area to my resistance. Do i stop the alians unlocking this or that ?Troop development in excom 1 had a right way to do it and a wrong way..... for example squad sight on a sniper and snipers in genrall where so op compared to other classes and could even finish the games finale boss for you on there own in 1 turn before the alians could even think of hitting you back. In X-com 2 there is no go to skills and each trooper can be leveld differntly and still be good / competative and all classes have there place.There was a large pool of maps in x-com 1 but you quickly start to see the same ones over and over again (think i must have seen that small one with the fast food joing about 400 times) in x-com 2 its allmost imposable to get the same map 2 times it is genarated and put together by parts like a jigsaw every time you play a leveljust one last time i want to say x-com 1 was an awesome game it just had the few things above that stoped it being a masterpeice in my opinion...... x-com 2 IS a masterpeice.ok enough of compareing it to x-com 1  PERFORMANCEThe game is very well optimised with good frames at least in my experiance on both my pc rig and my laptop ... not quite perfect but quite good. ROUND UPI love this game. I love how the cannon is we failed x-com 1 the storeys between games makes so mutch more sence than the standard and they lived hap..... oh wait the bad guys are back. You can really get attached to the characters like central or shen and the troops you design yourself. When you lose your favorite guy it can be devastateing and i have been known to spen quite some time mourning them and writeing there epitaph at the momorial.x-com 1 8/10x-com 2 10/10If your interested in my gameplay here is a link to the lets play i have going on atm. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL936OgHe6TZoyw4tILPsEHJuLfBwD_xZBThanks for reading and hope i helped you :)			"

												As a huge fan of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, my expectations for the sequel were astronomical.They did not disappoint. Its the classic sequal route, more but better.The game is about as hard as playing chess against a six-armed bear with the brain of Bobby Fischer while balancing a plate of hollow eggs on your head at gunpoint.The workshop is shaping up to be pretty great, and will keep me coming back for more.Even all the things the aspect that everyone is up in arms about, the unceasing timers and turn limits, are pretty good design. They force you out of your comfort zone and make you think about everything you do, making you experiment with new strategies.The one downside is the abhorrent optimization. Like, its really terrible. 25 fps while im on the avenger? On a PC exclusive game? What? Luckily with a few tweaks you can have it up and running at an enjoyable framerate, and its not like the game is reflex based so its not really that big of an issue to begin with.UPDATE: Wow, my save games got corrupted out of nowhere, so I guess thats a restart for me. Seriously, how did this game launch in this state?!2nd UPDATE: Incredible. I cant run the final mission. Crash to desktop everytime. Unbelievable. I know I already said it, but how does a game launch like this? This is unfathomable. Crash every time, and I cant seem to fix it. Firaxis, we need a patch. Now.3rd Update: Most of the bugs are now ironed out, the workshop is flourishing, and while the DLC is a bit weak, its a fun game nontheless. Lots of replay value, similar to Enemy Unknown. Thumbs up from me!			"

My only real issue is with the excessively long loading times, that appears to be a problem even for others who are using SSDs.			"

Posted: February 11, 2016
												I am longwar fans (600+ h ),  I've been played this game for 20+ h. And sorry for my bad english.Suggestion: Do not start with Legendary + ironman, it's a new game, and they change the gameplay style in every aspect (tactic strategy, research tree, and research-gear relation, etc)So far I am pretty satisfied with all those IMPROVEMENTs. The reseaon I call it IMPROVEMENT rather than change are the following:1. Strategy: which is the most complaints about. However, to me, is not. Someone complain, there is always a timer for most of the games (maybe 7 out of 10). If you play longwar or vanilla, you spend a lot of time on searching the enemy, which is pretty boring. This may be is why they put a timer and decrease the map size, meanwhile increase the complexity. In this way, you just focus on ""what the hell, How could I get out of here safely?"" when you've done this, together with some LOOT, you will gain a lot of fun and sastisfactory. Every mission last for 20-30mins average. Some mission will last for 1 h. The game strategy rely more on your understanding of the following: a) Enviroment, not just cover and destroy cover, sometimes, a Perfects gernade will change everything (4+4 damage is possible!), especially in the start. there are many examples for you to discover. b) your understanding of the class builds, and every item(all of them are pretty useful), and each of the class plays its role in the gameplay. (compare with vanilla within, super hero-""sniper"") c)Playstyle is various, Overwatch is not always the best way to kill the enemy, so does ranger. you will always have more and better choices, there is not a unique pattern to follow. And this is also why I suggest not choose ironman at first, you can discover many strategies. 2. DifficultyPersonally, I suggest longwar verterans starts with commander, famillar with  and gain some knowledge about the game(especially the research tree and mission choise). Because xcom 2 wiki is now under development, it's almost impossible to beat the legendary ironman. The Auto Save and Load design is pretty good, especially for those who rely on S/Ls. I mean, you never focus on when should I save? (S/L gurantee hits is a bad habit, xcom 2 will help you get rid of this) Find the diff level most suitable for you which also means minimize the S/L times. Be preparing for the final xcom experience ironman. (when xcom 2 wiki is complete, I will start Leg+ ironman)What do you think about Legendary Diff? I think it is suitable, but it's not for the beginners, seriously. If you are interested in that diff, you can search youtube, like Mr. Odd's(recommended), or some twitch channals. 3. Research + ""New Foundry""-Proving Ground + Loot/Gear System.The new gear systems is pretty fun. the relation between those 3 is very neat. (I am pretty sure they gain the idea from LONGWAR). But I should say, there are still more space to improve.  Just enjoy it. 4. Missions: Becareful about the choices, especially in Commander and Legendary Difficult.It's not just as easy as ""rush satallites"" in within. Someone complains about the design, think, I've been already super frustrated about the tactic strategy, can you give me some ""non-frustration"" time? Maybe this is a point for those modder and developer to think about. Currently the game design is: ""You will not have anytime to take a deep breath, aleins have already take control the world."" You must stop this, although it is ""IMPOSSIBLE"".5. Bugs: A Lot of bugs...crushes is pretty common. Some bugs are funny, like, sometimes the enemy are ""stunned"", you name it...So may be it's not  the time to start the ""Ultimate Xcom Experience: Ironman"" LAST, I believe after some patches and mods, this game will become a ""must buy"".   Besides, there will be a LONGWAR mod to make it Legendary.  "

												Hit a bug where enemies will stare at you in pity instead of fight you for a few missions.Though I was doing pretty bad, only playing on baby (normal) difficulty. They probably felt sorry for all the save scumming I had to do to complete some prior missions. Or scumming and choosing a different, hopefully easier, RNG'd mission altogether.It aint a bad game. It runs well for me, loading times are good. Just feels a little too spiteful. Hard/full cover seems to mean about the same as soft/low cover. Same with elevation. And the to hit % is a lie i think. Tries to give you a little hope or something. It feels like a 98% chance to hit is the same as an 11%. I just take every shot now. No matter how many yards/walls/squaddies and floors I have to shoot through.I used to think I liked challenging games. Where you could find ways to nudge the odds in your favor. And see it was making a noticable impact. I like Darksouls. Darkest Dungeon. PVP games. XCOM EU/EW. But XCOM2 is kinda seeming to be too challenging. Or not rewarding enough. Or too stressful. Too much out of my control. Beating a tough mission isnt that great of a feeling usually. Always end up with wounded units that are out of action for weeks on end missing out on missions and not advancing. Throwing new recruits in instead who get chewed up or wounded and put in the infirmary too. And dont forget that doomsday clock is really ticking up, and we are out of power, and we havent got enough engineers, and the missions are jumping up in difficulty rapidly. Just throw more rookies and corporals at them! Until you run out of supplies cause you were dumb and didnt counter the recruitment dark event and countered the doomsday clock ticking up instead. Dumb♥♥♥♥♥Just not what I hoped it would be. And that Punished Bradford is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Guess ill try ultra babymode (rookie) and see if my appreciation for this game improves.			"

												I've barely scratched the surface of the game, but I've gotten to the meat of it and here is what I think:XCOM 2 is a great sequel to it's predecessor.If you are expecting more of the same gameplay with new features, mechanics, ideas, and continuation of the story -- you will find it. Firaxis seems to have spend most of their time improving what already worked rather than reinvent the wheel, and that is a great thing.More options, more strategy, more enemies... simply more XCOM.

												So , the only way to get all the sounds to work with headphones is to disable 5.1 surround and set it to stereo everytime I use my headset. Game stutters every now and again. And worst of all most missions are timed missions, to the point where all you have time to do is bum rush the map in the 8 turns they give you...some times you get lucky and get 12 turns. So forget planning and thinking just run blindly forward before you run out of time. Every so often there is a mission that has no timer and it is delightful to play. Could be good. But then again first impressions are everything.			"

												This game is full of game breaking bugs, wait until it gets patched before you bugs it. :(- EDIT -Ok so the bugs or at least almost all of them can be worked auround by saving the game at the point it is broken and immediately reload that game. It isn't pretty since the loading times are not exactly short but it kinda works. All that remains now are the usual glitches like aliens spotting and shooting you through walls and floors, game freezes because of stuff like units taking damage from falling damage and ending up in some kind of furniture, etc. etc.I believe there's an entire redit XCOM 2 Megathread where all the bugs are listet but those are the ones that will be encountered the most.Other than that it's actually a nice game. Not as good or fun as the original, mind you, but still nice.But, if you are not a fan of the new series, I'd suggest you wait for the next steam sale until You can pick it up at a cheaper price.- EDIT 2 -So why am I still not giving it a thumbs up? Easy, it's not worth 49 bucks. Right now it's worth  maybe 40, 35 would actually be a fair price. But not 49 that's just plain too expensive.			"

The game would be great if not for the performance issues, I would wait until a patch is released before purchasing, as it stands now I paid full price for a game that I can't even play.			"

												I've got an hour in, and don't get me wrong, the game itself looks pretty good (though I'm not liking the sound of the time limit everyone's mentioning), but this game was not properly optimized or tested at all. I'm running a GTX980 and am still having slight framerate issues on the higher graphics settings. Combine that with the fact that on my first official mission (the first guerrilla one) the game locked me into the equipment selection screen and wouldn't let me back out to start the mission? I can't recommend this game in its current state. It's completely unforgiveable to release a game with this level of bugs and optimization issues on day one.			"

												All the claims of turn based strategy go out the window when 2/3 of your missions are auto fails in 6 turns or less.  If you dont risk sprinting across the map you'll fail, of course if you pull a group of aliens you also fail as your time runs out before you can deal with them and reach the objective. The percentage chances of shots are meaningless because no matter  how high a chance you have to hit its still 50/50. I missed 17 85% chance to hit shots IN A ROW.  Also poor camera angles when your troops act out your orders. Great view of the inside wall while my soldiers take their overwatch shots. This game feels rushed even though its been out for quite sometime as I write this review. Camera issues and graphic stutters really ruin the immersion.			"

												This is a Review of the game after my first play through.I liked the game but feel like its another rush job from FIRAXIS/Y2K. Don't buy untill this game is optimised and finished. At the moment it feels like Early Access Beta.Tactical game in XCOM 2 is excellent, the strategic layer/story is a bit of a let down. A lot of Base management doesn’t make sense. (Why are scientists essentially useless and engineers do all science jobs?)Overall game feels a bit rushed and unfinished. This is a shame because there is an excellent tactical game in here.All the budget was spent on fancy hats for your troops..Pros+Fun and addictive tactical missions+Environmental destructibility (open the door or just blow up the wall/ceiling)+Random Maps+Lots of tactical options in missionsCons-Game wastes a lot of your time with pointless unskippable transition animations-Terrible use of the Unreal engine. I have no idea how they have managed to make this game run so horribly. It feels like it's barely holding holding together.-No support/patches/acknowledgement from the developer for the game's technical issues-Story is serviceable at best, with a cliffhanger ending because of course it will not have a satisfying ending (must set up DLC/xcom 3)-Final battle is just lame-Seems to be always-online (that is probably the cause of some of its performance issues)-At the end of the campaign it doesn't even show proper stats (world stats are missing)-No way to turn off annoying unskippable animations (eg hacking)-Camera controls are terrible, no options to customise anything. game takes control of the camera even if you don’t want it too-Unskippable in mission dialog (unable to perform actions)-DLC feels like ideas that  were cut from the game-No mission variety-No way of choosing your own actions/missions (have to wait for them to pop up)-No free mode (can’t turn off story mode)			"

												Good game, but (very) disappointing.The fact that it was potspone for a few months made me believe it was for an actual good reason, to release it into a somewhat ""perfect"" state. I heard ""Let's not make the same mistake of failing the release, like so many else"".Obviously, I misheard.The game itself.The ""2"", for me, stands up for ""more"".And for customisation, that's true. It is a huge step up in looks, weapons, tools, passive traits, and unique skills. Somewhat perfect. (Well, almost, when the gloomy character you made in the pool will show with an idiotic smile instead, you may feel a bit let down,  their attitude is randomized, immersion lost).And, that's it.Everything else seems ""more less"" (DLCs pattern).The worldmap.Oh man, I was so kicked by it on the teasers.. By the looks of it, It may be like Aftershock, maybe even more, like the one in Afterlight..Well, it is not.It is an empty land with pop-ups. Where you are urged to slow the ""Avatar Project"" by Captain Obvious every 2 minutes, actually by wasting this so precious time, moving and locking your camera and controls away for the time he repeats the same phrase over and over again. (In order to show you a spot where you can only interact with on the very last mission).I understood the stakes here the very first time Bradford, please believe me.Of course this so had to happen while in missions too.Can feel like Internet without ad-blockers. Old days.The resistance.After contacting them, well, they will write you a check after the end of each month. That's about it.And they get passively slaughtered on retaliation missions ('cause aliens don't like them for writing you checks), as Bradford will unavoidably never fail to mention.A resistance that doesn't actually resists. Strange concept. (To be fair, they may not carry wepons, but they will manage to take down some UFO's for you, to remind you the name of the original title).The Base.You build what you can, when you can. Thats's about it, with a bit of management. Feels better than the last one, can't compare to the originals (was more like mini-SimCity). Still, rather good I might say.Discussions between staff can be muted, if not, they don't freeze your screen when talking (wich is something someone could have learnt from his comrades).Research.It is deeply simplified, for the second time (so long old-timers) : Research Tier 2 weapons & armor, research Tier 3 weapons & armor. Autopsies unlock new tools, and they made the option to instantly research those after some ""breakthrough"" on the next Tier.So, do you want to research x for 3 days, y for 4, then next Tier for 10 ? Or next Tier for 10 and instant x & y ? Tough choice.Let me break your expectations, there are bullets, laser, plasma. Yes, those are the same (more straightforward). And no, there's no MEC.If you haven't played the precedent game, won't be a problem though.Overall progression.Fine by your troops, slow and steady, each skill, every bit of scrap seem to matter. Very well done.The way ennemies are introduced every two missions is not. It soon feels like a freak show, and utterly destroys the low profile Aliens are supposed to have (Sure Bradford, they don't have to hide, but frightening the population doesn't seem great either). More coherence would have been nice, like maybe only Advents troops in cities, other species represented in the ""wild"", or in Resistance lands, maybe common/rare types, etc.Some are underused and replaced, other overused. ""Codex"" is a perfect example, so great ennemy, brillant design, until it becomes absolutely common in every mission, therefore losing all of its aura.The combat.The system still works, stealth mecanic is also a fine addition.But it lacks coherence. Why the ennemy would blow up his precious installation without him knowing we're here ? Why is all squad revealed when only one member is detected ?Just to justify the turn-limit and the one scout class, who will be better at never actually fighting. Not enough for me. It limits the way you play more than it opens it, not so good for tactics.The turn-limit system and very small maps resume gameplay to :1) Take a direct shot at 30%.2) Make a flanking move (with a 70% to trigger new ennemies).3) Blow up cover with explosives and shot after.Answer is 3) until you have to make 2) due to the turn limit, wich is now a bad move. I think the precedent system of ennemy triggering and their free move & turn should have been arranged to better fit this new layout.Normal difficulty is more permissive strategically wise, higher ones and the fact that the game is currently crippled with bugs will only lead to an irritating experience.Last but not least, in its current state, all of this will be darkened by the fact that you will be detected for no reason, sometimes even shot at the very same moment, melee & shot through walls, moving on another tile than the one you clicked, performance issues, etc.Replay value is kinda limited in a way, you will have researched everything when you beat the game the first time, ""screen locking"" will still be there and it doesn't grow more pleasant, no second wave options (not even unlocking customisation at beginning), and Ironman seems avoidable with gameplay bugs.Oh, and a special mention to the ""Final Mission"" and its idiotic moment.. Worst concept ever, and Hack'n Shoot'n Slash parody. ""Or when Aliens do recall they could summon infinite troops instantly"". Brillant.What should have been the most epic moment of the game chose to be the most depressing last note ever. I think underwhelming good reviews state what the game will/might be, and in this case I might agree with them, but certainly not what it currently is.I'm pretty sure it will be a better game than its predecessor, but releasing in this state can't be supported as it is literally asking for this kind of pratice.(As for an example, not much, but clearly shows a lot, in french, some voices have the same number, and the country of origin is repeated again at the end of each biography. Meaning, not even a single person took a single look at it before launching the game.)If you haven't already bought the game, spare yourself the disappointment now and buy it when the actual release comes out, wich is programmed for the second half of 2016.+Another XCOM+We can play before release !-Shouldn't have been released yet.-Way too oftenly Bradforded			"

												So , the only way to get all the sounds to work with headphones is to disable 5.1 surround and set it to stereo everytime I use my headset. Game stutters every now and again. And worst of all most missions are timed missions, to the point where all you have time to do is bum rush the map in the 8 turns they give you...some times you get lucky and get 12 turns. So forget planning and thinking just run blindly forward before you run out of time. Every so often there is a mission that has no timer and it is delightful to play. Could be good. But then again first impressions are everything.			"

In particular, the Long War team is back, and making free content of very high caliber.If you've ever enjoyed turn based tactical type gaming, you'll like this. I had honestly forgotten how much I enjoy these types of games, and XCOM 2 has reminded me.			"

												The game crashed while trying to play the tutorial, so I dont recommend this game...After a while of playing I can say this game makes me sad. I LOVED the original Xcom and after years of technological advances and a huge increase in computer capibilities, they manageed to make a game with less features and options than a game made in the 90's. Its as if the designers had a picture (""picture"" as in a single literal picture) of a tactical combat game then built the game backwards. Then its as if after a couple years of development someone told the designers, ""Hey there is this old game called Xcom made in 1994. You guys should make your game like that one.""** Edit #1 ** Crashed again while loading a save. Even after the game ""shutdown"", Steam still thought it was running. The game had a file running in the background and Steam wouldnt budge  until I manually closed that program the game still had running (it was crash dump something exe).			"

												First and foremost let me say I've always been an Xcom fan.  I've played since the 90's.  I'm not bad at the game either and I love the difficulty.  Losing troops, failing missions, and the tension that permadeath brings is fantastic.  The previous Xcom game was amazing.  This game has some poorly executed gameplay ideas and extremely frustrating bugs.  I've got about 40 hours into this game and maybe 15 of it are replaying game sections because I got screwed over by a bug.  Line of sight in this game is busted.  You will get shot through solid walls, floors, and even the map itself.  Hit %'s don't represent the actual percentage as their are metrics and abilities not factored in (dodge for example).  Sometimes abilities flat out don't work.  I've had every enemy on the map turn invisible and slaughter me.  The last straw for me was when one of my squaddies just said screw it and laid down.  Half health, concious, and alive they just laid in the street.  I couldn't pick them up.  I couldn't revive them because they were not bleeding or unconcious.    Like a toddler they just said, ""I'm done doing this.""  I thought to myself, ""Me too squaddie, me too.""  I want to love this game, I really do.  I'm sad to give it a negative review and I hope after several patches these things work out.  I'll revisit it once its worked through.			"

												Wow... no other way to open this review. Much respect and coodos to the devs and all the support team in making this XCOM possible. The game as is exceeds the previous one and I love the new spin on being a rebel force. Charecter customization .... dopeMusic and cinematic shots thorough out the game .... tight The story line...... finally some substance and context to the game that helps draw you inMAPS..... I havent had a same map yet. this kicked the game up so many notches and I like how they tend to refelct the part of the world you are in#1 in my book ..... allowing modders access to bring additional ideas n creativity to XCOM. One sure way to keep the intrest going over timeThis game in its current state is solid and what can happen when good moders do what they do to enhanse the game .... makes this game WORTH EVERY PENNY XCOM is in my top 3 purchases along side Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

												Didn't have a crash once, saw no glitches, other than the delays in turns, which a mod fixed like day 4, Customization is insanely awesome, i was a person who believed it would add nothing to the game. I was totally wrong, the introduction of the character pool, which allows you to create soldiers and then import them to your game or show up as rookie recruits is amazing. The game is an improvement on the previous xcom games in LITERALLY ALL WAYS. The base building lets you have freedom and choice now, no more limitations such as forced to build Uplinks asap. The new enemy variation is astounding, new enemies show up constantly keeping you on your toes, constantly wondering what the game may throw at you next.  The Viper enemies are probablly the worst alien to see, they take whatever plan you had and make you throw it out the window quickly so you can try to come up with a way to save your soldiers. (they do pathetic dmg though hardly a threat on their own)The loot dropping mechanics and weapon upgrade system, are awesome, really giving you the feeling that you are working with what resources you are given, replacing Meld, with the detonating loot. BRILLIANT. The story was quite thin in Enemy unknown but it served its purpose, the story here is more fleshed out, and you could tell they wanted to give you a good reason to push throught the trials, to save humanity from the Avatar project. The Woudned system works differently you can have lightly wounded, wounded, or gravely wounded soldiers. If someone is gravely wounded they are healing for around 15 in game days, and if the aliens retaliate with your best troops wounded it can seem terrifying. (still beatable)       This new system teaches you to be safe with your soldiers, sometimes causing you to be too safe and screw up evacuation missions, but thats what Xcom2 is about. The Classes have been given much more attention, both trees are very appealing in their own ways and both are viable in every class.Psionic troopers are available earlier in the game!!!!! However they are only available early if you take the sacrifices of not building your Guerilla building, or your workshop. You can take a chance at fighting the aliens with only 4 troops, or have your 6 troops, but be behind on your psionics research and training.Psionic troopers take FOREVER TO TRAIN (literally around 2 MONTHS in game time. But that is to have a completly trained soldier, with literally all psionic abilities.  However this is not a negative, they become precious troops, whom will actually force you to play the game better, and that is only because of the new injury system, without it they would just feel like overpowered troops with no downside. The new ""failure state"" comes when you allow the Aliens' Avatar project to go unchecked, you were either busy training psi soldiers (like me in my first game) or busy trying to get a bunch of supplies. This failure state is far more satisfying than the countries leaving the Xcom project. You feel like you actually have a tangible thing to fight against rather than just HOPING that the next Abduction mission does't happen to your highest panic countries. .If you fail, it was your fault. not just because rng decided to make it so.TLDR-An improvment in all ways over previous xcom games, -EXTREMELY varied enemy pool.-Varied customization.-Sticks to the solid gameplay Enemy unknown made us all love-Concealment is super satisfying and getting the jump on aliens is glorious. -Weapon upgrade system helps add more flavor to your already flavorful troops-Base building is way less constrictive, and because of this actually leads to more choices, and therefore more varied replays of the game.-Story is given more love-Classes are now quite balanced giving you more choice when you rank up. -Mod Support on Day 1, that basically fixed anything the dev's didn't think of, or didn't have time for.

												I don't think this is as good as the first game. It has a few nice additions, but comes with a few irritations - so it took a few steps forward, but also a few steps back. Ultimately, I think the irritations were a bit too much to make it fully enjoyable compared to the first game even with the improvements.After that has all been said, it is still an amazing game and can be a lot of fun.Pros:- Hacking Mechanic addition.- Ranger class with Melee combat is so much fun and it's actually so good.- There;s always something to do. I actually found myself not able to do everything I want to because there's always soemthing that is more important.Cons:- There are many timed missions which I believe defeats the point of a turn base strategy game. It has produced some tense moments but it is more of a brute force way of forcing you to take risks when you known you shouldn't.- Load times gets worse the longer you play the game. This is on a pretty decent computer with an SSD harddrive.- There are lags in the UI when something hasn't updated properly (especially after using the first action point) which has caused me to accidentely do the wrong thing. You can get around this by simply waiting just a bit until everything has caught up to itself but it breaks up the game flow.- Some of the shots seems impossible which can catch you out.- There are a few crashes here and there but I've never lost a save game.

												Dear god, this game. And I mean that in a good way.I just played through the game from day of release to tonight, non-stop, and never have I felt such a boiling pot of emotions from a game in my entire life. This game hurt me, this game made me feel stressed, and this game made me feel stupid. But at the same time, this game encouraged me, this game made me feel good about myself, this game made me think, and rewarded my when I took time to do so.There are tons of improvements over the original XCOM, namely ones relating to armor and weapon upgrades, along with resource acquisition and base management. It all just felt a lot more smooth and made much more sense to me. Instead of spending hundreds on a single gun, you spent it to upgrade your entire force's arsenal. When making the incredibly high-tier end-game armors, you had to manufacture them in the proving grounds over a course of several days (depending on your engineer count) but not having that armmor was never really a death sentence. My favorite improvement through is the level of customization added to this XCOM title. Every soldier feels that much more special after you spend upwards of hours messing around with their armor, guns, props, faces, attitudes, voices, etc to make one that just works for you (Look at my playtime; at least 1/10th of that was spent in the character creator/editor alone.) It feels easier to get attached to squad members in this game as such, making it hurt that much more when your favorite dies, or make you get that much more on edge when they're in danger.Of course, this game is FAR from perfect. It's plagued with some major artificial difficulty in certain aspeects, such as many enemies having a large amount of health, armor and damage relative to your abilities to take them down at that point in time. Another thing people have been complaining about: Mission timers. These were added to reduce the likelihood for players to overwatch crawl through every mission, and many say that they're just too much. I agree, AND disagree with that. The timers add urgency to the game, and make every move count much more than it did in Enemy Unknown/Within.  While, at the same, the timers DO feel rather... Short, at times. If they were closer to 10 and 14 instead of 8 and 12 for missions respectively, my guess is there wouldn't be as many people upset about them as there are now.Overall, I'd say the game is most definitely worth picking up if you enjoyed Enemy Unknown IMO. If you're new to the franchise though, I'd say going for EU & EW together, or the original, classic XCOM for a more cheap intro to the series. XCOM 2 and Enemy Unknown aren't DRASTICALLY different, so if you find you like that one, I whole-heartedly recomend this one. "

												Never trusting another FireAxis Product ever again.  Where to start with this game.  First and foremost, with how broken it is.  I get crashes every single time I play it.  Then there's the fact of how poorly optimized it is.  I have a 980 TI and this game gets poor framerates.  I would say I'll come back and change my review when the game is patched up, but this release is so riddled with bugs that it is a clear indicator of an integrity issue.  I will never review this game positively because this was such a terrible slap in the face, and proof that the debugging team (if there was one) gave zero **** about the consumer.Where to go from here???  The game is NOT more fun than EU/EW.  The graphics are NOT much better, yet extremely taxing.  What am I even talking about??? I can't even play the game without it crashing.

Everytime after I killed the 2nd enemy in tutorial mission, the game crashed.My total time play is about 100 minutes but actually I can't play a single mission at all. Because of cutscene that can't skip. If I play over 2 hours, so it can't refund.I submitted a report to 2K once at the time the game released but no one answer my question. Both XCOM 2 and Borderland 2. Very disappoined.			"

												Playing this game in ironman mode is frustrating because of the bugs.-Line of sight issues (aliens can shoot you through floors and walls, when they shouldn't be able to see you). This makes high ground unreliable, since the enemy can enter the building and shoot you from underneath.-Cover and flanking are not reliable. It rarely happens, but sometimes a flanked enemy will not be labelled as flanked, and sometimes a soldier under cover will be labelled as flanked. It's rare but it'll ruin an ironman game if it happens.-Sometimes a game does not save properly, and your ironman run will disappear and become unrecoverable.-Grenades are the biggest tactical advantage in early game, and their explosion radius is unreliable. The HUD does not highlight the radius correctly. Throwing a grenade with a 1-tile space from cover may or may not blow it up. Even if it isn't highlighted by the HUD, it may still blow up. Basically an early grenade has a 3x3 radius of guaranteed cover damage, and a 5x5 radius of MAYBE cover damage that isn't shown.Some non-bug issues:-During concealment phase, the enemy knows your exact location and will walk towards you, forcing engagement. This happens if you sneak close to the target, which will force an engagement with 2 or 3 pods. This makes sneaking to the target impractical.RNG already makes the game unpredictable, but with unpredictable bugs it becomes hard to enjoy the tactical part of the game.**EDIT**Played even more, some more game-breaking bugs:-Sometimes can't open door to rescue VIP, results in failed mission.-A failed cerebral mine has bug that will kill specialist over time during the mission. -Rushing research does not work properly on Legend difficulty. Causes -Killing Andromedon in the first-contact phase on overwatch will magically allow the andromedon to attack (usually aliens will run to cover).I was given the suggestion to just play without ironman, and only reload if a bug happens. The problem with this is that all the moves made leading up to the bug are no longer a surprise, which is what makes ironman fun to play in the first place.			"

												10/10 I have been waiting for this game from the day it was announced I love how they made it so that we lost in enemy unknown. It's not as repetative as it was in the the first one which is a great thing. the customizations are fantastic. the new classes and the new enemies are great. I can't wait for the dlcs to roll out. If there would to be another xcom coming out I would buy it because this one gave me high hopes for the next one to be great.			"

												EDIT - There are already mods on the Workshop to disable timers, which is the basis for a huge number of negative reviews here. So, y'know, keep that in mind.Pros- Punishing; you WILL lose soldiers you WILL NOT win every mission or campaign.- Wonderful model and texture work, with nice lighting and shading.- Feels different enough to justify a new game imo.- Enemy patrols are a game changer, forcing you to pick your battles and make the most of your advantages.- Large array of character customization, letting you create and become attached to digital representations of your friends so you can watch helplessly as they are torn apart by aliens. With Workshop support, there is almost endless possibilities for new cosmetic options.- Extremely open modding, to the point where some core mechanics are essentially .ini value tweaks.- 42GB of development content in the SDK to work and create new content with. Seriously awesome.Cons- Others report performance issues, though I have not experienced them aside from slight stuttering during the insertion cinematic animations. (i74790k, 32gb RAM, TitanX, Win10, installed on SSD).- Strange pauses once in a while before or after actions, though I haven't found it as annoying as others appear to have.Notes- It's not EU or EW with better graphics, it's a different game. Most missions have turn timers which force you to think and play aggressively and take risks, rather than turtle your favorite soldiers up 1 square at a time. Some people hate this, they say it isn't ""fair"" or ""too hard"". Personally I really enjoy it for the reasons I listed here.			"

												i love this game, but then again i love gambeling and damn if this game isnt luck based even more so then in Enemy Unknown.  let me say this i realy do love this game but ♥♥♥♥ all those damn term limits in EU they were a welcome change of pace but now its almost every ♥♥♥♥ing mission this forces the player to put his men where he normaly wouldent. whereas in EU these pushed your skills to maximize each move in 2 they feal like they are constantly putting the player in unfair situations where if he strays from a formula its all over no chance thats not strategy thats chemisty. ultimately this game is realy good but i never had a chance to savor it cause just like the missions the game has a turn limit and this prohibited me from sitting back and getting my full enjoyment out of this game. it just feels like it was over to fast. that said i have 147 hours in it and im not bored yet so...

												amazing! I have played xcom since its early DOS days with all the malformed weird soldier pictures and the barely recognizable snakemen. Now it has bloomed into perfect. And honestly...honestly i really really didnt think i was going to like this story setup. earth lost?! wtf, but no...it was written amazingly! if anything it made me feel a ton more connection to my rag tag renegade group that you can customize....and omg the customization in this game...oh how i love my customization and this game has made it so i can pretty much recreate all my friends into perfect soldier form. down to alot of the same tattoos and scars...aagh its been so long. so so so so long since i have fallen in love with a game this much. xcom 2 i love you. i love you and engineer shen, but keep that on the dl ok?

												Wow... no other way to open this review. Much respect and coodos to the devs and all the support team in making this XCOM possible. The game as is exceeds the previous one and I love the new spin on being a rebel force. Charecter customization .... dopeMusic and cinematic shots thorough out the game .... tight The story line...... finally some substance and context to the game that helps draw you inMAPS..... I havent had a same map yet. this kicked the game up so many notches and I like how they tend to refelct the part of the world you are in#1 in my book ..... allowing modders access to bring additional ideas n creativity to XCOM. One sure way to keep the intrest going over timeThis game in its current state is solid and what can happen when good moders do what they do to enhanse the game .... makes this game WORTH EVERY PENNY XCOM is in my top 3 purchases along side Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

												I don't think this is as good as the first game. It has a few nice additions, but comes with a few irritations - so it took a few steps forward, but also a few steps back. Ultimately, I think the irritations were a bit too much to make it fully enjoyable compared to the first game even with the improvements.After that has all been said, it is still an amazing game and can be a lot of fun.Pros:- Hacking Mechanic addition.- Ranger class with Melee combat is so much fun and it's actually so good.- There;s always something to do. I actually found myself not able to do everything I want to because there's always soemthing that is more important.Cons:- There are many timed missions which I believe defeats the point of a turn base strategy game. It has produced some tense moments but it is more of a brute force way of forcing you to take risks when you known you shouldn't.- Load times gets worse the longer you play the game. This is on a pretty decent computer with an SSD harddrive.- There are lags in the UI when something hasn't updated properly (especially after using the first action point) which has caused me to accidentely do the wrong thing. You can get around this by simply waiting just a bit until everything has caught up to itself but it breaks up the game flow.- Some of the shots seems impossible which can catch you out.- There are a few crashes here and there but I've never lost a save game.

												HUGE amounts of bugs and gameplay issues that make it impossible to play. I love XCOM, see how many hours I have on XCOM 1, and was so excited about XCOM 2But the game is frankly an unfinished, buggy mess. Some examples - My solider is on the ground floor, inside a building.  I can see, shoot and kill an enemy through THREE intervening ceilings without actual line of sight. The same happens with the AI in reverse.Then we have situations where a player runs up to cover but instead of hiding behind it, switches to walk up the side of it like spiderman - or in some cases, walks up thin air so he is at a 90 degree angle to the rest of the map. Or gets stuck trapped inside a wall.  OR simply disappears when the move is finished.Coupled with all manner of other impossible shooting & moving issues, colossally stupid AI (I even tried the improvement mod), and absolutely shocking graphics performance on high end kit I'm gutted. Hugely disappointed.I can only show my dissatisfaction in one meaningful way, and that is to get my money back.If they ever fix it, I'll think about coming back.But right now it's horrible.  And that's very sad.			"

												A great game.  I played this on veteran and again on commander to increase the challenge.  I briefly tried Ironman, but I just don't have the patience to lose a bunch of soldiers and game progress due to RNG.It's a great game once you figure out the long-game and avoid bad decisions in base building, mission selection, and research selection.  The squad-level combat is a lot of fun and looks great.I bought the DLC pass and while the customization options included in Anarchy's Children are pretty silly, the Alien Hunters added some interesting weapons and armor as well as making missions in the early game far more challenging.  I don't know what the next round of DLC will be.  I do know that if it is just augmentations to the original story line, I'll probably pass.  Probably			"

												I was very disappointed to hear the premise of the sequel was that humanity had lost against the aliens when I worked so hard to successfully defeat them the first time around...But you know what?  I was wrong.  This WORKS.Playing an insurgency against the alien rulers on Earth is an awesome feel.  There are minor gripes...the soldier bios repeat way too quickly, for example.  But each of these gripes are easily overcome with fully functional mods.200 hours in, and I still haven't beaten this one yet.  And I love that.Great game.  As a fan of both the ""true"" original XCOM and the more modern XCOM that this one spins off of, I highly recommend XCOM 2.  10//10.			"

												UPDATE, after installing once again, hoping that they fixed stuff by now:- still runs like♥♥♥♥♥ even on absolute minimal settings; waiting for the flashy menu transitions (basically every time you click something in the strategy layer) probably accounts for half my play time. I know my system is getting old, but I don't have this issue with other games that have similar graphical quality. XCOM:EU ran flawlessly on max, XCOM2 chugs along on minimal.- iron man is still a succession of frustrations with inconsistent line of sight, extraction zones that get moved to the other side of the map with 1 turn left (because one tile got damaged!), unpredictable environmental damage, etc.- oh great, turns out I got a completely useless set of continental bonuses, thanks RNG! Should I replay the entire first month of the campaign if I want a set of fun ones?- having played the game a while, I realized the maps being random just means every single one of them is forgettable. Would much rather have had a good selection of well designed static maps. You know, with interesting choke points, etc.- a few mods provide improvement on a few design choices, but most of them are just collections of shiny helmets and weapons from other pop culture franchises. It's cool, but it doesn't save the game from being underwhelming.ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you want to play this on ironman, it's probably better to hold off on purchasing for a couple of months. Too many bugs and inconsistencies mean it's a rather frustrating affair.The good:- modding support- animations/ragdoll physics- more customization of soldiers and weapons (both functional and aesthetic)The bad:- very poor performance on all graphic settings- lots of waiting for animations to finish- unintuitive and cumbersome UI- strategic choices are largely illusory, you're kind of forced into a certain path of action if you don't want to lose- lots of bugs dealing with line of sight- overreliance on RNG to simulate diversity, screwing you over in ways that are beyond ""that's XCOM baby""- not a very interesting difficulty curveI'm halfway during my second campaign (on 2nd highest difficulty) and I simply can't be arsed to start up the game anymore, since it feels like a chore to have to sit through all the bad in order to get to the good parts.I really wanted to like this more, but I can't really recommend XCOM2, based on my experiences so far and the price they're asking. I'm probably going to play very little until they either patch the hell out of this, or some genius modders do.			"

												I love the XCOM series. Having played XCOM since 1994, I was really nervous when XCOM: Enemy Unknown came out in 2012, but it was an enjoyable reboot. It had its flaws and limitations but all in all was a fun game to play. I was blown away with XCOM 2, it is everything I wanted in a sequel. Not only is this game worth paying full price for, it is also worth the inevitable hardware upgrade you're probably going to have to do to fully enjoy the game. I have an older gaming system, hardware is about 7 years old. I only had to upgrade system RAM from 4GB to 8GB and my video card from a GeForce GTX 260 to a GeForce GTX 750Ti 2GB, in order to run DirectX 11. All in all only about a $180 upgrade but it runs the game perfectly. XCOM 2 take place a few decades after XCOM: Enemy Unknown (EU), but with a twist. Without having any spoilers for anyone who hasn't played XCOM: EU or XCOM 2 yet, the end of one does not match up completely with the beginning of the other. XCOM 2 is unlike most every other sci-fi sequel out there, and is much more enjoyable in my opinion.PROS:-Original Storyline.-Fully Customizable Squad (ALL Squad specialties are useful, unlike previous Xcoms).-Amazing Graphics.-Tons of replay value.-Computer AI is well done, unpredictable and fully uses the environment and weapon systems against you.-Stays true to the core principles of XCOM.CONS:-Requires A LOT of hard drive space 45GB for basic install.-Graphics Glitches that sometimes effects gameplay.**-Smaller map size, not a lot of huge buildings to clear like XCOM: TFTD.-Can have slow load times.-Average game length.**= Ghosting sometimes occurs and during graphics intensive segments (like catastrophic explosions) characters sometimes display incorrect actions afterward. (Like constant crouching or constriction after 'bladestorm' etc)Probably my favorite turn-based strategy game of the last decade, and a must-have for any XCOM fan! "

												I pre-ordered this game and played it the day it came out. It had a ton of bugs, which was to be excpected at launch, and I  did not even finish the campaign. After recently coming back to this game it's disappointing to see that it's still infested with bugs. However, the bugs aren't the only problem I have with this game. The gameplay itself offers little more than the previous one and even takes away some great content that was in XCOM: Enemy Within. Speaking of DLC, you won't find any worthwhile in this game thus far. The best changes in XCOM 2 are the graphics and the new overwatch system but everything else is mediocre.			"

												If you liked the 1990's originals or Xcom: EU/EW, this game has something for you. Play on the second difficulty level if you're used to playing EU/EW on classic, as that's about the same kind of difficulty. This game is tough, but fair. The strategic global layer is deeper than last time, and the gameplay is similar but significantly different to the first game, so that people good at the first game will find this one tough too. There are some bugs, but nothing major and we're still awaiting the first patch so that's fine.I highly recommend this to people who liked EU/EW. If you didn't play them, play them before you buy this since they're some of the best games released in the last few years. This game, however, is better. This might be the game of the year for me.

												I played the first XCOM, haven't tried the XCOM: Enemy Within DLC, have no idea about XCOM 2 until it release date but XCOM 2 really got me hooked. Aside from the game feels alittle bit rush (Spoiler: project Avatar will make your life a living hell if you fail to delay it) and the aliens can be d*cks sometimes with godly aim. To sum up, game is awesome. In addition, the game is really well optimized i can play it just fine with my crappy laptop (Core i5-4200U 1.6GHz, Nvidia GT720m 2GB, 8GB DDR3 L Memory Ram.) Overwatch is kinda overrated in this game but the stealth mechanic is really cool (for setting up ambushes, rush objective,) also this time you can actually save your fallen beloved soldiers from the battlefield which is super since iam kinda attached to some of my toons. In conclusion this game is worth 59.99$ for what it is giving the players, i do recommend you to get it if it is on sale or full price if you can :3 9/10 - Superb.			"

												Basically another strategy game where the developer's only recourse to making the game ""hard"" is to summon additional troops each time you eradicate enemy presence.  For the rest, it's just like the previous Xcom, only with a moving base and a time constraint on the overall game and in most missions.  Again, the lazy-dev way to making the game ""hard"".  Nothing too special, I've played better and am going back to those games.some more cons:- you get skills always greyed out in game- snipes appear to be CoD players in terms of accuracy- range does nothing for hit/miss chancemaybe it'll become good when modded...

												Xccom 2 has incredible graphics thanks to the unreal world builder and great artistic work by those who deserve credit. That is the only good thing I have to say about Xcom 2.So far in my commander difficulty game I have not enjoyed any of it. Every single mission is the same. You are on rails the entire game. Every map is your squad walking straight across the map, no exploration, you walk directly from point a to point b, every single time. No exploration, you know without question where the enemies are. It's not tactical at all. Every mission has the same enemies and the same ammount of them. Nothing fun about this game and to top that off the dialog is unforgivable. Jake solomon is hands down the worst thing that has ever happened to Xcom. Constant misuse of words in dialog, with no intelligent flow from subject to subject. Just as if Sarah Palin wrote the scripts and then they paid some voice over to read each word of the script. However they only record each word one at a time and paste all the words together so you get the MOST akward dialog at times where you know for a fact that the sentence was spliced together by seperate audio clips. So lazy for a 60dollar game especially a well established game company thats been in business for years, you would expect much more than this.A lot of people complain about performance, I have no issues with performance, but I must note that at times enemy death can take upto 10 seconds. You're just sitting waiting, the death only took 2 of the 10 seconds but you just sit there waiting for the game. It might seem like lag but you can see the soldiers idle animations and frame rate isn't dropped or locked at all. Music mouse ect work just fine but it's as though there is wait time programmed into so much of the animation sequences that the game plays like a poker game where one person is in the other room ALL THE TIME.The worst part about this game is that it's only an intellectual property license which means you can't get a refund for the game and you can't take a literal♥♥♥♥♥♥on it. Because there are only two things that this game would be good for, pooping on it, and returning it for a refund.			"

												Sequels that are just retreads/reskins of the previous title are all too common nowadays.  XCOM 2 is everything that a sequel should be.  It takes the game play of the original and improves upon it in every way.  All of the player classes are reworked and improved.  All of the returning enemy types have been remade and there are several new enemy types.  Levels are now randomly generated instead of being the same dozen maps over and over.  The geoscape has been completely redone.  The game has mod support with Steam Workshop at launch.  The new concealment system adds many new tactical optionsSeveral outspoken people have complained that the mission timers and Geoscape timer have ""ruined the game"" but I will disagree and say that these 2 additions are the two best improvements from the previous game.  In the previous XCOM, it was all too easy to turtle with overwatch and completely minimize any risk.  Many missions in XCOM 2 have a turn limit that require you to complete the mission, or a mission objective with in X number of turns.  This forces you to be less conservative with your actions and keeps you moving forward.  This makes gameplay much more interesting and dynamic. Sometimes you will loose missions and some times you might have to sacrifice some of your soldiers to save others.On the Geoscape, some times you will end up in a situation where you have to take a dark site mission or some other mission related to the Geoscape timer at the expense of ignoring some other mission.  This forces you to make decisions that can impact your game.A lot of people do not seem to understand that a game you always win isn't fun.  Fun is feeling like you accomplished something and you can only feel a sense of accomplishment if there is a real challenge.  XCOM 2 does provide a challenge and is fun. "
