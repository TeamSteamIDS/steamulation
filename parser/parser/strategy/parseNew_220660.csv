http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SDVC/discussions/0/This review was marked as ""abusive"" by the Developer, was taken off of the review page between March 8th 2014 through to March 11th 2014.  Pathetic.This was a total waste of my $29.99,  I bought it under the pretense of Multiplayer being released first major patch after final release from my Friend who recommended the game.  The Developer has come to the conclusion that by changing the Engine and flushing out his original Idea for a game, that he can now  make ANOTHER game and wants money for it, the full game that he originally wanted to make but couldn't.   This is the result made by a very poor decision long ago to use the wrong Engine <Sunburn> for his project, an engine that Microsoft dropped and everyone in the know knew was a dead-end, months before Zero decided to release the game as Final.  Nothing about the programme changed between final beta release and the first day of Final Release in April.       The above mentioned Steam Group is a place for free discussion about Stardrive, and its Developer that You are going to purchase a beta, abandoned game from.  The Developer will finish it on his whim alone, that could be years or decades.  These are all direct from the developer, but sadly I can't direct you to the correct site to see them, he has, or has had his Minions, delete threads full of direct quotes from Zero you simply wouldn't believe if I wrote them here, thinking I was a Troll.  I hope this shows I gave 90+ hours trying to play this game, and never completing 1 game.  Buy this game if you like someone lying to you all the time, some do I suppose.			"

												This game was never actually finished before it was abandoned by the developer so that he could start work on a second game. The store page continued to promote features that were never implemented for months after it was clear that they were never going to be added to the game. Making matters worse, the developer has demonstrated extremely bad judgment when interacting with customers that shows a lack of professionalism. This combined with a loyal but rabid fan base make this game a toxic property that is best avoided.			"

												Bought the game in the early days for full price, was listed as Multiplayer and promised many features. Multiplayer was NEVER added and none of these features we were told would be implemented, made it in to the game. The Developer secretly worked on the second game behind the scenes, using our money to fund his work rather than finishing the first one and then even having the cheek to Kickstart the second game for even more money? Only to then sell this second game back to us again, at full price! Complete rip-off. Now we're left with nothing but a broken demo. I will NOT be buying the second game and funding such a dirty, cheap money making scheme and I'd advise that others do the same. The only way these developers will learn NOT to cheat their customers, is if they have no custom. As bad as EA as far as I'm concerned.			"

												the game is nice and has some really good features but the dev abandoned the game early into its life so it gets boring quickly without mods.the ai is pretty terrible.no different research for the different races they all share the same tech tree.not much interaction with the ai beside talking,spying or becoming allies with them.has no story line to speak of even though it has secrets to unlock and had another race which was removed because the dev said the game was complete even though their was only one option with them.i recommend you wait for it to go on sale before you even think of buying the game because at the price it is with the features you get its not worth it.

												Edit #2: I'll just leave this here.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SDVCAn unofficial StarDrive group, where discussion is open and not censored. The Steam forum is pretty heavily moderated and the developer has a habit of deleting threads and banning people left and right before and during a big sale, so this is where people go to talk about the game however they like and not risk having their threads deleted because they didn't like the game.***I bought this game when it was in Early Access and... I thought it was amazing. Full of promises and ideas. Back then, the developper was promising updates pretty much left and right. Multiplayer was to be added to the game. Rare resources, laying mines, better diplomacy, being able to make joint operations with allies; all of these things were to be added to the game... But none -- NONE -- were implemented. The game you can buy right now is very much the same game I bought in Early Access, minus a few bugs. Hell, some core features such as the freighters are still buggy...So, that being said, is this a good game? Well, it's an okay game. I spent several hours on it so obviously it's not totally terrible. But the thing is, most of these hours (I'd say two third of them -- yes, that much) was trying mods and messing around waiting for the content update to come. When the Developper announced that he screwed up and decided the game was done and could not be updated anymore because of engine limitations, I stopped playing altogether.To make up for it, the owners of StarDrive will get a discount on his next title and access to some kind of multiplayer mini-game is going to be free. The thing is : his next game is going to be a turn-based strategy game. I bought a real-time strategy game. His next game is going to get as close to a MoO2 clone as he can. Good things for the fans, I guess, but that's not what I bought.So, to sum things up: this game is half-finished, features are lacking, it lacks polish and is very, very rough around the edges and is developped by one of the worst indy dev ever as far as PR and ""I care for my customers"" are involved. There are better games out there to spend your money on.But hey, that's just my opinion.***Edit #1: the multiplayer mini-game has been abandoned as well. Yes, that is yet another fail to put on Zero Sum Games resume. Also, that discount I was talking about? The one the owners of StarDrive will get? That will just be a Steam coupon with an expiration date. Great, eh? Way to tell your customers to hurry it up or screw you, Zero. Way to go indeed.			"

												This game had a ton of potential but was abandoned by the developer for greener pastures after he decided it would be good to start on a sequel while charging full price to everyone (including the people who have bought this unfinished project). It was initially released with a ton of bugs and still has many things that have yet to be fully fleshed out much less finished in any considerable degree. The ship designer and the battles that rarely take place are the only positives to take out of this game.The diplomacy part of the game is very shallow indeed. With races declaring war on you with little motivation beyond your empire's progression crossing a line set by their predetermined level of aggressiveness. The same goes with positive interaction. It's very much a game of watching a bar go up or down to get them to do something you want to do.Empire building is also shallow and unfinished. There is almost no internal management other than building a shallow level of building sets that make all your colonies resemble one another after only a colony or two. Rebellion takes place when your treasury drops below a certain level and only in this manner. Civilization 2 has more in depth internal management than this title.Military matters are hampered by two things: The lack of any meaningful artificial intelligence and the small tech tree present in the game. The tech tree is the smallest tree I've seen in a 4x game (and smaller than some RTS games like Rise of Nations or even Age of Empires). The AI assembles the same, tired fleet makeup and then throws it at you. This means pretty much every single game plays out the same way regardless of the galaxy size. The one saving grace in enemy behavior is that the game saves your custom ship designs and then uses them against you in subsequent games should you choose another race to play as. I would love to see other 4x games incorporate this feature into their titles so I'm faced with much more difficult fleet makeups since they were designed by myself or other players who post their designs for others to use.All in all, I'm very disappointed in not only the way this game turned out, but the developer's behavior on the steam forums once people heard he was abandoning any serious development on the game on an interview. He would ban people who warned others about the state of development and has had meltdowns on multiple gaming forums when confronted about the issue. Do not give your money to this studio. Other 4x's like Galactic Civilizations II or Distant Worlds do this genre much more of a service.			"

												Sometimes you find a game for $1.00 on HumbleBundle and think why not, I'll give it a shot.  What's the worst that could happen?  It sucks and you're out a dollar?  Don't be a fool.  Listen to me, I used to be like you...naive.  I paid the dollar, positively gitty at my thrifty yet philanthropic purchase, but I discovered there are far worse fates than not liking the game.  Oh yes, much to my dismay, I learned you could absolutely LOVE the game.  Specifically, I learned that someone, some magical gameweaver of a developer, had somehow discovered a way to craft all of my 4x RTS dreams into one perfect game.Imagine having all this only to find out after hours of gameplay that the mystical Dev had just M. Night Shyamalan'ed your♥♥♥♥♥by abandoning the game deep in development, leaving gamebreaking glitches unpatched, and giggling all the way to the bank with your hopes and dreams.  Now there will forever be a void in my heart where the finished version of this game should be.  I would've rather spent my dollar on paying someone to kick me in the balls.  At least that paid would go away eventually.To be fair, I'm only whining because I love what this game could've been.  Wasting that much potential should be a crime.  The finished, patched version would have been one of the best 4x games of all time.  Unfortunately this game was abandoned to begin development on a sequel that will be turn-based, not real time, and therefore more of a completely different game than a sequel.  While I love turn-based strategy, the RTS version of this game is the one I wanted and now I will never be able to play a polished version of it.  As such, I simply can not recommend it.			"

												I waited long to write this review as this game had huge potential. It is amazing work considering that it was all made by just one person. Unfortunately that person moved on and never finished this game. You can custom built and constantly upgrade your space ships and watch them perform in battle. Which is quite addictive. It could have been so good. Unfortunately, many game mechanics are broken and will never get fixed. Trade ships don't work properly which will render your population starving despite having a food surplus. Mikromanaging it all is possible to some extent, but those settings are lost once you load a game. Pathfinding, AI and diplomacy are rubbish together with a minimalistic story line. Overall I sadly can only advise to stay away from this unfinished broken product...			"

												The game has a good concept, the ship designer is fantastic. However, the game is NOT FINISHED. The author abandoned it to work on a sequel instead of finishing what he started.The game is missing:Any meaningful construction on planets.Detailed Tech Trees.Balanced 4x elements (it's very easy to break balance on spies in particular, and impossible to do well on high difficulties without large spy bonuses really).Proper debugging.Multiplayer.Although if this game had been finished it could have been very good, it has not been, and I would NEVER buy another product from the same author. If you're interested in this game, I would consider pirating it, getting a copy from a friend, or some other method that avoids paying the author. The ship designer is still fun to play with as long as you install one of the large mods that adds in a lot of the content that the game is missing.			"

												A fun, aesthetically pleasing space strategy game that is simply awesome!Or atleast it would be if crucial game elements were fixed.As it stands, 02-02-2014, several game features are severely lacking in polish and there are some design flaws that really jump out - such as any unmonitored battle being auto-calculated without taking into calculation such things as ship armour or shields, etc. which essentially makes the elaborate, fully customizable ship designing pretty much redundant.Or the way that the AI can win the game without warning due to building a late-game Wonder-style building, which you recieve no notification of until it is already built and the game has ended with your defeat (though this building can be disabled by modding. But it's supposed to be a feature-complete, finished game, right?).The game still do not feature alterable gameplay options, leaving you with only the options of adjusting video and audio.The game's features such as customizing races are great, and the shipyard ship-designing is really fun - but if it doesn't matter in the slightest, it isn't really that much of a draw, is it?I don't really think that I can recommend this game as it is at this stage. It has a lot of really cool stuff going for it, but when crucial elements of the game remains broken, that's really just bad. When (hopefully) they have been fixed or have become toggable (as indeed some of the problems seem to stem from the developer's design decisions), the game is definitely something to recommend.But not in its current stage.

												So after a long while this Dev releases, of what should have been StarDrive in the first place, StarDrive 2. If you purchased StarDrive before the 'release/abandoning' you will certainly feel screwed over, below is written as to why.He has abandoned and called the first StarDrive 'finished' himself (despite all the criticism, which he immediately removes stating 'I got a little carried away trying to clean the forums up.') only so he can release the game a second(!) time in a more finished state. (http://store.steampowered.com/app/252450) The game that StarDrive should have been in the first place.The developer has gone as far as to excluding all criticism only to be put in 'one single topic'  giving us the reason of 'I think it is a better approach to provide a single thread for people to vent in rather than to just delete repetitive threads.'(here's the topic, http://steamcommunity.com/app/220660/discussions/0/792923683730544619/ )That's right, one topic to ignore. The rest will simply be removed. Just one topic he has to avoid, makes things simple for him doesn't it.Any form of (constructive) criticism is replied with 'If you feel cheated by StarDrive, kindly scroll up to the upper right portion of your browser screen and click the ""Logout"" button. I don't want to hear it.' and/or removed.This is why steam early access is a dangerous thing, you can't get your money back when the developer(s) fail to forfill their promises that they advertised the product with in the first place.Stay away from this Dev and publisher, atleast that is my opinion and what I recommend.

Your money will encourage the developer, after abandoning this project before completion of promised features or Kickstarter goals, to continue bailing on commitments because of their own poor decision making.I eagerly await StarDrive 3, but only when it is pitched to a major publisher, who in turn puts someone of their own, with experience on bigger titles, as project lead.

												This game was a dream. A fine product in the making with aspirations for greatness. We, the ones who bought in early in development, had further dreams of playing this complex and (even in early stages) fun game.Then it started. Features began to be stripped off the list due to engine limitations (I might add that other early access games have successfully carried out full-engine ports when the limitations of the initial engine became apparent and at no additional expense to the existing financial backers...). The dreams and promises slowly turned to ash in our mouths as this unfinished and limited product got promoted out of beta (some having suggested just in time for sales to boast visibility...).I gave up on this product completely. I wouldn't have thought about it again had I not accidentally clicked into it's forum (I was aiming for Starbound). ""What do you want from Star Drive 2?""In summary this product is a promise. It is a shadow of what it could have been and it is well-and-truly abandoned; as even IF the developers take the time to add an additional patch simply to avoid it being permanently labeled 'abandonware' my confidence in the devs doing anything to address any additional bugs (least of all those that are likely to be added into the game by a half-arsed, smoke-and-mirrors patch) is nil.A grave disappointment all round and I truly wish the best for any whom buy into this product (or other products) as I feel burned by this developer and wouldn't wish that upon them.

Instead of fixing the issues and delivering the promised features. The Developer is realeasing Star Drive 2 with the promised features that Star Drive 1 was supposed to have. He has stated repeatedly on the StarDrive forums and in the Steam forums that he will update SD1 when he feels like it... Zero gives indie developers a bad name. Even though Star Drive is a fun and entertaining game, it was released extremely buggy, it felt like it was half finished, only mods made it playable, and the developer has abandoned it for SD2.

												Forgoing all my past issues with the game, I'm going to focus on one specific feature that is missing.Ingame, deletable, saves. The code for such is already in the game, with one being able to delete custom ship designs, but you can't delete your saves.And depending on how much you play, the space taken up by the saves can get rather large. And given that you have to do through a, by default, hidden folder to reach the saves directory then not everyone is going to know how to manually delete them.I've wiped my saves folder a few times. The first was after Pre-Warp mode was released. I wiped three gigs of save files. The next was after I decided to start using Tech Level Mod, and I wiped 2 gigs worth of save files. Eventually, I wiped those saves out as well clearing out roughly 3 gigs of space. I wiped my save folder again recently, hadn't done it for a long time, and got rid of 6.3 gigs worth of saves. Counting all these saves, I had roughly 14.5 gigs worth.That's practically the size of a completely new game. And if I didn't know how to reach the saves folder, I'd have never thought about cleaning the folder out because well... how large can something as simple as save files get?Given how much space you can eventually rack up in saves, it's rather sad that Stardrive doesn't include a easier way to get rid of them.

												how can ANYONE say this game is finished? I'm just gonna give you a quick example - planet Revoran, or whatever it's called. There is a little bit of interaction with this planet which was said to be developed into a ""quest"" in the future. There also were promises of other random events like the Revoran quest. Where is it? Zero says the game is finished, starts making another game, while not even completing all the stuff that HE SAID will be there.I was a big fan of Stardrive, and an active community member. I actually spent much more time on SD forums than playing the game itself. I was just waiting for it to get more features, so every scenario I play wouldn't slip into repetitive slapping of stupid AI. And the AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												The developer's a lying sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥ which I suppose has never been entirely uncommon in the game industry. Unfortunately, it's not like the days of old where a game like Big Rigs would simply cause an entire company to go under, and hopefully many of those people went on to work on real games, or committed suicide. No, this is the glorious age of crowdfunding, where ♥♥♥♥nuggets like the guy who made this game can tell you that a feature will be included, then not only fail to do so, but obtain enough support to create a second version of the game. Not even a sequel. A second version of the game that will be sold at full retail price.So what happens if you own this version of the game? You get like, a 20% discount on the new one. That way, if you're actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to buy it, you can have two different versions of the same game in your Steam library: one unfinished, the other with the promised features for the first(maybe; I wouldn't hold my breath). It's like if every patch for every game were released as a separate version of a game and you had to pay for all of them. There isn't even an entire company behind this game. It's just like one dude. Jesus. Let it go under so he'll go back to accounting or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he did before he became a professional thief.			"

												Unifnished, buggy mess.  Abandoned by developer while still incomplete, whom then had the gall to go and make a sequel with the same name.  That anyone would trust this person again is a testament to gullibility of some people.Said developer's attitute towards criticism has been, shall we say, a tad immature.  Nowhere near the J.C.Smith (Repopulation) levels of childish temper-tantrum throwing, but still kind of embarrassing.If you like the sequel, that's fine, but in such a case please do yourself a favor and don't try to find out what the original was like.  It's an ugly skelleton in a closet, to be sure.			"

												I's a 4x made as a real time strategy game. Although you can pause and set the speed to 4x normal (although it would be nice if it could go even faster).The UI stinks. You can't control planetary production or spies as a whole, in groups, auto-repeating, etc. It becomes very grindy just setting up production clicking to add, next planet, click to add, next planet, etc. There's way too much of that crap.The game crashes in longer games. The game doesn't handle too many ships very well. It should really have a unit cap or something but it doesn't and so you can build too many units and mess up your gameplay.There's no multiplayer.The AI interaction sucks. There's not much you can get the AI to do. You can't really coordinate anything with them. It is a shame since 4x games are fun to play cat and mouse with the npcs and pit them at war with each other. Also when you get someone to join your alliance they become part of your race or whatever and they vanish out of existence and you just control all of their units. This also reduces the amount of AI interaction because everyone either joins with someone you don't like or with you and then it's just a 1 v 1. There's a lot of other reasons why this game fails. I have to admit...it is a great genre and the real time space fights especially since you get to custom build them (although it's not as good as it could be but that's another issue) are really fun to watch...but in the end, there are just a waterfall of shortcomings that make this game something nobody will remember.Get it if it is super cheap like a few bucks and you like 4x and RTS. There aren't many RTS crossed with 4X so it's still nice to play for a bit.  "

												developer abaondoned this to anounce stardrive 2 without ever finishing many of the in game functions and content. my system could start the game, but many of my friends could not even get it to start. their posts in the dev forums went as problem solved. there is a huge memory problem that causes a crash even on my system after a couple hours of play. many crybaby ideas in forums turned most of the game content into nurfs instead of real balancing. the playable races only a few had full ship trees while the rest were place holders. developer money grab attitude has given me the policy to not support indie projects. rather have a company take control of the project and hold people accountable for my dollars.all that out of the way the game even in its unfished form was extremely fun. if you can actually get it to run and play up to the 4 hour limit on single game then stardrive is gonna be a good time. ship customization is unparalleled. and if you can get over the fact that the other races are not and will not ever be finished then who cares. if you can look pass numerous dead ends in the games ui or story function because this project was abandoned for stardrive 2... then you gonna have a good time. for 30 bucks i wouldnt do it theres other fun out there for that kind of money. if it goes on sale id say pick it up. steams good like that.i ultimately would not recommend supporting a game that gets abandoned for a sequel. if track records go this way then i would lookout for anything in the future with names attached to it from members of this project. early access never again.

												This game showed promise. It really could have been a fantastic game, yet the problems with the final product force me to not recommend it.Why?A game match cannot be completed reasonably. Towards the end game there are huge framerate issues/lag that literally bring all ship movement to a near halt . Lots of good gameplay aspects, unfortunately the game is unfinished. Quests are incomplete, ship models are not implemented for some races(The wolf race), and the developer has no intention of finishing/fixing it. What boggles my mind is the developers decision to make a sequel. How could anyone reasonably expect the sequel to be any more of a complete product than this ?I cannot reccomend this game as it was personally dissapointing for me, the developer is incompetent/Shady ,and this is not a finished product.Don't waste your money.

												I played this promising game when it was still on Early Access. At the time, it was a very good looking EA full of potential. Artwork was pretty awesome and in the line of Master of Orion and the 4X real-time game concept was pretty interesting (MOO meets Sins of a Solar Empire?). Ship customisation was nearly as in-depth as Galactic Empires V (less techs/weapons, but firing angles matter) and loads of good ideas were there in the making. UI was a bit awkward, but still functional once you had a grip on it and it did not seem impossible to improve.Nearly 3 years later I decided to see how it evolved. Well, it did not. At all.I read the negative reviews and I understood why. The dev went to make the sequel Stardrive 2 instead of delivering a good product. Apparently, that sequel is even more ambitious (yet reuse most of the Artwork) but also even more flawed, unpolished and unfinished). Basically he repeated the same pattern.It is very sad this Zerosum had 2 golden chickens in his hands and instead of collecting eggs over decades, he chose to break their necks and eat them immediately. That is pretty unwise in my opinion, but whatever floats his spaceship... still, I didn't buy Stardrive 2 and may never do.			"

												Had a Fun time with this game in early access, but the game was never finished. the developer never got around to putting all the features he promised in, now you cant really play it without mods.I will say the ship design and combat is amazing. but designing a ship takes forever, and sometimes you dont even get to make the biggest baddest ships available, becuase the AI got them first and decides your weak enough to just be rolled over. So the diplomacy doesnt work, AI's that want to be friends are weak like you, and others that cvan help with fight for awhile, then sue for peace when things get rough. All in all, not worth my 50 bucks to get into early access with. Definitely not worth a 33% dicount on the next game, oh yeah the reason this game isnt finished is cause he went onto the next game. I had faith in you Zero, but your let me down. I wish you luck tho, you had a great idea here. too bad it wont get finished.			"

												(6/10) (Turn based 4x fans)(8/10) (Real time strategy fans)Could have been an amazing turn based game, instead the dive into real time gameplay had some innovation potential but overall served to just bring the overall game down for me, removing the thoughtful nature of play that I am after with 4x games.  Instead of carefully planning each turn and building each world, you are constantly under the gun to move as fast as possible and blaze through reflexively.  Its a shame because otherwise the style and production of the game is quite high and would have more than carried it for me for a long while. (Admittedly, I really do not like RTS play to begin with, and my main score reflects coming into the game expecting it to have been a turn based 4x title along genre norms.  The second score applies for people who do prefer the more highly energetic RTS style gameplay over turn based strategy)			"

												After 140+ hours. I would say: not recommended. While the combat is addictive (building ships and watching them fight in real time) there are just too many bugs/neglects on the developer's part.it has been 9 months, and instead of polishing/fixing the glaring problems, the developer decided ran off to make a sequel instead (read their forums about it)All in all, it does not live up to the dev's promises and comparisons made to galactic civilization or master of orion back in feburary.  it might be worth it if its a steam sale under 5 dollars.Edit: make no mistake, the combat is fun. its just not what was advertised. (I would laugh if the description in steam store page gets trimmed down even more to just: ""stardrive is a spaceship combat simulator""... but at that point, I would recommend it since the product is what was advertised).May 29th update:Buy Distant World instead:The only thing that DW didnt do better is the ship design part, Stardrive still takes 1st in that, but everything else. *thumbs down*June 9th 2015 update:Edit 2: the black box mod fixes alot of the complaints.... but to let the community fix the games problem is a bit, disappointing.*and atleast distant world's devs still updating their game.Also, while Stardrive is a bit of a let down. its still cool as a demonstration of how fun ship design and combat can be done.

												I'm a pretty big fan of space games in general, and the idea of StarDrive caught my attention. Wow, a real-time 4X game? Sounds great!...It's terrible!I don't like to have to say this about a game that I put money into, but it has to be said for the good of humanity / the steam community. But why such a harsh approach?1. The interface lacks any polish. It's bad, everything is hard to manage. You will feel the pain once you are 10 minutes into the match as it becomes impossible to manage anything. There is no good notification system and you will probably neglect something important for a good 5 minutes of the game.2. The game isn't finished. Yep, it's broken. There are many bugs left in the game and it is NOT feature complete as it says on the steam page. Yes the game is playable, that does not mean it's done. Many of the features the developer promised never made it into the game, and he is making no effort to fix any of the issues the community has presented. Which brings me to my next point.3. The developer has abandoned the game. He has ditched the project and is now working on StarDrive 2, which is basically StarDrive 1 but actually polished. The developer has even gone to the extent to delete all threads which criticize the game. So now everything on the community page looks positive and isn't showing the truth about the game. Luckily he can't delete steam reviews, so I have one last hope to convince you the reader to save your money for a better game.4. The game is just over-priced! I mean really. There are so many better games for half the price or even less. It's not even worth the money. Please buy a real game. The developer himself said this was his 'experiment'.			"

It has one of the worst interfaces I've seen in a strategy game which at the very offset of a new game, ruins the entire experience.  Even the tutorial videos aren't done very well as the music eventually overtakes the speaker!  The entire project seems more like an abandonded Frankenstein than a thought-out game.  Additionally, taking a quick tour of the forums tells that the developer is already working on a sequel!?  My advice to the developer is to hire someone who is good with interfaces and the other various front-end facing pieces of the project.  If you're too proud to do that then at least try to play your own game from the perspective of a new player so that you can maybe not make the same mistakes on the next one... :/			"

What happened was progressed slowed, and now the developer has moved on to the sequel while the original is still a very broken game.  There are ""quests"" that don't work, the game is unbalanced, and good luck finishing a game that has a larger map than medium.  I am so disappointed because this game was everything I ever wanted in a space 4x.  I loved how you could build your ships and make them as fast or as tough as you wanted them to be, but the game was never finished.

I have played it numerous times, attacked the game in different angles each time, being different races, building my ships differently each time. But the thing is there  have been no updates, no work shop allowance to make it more customizable, not even DLC, not even a shred of a furthering of the game to make it a step above the other games that are of the same ilk. I hate that  I am marking it as a negative review, but my love for this game wore out with the fact that it has been the same game wit nothing added to it since I bought it. With this game type there need to be some kind of additions or updates to make it worthwhile to play.

												Although my favourite genre is Space 4X I only played Stardrive recently despite tracking the game throughout.Compared to games such as Distant Worlds Universe I did not find Stardrive immersive at all as it was very uneventful with a limited storyline.  The AI was weak and it very quickly became an AI curbstomp in my first game while still learning the mechanics.  The game is strategically shallow.  There is an obvious need to spam troops.  A good technology tree is essential and this game was distinctly lacking in that respect.  The ground invasion mechanic is very simplistic.The ship design is cool.  The combat is okay but I vastly prefer Sins of a Solar Empire.  I didn't really notice any of the bugs and missing features that some people go on about but then for $8 my expectations were low.The Developer takes an extremely hard line to Moderation which is often unfair and unreasonable.  I've recently seen a poster banned and all his posts deleted despite the fact not a single forum rule was broken.  Some of my posts have also been deleted despite also never breaking a forum rule.  Unfortunately the Developer is stuck in the habit of shooting himself in the foot with respect to the future of his own community. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SDVC/discussions/0/I really don't understand why some consider the game groundbreaking. I would rate Distant Worlds Universe, Endless Space, Galactic Civilisation 2 and Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion all as significantly better games, each in their own way.  You can see the potential but a lot is unrealised.  There are patches but they are very slow and limited compared to games like Distant Worlds Universe.There is hope with the Stardrive Extended Mod and perhaps there will be a vastly improved effort with Stardrive 2.   It's possible I could really get into them so I'll stay involved.Post Review Note: Along with others I have now been banned and all my posts deleted despite breaking no forum rules. Be warned.			"

												Was a promising game, got it cheap so I didn't care, but I advertised it with some friends and I feel bad right now. I virtually shelved it in my library and waited patiently for good updates to come but they never did, and the game was released unfinished, development was stopped and the dev got away with all the money. Now he's making a 'sequel' which I know I won't be buying unless the recommendation ratings are 90% and above, which is unlikely. A lot of promised features are not present, even some existing features are not fully completed. The game runs bad on my rig after a long session. Visuals are good, but that's about it. Browsing the forums and checking it out again recently, it seems that modders are still trying to make the game work, which is nice, but I still wouldn't recommend it to newcomers.Thank god I still have GalCiv 2 and GalCiv 3 soonI don't blame the Early Access model, it's there for games like Kerbal Space Program, in which I would lose approx. 1000 hours of fun if it the model hadn't existed. For games like Minecraft, Starbound, Arma 3, GalCiv 3, etcIn the future I would be more careful about buying early access games unless the ratings are 90% Positive and above, and the game is already feature complete, Thanks Enhanced Steam for that extra data! ratings right now are 48% positive 52% negative, bad.

												This game is one of those without fully realized potential. I haven't even been able to load the game in months, it just crashes.When it works the game plays beautifully and it's everything I wanted a space brawler to be. But persistent problems with stupid AI, rampant memory leaks, random crashes, and other bugs make this game nearly unplayable without community mods. Unfortunately installing the best community mods often introduces yet more crashes.I would not recommend buying this game, nor will I ever support this developer. As soon as he had his money he stopped what little patching he did and ran off to develop his next game. I get that it's exciting to work on new projects, but it's also important to keep the loyalty of your original fan base.			"

												Rating: 1/10 -- ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆Valve: Please change recommendation/review system to use a 10 point star system. Much more accurate than ""yes/no"".This isn't a game, it's a headache.  It's basically the same exact thing as Star Ruler, only less NPC factions, and you get to somewhat customize your horribly designed ships that aren't even remotely symetrical half the time.  5 hours of playing and I barely managed to get very far at all, and the planet building sucks.  It's just not worth the 75% off that I paid.  I wouldn't buy this for any less than 90% off.  Seriousy, just wow.  I'm gonna go find something different for a while.  This game gave me a headache with no enjoyment.  I'll re-write this review if I need to after trying the game a few more times at a later date.			"

												Hello fellow gamers.When i first saw Stardrive i thought that this will be very cool, a little different 4X game.At the very first glance we got everything:- Sci Fi theme- Space battles- Development of our Empire- Ship designThe formula for most 4X games is simple. We explore, expand, exploit and exterminate. Easy right? Most 4X games are turn based- but not a Stardrive. It is real time.When i firstly heard of it i thought ""cool! it will have more dynamics""Boy.... i was so wrong.StarDrive is semi finished game.I know- hundreds of gamers wrote it in their reviews. But i don't mean bugs, no update for.... ever.I meen there are only few techs, some about 5-7 buildings to go on planets, few ships.And thats not all!The galactic is very empty space- sure there are some pirates and aliens but this is about it.Nothing more.So what we really get from buying this game?Pretty decent ship design tool.O! and the treading cards.....Well music is nice but there is no additional soundtrack so we actually have to play this game to listen to it......And the dynamic of play i was thinking about?Nope. This game is slower than most of the turn baset games.So....Plus:+ very good alien graphics+ space looks nice+ music+ ship designer+ space battles are niceMinus:- well you bought a demo of beta version of game- bugs- no joy- slooooooooowwwwwww and boring- where is content  ????I'm big fan of SciFi and i adore 4X genre and i have to say:Don't buy it. Please. DON'T "

												This game tried so hard to be MoO2. It feels like the developers tried just a little too hard to differentiate it. ""What if we did MoO2 but real time? TOTALLY AWESOME, AMIRITE?""  The most glaring problem is that the sense of time scale is normalized. Ships fight in the same time that planets are colonized. I can understand possibly having ship TRAVEL and colonization on the same scale, but combat is vastly, vastly faster.  However, it's still on the same time scale.The user interface is abysmal. Tooltips aren't really tips. The user icons aren't extremely desciptive, but can be memorized. It's not explained what some of the icons are. It took a few google searches to figure out that the swirlies next to system or planet names means there's an exploration anomaly. Nothing in the game indicated this. It was my third play attempt that I figured this out.  The tooltip time to show is very long, so I'm waiting 15~30s to figure out what that button does.Ship design is nice, but not my cup of tea. I have no idea what gun is better than another.  There are too many variables to balance.This game is definitely not for me. Looking for something that's difficult to learn and master? Perhaps this is for you. To me, this is a nice beta product. Needs s-loads of polish.			"

The tech tree is microscopic, the game features are the same: there is no way to mothball ships, you cannot set rally points (etc), and there is no endgame-oh-so-awesome technology (Comparison: ""Space Empires 5"" have Dyson Spheres). Giving orders to ships is easy, but the same can be said about ""Star Ruler"" which is a better, but less pretty buy. "

												DO NOT PAY FOR THISThis game was abandoned in beta, and never actually reached completion. The AI is both overpowered and idiotic beyond comprehension, and war with the AI drags on. The AI also only uses missle and mass driver weapons, likely due to lack of designs.......The tech trees are universal, uniform, and boring. As is the planetary infrastructure. So you effectively get not 8 different species but one species. It is boring and monotomous.The only redeeming qualities are the ship design and combat engines, but those are still limited by technoloogy. The AI don't usually use anything larger than cruisers nor do they use shields or energy weapons extensively. So you get good energy weapons, shield, and a cruiser hull, and you become the overlord of the galaxy......bit boring, frankly...And the developer had the gall/nerve to go on and make a sequel, when the original wasn't finished...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

												Despite it initially having amazing potential to be a near-flawless modern equivalent of Moo2 (Master of Orion 2 - the quintessential 4x strategy game from the 90s), the developer has effectively ceased meaningful work on this project.I, like many Steam members, purchased this game during the so-called ""beta"" stage with the intention of ultimately playing the game in a fully-functional completed state. Unfortunately, this will never happen as the developer (a guy going by the name of ""Zero"") simply proclaimed the same beta-level product as ""final"" and proceeded to publicly state that any future progress will be solely at his own personal ""whims"".At the time of this writing (10/10/13), the game is known to be *extremely* buggy with large swaths of functionality crippled or non-existant. Past promises of additional features go unfullfilled (multiplayer, etc.). Further, anyone with the gall to complain about the situation (however civil they may be) on the developer or Steam forums is promptly banned and any associated content is deleted (I know this because I have similarly been banned from the StarDrive Steam forums). NOTE: My specific offense... The action that immediately prompted my banning... was that I noticed that a particular thread which was critical of StarDrive was deleted and so I asked why. I suspect that the aggressive action being taken against anyone who complains is a result of the game currently being on-sale, advertised on the Steam main page as a ""daily deal"" (Zero surely wouldn't want customers' 100% valid concerns & complaints to negatively affect sales of this very dead project).Check the StarDrive forums on Steam for yourself and you will certainly come across content from angry customers who (rightly) feel cheated - that is, if you get to it before said posts are deleted. As I write this, StarDrive is being advertised & sold on Steam's front page. I sincerely pity anyone unfortunate enough to purchase this steaming pile only to inevitably find out how they've been robbed.What's most offensive (aside from the literal theft which is being perpetrated - that is, the game being advertised as beyond beta and fully functional), is the *EXTREME* arrogance displayed by the developer. Observe a snippet from a forum post on the official StarDrive website (before it was deleted):""Zero: I'll be as clear as I can be... I think StarDrive vanilla is a fine game. I'm happy with it. I'll be patching it here and there as my whims take me. If you feel cheated by StarDrive, kindly scroll up to the upper right portion of your browser screen and click the ""Logout"" button. I don't want to hear it.""There you have it, directly from the horse's (Zero's) mouth. The game, in its currently crippled and bug-riddled state will only be worked on if Zero's ""whims"" allow. Further, if you purchase the game only to find out that it's unplayable in many ways, don't bother complaining because he absolutely does not care (after all, he already has your money).Would *you* knowingly purchase something from a person or company which displays such a low opinion of the customer's (absolutely valid) concerns? I didn't think so. Neither would I. Do not support this developer. Such behavior in business should absolutely not be rewarded.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Update (10/11/13): Immediately following the end of the StarDrive front-page sale on Steam, I found myself no longer banned on the forums. While I guess it's a ""good"" thing that I'm no longer banned, it speaks quite loudly for the theory that the recent aggressive ban-hammer usage was indeed due to the developer not wanting negative forum posts to affect sales (regardless of their validity). In addition, the forums are back to being predominantly full of complaints where as yesterday such threads were being deleted as fast as they could be posted.			"

Developer (Zero) made several promises for the game, raked all the $$$, abandoned this game and started to work on second version of this game. Very poor updates from developer as they abandoned the game before fixing minor and major issues. Fans of 4x might consider Endless Space or Sins of Solar Empire. Steam does offer very good collection of other 4x games from far better developers. StarDrive is not worth my time or money. StarDrive worst 4x Game in Steam Inventory.Hopefully their Second Game does not suffer from same issues and broken promises.Not Recommended!			"

												Do not waste your money on this game. The devs PROMISED us they weren't going to abandon this game, and they proved it by focusing their energy into STARDRIVE 2. That's right, they made a sequel to a game they haven't even finished yet. To say this game is in beta is an overstatement. It still feels like it is in alpha. Waste of cash, and I'll not be buying anything else from this company ever again.This game, and it's complete failure, is what happens when you claim that you're going to impliment multiplayer into a game while using a game engine that was never designed to have a multiplayer element. Instead of fixing this by putting a new game engine into this game, they decided to create a completely new game to make twice as much money.			"

												It pains me to admit but I don't recommend this game.I'm coming up 100 played on this game and I will probably play more as personally I enjoy playing StarDrive but I can not in good conscience recommend buy this title to even my vile enemies. Unless its on Sale, then it may be worth it if you enjoy this type of game. If I we're you however, right now considering buy StarDrive, I would spend my money of Galactic Civilation 3. It's the same game has this, in fact I would say this game is a bad copy of Gal Civ 2 which is a 'banging' game, although not as graphically nice as StarDrive gameplay is so much better. So if you can afford it Gal Civ 3. if you want to save money gal civ 2. Anything but StarDrive.Right, so I've had a rant but objectively what wrong with the game. Weirdly not alot. It crashes for time to time normally because I'm tabbing out but autosaves stops that from been a big issue, and few minute roll back max is not really anything to get worked up over. The AI is bad, there are times that it seems slow and dumb, not even able to get off the starting planet. Other time as soon as they make contact they declare war and within 5 mins I have two invasion fleets heading to two different systems, this with the first 20mins of the game. I suppose you could agrue a degree of dynamic realism with the AI but it doesn't feel like that it just seems break. Hypo active somethings and hyper active other times never a good balance. The Gameplay is very long but that not really a fault of the game, more the genre. The tech tree is a bit bland as it's a standard tech tree discuss what race you play has.In final conclusion; I enjoy playing the game, it has some nice features to it and a good about of variety when it come to ship design and weapons. However the game feels unfinished whenever I play Stardrive I have fun but i'm not satified and its for that reason I can't recommend it. "

												Well, I bought StarDrive while it was still in Beta and promised a paradise of gameplay. I love simulation games especially if they provide a scenery like StarDrive: The space. Bought the beta, played the beta, loved the beta. I got about 20 hrs gameplay of which about 18 are from the beta. It's not much I know but after 18 hrs of beta it got kinda boring and was too much frickling and tuning of the fleets. I hoped I get a Spacesimulation where you can prosper by trade, being completly neutral and just prosper. I was totally wrong:Beta provided the player with one gamemode: Sandbox   -  It's a beta, I can live with that.Release versions increased the number of gamemodes by 0! - Still Sandbox   (You have to massacre all AI's to end the game, even those you established a peace treaty with)Beta provided animated Cutscenes   -   Release doesn't even show me a picture anymore (There are actually Issues with the animation but I'd love to get at least a nice Picture of the race I'm talking to. For my eyes sake...)I could go on and on but to summarize:beta - pretty good for a betarelease - holy shmoly! Did the game degenerate into ""Pre-release alpha somewhat not existent development state""?It's very sad StarDrive evolved in something I would call a Beta-Heist. Throw a good beta (I really aprreciate the effort of the developer), cash in and relax. And the update released got a timespan of about: ""What? What game is updating? StarDrive? Whats that?"". Actually happened to me last update and happened to me when I missclicked the game in Steam. That's the reason why I'm writing this review now: played it, got bored after 20 minutes ingame.For me it's a game I will play time to time (I think 20 minutes max) and keep it as a reminder: Never trust a pre-release.Until the game is fixed and the developers find their love to the game they developed: I do NOT and will NOT recommend this game. Period.			"

												This game had potential. The developer however left for greener pastures and abandoned the game. The game is fun untill you get really big fleets of ships engaging each other. The game will slow down to a crawl with framerates between 4 and 20 on the most powerful systems. Avoid at all costs.			"

												Do not buy Stardrive. This game is an unfinished product. It is, at best, “glitchy”. It's an “early access” with no chance of being fixed. Apparently, for reasons beyond the developer, he isn't allowed to work on the engine of the game any more, or something.This is rather sad because the game needs optimization, badly. The controls and interface of the game aren't adequate. It makes an obtuse game with a steep learning curve even more convoluted. Basic RTS controls, like finding idle workers or rally points aren't implemented. At least one technology in the science tree doesn't work as described. Ships, especially freighters, lack a good path-finding, making them delay deliveries of vital goods, but it happens to offensive fleets too. Trading technologies requires you look up, -or know the cost by heart-, of everything in the science tree or risk the ire of the IA. The planet managing screen lacks clarity and the possibility for quick changes. The ship building interface refuses to show critical information, like the rate of fire, the global ammunition consumption per second or the global energy consumption. While it can be nice to figure out this puzzle, you have to recalculate everything as soon as you improve your design with new technologies. Having to look up the wiki for vital weapon-data is also unforgivable for a game that requires such precision in its main mechanic from the player. Personalising larger ship becomes a tedious chore.Speaking of ship building, while it is nice to modify them depending on your style, it doesn't take into account how the game works as a whole. The IA isn't a big threat later on in the game as much as it is in the beginning, and that can be circumvented as soon as you realise what variable the computer uses for it's moves: the size of your fleet. Just build a big fleet, and you've won. You don't even need to research, or spend hours personalising cruisers. In the end, it is completely pointless, because you will already be winning by the time you get to bigger spacecrafts, making their puzzle-like personalisation moot and time wasting.Worse, this system isn't as open as it pretends to be: you cannot build viable ships if you deviate from a certain type of fighter. If you are thinking of building a huge flying fortresses which shoots at everything in all directions, think again: one ship attacks one ship. Sure, the area of effect damage might hit others too, but that's leaving it up to chance, or worse, the IA. The attacks your ships employ are always the same: charge! There is an option to turn on a “broadside” tactic but it doesn't work according to the forums. When you get right down to it, the changes you make to your ships are quantitative, not qualitative. You decide the weapons and the defences, and how much of each, and then try to figure out the best way to power the whole thing and keep sufficient ammunition. In essence, this more open system is just more complex than the one in Endless Space, replacing the straightforwardness of it with inconvenient and pointless creation tools. Also, Endless Space has more tactics during the combat phases, with three different phases, defining tactics for each, heroes and hero abilities. In Endless Space, the ships are not just flying towards each other like a Middle Age jousting competition.It's a shame since Stardrive sounds good on paper. A better IA and path-finding across the board would have gone a long way. An IA that changes tactics depending on difficulty, rather than giving it a boring bonus to resources to compensate for it's inadequacies, would also give a more organic and challenging experience. Being able to annexe other civilizations peacefully by building a federation is great but removes diversity from the game world, by having the player taking control over the planets and fleets of the ally, making end game seem even more without challenge when you suddenly control half the map. Finally, on a positive note, the aesthetic of the game, the design of the races and the ships, are very pleasing and enjoyable even thought there are basically references to other media (like the Wing Commander series, the mythos of Cthulhu, the Asari from Mass Effect, etc.). The mixture of all the references kind of creates its own style. The rest of the game though needed a lot more polish.			"

												I have played many 4X games, all of Master of Orion series, Endless Space and few others, so StarDrive was a must test. I liked the videos and screenshots, but actually playing it did not deliver. 15 minutes was all i could stand. The controls and UI are simply horrible. Buttons are small and spread wide across the screen borders. Font is plain and tiny, you can't scale them up. All the info is big masses of this tiny text, from which you need to gather information of what's happening, what means what. At the point i was simply trying to move camera around the galaxy, i quickly noted the developer hasn't learned anything about mouse controls from other games. Most of the general mouse functionality, such as simply dragging would have made it much better. Does he expect me to use arrow keys to navigate the map? But it was time to quit game before actually seeing any space combat, shame.			"

												A lot of broken development promises during beta, a serious lack of depth for a 4X such as pathetically stunted tech trees and gimmicky planetary micro-management, and lacking any charm outside of faction comm screens (Which, I must say, are at least pretty) make this a very deflated experience. Maybe some day the developer will actually do something interesting with the potential of ideas, but with reports of game breaking bugs in launch, it's unlikely. The most fun you may have is with the modular ship design system, but that's it. Avoid.			"

												A good idea to revive Master of Orion 2. Bad execution. As a MOO2 fan (IMHO best galactic 4X game ever hands down) I purchased when it was on alpha, No big difference from alpha to release to be honest (or at least nothing I can see/feel): bugged (although playable), bad interface (not even a homogeneous way to close a damn panel...), bad gameplay (real-time? Just why...). I just love it when developers take early access money and go away with it.

												Do not buy this game expecting any 4x4 action within the first 15 or so hours. Painful to say the least. no tutorials worth a damn and the control scheme is out of the early 90's. My bad buy of the 2014 Jan sale and I'm really dissapointed, Such potential there but no flesh at all. It appeared when I bought this that it was early access but it now seems to be ""Full Release"" a few days after the steam sale. A real shame as this could have been my space total war. A decent blow by blow tutorial would probably help to ""fix"" the game for most. I am a 4x4 vet and still couldn't figure out why they made WSAD the ""ship control"" that you barely use instead of the ""map movement"" like any other 4x4 nowadays. This was suposedly a beta when I bought it but in the last few days has been registered complete. I would love to see this come good with a few simple additions to early gameplay (tutorial (that isn't just screen grabs) anyone). I won't be asking for a refund but I really do ask for a developer tutorial, and ask for the dev's to not rely on community love for them to do your job for you. Valve should also take note, one more game delivered as finished when still in alpha. Where's the QA?this isn't a hate message, I wan't this game to succeed but I also want it to be great, dev's, you now got the cash, finish the game please.			"

												I bought this game months ago and have played it after each patch release.  To date after 63 hours of play.... I still find it unplayable.   Those 63 hours compose many games that started off with promise but died out for one bug, balance issue, unfinished feature or another.  The core game shows great promise, but with debilitating bugs, and unfinshed content.I had been waiting to write a reveiw though as patches were still coming and I was holding out hope.  Now the developer anounced they are done with this game and are working on a sequel.  The sequel will include all the things promised in the original game, I only need to pay again...  They did promise a 33% discount to current stardrive owners but that just feels like I have to pay 66% more for the game I tried to buy the first time.So in summary BUYER beware of Stardrive and it's developer.

												(Feb 2015)The game did have a lot of potential and was fun to play while it lasted. End game crashing issues, end game becomes a resource hog, which making it impossible to finish and destroys any desire to finish the game. The game is also very unfinished and only some of the features promised.  Now the developer is making a second game. Which I will not be buying because if someone can not make good on his word with the first game, why would he do it for the second game. The second game may be better, but I bet he will employ many of the same tactics as he did with the first. Do not buy the second game if it goes early access, wait until the game comes out and is reviewed before making a purchase.(Oct 2016)Just to update anyone who may be interested in this game. As mentioned above, my verdict still stands. The game was completely abandoned and has many glary late game bugs that will give you an anuerysm just to want to complete it. I have also been following stardrive II. If you go to the forums and read reviews, the developer appears to be is treating the 2nd game as the first. The only added difference is now there is DLC, not borthering to fix the bugs already in the game, and is more concerned about earning money then improving and making a worthwhile 4x game that is fun to play and has great depth. There are many other options to choose from to have a good 4x experience. A great example would be stellaris, which is more of a grand strategy in space.			"

												Sadly, this game seems as if it will remain an unfinished product forever.  The developer is already working on its sequel, and it becomes apparent over time that Stardrive was a prototype that many of us paid for.  Still, with any luck, the sequel will deliver on the game's promise.			"

												Not a bad concept as this game is quite different than traditional 4x games, but honestly this game just feels too ""small"" to be anything other than a bargin bin, $5 time waster.  Here's why:1) You can discover the entire galaxy with literally your first scout ship with almost no impunity.  No need to develop a drive or anything.  2) You can seemingly spend your time waiting on research building way points that connect virtually everywhere (seemingly no drawbacks or economic penalty for doing this).3) Economy is ENTIRELY population based.  Expanding your empire's economy relies on you NOT building any actual buildings (at least early).  Maintenance costs on buildings that are designed to increase food, defenses, or production ALL drain more out of your income than actual ships, so it's better to just colonize and send colonists and food to the planets for seemingly forever till they have enough people to grow.  Just a bizarre concept that doesn't feel rational to me, there really is no option to have a small, but robust empire. It's zerg expansion or die.  4) Conquering enemies, likewise, involves nothing more than zerg tactics (i.e. spamming smallers missle ships and troops).  All you have to do is land more troops on the planet than the enemy has and it's soon yours, you can actaully do that by flying right past their defense fleet and zerg landing while a small number of attacks ships keeps their fleet busy.  Very silly strat but works easily.5) Diplomacy is haywire. People either love you to death regardless of your actions or they want to murder you out right.  Then they simply want to join with you or your enemy, effectively taking the diversity out of the galaxy and matching one big against another big.  Really saps the interest in the game.  6) Ship design is convoluted and seemingly pointless.  You don't know what you need to put and where and there is no manual whatsoever to figure it out.  Simply putting a power source on a ship isn't enough, you need to add wiring that connects the guns or the shields or the bridge to that power source....at the expense of things like armor.  It's like a really terrible game of minesweep to be honest and I like complexity in games, I play 4x games and Paradox games like EU, CK2, and Hearts of Iron....but this ship design leaves me baffled.All in all, this just feels like a very incomplete game that could have been much better if things like the economy and diplomacy had been fleshed out.  The battle system is fun to an extent, but it boils down to zerg tactics.  Bring enough cheap to produce missle frigates and focus fire for the win, leave the tactics at home.  I can't recommend this game.			"

												My initial reaction to seeing this game was that I thought it looked like a modern ""starships unlimited""(an old favorite of the genre of mine), so I thought I would buy it based on that merit........and so far I am very much regretting it, sure the game has some improvements over SU such as the variables that one can adjust for how effective a civilization is at a particular task, or extreme ship customizability... However the controls and tutorial system are completly counter intuitive. My middle finger is tingling from all the mouse wheel usage I've been using... A few suggestions for the devs*simplify the zoom levels*When you put a tutorial on the frontpage, make sure that it is at least as sophisticated as one you would find in a flash game, I paid for this game, it should be held to a higher standard than a free flash game .and those are merely my issues that I care to put into words at the moment, my middle finger wants some rest.Overall, it wasn't worth the price I paid.... and I bought it during a flash sale, DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE, it is not worth full price currently			"

												Why is this game unfinished and having a sequel released and still charging 29.99? Is the developer a thief? Drop the price of your mistake down to atleast 9.99 to the value its worth so that anyone who reads the reviews and realizes they are getting ripped off they spend the 2.00 its worth on a sale. I think you owe your community Zero, i think with star drive 2 you should put some incentive to star drive 1 owners as an apology. First off your an alpha designer if you look around steam most quality alphas only charge 19.99 for thier games you should charge that for newcomers and half for people who own star drive 1. An apology to us for wasting our money on lies and half truth broken promisis. The community can kill your future in gaming as a company. You Should also Finish and live up to any promisis you make for star drive 2. because i can assure you if you realease star drive 2 the way you did star drive 1 you might end up with a class action lawsuit. So id be weary of the thieving style development... That being said stardrive 1 had massive potential till the dev dropped support and didnt complete the game as was stated. This review is harsh but true, i dont like backing companies that lie and cheat, I back companies so no matter thier success they can make the best game they can. Like sword of the stars 2 they fell through but a year later made the game they promised and i was glad to support them. It was worth every penny.

												Here we are, months after purchase and hours into the game.So much potential, squandered, wasted.ZeroSum games was basically a one-man studio, with what seemed like a desire to bring back a great space-4X in the vein of games like Masters of Orion.  Oh, the disappointment.It started great.  Bought this on early access, it had some problems, a couple major ones in fact, but it was close enough that you could see the point of it all, even then, and could see the few hops and leaps it'd take to get the foundations in place and really start cranking out an awesome game.Instead, what we got were sweet nothings and empty promises from ZeroSum, tales of how we would get X Y and Z features or fixes.  Trade is still broken, warping still doesn't work properly, warp nodes and defensive emplacements are still prohibitively expensive, the AI is still crap and consistently allows itself to get rolled over in stupid and meaningless ways, often outright killing themselves due to what should be only one or two MINOR circumstances regarding their worlds and infrastructure...  No balance, no design, no polish, the damn game isn't even finished.ZeroSum took a game, created a clear image, started tapping serious potential...  And then turned around and flipped their entire customer-base for this game the bird.  Zero literally said he would fix the problems and get the game working...  After saying this, he never even got around to the first major gameplay problem, the broken Freighters...  And then announced StarDrive 2.Do not buy this game, do not support ZeroSum games, do not support Iceberg Interactive until they drop ZeroSum, because at the very least, ZeroSum Games is nothing more than a shady, cash-grab studio who does not deserve to be called a Games Developer, and Iceberg deserves to same insults and utter lack of respect for as long as they intend on keeping such a disingenuous, malicious individual/studio under their umbrella.StarDrive is a game to AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

												Would recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing this game to bypass the official forums as they are seriously biased to deleting anything relating to major complaints about the game. Click on the find community groups and take a look at stardrive continued. I bought the game code off Amazon after the supposed ""release"" date. I assumed I was getting a completed game. Wrong. Not in any way worth 29.99. The game, as IGN reviewed it, feels like ""a big black hole"". A game or two and you'll realize all games feel the same. I know there are supporters of this game, but all the negative reviews kind of speak for themselves. Hey, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck.........I have no need to notate the issues with the game because everything is pretty much well documented in previous posts. Buy if you want, or don't. Matters not to me. Just trying to help people save money. I happened to call Amazon right before Zero had all the negative threads deleted and asked them to look at the forums. I got a refund of my 29.99 because of it. Now that I've finally posted a thumbs down I wash my hands of anything from this developer.			"

Rather than fix up those outstanding issues, the developer went ahead and developed a second game instead of finishing this game.

												The game is unfinished, I've crashed the game multiple times through normal play. There is something fun about designing space ships and seeing how well your designs work. The fleet building mechanic is neat and something I've not seen before. The game only handles one mod at a time, it is up to you or the modders to compile mods together.Diplomacy is fairly shallow.I'd wait for the sequal or snag this on the cheap to see if it is interesting.

												Don't buy this - the main quest is bugged (among other bugs), and the developer abandoned the project before adding any game modes other than the initial sandbox mode.It's a shame - it was a cool idea, but it's unsupported, unfinished, and the developer obviously doesn't care. Ignore it.			"

												Game is unfinished, promised features are not implemented and game is abandoned in favor of an iPad version that has nothing in common but the name. Developer currently plans to port this game to a new engine and BILL EVERYONE AGAIN. You have read that right: if you own this mess right now, you will have to pay for a fixed version. So don't buy this now and wait for reviews on the ""next"" game that will be this mess on a new engine.			"

												Too crash-happy to be enjoyable, not a bad 4x game but as other have aid, this has been abandoned by it's developer and it just isn't finished. The tech tree is very lacklustre and the entire game could use more polish. There's nothing remarkable about it, other 4x games like SotS, Star Ruler and Star Empires V do this concept much more competently.			"

												A 4x game that was launched with a wonderful bug that results in the game grinding to a halt and crashing incessantly if you reach late game without playing in a very specific way. But hey, no problem, most reviewers never finish the game, so sales could still be made.And the solution? Abandon the first game and release a sequel.Do not support this developer. Not only are they incompetent, but they are dishonest and try to take advantage of consumers.			"

												Warning - this is longI found Stardrive ages ago and saw a lot of good things about it.  It was in alpha/beta though and Steam was nice enough to point me at the products webpage, because as handy as steam is they cant list all of a products features on their little webpage (I dont think it had the read more tabs at the time).  Looking at the developers product page and seeing youtube videos of what you are going to purchase is just good consumer behavior so that you know what you are purchasing.   It looked really interesting and offered things such as Moo2 like but RTS 4xMultiplayerCreate your own fleet designsSpecial Missions in which you assume control of an individual ship instead of a whole sideA sandbox mode with an engaging storyline.Neutral factions like remeneant and piratesA variety of random Galaxy events.Shortly after buying in the developer said he was temporarly removing multiplayer to work out the kinks. Of course the sandbox storymode wasnt finished yet but thats ok it was in beta and we saw how it was going to work with researching technologys and contacting a neutral planet and yadda yadda.  And watching the WTF is, along with other videos I knew what to expect with late game latency, so when people bashed on it I spoke up for it, telling people to give it time.  As a one person developer a 1-2 year wait for him to fix things up was acceptable.  Especialy for a game that had already been in development for something like 4 years.  But it was nearly done,  so we should hold on before making judgements.  I made guides, tried to help people out,and gave suggestions.  But the longer it went on the more sour it got.  A couple weeks out of its -short- Beta when we could no longer get refunds there was a 50% off sale.  A couple months after that we were told Multiplayer would never make it to the game and that maybe in a stardrive 2 we would get it.   Special missions were abandoned all together.  The Galaxy events were restricted to simple planatary shifts for fertility/richness.  The Remenent story-arc was removed (and then later reintroduced in a shoddy manner).  Some of the AI's were just left in a crippeled state.   And then afterall of that there was a Fertility/abundance nerf across all difficultes (that the AI ignores) that you cant disable... Why nerf fertility/abund in a single player game?  A -lot- of players got banned from the message boards for silly things and it was a pretty rage induceing time all around.  But thats ok I thought,  I decided to give him more time.  He said development would 'slow' while stardrive 2 was in development but we could expect improvements.  I decided to wait for SD2 to get finished before looking back and seeing what has changed.So this last week I gave it a try again.  And I have to say i am not very happy with it.  I enjoyed the game more during beta and after 'release' with the late game slowdown then I do now.  Sure some small bugs were fixed with fire arcs and its a little bit smoother.  But several AI's just sit there and let other AI's conquer them with out putting up a fight, several races just refuse diplomacy of any sort (usualy the ones that are conquering other ai's),  and the AI still cheats up the wazzoo building fleets it cant possibly support.  And overall it feels really bad fighting over a 4 population planet with a 1.2 fertility and 1.1 richness because thats the best there is out there.  In the end the game currently (may 2015) feels unfinished (even more so then during beta), and in need of a good AI patch, a balance patch, a few new galaxy option sliders to combat what was done post release, and maybe a gamemode paid DLC.  I'm gratefull for the 33% discount on SD2 for SD1 owners,  its a nice gesture.  And I really do hope SD2 turns out well, and can compete with other games in the turn based strat genre. But in the end this game also made me deicde to hold off on SD2 until its cheep as dirt.. because no matter how good it looks 'now'  it could be a lot worse in 6 months.   And thats just not something I ever really expected to say about a game.  ps- yes I know my spelling sucks. Hopefully it wasnt too bad.			"

												I do not recommend this game. Not because it is terrible as it is, but because I feel like I have been cheated on this one, and paying the dev of this game more money is supporting quitter.I was promised many improvements, patches and possibly multiplayer after launch. I was suspicious of multiplayer, which did not happen, but neither did the patches and improvements.This game outside of the starting menu screen is exactly the same as it is when I bought it when it was new to steam, now that it is ""released"". When I first time played it and I did succesful empire, my game crashed quite few times when I was too long on planet invasion screen or exited it improperly... is that bug still there? Yes. Back then I even went to trouble of taking the screen shot of the error message and posting it to Stardrive forums in good belief that it´d be fixed, and I went back to that old picture when it happened to me again 3 days ago, and YES! it was same error message, related to ground invasion screen, it is same bug! what a fool I am.And now the dev has ditched this game to make... Surprise surprise, Stardrive 2, with people that made Endless Space. Will I buy that game? Hell No! I will jump on board of Galciv 3 or planetary annihilation, they are most likely out at reasonable price (and reviewed so I know if I should buy them or not) when Stardrive 2 comes out or goes to alpha to beg for money to ""finish"" it.Dev of this game has lost his credibility to me. He pretty much cheated me 30€ which is ridiculous now that I think I could have bought two or three reasonably priced, well reviewed and recommended indie strategies.In the end, if you want decent single-player space RTS, buy this, but if you even little care what kind of business model or people your money is going to, please dont.Be responsible consumer.

The forums are HEAVILY moderated by The Doctor and the Dev lied SO much during this interview its amazing. Nothing he said was true. He promised multiplayer but deleted all references to that promise to save his own skin. I had bought the game during the alpha and its amazing how the Dev twisted his own words and promises to walk away with the money of so many people. If multiple people are saying this (Which they are) its not just someone being angry or trolling, its the truth. Stay away from this game and this developer. Support other trustworthy third parties who are making similar games or simply buy a finished product of this genre from a company with ethics and whom supports their customers unlike this unethical developer and his team of tyrannical forum moderators.

												I cannot say I would recommend this game, mainly because of the promises broken. Primarily the promise for multiplayer, Other than that area the game was a good spiritual successor to Masters of Orion 2, I won't lie and say it had amazing diplomacy, mainly because it didn't. But I loved the ability to design my ships and it did well on that, It does or did have a collision issue with ships ramming into your ship through armor and shilds and doing internal damage, but to be honest not doing a proper build of your ship is the end cause of the failure.  I would definitely not pay the full price, and I wouldn't belive anything this developer says at this point, but the game was fun by itself, would have been amazing if it actually had multiplayer as promised. Game devoper says he never promised anything like that however the kickstarter that funded the game said it was a feature in the game. Everything pointed that it would have multiplayer but sadly he has said its not going to happen. Its true part of the issue comes from the engine losing support but that is not our fault or responsibility and version two is turn based. If i wanted turn based I would just go back to Masters of orion 2. anywas good luck which ever you choose.			"

												I bought this game when it was in development. Now it is finished, but nothing really changed. Author promised so much, made this project sound so promising, but abandoned it. When his fans (me including) tried to force him to fulfill his promises, he made some adjustments, bringing the game to the state ""Shut up! Now you can`t sue me!"".He promised ""quest system"" - now we have 1.5 quests. That`s not a joke, that is exact number. One complete quest and one that can be started, but can not be finished. He promised multiplayer - there is no such thing. And the list goes on... and on...Now he is making ""new"" game. Which is the same game, for a full price, once again...People like him undermine reputation of crowdfunding. All because of him, some really good developers won`t be trusted... "

It is a still birth that had a lot of potentiol until it was abandoned. If the games market and or steam had anykind of consumer protection I would be asking for a refund on the basis that I paid money for a product that was never delivered, instead they have put it on sale to try and claw a few more pennies from unwitting consumers. I cant see this honest review staying up very long and fully expect it to be deleted like many of the negative forum posts, but if it saves somebody from a con then it will have been worth it!			"

The windows where i should select a marine to land (or to say land all) is always empty, although the marines are surrounding the planet's orbit. GRRRRR and on the other side the AI marines appears on my planets without flying to it - the AI marines are appearing on the planets surface by ...how should i say Scotty's super beamer? or what.... .

												STARDRIVE.The little 4X that almost could..For starters, i must voice my bias. Towards grand-stategy and 4X-Games. They have been my personal guilty pleasure for the longest time. However, even with the enjoyment i get from them. There are examples of the genre that are not exactly the best and unfortunately StarDrive falls to that category.This is easily explained, the game is dull. Bloody dull...  In all of my 140+ Hours of playing it, i have completed it only thrice.And every time, the end-game played out the same. Every single time, not counting the time i went all Borg with the Opteris. This is mainly due to design issues with the Tech- political- and AI-systems, they feel unfinished and in many ways they still are. The game still crashes now-and-again and some of the mods that have been made for the game only make it even more unstable. (This just might be only on my end, but its still a noteworthy issue.)And for a game that is aesthetically very similiar to the good old Master of Orion series, the problems only make it worse. Since in its core, the game is broken and even with the patching the developer has done (and if memory serves it was just one guy.) the game is still broken.And i'm really sad about it, since the idea is so good. A spiritual successor to Master of Orion, with better graphics, sound and all the other fluff. StarDrive tries to be that game and in some ways it has succeeded, but the technical and design issues are the things that kill the experience, not to mention the pacing.In all, StarDrive is a decent game. Even with all of its obvious problems, it is somewhat enjoyable. But not by much. It gets dull really fast and with the pacing being off, i really doubt that you could squeeze more than few playthroughs out of it. And even the modular ship building system, can only squeeze so much fun out of it.StarDrive.I think a C , is the best grade i can settle for. This coming from the game being still mostly incompleted and the modding only helps so much. But to give a yes or no on the recommendation option, i think i still need to put a yes on it. Since Steam has no ""neutral""-option in the recommendation thing..Furthermore, i would not recommend paying full price, buy this when it goes on sale. Since the content isnt there for 30€ (or regional equivelant.).			"

												So i sunk about 20 hours into this game comparing it other games in the turn based/semi realtime space expanding empire genres. A genre i really enjoy.At first I thought the game mechanic and themes could be good and was enticed by the ability to find, explore and colonize new worlds.I was impressed by the level of scripted automation and the feel of some of the game.Unfortunately for me it fell short on the gameplay side of things and many aspects seemed to be very similar to other games of its genre.Unfortunately I did not reach the compelling and addictive gameplay I was looking for andI think some areas were on the right track but did not quite make it to the punch the developers were potentially looking for.Dont give up just yet, maybe a followthrough on the detail and gameplay in the sequel?3.5/10 . frustrating once you finally get a handle on things.

												SPANISHEs un juego con buenas ideas y bastante contenido. Aún así, el desarrollador lo ha dejado a medio hacer, y eso se nota mucho. A continuación enumero las las cosas que más me han sacado de quicio:1-No hay tutorial. Hay un hermoso botón donde dice ""tutorial"" pero se trata tan solo de una pequeña presentación que te muestra lo básico de lo básico. En un juego que se vanagloria de tener tanta profundidad como éste tal cosa no es aceptable.2-El juego tiene amplias opciones de automatización (admistración automática de planetas y flotas, recursos, etc). Sería genial, si no fuera porque no funciona. Deja un planeta en manos de la IA y te lo joderá seguro.3-En las partidas avanzadas, la incesante actividad de flotas y las constantes batallas por todo el mapa ralentizan de forma considerable el juego. No es un problema de mi máquina, pues ha sido documentado por mucha más gente en los foros.4-En mi caso, después de una larga partida de algo más de 10 horas, al día siguiente el juego se niega a funcionar correctamente, congelándose la pantalla cada 4 ó 5 segundos. Por esa razón lo he desinstalado.En conslusión, si lo encuentras barato (menos de 7-8 eur), puedes jugártela y comprarlo si tienes muchas ganas. Pero ten en cuenta que si encuentras algún bug gordo o te molesta alguna de las cosas anteriores, ningún desarrollador lo va a solucionar.CONSEJO: SI ESTÁS BUSCANDO UN JUEGO DE ESTRATEGIA 4X, VE A POR LOS TÍTULOS MÁS CONSOLIDADOS QUE ÉSTE.ENGLISHThe game has a lot of content and features very good ideas, however the developer left it incomplete to work on another project (see Stardrive 2). The fact that this game is unfinished and unpolished is really evident sometimes. Let me show you the 4 things that angry me the most:1-No tutorial. Yeah, there is a big shiny button tagged ""Tutorial"" in the main menu, but it's just a slideshow that provides little to no useful info. In a game which aims to be so deep and complex, this is a serious issue.2-Automatization. The game let's you give control of various tasks to the AI. Almost anything from planet management to Empire defense can be managed by the machine. Problem is, the AI is stupid.  Give it control of a planet and all the population will be dead in no time.3-The endgame CPU consumption will kill your computer. Although this game is not exactly FarCry 3 graphics wise, the constant battles and endless activity during an advanced game will cause freezing and periodic stuttering. This issue has already been documented in various forums. 4-In my case, after 10 hours of ""successful"" playing, now the game refuses to even work properly, causing stuttering even when I'm at the main menu and taking about 5 minutes to load. For this reason I uninstalled it.In conclussion: if you really like the concept of this game or feel like playing, buy it if you find it at a good price (less than 8 eur). Keep in mind, however, that this game is already considered ""complete"" by the developer, and so none of the issues explained above, along with those that you find, are going to be fixed.ADVICE: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 4X GAME, GO FOR THE MORE POLISHED TITLES			"

												This game has a lot of promise and potential, but it fails to live up to any of that. When I first started this game, I was expecting something awesome, but what I got was a massive dissapointment. When I finished customizing my species [in a really restricted character creation], I was immediately put into the game without ANY tutorials on how to play the game. However, I did find a few tutorials, but they didn't give me much help and I was left clueless on how to play the game. 4/10P.S.: It also isn't worth the $30 I SPENT ON THIS GAME			"

												This game was released ahead of time, not being finnished.The developer gave up and left it to focus on a second game.After giving promises, and almost have fulfilled them, making bad decissions the developer now has stranded his customers with a very unfinnished product that lacks A LOT of features as well as drags on with many many bugs making it very hard to impossible to actually finnish games due to the game crashing.This had such potential, and I´ve been in it since very early BETA, but unfortunately the developer has left the game sinking and non-functional ripping of his customers to be able to get more money and now try to do the same thing with a new game.To be honest the game ought not to be allowed in the store with the information that it is a finnished product, it is not.It is in the same state as it was under the BETA with no to very very small changes.

												Gameplay is alright but game seems to have some bugs in it.  For instance, your budget and income reports will tell you that you'll have income, but after 1 turn the income drops to a negative value.  Going back to the report shows a positive value, and that value will last 1 turn after you close the report then it drops back to negative.  Makes the game unplayable after a period of time when regardless of how you play you're always losing money 'just because'.The company was unresponsive when I attempted to open a case with them to address if I was doing something wrong, or if it was a legitimate bug.  Uninstalling to play a more polished game.			"

												What at first seemed like a promising new addition to the 4X genre turned out to be a complete disaster.The game is incomplete and the devs have since jumped ship to rebuild the game from scratch under a separate title, ""Stardrive 2"". No has been compensated in any way, and this broken, unfinished mess is now being touted as a complete game.As for the specific issues with the game:PROS-1. It is a 4X game played in real time. That allows for a number of new strategies not possible in the ordinarily turn-based genre.2. Stardrive brought something new to the 4X table with the ability to design/fit your ships from scratch. This was the core pulling factor of the game. With customizable ships, you could choose from a pre-existing hull and redesign the ship to suit whatever specialised need. Titanic capital ships dedicated to bombing a planet into a foetid hellhole (i.e. conducting Exterminatus)? Done. Beam cannons on a fighter? No problemo. Or how about a logistics ship to provide repairs to your fleet on the go? All possible.CONS-1. The Sunburn engine is a laggy unoptimized mess. The framerate basically commits suicide during mid to late game, and especially in the middle of large fleet battles involving more than a hundred ships, even more so with the fact that the game runs in real time. The devs took a bad gamble opting to use a new engine with little repute, and lost.2. The AI is shallow at best, and in the state the devs had left the game, you can't do much more than basic threatening, bargaining, and decaring war. Some of the interaction options do not even seem to have any real purpose or effect.3. The game claims to be mod-friendly, however due to the limitations of the engine it can only run 1 mod at any time.4. Planetary interaction with colonies and ground troops could truly be better. Every ground unit across all the playable races are basically just reskins of one another, and the gameplay lacks any sort of strategic depth beyond throwing as many troops as possible at the enemy (or as many as you can fit on the map). Building placement doesn't appear to have any strategic element either.5. Finally, the game devs abandoned the sinking ship while all the passengers were still on board. Didn't say a word. One day they just went *poof*, and no one heard from them again until they began advertising their ""new"" game.'nuff said.Such a pity, really. This game had so much promise....			"

												OK this is getting long so don't buy this game. It's buggy and shallow with few saving graces. After 57 hours of gameplay I can say without a doubt it was not worth the $7.50 I paid for it.I wanted to like this game. It has a lot of things I like but it is too frustrating to play. I spent the first five hours of this game just figuring out how to play, finding a good path up the tech tree, creating an initial build queue and understanding the UI to be decent player. That's was OK because I thought after I had that down things would get better but as time went on it just left me on a plateau and I was no more satisfied than when I first figured out how to play. Things I did enjoy- fitting your own ships with armor, weapons , subsystems and powergrid. Terraforming an ice planet turns it into an ocean planet. The artifacts are a nice touch and assimilation is very useful but comes too late in the tech tree becasue it is not retroactive.My first successful empire was based on the good luck of finding a planet with 5 thought crystals. This gave and immense boost to my research abilities and I was quickly outpacing the computer. So whipped up a good ship design and threw it into production immediately and soon I had a decent size fleet ready to be mobilized on anything and I learned my first combat lesson just as quickly. Projectiles and missiles suck pretty hard in this game and energy beam weapons are way overpowered.Why? Projectiles miss quite often and require ammo to use which means less space on your ship for armor/shield/powergrid mods and require resupply unless you have the painfully slow ammo fabricator. Missiles are slow and are easily avoidable if you maneuver your ships away from them and also require ammo. Beam weapons almost never miss (I had a beam weapon miss a few times when I paused the game and gave an order to attack then unpaused and the computer fired all weapons even though I was facing the opposite direction from my target? Still haven't figured that one out.) and require no ammo so making a good beam boat or two pretty much seals victory every time. Also want to touch on the ""phased ordinance"" tech here as this tech allows for a 50% chance of projectiles penetrating shields. You can unlock it twice so you can get 100% penetration but the first unlock is waaaay to early in the tree and there is only one other tech cheaper to start. It seems this was done to compensate for the low hit ratio of projectiles but it just breaks the game for shield users way early on. Don't even get me started on projectile armor penetration as well.So I went back and rebuilt my ships with beams and ventured back out this time to steamroll everything in sight and that was pretty fun. After the initial wave of attacks I had reduced my enemies fleet to just freighters and they never seemed to recover. They never built another fleet of any size comparable to the first and this happened every time in every game I played with every race. You have one good fleet fight with the AI and its GG from them.Also found out the hard way to never EVER press escape in the fitting window with the arcs overlay. I thought escape would drop the overlay and put you back to the fitting window while actually it will drop you from the fitting screen entirely without the chance to save your design. I always did the weapon arcs last so I lost a few good designs to an errant key press and I quit the games a few times doing that. The escape key is not consistent in the UI and lead me to believe it was more a ""go back"" button then a ""close window"" button.And don't forget completely broken ground combat where if you take over from the AI and move your own guys it will allow your troops to automatically fire on each other as if they were the enemy and you have no way of stopping them until the unit dies!! Grrr!!!			"

												StarDrive is one of those games that looked good and innovative when it was in development, but ultimately fell short of expectations once it was released. The game was released fairly quickly - some would say a bit too quickly - and while it did receive several significant patches and updates after release, the post-launch development was not nearly as comprehensive as the community, in my opinion, deserved. As of the writing of this review, ZeroSum Games has already announced that they are making a sequel. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but it seems as though this first game was really little more than a test run designed to iron things out and bilk some folks out of the money that the studio decided they needed to create the 'real' game. I can only hope that this sequel does more to address the issues that StarDrive had and provides a more satisfying 4x experience.Even at the supposed 'end' of its relatively short development cycle, the game still suffers from a number of glitches and bugs, as well as incomplete or poorly-executed gameplay systems. Ships and fleets often suffer from poor pathfinding and an inability to carry out simple orders. Up until the last update, the few 'random events' that made up the in-game 'storyline' were still incomplete or did not work properly. The lack of any sort of scaleable engine technology or range limitations on your ships pretty much allows any player to scout out the entire map in the blink of an eye, destroying any sense of gradual exploration and leaving you susceptible to zerg rushes from any 'warmonger' races you have the misfortune of rolling up a new game map alongside.Planet development, research, and economics are serviceable but pretty bare-bones. The short tech tree is ridiculously easy to blow through with 'standard' pacing, and really needed to be at least 50% larger than what it was; several branches were seriously underdeveloped. Terraforming is almost nonexistent and the greatest variety of planet facilities is in defenses; there are no more than two or three facilities each for farming, industry, and research. The economic system had the potential to be quite intricate with its system of freighters physically transporting goods between planets; however, the limit of only three resources (food, industry, people) and the seeming lack of promised effects from the economic-related techs don't contribute to a realistic economic model and make it hard to afford much infrastructure.Game setup doesn't provide a lot of options compared to other 4x games (Endless Space, GalCiv 2, and MoO2 - which this game purports to be emulative of - come to mind). Even the largest map size doesn't seem to be quite big enough, particularly given how sparse most star systems are and how many turn out to be crap - which, given the lousy terraforming options, make meaningful expansion of your empire difficult. Locations such as volcanic and ice worlds, gas giants, and asteroid belts, rather than providing additional options, are instead little more than eye candy, contributing nothing of value to the overall game when they could've added whole new dimensions to the tech tree and gameplay. The game's seven races are fairly original, for the most part - conforming to the usual tropes, but distinctive in their own ways, though some are considerably more derivative than others. The diplomatic options are good, if not outstanding, and  the responses provided in the course of shooting the breeze with a particular species are amusing, while providing a gist of each race's personality and culture - though there's not a great deal of background information to be gleaned during the course of gameplay. The diplomacy system gives you an idea of how a given species feels about you, but no feedback on what you can do to improve relations. Espionage provides a number of options for stealing or sabotage in a fairly good, time-duration assignment system that relies on hiring spies and advancing them in rank. I do have to say that the game's ship design system is solid, allowing you to get down into the nitty-gritty of customizing each vessel to the last component. Everything comes down to power; each component has to be within range of a reactor or power conduit or it won't function. Design a ship with too many power-hungry systems but not enough power generators, and systems will shut down once its reserves run dry. Ship-to-ship combat happens in real time on the system maps (a la Sins of a Solar Empire) and hit detection and damage is location-based, with external systems taking damage first before the guts of the ship can be hit. What this means is that ship design must be well thought-out and involves compromise. With only so many slots on a particular hull - and only so many internal and external slots available - you have to strike a balance between power systems, weapons, and defenses. Ships with heavy armor on the outer edges will have less space available for weapons ports; shield generators have limited coverage bubbles and must be positioned to protect the whole ship; reactors are volatile and will cause splash damage to surrounding components if they are destroyed - do you have the space to spare for internal bulkheads, or do you trust your ship's armor and shielding? Each weapon can be given an individual arc, allowing you to construct aggressive, maneuverable, front-heavy gunfighters or well-defended, multi-turreted line warships capable of massive broadsides - or anything in between. All that's needed is a way to lock each weapon in position so it can't be moved - errant clicks while upgrading or changing designs can skew a turret's alignment clear out of whack, which can lead to whole fleets with frakked up aim if you happen to not notice. StarDrive does have some good points and interesting design features, but overall the game feels incomplete. I could go on about other aspects of the game that suffered from clunky design or thin or incomplete treatments, but the message has been stated - StarDrive is not worth picking up, at least not at this point. Clearly it has been popular enough to warrant a sequel, and hopefully the developer will take the time to get things right in the second game. StarDrive 2 definitely needs a far greater level of depth and sophistication in its gameplay if it wants to stand out from its competition in this fairly crowded field of space empire-building games, and needs to have the glitchy systems and underdeveloped features of its predecessor ironed out in order to deliver a satisfying experience. Hopefully the sequel will prove to be a game that greatly improves on its 'trial run' predecessor and is able to succeed because it is well-designed and provides deep gameplay options - something that the original game has not succeeded in delivering.

Now thats not saying this is a bad game, the ship customization and planet management is excelent and the combat feels like it should in space, but it just can't carry the game on there own. Wheres the Multiplayer? Story mode? Improved diplomacy? We were promised it but it just never materialized. Its a trend thats been happening for the last year with 'pay to play early' Alphas and Betas, and i honestly wouldnt of minded if the game had been continualy updated and polished. But it wasn't, It's AI feels buggy and will uterlly crush you on anything higer than Normal, balancing resource production is a NIGHTMARE, the game crashes after several hours play for no reason and Diplomacy isnt finished, just the classic 'give me tech and planets' approch or picking from a list of things your spys can do. The term 'cash grab' certainly has come to mind.If somebody put another 6 months into polishing and actualy finishing this game it would be great, in its state now? Save your cash, go play Galactic Civilization II, SIns of a Solar Empire or Armada, that should cure your itch for space colonization for awhile.			"

												I was really looking forward to this game in early access, but after the new wore off, and the dev rushed off I realized there just wasn't much there.  I admittedly need to play it some more but I dislike so much of it that its hard to want to get back in to it.  I love the art.  I hate the tiny tech tree(shrub? potted plant?) and managing planets.  I have not mastered ship building but that might be what gets me to take a second look.  But if you are looking for anything with a tech tree or interesting empire managment look else where.Edit:  There are no positive reviews for this game.  If you buy it its your own damn fault.			"

												This game is the reason that I won't be participating in any early releases again anytime soon. Despite any ""communications"" from the game developer about this game being complete, it is most definitely still in the same beta stage it was months before its ""release"". I can say this assuredly, because to date, the developer has still not included basic game items like titan class ships for all races, I still can't build the titan ship for the Wulfar race BECUASE IT STILL ISN'T IN THE GAME. Save your money, and make sure you are 100% ok with a game never getting finished if you decide to partake in early access. If I sound bitter, its becuase I loved this game to play it, and would have finished my playthrough, if I could have. Read the other reviews, you don't have to take my word for it.I wanted to edit this review to add that Vulfar Titan class ships were finally added nearly a year after the game was ""released"" as finished. I did finally get to have a fun playthrough, and am interested in Stardrive2, ONLY after it is released, and honestly a finished product. Lesson learned.			"

												I enjoyed the vanilla version of this game and was looking forward to downloading the updates.  It is now a ruined game.  It had it's flaws before but rather than fixing those flaws the developer chose instead to play around with the parts that weren't broken to begin with.  For example homeworlds always used to have 2 richness and 2 fertility.  now every time I start a game the homeworld only has 1 richness which makes an already long game take hours longer.  Furthermore I have never been able to properly install a mod (wanted a sudden death version where research only took 1 turn).  My advice: this game is no longer worth buying.  It was on it's release but it's been broken.			"

												Game is too easy for classic grand strategy (4X) genre in every aspect. You can learn all the tricks in mere minutes and there's not much to do after that. Most annoying is the tech tree: it is just too shallow and all-visible at start (well, there's something like 1-6 upgrades in 1-3 tech trees in each of five tiers plus one 'hidden' tier). Upgrades are completely evolutional, improving just main characteristic of shield/armor/weapon/etc. Space combat is really nasty too: no matter how much time you spend designing your ships combat result is mostly determined by ability to sustain DPS and hit the target (like a not-so-large pack of cheapest fighters with ammo-less lasers easily destroy something like cruiser). Moreover ships in fleet do not keep formation during combat thus there's no such thing concentrated fire or support ships staying in safe position delivering ammo/repairs to the hot zone. As for diplomacy, well there's none out there. First Civilization had as much diplomatic choices as we have here and it is not the simplicity you want.To be honest there's a couple of things that are good: it is ship designer (however you cannot fit your design with latest weapons/armors just developed by your techs, you need to do it manually) and 'turnless' strategic mode, however there're many space strategies which include these pros and doesn't have so much cons. If you want a good game, go for endless space (easy to learn) or something like space empires V or distant worlds (much harder thingies)			"

												This game was good at first, when i believed it was incomplete and still a work in progress, so much potential... Sadly, that went unfulfilled. The game seems to not want to communicate very well, with scant notifications or pop-up messages telling you whats afoot in your empire. The diplomacy is pretty light, though not the worst in the world. But for a game about ship combat, there's a surprisingly small amount of control, as aluded to earlier, you get no notifications when your ships are in combat, nor can you zoom to your ships or padlock ther camera on a ship (only your flagship and any ship you manually take control of) which makes the game seem incomplete. So many features seem unfinished or rushed and there's no word from the DEV on fixes or further development. The game looks exactly like Distant Worlds and attempts to play very similar but is a far inferior product and I'd reccomend that game over this any day, on account of it being a complete and enjoyable product, unlike StarDrive.

Posted: September 25, 2016
												tl:drThere are no credits anywhere in StarDrive. I'm not surprised. I wouldn't want to put my name to this crap either.And don't buy StarDrive 2 either.I've read a lot of the reviews for this game and they all read much the same, that it was the product of a lone developer who took the money and ran before the game was finished, but not many actually talk about the game beyond ""it could have been great!"" So to give some insight into what StarDrive is really like:* Path-finding is appalling - Use alt+click to override if you want your ships to get anywhere as fast as possible. There is also such as a thing as too fast. Keep the FTL under 100K unless you want to watch your ships play ping pong around each destination.* Accuracy of weapons that use munitions is appalling - You can either use beam weapons (and suffer appalling lag) or spray the battlefield with ordnance (and suffer appalling lag) to increase the likelihood you'll actually hit anything.* Ground battles are appalling - Have more troops in orbit than there are tiles on the planet, land them all at once and then let the AI take over and forget about it. Do not bother trying to micromanage the ground battle, it is a waste of time and takes too long, so just wait for the notification saying you have taken over the planet.* Manual ship control is appalling - There is no point of reference when you take manual control of a spaceship, the mini-map does not zoom in to help you navigate and the only way to get some idea of which direction you are travelling is to fire forward facing munition weapons and see which way they drift. It is truly horrific trying to fight using manual control, most of the time you'll just be turning on the spot hoping the enemy ships really will fly into your gunsights. That is if you can even get your ship to stop.* The AI is appalling - Nothing can be done about this, although you can abuse it. You can bombard a planet into nothingness and then leave at least one bomber continually dropping nukes because the enemy will continually try to recolonise it until you have wiped them all out of existence. Also, the AI does not send more than four ground troops at once for a ground assault, so just make sure each of your planets has as many hard troops as will fit.* Diplomacy is appalling - Just make sure you buy alliances before someone else gets there first.* The interface is appalling - There is no way to delete save games from within the game. When I did finally find them the first time I did a manual search of the hard dirve they had consumed over 4GB of storage space.* The lag is appalling - By far the worst problem is lag. You won't notice it at first, but the longer a game lasts the worse it gets (and not always because of large numbers of ships). The most impressive lag I've seen is when the final game stats run. I just get the impression it's replaying the game in the background all over again because how else can you make the final game stats lag so atrociously? It's just a map with three bar charts!There is loads more wrong with this game, this is just a shortlist of the ones I can remember, but there must be a reason I pumped 78 hours into this monstrosity? Well, I got it in a bargain bin from an actual shop, so didn't see the reviews initially. But, the main reason I wasted so much time on it is modding. People complain about the crappy tech tree and the cookie-cutter planet development. Then just mod it. Literally everything can be modified. I had whole new branches of technology, new ship hulls (most notably the Borg and a smiley face), new artifacts, new ship modules (from armoured reactors and reactors that were armour, to guns that never ran out of ordnance and armour that was a gun and provided power and never ran out of ordnance), ships that could travel the universe in seconds, new planetary buildings, and so on. Literally everything can be modified, and once you learn how it's not that hard to make a change and then test the effects. Unless you make a mistake, then the game fails to load. Even then, with a little practice, you begin to learn how to read the error message. It is even possible to modify armageddon and have a game that never ends. (Which actually means ends when it crashes.)So given all that potential for making improvement why do I not recommend this game? Because once you start rooting through the game files to make changes you begin to notice strange files and folders that hint at missing features and you begin to understand just how much was left unfinished by the developer and the fact they couldn't even be bothered to remove all of this before releasing the game as a finished product. Like a hint at just how much you are missing out on. But worse than that, even though you've modified every single aspect of the game so you can effortlessly hold off armageddon indefinitely, it only works if you micromanage every single battle because the AI is appalling. I did try imagining my ship commanders were just drunk bullies because they always go after the smallest, weakest enemy ship (fleet orders reset to defaults as soon as you close the fleet setup screen), expertly missing them even though you've modified the Vulcan into a minigun-shotgun with the range and fire power of a sniper rifle, all the while oblivious to the enemy capital ships playing turkey shoot with them, but I couldn't hold that thought for long because it really is a just crap programming and a crap AI. And indefinite ends when the game decides to crash from out of memory (which is impressive when not even a quarter of the 8GB available on this machine is being used) or you just can't stand the lag any longer and know that the lag in the endgame stats is most likely going to crash the game anyway.And then you read the reviews for StarDrive 2 and see the pattern repeating and you realise the developer is never going to learn so long as people continue parting with the cash for unfinished products.Actually, there is one final point to make about this game. I've never before come across a game that didn't have credits somewhere. The credits might run when you complete a game or be hidden somewhere in the menu, but they are always there somewhere. There are no credits anywhere in StarDrive. I'm not surprised. I wouldn't want to put my name to this crap either.			"

												I'll be up front right now, I like this game. It offers a unique experience and I find myself coming back again and again to play it. That being said I would not recommend it unless it was on at least a 75% sale as the game is not complete and pretty much never will be because the dev dropped it. Now you can play the game, it isn't broken you can play and finish a scenario but this game was abandoned and a lot of promises that were made were broken by the dev so there is lack of content and after a few games you get the gist of how things will go and the prospect of losing goes out the window even on the hardest difficulty. The Blackbox mod can fix this a bit but overall it's a problem. In addition you will suffer a lot late game due to poor optimization that even a really powerful system can't power through. I put a lot of time into this game on my 3570k which was overclocked to 4.8Ghz and on the larger universe settings I still had significant slowdowns and juttering which can and will render the zoomed in direct fleet control unplayable. It basically leads to you sending massed fleets into enemy held systems and hoping that the AI can take care of things. The best thing to do is the leave the universe size to normal and use the Blackbox mod to limit the number of ships the AI can have because if you don't you will quickly find that the AI will continue to pump out droves of ships and each one will make the game run a bit worse after a certain point. That being said if you have a recent Intel based chip(Sandy or newer) your system should easily be able to handle around around a thousand ships in the universe without significant slowdowns.Probably my favorite thing about the game is the ship customization. In a word it's friggin cool and it really makes you feel good when your ship you designed is good enough to take on three or four ships of an equivalent class of ship and come out on top. That is I think the thing that really keeps me coming back because I keep finding better and better ways to build my ships and it feels really engaging.  To wrap up this game had loads of potential but it was let down by poor choices made by the dev in both the way they made the game and how the handled the abandonment of it. It is in no way worth the standard $30 asking price, you can pick it up for the unique experience but only if it's less than $10.			"

If you can get some of the mods to work, such as the tech mod, it expands the potential greatly. However on it's own it's not even CLOSE to what I paid for it.Zero, the dev, now makes a stardrive 2. I will not be buying it regardless of how good it may look. TBH from what I have seen he's going a very different direction the the original so I was not very interested to start.

There are bugs in every hole of this game, it crashes due to memory leaks, there is no MP. The AI has the grace and elegance of a 6 year old trying to eat a freezepop. This is a shame because this game definitely could have really been something. But alas this game was abandoned for its sequel which is in no way similar to this game, for $30 you definitely do not get what you paid for. I would stay away from this one unless it is on sale.

												This game has alot of potential much like Stronghold kingdoms, You can play it and have a blast but there are a number of issues that make this game a high price to even buy. For one thing a reason why I dont reccomened is IT""S NOT FINISHED! There is a variety of features in this game that have been started and will never be finished.For example, Revoran the games one and only quest and never finsihed. This little planet gives you the start of a quest in a pop up window but then it can never be continued. The planet is now removed which is like taking the only city state in Civ 5 out of the game leaving you with 8 war hungry monsters.The game promised multiplayer, Never came.There is also options for more then 1 game type but you'll only play one. There are no other game types.These are just a few unfinished things. Everything could of been in depht alot more but the developer just slaped a price tag on it and said done. HE ABANDONED THIS GAME TO MAKE ANOTHER. Another good reason to not go into early access. The game is just one giant war leading to your victory, There may be 1 or 2 other secret things to win but they are so hard to do you might as well just declare war on everyone.My time came from nearly mods and that only.

												I am so incredibly sad and annoyed that this game was abandoned by the developer before completion.It has one of the best ship editing and creation tools I have ever seen and I spent hours looking over designs to see how I could improve them.The potential the game has as a solid 4x modelled off of MoO2 is incredible and to just walk away and blatently start developing a sequel that takes most of the features of the first game and calls it a whole new game for another money grab is despicable.Boycott this developer!, he is a shonky conman.(My hope is that someone else improves on his design and develops a full and improved game from it's ashes)			"

												I like this game, despite its terrible faults.  I bought it to support the developer, yet it appears that after he sold enough units the development ceased (as far as I could see).  Not the greatest support to his customers.I understand that the developer is making Stardrive 2... will I get that one?  Probably, yet I won't recommend this game to people due to its many issues.There are many other, better 4X games out there.			"

												Could be fun, but has a non-existant tutorial. I had no clue how to design my ships, Plus you can't look at pre-made designs to get an idea or upgrade them. It does have a explanation area when you click the question mark, but it really don't explain much, especially about ship design.Their idea of an epic sized galaxy is a joke.All planets are exactly the same size since they all have the exact amount of space to build on.I had trouble with setting up fleets, after a while you get garbage graphics and have to get out of the window to clear them. When adding ships to a fleet, they don't actually move into the fleet area until you move the fleet which makes no sense to me.You have a planet manager, however all you can do in it is to tell the AI what planets to colonize. You can't even use it to move to individual planets. I had to scroll around on the map to find my home planet so I could give build orders.Building anything in this game takes forever. My 3 hours of fame at 4x, all I managed to do is colonize roughly 20 planets and build some facilities and ships. There just doesn't seem like there is a lot of variety of buildings. Oh and you only get to build one of each on each planet. I couldn't find a way to stop time, I just hit random keys until something happened. Eventually I just got borred an quit.I don'tt understand a lot about this game and frankly I don't care, it's got too many issues to be a fun game. I was bored or frustrated most of the time. Glad I got it in a bundle, sure as hell not worth the 30 bucks they're asking for it. Read somewhere that it was abandoned by it's dev for a sequal and that the sequal is just more like an update.Update 7/25/2016: Was so upset about this game that I typoed alot in this review. Fixed all my typos (I think).			"

												This is one of those games with a lot of potential, and also one of those games that never quite lived up to it.The premise is simple. The game takes place on a 2d plane. Your ships can be customized and designed very similar to Gratuitous Space Battles. Any wacky ship design you want, you can build. The game is also highly mod friendly, which is a huge plus in my book.You colonize planets, design ships, build fleets, and conquer the galaxy. Simple enough.Problem is that the game is highly buggy, full of memory leaks and other instabilities. This is a real shame considering how brilliant the game design is. There is just no polish and little to no bug fixing that was done. Be prepared to have your game either slow down to an unplayable crawl and/or crash to desktop continually.Lots of potential but poor execution. Avoid this game unless you like frustration.			"

I would not recommend this game in anyway and would take the aforementioned titles over this one. Stardrive introduced no new ideas, and in fact, left out some of the very things that gave these games their appeal. It's obvious that Stardrive was modeled after Galactic Civilizations. Why the creators felt a dumbed down and uncreative version would be acceptable is beyond me. I spent the money. Don't make the same mistake I did.			"

												StarDrive is an immersive RPG. The amount that goes on in this game after a while starts to get crazy.The concept is simple... zoom in and out with the mouse to view the star systems. The navigation that this game play provides is smooth and allows you to get to which system you need to view. The managing system of seeing all of your empires/planets and being able to allocate production is sophisticated enough but the user interface for it was done simply and made easy to use. Diplomacy can work for or sometimes quickly against you with an opposing empire declaring war. Trade routes, non-aggression pacts, war declaration, and even colony claims can be through diplomacy. Planets come in different varieties such as gas planets, Terran, swamp, barren and a few variants. Be sure to start exploring early and claim good planets, but doing so exposes you to aliens. You will find yourself addicted to this game after a while if you like micro and macro managing planets and a multitude of ships. You are also able to create your own ships (from colony ships to cruisers) and the creation system is a neat one at that. There is also an in game fleet design system that by itself makes the game much more easier to play (and to defend against enemies). Why I support this game even though it has a lag issues (sometimes with and without the mod) is there is a community out there trying to improve this game. Moreover and more importantly for me, you are able to control a SINGLE UNIT and tell them what to fire. You can't say exactly which guns to use, but none the less this is the right idea in my mind to create a new genre : RPG meets first person shooters. Literally, any unit that's out there, choose to control. I wish more games did this in the sense. Imagine playing Starcraft and you can control a marine. Your marine that you are controlling dies so you automatically jump to the next one or go back to the RPG screen. This to me is brilliant and perhaps even game changing in the future. I will have to give it aRATING : 7.0/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  C+ (due to lag)Due to lag issues and a need for a mod but either than that I recommend it - especially on sale. Just be extremely wary about the lag issue.  "

												Stardrive is a really good game, though with a few rough edges.  It seems to run fine until late game area where it will lag (on any computer) a good deal.  The develoment is done for it unfortunatly but you can get the blackbox un-official patches from https://bitbucket.org/CrunchyGremlin/sd-idk/overviewBlackbox is still pumping out updates to make the game better and better.  I would have liked to see some multiplayer though or even some more fleshed out storyline (the game has a kind of story you can figure out as you play).The races you meet have very unique looks, especially the space samuri bears.  The ships look and feel amazing and each one can be totally customized and upgraded with research and the shipyard.  With stardrive 2 coming out soon though I might just hold off buying this one and get the sequel (which should have much more added in).All in all I will be buying the sequel, so that should tell you how much I like this game.

												I have been playing this game since its beta release and i think its fair to say this game could have been so much more“Some omissions and flaws, but balanced by excellent alien races and ship design. A welcome addition to the crew.” this says it all nicely but is largely understated. As a whole the management and construction of an empire works quite well but in combination with wonky AI; a civ 5-esque diplomacy screen with reduced options and strange reactions (allies will quickly turn hostile if the wrong trade is proposed); no counterspying option leaves you to get ravaged by enemy spies; many incomplete or just missing features; no multiplayer; and late-game performance issues (I play it on a laptop so it may just be that) the fun factor quickly turns to frustration late in the game.  A lot of features were also just left out, despite being advertised as either implemented or coming soon on the steam store, and will most likely never be implemented as Zero Sum basically dropped everything in development for the game and focused on the production of a sequel, leaving the first game feeling very incompleteBUT there are many aspects that work quite well:The shipyard feature, for example, is amazing. it allows you to arrange unlocked systems on a ship frame so you can create specialized designs (ie resupply, strike, scout, coloyization etc) and allows you to control thier performance levels.too many systems bogs down the power supply, shields over armor can be a vulnurability and more massive means slower travel. to name a few things.the game is visually stunning. you are able to scale the map from a galactic map down to a single star with orbiting planets. the alien races are all fantastically concieved and there are 8 playable races which can be customized to have a number of positive and negative traits upon starting a new game. each race has its own ship designs, and most of them have unique ground unitsI really liked that this game was 4x so that The game flows continuously and allows space battles to occur in real time while the construction and research aspects are turn based progressions. i thought this system worked really well, especially since you can increase the time scaling up to 4x (or more, but not on my laptop) and speed up the slow early stages of the game.Unfortunately the features that i liked did not make up for its short comings, for me at least, and it looks like they will be carried through to the sequel along with countless improvements/features that should have been in this game.VERDICT: this game is not worth $33CAD If this game appeals to you, then I would wait for the sequelIf you've read a fair number of reviews and still want to try it, then wait for a sale to drop the price to $5-10 as there are some mods out there that really add a lot to the game and the game is still enjoyable  "

												This is a one-man-project, and it shows.The One-Man-Show showed itself in a lack of discipline to work on the ""boring parts"" of a sellable product: rigorous bug-fixing, polishing, usability.A few concepts, such as the design-your-own-ship puzzle are AWESOME. Laying out your own, where to put armour, where the guns. Big engines or small. Truly an inspired idea that made me decide to buy on-the-spot.On the other hand, many parts of the game are buggy, unpolished or even unfinished.For example: The game slows down over time; my campaign has never been not-laggy after the first half hour. This wasn't considered a priority problem, despite multiple people reporting it.Some efforts were made, but it shows there was never enough time for a good fix.All in all: Great concept, but the idea(s) were too big for the one guy implementing them.No more one-man-shows for me, and I'll pass on StarDrive2 as well. ZeroSum games has lost my faith. "

												This game involved a lot of really great ideas, all with terrible execution, clunky control, and a UI that makes you want to gougue your eyes out. Ship design in this game might be the deepest ever attempted, but involves far more tedious wiring of power than engineering acumen. You'd almost certainly enjoy Star Ruler's much simpler scheme, which ends up achieving far more creative possibility, or GalCiv and skip the hour-long battleship design process entirely. Automation? Sounds good, but the AI is pretty terrible at minding itself. If you want to get much done, you're forced to take it into your own hands, and deal with the horrid hotkeys, UI, and the rediculous WASD-control of ships, which makes them unavailable for scrolling around the map. You also can't click-drag. You're stuck with arrow keys or zoom-popping like a schizophrenic rabbit. If you want your empire to do its own thing(but also the way you tell it to), play Distant Worlds, because that game has true and almost total automation options that is as capable as the actual enemy AI(which can get rather brutal, unlike stardrive's rather easy bots). Ship combat doesn't even look that good, or play well. If you want something with tactics, go play MOO, and if you want actual cinematic splosion glory, go GalCiv or endless space. Small ships are gross pixel blobs and large ships just tend to look like a bunch of sausages flopping around. There is very little customization available other than the standard race min/maxing before a game starts. Want to slog through a massive galaxy of mostly barren worlds? nope. Want a quick fight between factions already up against each other's shoulders? too bad. Square maps that all play the same. Why not any other game I previously listed, some allowing you to play on 3-d barbell, spherical, or perpedicular galactic arrangements while all allow much more map control. Why was this overlooked?So even if you actually get used to panning around on the arrow keys like a geriatric, navigate your way through obtuse and uninformative UI, and after spending hours plugging your ship's weapons into power sockets, what do you get? Well, you'll be dealing with micromanagement forever. Yep, like Civ5 lategame, but more like all game. Governors are idiots, and basically anything you want to do you're going to have to pause the game and painstakingly order it out so that fleet doesn't fly apart in transit and make sure you pay attention to your ground forces so they don't sit there for days doing nothing!You don't so much play this game as try to bear it.

												Despite all of the flak this game has received it is still a fun game to play. I missed the Kickstarter for this game but got it as soon as it was available. The game met every expectation I had for it and has been a huge time sink. The ways ships are designed is one of the best systems I have seen implemented in a game and one I wish other studios would adopt. Now I did not have many of the problems mentioned by most reviewers so I may have been lucky in that regard. The few crashes I did have were after marathon sessions of 12+ hours of playing. Over the years I tend to encounter very few bugs or other issues in games so I may just be very lucky.Some of the mechanics weren't well explained but a little trial and error would produce the answer. In my experience if no explanation or trial and error is needed to figure out how a game works then the game has been dumbed down and will offer very little. I've seen a lot of complaints about the developer not finishing the game and other issues but it ended up being exactly what I expected it to be. Personally, I got my money's worth of entertainment from this game and then some. I have even recommended it to a few friends who have also enjoyed it.			"

												Well, I could write a long review but, to me, the game is just not worth it.Don't get me wrong, it has potential and modders could possibly turn it into something really great, but sadly the dev decided to abandon the game. Promises made during the kickstarter campaign as well as during the alpha and beta phase will never be fulfilled cos it would just not be lucrative. Instead of working on StarDrive the dev decided to rather create a new game, which is basically StarDrive but is using the Unity engine instead. And, of course, if you bought the old game that now will never be finished you have to purchase the new one again, at full price.So, really guys, even though the game might be good, the dev really doesn't deserver your money.Another problem of StarDrive is the huge amount of censorship going on on both the official and Steam forums. If you want to avoid that pay this Steam group a visit: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SDVC/discussions "

												I love this game. When I bought it I just left it and never played for about 6 months. But when I picked it up and modded it with Tim's mod,  couldn't stop playing, I haven't had any problems with it, though that might just be because I have a gtx970. And with that mod it was amazing. However, the developer is a bit of an idiot. He has abandoned the game to go on the a sequel. WITHOUT COMPLETEING THE FIRST GAME!!! (but it will have much better land combat, but no more real time space combat :( ) As well some of the promised features never ended up in game, and I would really, really love multiplayer! (which was promised) And finally, the ship design system is awsome and is completely modular so youu can change, edit and completely remake every ship. As a result, I belive you should either try this game for its realatively unique real time space (most other 4x games do this due to preformance problems) or wait for the sequel for a hopefully improved game.Edit:I'm now more optimistic(watched thexpgamer's video on it) about stardrive 2 cause it does have real time combat, but you can only place ships right in front of the enemy and can't get reinforcements in battle. So I might try and mod that in if it isn't that hasn't been done already(pasted directly from my comment, sorry for gramatical issues)			"

												I am going to get alot of flak for this, but I enjoyed this game.  I always feel that if i get a buck an hour worth of fun out of a game its worth it.  I also enjoyed the game becuase I did not buy into the game during the early access, so I knew going in that it was going to be only single player, and knew what it had when i got it. I didnt research enough before i got Stardrive or i might not have bought it.  Game does have a few bugs still and i am disappointed with that and the fact that no more updates or multiplayer will be added.  All in all, for the sale price the game atm(8.99) i think its worth it, even if i dont agree with what the Dev did with the game.			"

												Multiplayer would make this game amazing, as would the ability to make an actual custom race (as opposed to customizing the races as presented). Even lacking these things, it makes for a fun game. It can take civilization levels of time to complete a game though, if you decide to go for all the races and maximum map size. All that said, I would suggest definately getting this game if you can pick it up for 20 bucks or less. If you are a particular fan of space 4x type games, then paying full price isn't out of the question. Having control of building your ships And commanding them in combat is very nice.			"

												This game is only good with community mod project that squashes a vast majority of the bugs that can be found and substainally beefs up the AI in its competive play.The ship desginer is fun and lets you tinker with many concepts for dealing with hostiles. the combat is very fun to watch play out, though if an enemy ship gets its engines knocked out and its moving away faster than your ships can travel... that gets kinda annoying.Richness and Fertility of planet really dictate your colonies usefulness to you and can make or break your start and the Remnants are relly just massive♥♥♥♥♥♥blocks for your expansion.Managing your freighters is the most annoying and tedious thing to handle and it never gets better.Other then that its a good game and really could have been made into something great, but the creator is too busy stealing from Master of Orion.play it, but only with the community mod installed.

Pros:-Great ship costimization,  I have a titan design soly made to disable other capitals while the smaller ships chew it up.-enjoyable diplomacy-flexible in game playCons:-Game crashing bugs-some what confusing UI, till you get used to it.-not so many techs (can be ether or but i like alot of choice.)-some of the races were not fully finished when i played and im not going out of my way to look at them again-unfinishedso all and all good game if it was actually finished,  i dont recommend getting this or the next one as it looks the same...

												A lack of a good tutorial makes this game very difficult to get into. Any 4X, complex strategy game should put a lot of effort into their tutorial otherwise they outcast newcomers to the genre. I'm not a veteran 4X gamer, but I've played my fair share. I eventually did sort of get the hang of everything, but the fact that I was forced to learn mostly manually made my choices very stilted and boring. Like I didn't want to declare war on anybody since I didn't really understand if I'd win or not. I also focused solely on economy because everything else seemed a bit more advanced.That said, the game was pretty decent, I just have zero interest in learning a new 4X game without proper learning tools. I'll go back and play SoaSE before I play this again.			"

												All the other reviews are true, some small changes and fixes could have made this game great.And given it years of re-playability. I still look at it sometimes wanting to play, but remembering how a lot of small♥♥♥♥♥♥things completely ruins the experience.Unlike most others I have gotten the game to run crashed one or twice maybe. And I have finished games with two races and played a lot more half way thru.I will not by StarDrive2 out of principle, or anything else from this developer.It was easily fixable especially with all the money he  got from pre-purchases, he should at least have let the community fix it when there still was a will to do so.

												When this game was on kickstarter there was a promise of making the game multiplayer post release.  Now it just looks to me like a scam.  Many ppl including myself purchased the game wanting to play this with friends.  As a singleplayer game i cannot recomend fighting mindless ai it just doesnt cut it for me.  As far a stardrive 2 goes i would stay away aswel just looks like a downgraded version.			"

												Stardrive is very reminiscent of the old school ""Orion"" PC series. This game lets you play the game however you wish; you can try and seize control of the universe through diplomacy, scientific progress, or sheer military might.  The game will often leave you with very open ended- decisions with you in full control of your ultimate destiny.  And at times when things don't turn out the way you wish, there are always more than one way to coming to a solution.  Stardrive will challenge your ability to think ahead, manage resources, and your strategic combat prowess to its full extent.			"

												Fun enough, but absolutely no late game whatsoever. There's not much point researching ships bigger than frigates - all you need are some ships to keep the enemy's ridiculously weak fighter fleets at bay while you infantry rush them.""Not finished"", as others have said, in the sense that the whole game feels very shallow, but it's not buggy enough to really be considered a beta either - I'd call it a finished product, though it's not a great one. Not a bad game in some ways, but very little replay and not worth $30.Yeah, I know I have like 170 hours on this despite saying very little replay. To be frank, I don't usually complete my 4X games because I get frustrated with the late game grindy-ness, and thusly, I did get quite a bit of time on Stardrive, which does certain parts of the mid-game reasonably well. Besides that, I bet at least 100 of those hours was spent designing ships, which is probably the best designed aspect of the game.But unfortunately, that is the big issue with the game as well - designing ships, the most interesting part of the game, is not really actually all that important in terms of gameplay. You can certainly min-max the ♥♥♥♥ out of your transport ships, and design ultra-badass capital ships with hangers (which don't work, by the way) and plague bombs (because you can't blow up planets) and death rays, but in the end it doesn't really matter because you are really only going to build a bunch of frigates armed with super-missiles to crush the pathetic enemy fleet while you infantry rush him. Did I mention you can't blow up planets?It sounds like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing about a specific tactic that works too well, and that someone with my hours is probably just good at the game. What I'm really trying to do here is save you money - this is not the easiest way to win the game, it's how you play the game, period. If you don't do it, the ultra-slow AI will eventually do it to you after several hours of ingame time, or at least try to. I personally used that time to build up a giant empire and a fleet of death ships that squished his little army without me having to do much of anything. Then quit and restarted because I realized that, nope, that was it, and now I'd have to spend two hours invading defenseless planets after I stocked up on cans of SPAM.Not that you need an empire. You can easily ♥♥♥♥ everyone's day up with 10 planets if you are smart about what you build and research. Hint: Build and research everything, because the AI is slow as a turtle in concrete and will still be using popguns while you rock rocket launchers. There's also only a dozen or so things to build, and everyone has the same research trees, so you don't really need to prioritize well.All of this is somewhat redeemed by the multiplayer mode, though. Because humans are not slow as ♥♥♥♥, you actually need to play the game in a fashion that bears some semblance to strategy. Infantry spamming is still the only tactic, but you now do need a proper navy in order to get your troops to the ground. The community is vibrant and great, and you'll find that the people you play against generally are good folks who want to play the game rather than use these kinds of tactics however.Oh, right. :p			"

												This game had potentiall. It really did.Unfortunately, the best I could say about this game is ""unfinished"". It's got some interesting races, sure, some humor as well, a decent amount of exploration, but at nearly every turn you run into something that just seems... unfinished. Ship classes? Not all implemented for all races yet, so some people get titans, some don't. Follow up an ancient mystery? Your reward is... fighting a giant ship. More than once, if you'd like. First contact? Never mind, that's been cut. Endings? Blow up everyone you're not allied to, that's the only way to win last I checked. The end-game optimization was also lacking, causing the game to choke horribly during battles.In short? If you want a great 4X game, buy something like Master of Orion 2 off GoG. It'll be cheaper AND provide more fun than this game, in its current state.			"

It's a neat game with a great idea behind it, but it seems the dev may have taken on too much with too little experience. Plenty of bugs and end game just kills performance. I didn't have these performance issues with Sins of a Solar Empire. Seemingly right after releasing this game the dev team started on and shortly thereafter released the second one. I think they just gave up on the first and left it for dead. I cannot recommend this game because of performance issues, bugs, and the fact that the dev team left it for dead.

												A lot of people dislike StarDrive. Most of those are upset that the developer apparently stopped working on this game before it was complete to start on the sequel. Some because the game is -- indeed -- in an unfinished state in some places. (The tech tree is incomplete, and the story-line is most definitely so: it stops advancing barely after it starts!) The game obviously has flaws.With that said, I really like the game. Great atmosphere and animation, the shipbuilding is detailed and the combat is fun, the rest is adequate at worst. I was also hoping that the game would be finished, but -- if you like 4x games and the game is on-sale -- I'd definitely recommend the game.(P.S.

												After reading through the piles of negative reviews, I just had to throw my 2 cents into the debate.  Initially I kept getting crushed every game, leading me to concur with negative review posse. However, after giving StarDrive a chance,I feel like it will depend on the individuals 4x gaming expectation. Although there are some issues, StartDrive is a little more nuanced in some areas than others have indicated,for instance, you can join or form alliances, develope a spy network to gain tactical advantage by stealing tech or by sabotaging rival civs covertly. Designing ship loadouts is cool cause it lets you upgrade your fleets tactical capabilities as needed to expand your empire,strengthen alliances and crush the opposition. I enjoyed using covert methods to aquire, or to sabotage a rival civ .I found that SD offers an unpredictable, quirky style that might change whats expected in a 4x space title. In summary SD marries an asymetrical  universe with challenging 4x game play, Stardrive marches to its own drummer  with some in game quirks, but I its worth the price of admission. By the way, the Black Box Mod expands player options and reduces a lot of the the unwanted quirks. I say buy it!!!			"

												The concept of the game is nice, but don't release the game and call it done, then go back in when every single person who bought your game complains, fix one or two things, and then announce the second game. Why would I want a second game when I didn't get my first one? StarDrive lacks a true narrative, the AI is buggy, and the map generation gives you like 5 different planet types and yet claims to offer a ""variety of detailed and unique worlds"". DO NOT BUY. Crap crap crap.			"

												I remember playing this game when it first came out and I was expecting bugs and crashes naturally. However, those issues were never fixed and I feel as if i've wasted my money. It's enjoyable in the beginning but later on during a game it becomes unplayable because of bugs and micromanaging dozens of ships and planets. Unless you have 120 GB of RAM, a 16 core processor, and 100 terabytes of storage I don't recommend this game... especially at 30 dollars. Knowing what I know now, I should not have paid more than 5 dollars for this game because the developer just gave up on it and is hoping to go through the exact same mess with stardrive 2 instead of updating THIS.

												If I could give a sideways thumb, I'd give one.  I liked the game because it reminded me of Masters of Orion, except not turn based. That said, I'm willing to bet that there are games in the genre that pay MoO homage much better than this one.  The most striking thing about this game is it doesn't feel quite complete.  I was shocked to see that they were coming out with a sequel to it, mainly because I had a hard time believing that this game was finished.  Hours of playing it and I still haven't managed to finish a game.  They've released several updates for it, but the game still doesn't feel whole, even in its current state.I'd really like to give this game a thumb up, but an overall feeling of incomplete game design, and rushed development ruin it for me.  A good game, but not a great one.  Definitely doesn't live up to the original that started the genre.			"

												StarDrive, a really immersive and fun game you'll get hooked on almost immediately. Starting of as one of the sentient races, you need to colonize, harvest, supply and defend your very own existence from those who would crush it (in most cases, everyone!). Build and design your own layout of each ship, you can have multiple different designs, but remember that the more you put on it - the more costly it becomes.You can customize your race's special benefits at the game lobby screen, although it's Single-player only, it has a lot of interesting play methods.I sincerely recommend this to Sci-fi, Strategy, Slow-paced genre lovers. It won't let you down!			"

												I highly recommend this one. It is already well polished for an Early Access game and I daresay is better that some AAA titles that have been released in their final stages.The races are varied and interesting on it's own and it even allows you to customize them to suit your own needs while still remaining in a somewhat balanced state.The ship building is easy and fun, if I had one critique though, I wish there was a way to test my builds before seeing them utterly fail in battle because I didn't know how a module will react. That said, as it is now is plenty good enough to enjoy the game.Pros:- Playable and polished even in early stages, loads of fun to be had- Races are a joy to behold as they are varied and rather humorous in their depiction- Easy to learn, difficult to master makes this something even a newbie in the genre can pick up.Cons: *but this could change*- Currently, ship building doesn't have a way to test builds so guides might be necessary there- Increasing tax doesn't seem to have any negative impact at the moment or no value for measurement (ex: colonist morale)- Enemy ships don't display their insignia so it could take some practice to know who's fleet is whose in game.

												When I first purchased this game, I was very concerned when I read all the reviews. I should have known better than to purchase a game without reading the reviews. As stated by the reviews, the game was unplayable due to excessive bugs and lag when first downloaded. However, one thing that I have found very strange about this game is that the more you play it and the more you explore, the less likely bugs are to occur (kindof like the exact opposite of Minecraft). IDK if this happens on everyone's computer or if it is just a wierd quirk of mine, and I have no idea how this could happen in terms of programming, but for about the last hour of playtime (about at 10ish hrs.), I have never seen any lag or not registering clicks to the degree that I first experienced it in the game. I still have some pretty significant trouble with the game not registering my mouse clicks, but it has become at least playable, and the problem is now only a minor annoyance, unlike the total hairpulling frustration upon first download. Sometimes, due to lag, it still registers that I clicked on something that I moused over earlier, rather than what I actually have my mouse over at the time of the click. I wonder if a similar phenomenon caused the programmer(s) to think that the bugs were fixed when they were unable to reproduce reported bugs. If you have the patience for the bugs, the game itself isn't too bad. The ability to adjust your species for tactical, RP, or mixed  gameplay allows you to play a species according to your own interpretation of how they are or what they could be. I prefer a much more strategic and magical Vulfen to the brutish, early-game swarmers version that they are set to by default (retaining their militaristic tendancies, because IMO Vulfen aren't really Vulfen if they are too peaceful, but upon player preferance this could be changed too). It does have a fairly Star Trek/Babylon 5 type feel, which I very much appreciate. Diplomacy is critical, and there is a high degree of intrigue involved (though taking the few abilities and technologies for intrigue that exist will make it very simple, as max rank agents can pretty much do as they please at this point, only occasionally getting discovered or even foiled but not killed). Players should keep in mind, however, that there are few guides to this game, and the videos that are out there regarding this game often do not involve enough information to really give you the feel for things. With no tutorials missions, you will likely be completely lost in the beginning, even with deep research. For this reason, I would advise setting up your first species to give you a large margin for error. Additionally, I found race customization to be very confusing initially, but once you get it, it is very straightforward. I have come to enjoy the game in time, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this game for its current price. It is simply too high.			"

												I could go on for minutes apon minutes on how this game is dreary, drab and overpriced but I'm gonna keep it short. So lets begin.While the game isn't buggy or unpolished by any means, it's because of the majority of it's design is absolutley awful, not to say everything is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, just most of it. Like the music, a fundamental part of any strategy game whether it's Master Of Orion or Civilization, the music is there to make you feel like a commander of a thousand fleets or a cultured world leader, and in both of the games mentioned the game does a great job doing that. But in StarDrive it's... uhhh...♥♥♥♥♥♥ The music sucks♥♥♥♥♥ It's a bunch of dreary melodies with a few space feeling instrumentals but all of them lack any sense of excitment. And that's the main problem, this game lacks excitment... or fun... or a reason to exist.I like ProJared's description of the game in his One Minute Review of the game. Hopefully ProJared doesn't mind that I'm gonna quote him.""It's like they took Master Of Orion 2 and made it realtime and then SUCKED all the fun right out of it.""That sentence alone can describe the whole game. Really, I could've stopped over a paragraph ago because that perfectly describes this game. And did I mention how this game is as slow as a snail in molases in a slow motion field? Even on the highest speed setting before you start, everything goes so SLOOOOWWWWW that you get bored after five minutes, even with the slightly cool shipyard (I say slightly cool because the best ship designs are the presets so you'll never need to use the shipyard) and the very amusing races. The game is so drab that it counteracts the good, and the game IS UNFORGIVABLY UNFAIR, meaning even on the easiest difficulty the A.I will CRUSH YOU UNDER THEIR BOOTS OF UNBEARABLE CRUELTY AND DELERIUM.Long story short, don't buy this overpriced crap, buy Endless Space, or hell, If your feeling nostalgic go on GOG.com and pick up Master Of Orion 1+2 for £5 or less. Don't bear the same pain that I did.			"

												Star DriveThis is a pretty decent game. It runs in real time as do the space battles. Ships can be commanded in space battles for full control of targeting.Ship design is really neat. Hulls come as is and may be filled with all sorts of space combat goodies. THis is a cool part of the game.Tech research is pretty neat. There are not a lot of techs but what is there is good.The alien races are all distinct and filled with personality. There is also cusomization for your race if you want it. The developer moved on to their next game, Star Drive 2, and they are very active in that title. This game has all that is needed to wage war and conquer the stars. It may be missing some fleshed out things but the game is definitely playable and fun.Oh, and ground battles are turn based with control over each troop. Pretty cool.			"

												I've had a couple stability and speed issues with StarDrive despite plenty of memory and being well over the GPU and CPU requirements for the game. Starting the game for example takes several minutes before I even get the intro videos everybody always skips.Nonetheless, once in the game I generall have a great time. The AI can be overly aggressive, but it draws a good balance between races which attack weaker prey, races who declare war because they see you as a threat, and races who could be peaceful allies (on conquerable foes, depending on your gaming style.)I'd like to see some small additions, like the ability to save custom race settings and either have them in a droplist or loadable from a file like they already have for custom ship designs.I really enjoy StarDrive. If you like space conquest games, this one's a good buy.			"

												Basically its a space empires 4/5 with better graphics, also bears some resemblance to master of orion -> colony managment is quite similiar if nor borderline the same -> so if you liked those games you should like this one too -> but that said the game has some cons as well -> tech tree seems kinda limited -> but the game is highly modable via simple notepad if you care to do so (with some understanding how the coding works) so you can adjust it to your liking if you care to do so (imho a big plus), Ship behaviour can be annoying at times, also i find some control options to be lacking -> for eg you can select one cargo ship and set its destination and what should it carry but you can do the same en masse with several at once -> which can be annoying when you build 10 of them and have to adjust each one in the same manner aka takes time and it can get tedious, fighter bays cane be exaple of this -> i had 10 carriers -> and form each one i had to launch fighters manyally aka select it then click the icon in its tab -> you cant select them all and press one button for that -> it can be bothersome in battle conditions. Also colony managment can get tedious if you have a lot of them . So yes the game does have some flaws but imho its a good game also nice graphics ans sounds make it immersive -> im a great fan of this genre so i love it ;) but some ppl might not like it -> due to tediousness or relatively slow dynamic at first. Also the game dev moved on so expect no new stuff from him -> either mod it yourself or get some mods from the community.			"

Please, play into the game, then write reviews, don't tell other people it's bad because something doesn't really affect the gameplay.4. I do see some people complaining about theres no multiplayer mode and I personally want it have this mode. BUT do you mean this is a BAD GAME because it doesnt have a multiplayer mode?

												This game is an unpolished GEM. The gameplay is great, controlling the ship layout for your personal play style, and ability to modify your own race are just examples of how much control a player can have.Yes, like all games, it does have its bugs here and there. They have seemed minor from my perspective, and far from game breaking. Crashing is infrequent once you realize what settings your computer can handle as it is a hardware hungry game. Don't play with anything less than the reccomended equipment.There are some things that I would have loved to see done differently but I'm not the one who created the game, I'm a player that, like all other players, wants things in my favor. Things aren't breazy easy, you have to play and fight the challenges.I reccomend grabbing this game and accepting that it is a gem in the rough. I am looking forward to StarDrive 2!			"

Unfortunately, it does seem to crash late into the game and I could't get around that. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for this game, but if you can get it on sale like I did (75% off) I'd buy it again without question. It plays like Masters Of Orion 2, the graphics for the ships are pretty good, the gameplay is awesome. The Tech Tree could be a little more extensive, but I didn't have a problem with it.			"

												Very great game, interesting race designs, well made fleet to fleet comabt and a good interface. The only problem I have had is that te game recently has been very slow, at first it was only at late game when fleets of titans were locked in combat and ships being built on every planet but since October the  game has been difficult to play. However this is still a great gmae 8/10			"

												Basically its a space empires 4/5 with better graphics, also bears some resemblance to master of orion -> colony managment is quite similiar if nor borderline the same -> so if you liked those games you should like this one too -> but that said the game has some cons as well -> tech tree seems kinda limited -> but the game is highly modable via simple notepad if you care to do so (with some understanding how the coding works) so you can adjust it to your liking if you care to do so (imho a big plus), Ship behaviour can be annoying at times, also i find some control options to be lacking -> for eg you can select one cargo ship and set its destination and what should it carry but you can do the same en masse with several at once -> which can be annoying when you build 10 of them and have to adjust each one in the same manner aka takes time and it can get tedious, fighter bays cane be exaple of this -> i had 10 carriers -> and form each one i had to launch fighters manyally aka select it then click the icon in its tab -> you cant select them all and press one button for that -> it can be bothersome in battle conditions. Also colony managment can get tedious if you have a lot of them . So yes the game does have some flaws but imho its a good game also nice graphics ans sounds make it immersive -> im a great fan of this genre so i love it ;) but some ppl might not like it -> due to tediousness or relatively slow dynamic at first. Also the game dev moved on so expect no new stuff from him -> either mod it yourself or get some mods from the community.			"

												For all those who want to create their own intergalactic empire, this is the game to play. Granted it is kind of a diamond in the rough, but it still finds a way to be enjoyable.Building up your fleet with your very own creations is quite fun. The creation of a ship is deceptively easy, hard to pull off right and takes time to perfect. But once you see them in action it really is a sight to behold. The memorable races do give the game some much needed color though.Being a sandbox, it does howerver lack some direction.

												Played since Alpha so the 6h aren't exactly accurate.Let's put it easy, the game isn't bad. It isn't outstanding either. It has some nice ideas especially the shipdesigner is great, probably the best around and watching the spacebattles is real fun (I say ""watching"", because the pilots do not really need your help once the dogfight starts). On the other hand the empiremanagement is very unchallengeing, almost nothing to do and to put it blunt: Best you leave it to the AI so you can concentrate on the big picture.Now, what is the problem with this game? Why wouldn't I recommend it?Well my downgrade has nothing to do with the quality of the game itself, but with the simple problem that the developer didn't implement all the features promised, but instead realises them in a different version of the game named ""Stardrive 2"". I wouldn't complain if he simply made part 1 and then turned to work on a better part 2, like many other developers do. But he's implementing features in part 2 that were explicitly promised for part 1.So, downgrade for bad management. But if you enjoy ship desinging and watching space combat, you might give it a shot if you can get it for a 75% discount.			"

												Whether Steam has recorded them or not, I have sunk hours of time into this game with no regrets. Whilst it can be buggy at times, it is extremely enjoyably and rewarding. I found there to be stability issues when playing on larger galaxies, and the difficulty presets could use some tweaking, and it saddens me that this game receives so little attention and support for how fun it is. I enjoyed the whole experience of this game more than Endless space and FTL combined, and if you liked either of those games, I strongly recommend checking this one out.			"

												An excellent game! Very unique, although complex, an immensly fun time. After I got over the hefty learning curve (SINCE THEY DONT HAVE ANY USEFUL TUTORIALS!!!) I immediately fell in love with the game. Being able to manufacture my own ships for my own means is way more fun that I had imagined. Although there are some aspects to the game that is lacking, in particular the weak diplomacy system, the combat is thrilling, and taking over the galaxy is always a good time.Cons, as I stated the tutorials are just non-existant. The AI can be predictable if not boring. And frankly I'm not sure why they even implemented their diplomacy system. Maybe I just don't understand it's mechanics yet, but after playing for nine hours I feel like I should've mastered it, assuming it was functional. The lack of options within the menu can be annoying, there are no difficulty settings. The AI just automagically decide how hard they want to kill you. There are still a lot of annoying bugs. Specifically speaking, large capital ships tend to get ""stuck"" although their icons continue to move. Ships randomly decide they dont want to attack, but that's more infrequent.Overall, I give this game an 8/10. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is into large scale space battles.			"

Love the spaceship crafter and I love the depth involved with each planets colonization. Each faction is very interesting and customizable. This game doesn't need a beast of pc to run as well. The last note would be to buy the game when its on sale if your on the fence about the game. Watch some gameplay videos and that will really tell you if the game is for you. I also didn't run into a single bug/crash while playing.I have no clue why so many pc gamers complain about wasted money on a game they spent 100 plus hours on when most games that cost 60 dollars only give you like 20 hours of game play.

												So Stardrive has a lot going for it. The ability to design each ship piece by piece and then set their AI. Want a large slow ship with all weapons pointing forward to hammer other large ships? What about making it lighter and pointing all the weapons to the sides and have it strafe through destroying smaller ships? Swap out those weapons for fighter bays and launch swarms of fighter ships. Don't like cannons? Switch out to missiles or lasers. Load it with emp weapons to disable other ships or tractor beams to bring fast ships to a halt and rip them apart with cannon fire.Each race oozes with their own personality. From samuri space bears to mechanical hive mind of the Opertis.Build a grand empire of planets. Forge treaties and even a federation with long time allies. The diplomacy system is not ground breaking but quite adequate.The only down side, and it's a big one, is the slow down you experience late game. No matter how beastly your PC is the game is going to crawl latter on when each race has hundreds of ships and are duking it out with each other.			"

												Another entry in the booming ""4x Space Strategy"" genre being populated by both established development teams and indies, StarDrive comes to the table burdened by a negative reputation but with more than a few strengths in its corner. No one will deny that StarDrive was released way too early to the public. It was buggy, incomplete, and, as a result, it entirely deserved the low scores it received.Since release, however, the developers have worked hard to plug the holes and fill the gaps. The game is now, especially on sale, one that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre. The strongest differentiator that sets StarDrive apart from competitors is the ship design. While some games allow you to choose your ship's weapons or shields, in StarDrive you build a ship from an empty hull to a bristling space cruiser. You select exactly where you want bulkheads, power plants, command centers, weapon banks, and sheild generators to be placed. As the research tree fills in, you'll open up even more opportunities to build new, larger hulls or moditfy your existing blueprints. Another area I enjoyed in StarDrive was the factions. Each faction is extremely unique in design and carries with it a lot of flavor. Whether your negotiating with the honorable but militant pandas or the robotic faction that's enslaved a race of owls - you'll find interactions to be a lot more interesting than the sterile diplomacy of many other games in this genre. In the end, StarDrive is exactly what it sets out to be: a 4x Space Strategy game with a robust ship builder and real time combat. If that sounds like it's up your alley, then I think you won't be dissapointed.			"

												StarDrive will provide a fix you've been craving all these years since MoO2.  Is it the complete experience you've long for? Unfortunately, no, probably not.  However, a good selection of features, and the module layout based ship creator, allow for some classic MoO style fun and enjoyment.The original launch of the game in early access had some issues from what I've read, but StarDrive was one of those games on my ""To Play"" list for almost a year before finally coming around to it after the latest patch (1.15 of this writing).  The core gameplay is there, but a tech tree that's lacking much depth is probably the most glaring flaw I've experienced in my playthroughs.This lack, thankfully, can be remedied with a mod which adds much more MoO-like tech tree into the game.  The current non-mod tech layout allows for a very balanced approach that was likely intended for multiplayer(which as of yet hasn't surfaced), with early ship designs still being marginally useful against even high tech ships late in the game.  For fans of MoO2 and it's tech singularity that often happened late game (Psilons, anyone?), this is a mixed blessing.As mentioned earlier, the ship creator is the main feature of the game, and the one I've had the most enjoyment from.  Going in blind, you'll come up with design iteration after iteration, and love each one as much as the one before.  Every module has a certain length and width that you try and shoehorn into the various ship hulls, with each race having a specific design.  There's generally an overall ""feel"" for each race's ships (such as long, relatively narrow hulls that allow for greater head on armor layouts for Terrans, or a greater number of possible weaponry on Kulrathi), and even the actual shape of the ship's hull can have very drastic effect when combat comes to your fleets.There is a slew of ease of use features in the game which makes play more friendly on the UI front.  Unfortunately, a lack of any decent game provided documentation makes some of these a complete secret until they're stumbled upon and discovered.  Definately do some searching for UI tips and tricks for this one.The tougher AI levels allows for some challenge, but expect the game to be a fairly easy breeze until you design some better ships for the AI to utilize.  The game has some of the spark of MoO, but it's not a drop-in replacement for it.Overall, I'm in love with StarDrive for what it is, not what it was promised or wished to be.  At it's core, it's engaging and enjoyable.  Hopefully the next offering from Zero Sum will be full spiritual successor that we long for, but this one is better than most MoO clones that pop up now and again.			"

												Buyer beware, this is not a console game. Expect deep gameplay, a steep learning cuve, and tons and tons of fun. Expect to spend 10-20 hours just learning how the game plays. When you do though, you will have a thouroughly engaging experience that is nearly 100% customizable. Build your own ships, customize what each planet does, engage in EPIC space battles. This is the 4X we've been waiting for since MoO2.			"

Ship customization gives you full control over the speciality of your fleets and allows you to adapt to enemy ships!			"

												If you want a great space game then go buy Distant worlds over at matrix games. Meanwhile this game on the other hand has 'Zero' content, funny enough the dev is also called Zero - Guess he knew he was gonna give Zero commitment on this project and then drop it for a new game as soon as he had the cash.Stay away & save your money.

												I really liked this game.  There are a few bugs in it but it has a large tech tree and the AI is decent.  Designing ships in this game is one of my favorite things as there are plenty of different ways to build a decent ship.  It took a bit to get used to but it's not as terrible to learn as a lot of these indi 4x games.			"

												Oh, StarDrive. Where do I start with you? You're the most promising space-themed Strategy game I've played, and that's both good and bad. You can be challenging at times, and despite having the re-playability of a 10 year-old's view of Peace and War, terrible, the fact that you are updated once every now and then has me sitting in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering, ""What will be next?"" This game has far to go before reaching the elite status, but the steps it must take are simple things to add. This game has one play mode, Sandbox, in which starting out, you have one planet and a few spaceships, and you must find a way to colonize beneficial planets on the road to galactic empire. Other alien species will be right next door, and your actions can (possibly) decide whether or not war will ensue. There is a full tech tree and a very simple, yet important management system that you, as leader, must lead. Sweet and ultimate victory will not be achieved until every species you meet is either your friend (boring) or completely eradicated to the point of extinction (yay). If you decide to be an Adolf Hitler, you can with the ability to bombard any planet's (and I mean ANY) surface with nuclear weapons and murder every last thing that resided there. Did I mention there is also a full ship constructor as well? You can create your own vision of whatever the Super Star Destroyer was in Episode VI of Star Wars during the two minutes it was on screen, and giant, flying pieces of metal with a million death rays are always fun. But this game is SOOOO repetitive! Every game you start up will have the same sequence of events happen, and no matter what you do, they always seem to take place. There's no multiplayer(Note to creator of StarDrive: Make this happen!), and even with mod support, what is in the game to be modded will take a LOT of creativity to make something out of. This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but in order for a consumer to get his/her money's worth PLEASE wait for a sale(like me). ZeroSum, you have a rough diamond here, and polishing has been done, but it is far from the Hope Diamond. 7.25/10.			"

												Three words - samurai space bears. What the f*ck else do you need?!But on a serious note, in a nutshell this game is a mix of Endless Space and Sins Of The Solar Empire, taking best from both worlds, and topping it with a very neat ship building system and really the BEST diplomatic window style and animations i've ever seen in a game. Those are not just blank avatars of another empire, but real, moving and incredibly realistic animations. This may sound weird, but it is exactly what makes this game so lively, in addition to nice soundtrack and a unique personality of each faction. You feel who you play against and who are you playing yourself in this big galaxy.			"

												I been wasting a ton of time(fun time) in fact about 354 steam record hours(not steam play throw in many more hours). I simply love this space space strategy game. its almost like old school turn base but its real time. so use pause alot when clicking on some things. reminds me of starcontrol and starcontrol two. But you can built a empire!Ship design is for me the heart of the game, ship hulls are different for different civilizations. The fun part is how you use different components into the ship design to beat the other civilizations. since they have access to the same tech research as you. seeing your superior designs destroy them!! LIke a fleet of meat into your meatgrinder!For example my favorite is the Kulrathi aka bearmen their ships might not be the fastest(not too many engine slots, you can put in different type of engines into that slot). but their fighter are the largest in the game. I love putting in fighter bays(they spawn fighters(free fighters)) into all my Titan ships(they are the largest hull type every civilization gets, each civilization has different sizes and shapes of that hull). I love putting in remnant shields onto the fighters and tons of weapons and no wrapdrive only thrust. They can be respawn from the carrier. Park the carrier slightly farther away from the fighting. wave after wave of fighters just destroy anything in their path.With many patches later they fix the Remnant quest. Also remnant tech is always the most powerful in game. There are a few mods out there but the ones that still out there is fun.			"

Stardrive is a lot of fun if you like strategy games.  The only negative I can find is that the highest difficulty setting is insanely weighted to favor NPCs (You will be attacked early and they get a huge discount to ship cost and a huge bonus to production which is needed to make ships).

												This game is very unpolished, but still fun.(A lot of things are fixed by two mods I use, the 'Black Box' mod and the Tech Level Mod)1. Ship designing:This is excellent; module positioning really matters in combat. If you fill the interior with lots of reactors, they'll blow up when destroyed and will probably destroy your ship from the inside out.Shields are not 'all around' your ship but instead only protect areas they're near to, so don't forget to place lots of armour to soak up the hits that get through.There really aren't enough ship hulls and modules; each empire only gets 1 hull for each hull type (i.e. frigate, cruiser, battleship, titan etc.). Reactors never get an upgrade. Sub-light maneuvering speeds are much too low.2. AI:The AI for the other players is poor - they don't expand very much and they have a tendency to get angry about every single system you colonise. They are very, very bad at fighting and will only cause you trouble if you ignore your military for the entire game (which they'll also taunt you for doing). Their art however is really nice and each empire has its own set of ship types.There's a nice automation dialogue that lets you automate the building and usage of scouts, freighters, and subspace projectors.3. Research:Research feels a little slow for me. The tech tree is pretty sparse and could use some more mid/end-tier stuff.There are two (maybe three?) 'discovered' secret techs which appear according to what you do in the game. This is something the developer never got around to adding more of, which is a real shame.4. Early Access 'dev didn't implement X':I hear this a lot, and it seems to make up most of the reviews here. This game does feel like the dev gave up when it was 80% finished. I didn't buy this game in Early Access (Humble Bundle had it for $4) so if you're not sure, buy this on sale.			"

												  Good game, IF, you like 4x strategy games. I am a fan of this game but there could be a lot more to it seeing how old it is. However for the time, effort, and abilities of Zerosum Games it is a good game. There are ups and downs to the game. (A lot of downs)  There are a few bad things about the game though. First there are some lag issues and stability problems. The game lags a bit when a lot of action is going on in a large galaxy. Second is mods. The whole game relies on mods at this stage to keep players interested and the game has a open mod folder to simply load one into. The website even comes with a tutorial on how to mod the game. Third is you have to be very meticulous to see what is going on when and where.   The game focuses more on combat than economy or events. The game has events but none have any significance or really game changing results whether that'd be good or bad. Events have changed over the year this game has officialy been out, that means a few events were removed, others added or tweeked. Economy is good but needs more to it as well. The game has two resources, food and production. Food is used to feed your race and production is used from building structures to ships. Other than that it doesnt get any more complicated. The only tricky thing about economies is taxing and distributing resources.   Combat offers a lot to the game seeing how that is the soul focus of gameplay. Ships can be custom designed with a traditional grid pattern and using moduels to fill them in. The possibilities are practicaly endless when it comes to combat.   Dev did abandon the game unfortunatly. After the full game came out updates have become rare. The game has absolutely no purpose but sort of sandbox game letting you do as you please. The only downside to that is there is no story to the game, no story or big explanation about the mysterious ""Remnant"" race. All we get as far as story to any AI alien race is a short three sentence paragraph FROM the AI. And all we get for story behind the ""remnant"" is a short mini event quest that, when summed up, gives literaly a short two paragraph explanation on them.   The game feels very open and at times too open. There needs to be more content before this becomes a real game because at this stage it does seem like a very high quality app than a full game.			"

												Time for some positive reinforcement. Star Drive a unique 4x game in that it does everything in real time. Now, Sins of a Solar Empire did the same, but get this: no phase lines here!  Go any where you want! This can lead to some preformance issues, as when you have transport ferrying things between planets and a  fleet fighting a bunch of ships at the same time things can slow down a bit. Also keep in mind this is not Space Empires, the rules here are differnt, you will have a bit of a learning curve here to learn the rules of this game. The Galaxy is also kinda bland. There are not many features in it besides Planets and Stars, you will not be encountering asteroids, a  Black Hole, or nebulas.However, the game it's self is fun and worth a look if you are a fan of 4X space games. The ability to design your own ships is nice, and the game has some cool visual effects. The differt empires you come across are full of character and varied.  The same planet rush situation is present in this game, grab what you can when you first start, but make sure you chose rigth and supply the planet with food until it can produce on its own!Cons-  not all features in when it first came out-  tech tree not that extensive... but there are mods you can easly add in.-  Map has planets and Stars, not a whole lot more then that. Pros-  Unique real time 4X game for those of you tired of hitting the end turn button. ships go boom.-  Exploring the galaxy and encountering the races is alwasys fun in this game.-  Mod support. -  Designing your own ships is fun.All in all, this is a decent game.....

												Sadly this game requires you to have all the techs and what nots to even stand up to a simple opponent. Somehow the independent systems are so far ahead of you even on the start of the game that they pose more of a threat than the real ones. And this is on the simplest of the settings. If you are looking for a serious strategy game, look elsewhere. This is more fluff than actual game. The 3D fighting is, disappointing. Galactic Civilization II or Sins of a Solar Empire are far better executed.This was sadly a waste of money, not time as it should have been.			"

Pros-  Unique real time 4X game for those of you tired of hitting the end turn button. ships go boom.-  Exploring the galaxy and encountering the races is alwasys fun in this game.-  Mod support. -  Designing your own ships is fun.All in all, this is a decent game..... When its on sale. I don't know about the $30 price tag. But if you are willing to support an indie developer with some cool ideas then give it a shot.			"

												A nifty little game. Sure its a little buggy, is missing many features and lags pretty bad during the endgame, but if we only focus on the negatives in life we end up like Hitler, or Cersei Lannister.The good features far outweigh the bad, and I have had a brief addiction with this game. THE most fun thing to is obviously the ship design. In my experience, you can take the basic frieght ship from the start of the game, outfit it with nuclear reactors, and then crash them into the enemy. You can create ships, that spew out dozens of tiny fighter drones. You can create ships bristling with poisonous spores, and then bombard your helpless enemies ground forces. You can assume direct control over titan ships, driving them like Jesse Pinkman in the Need for Speed movie. You can launch an armada of mobile space marines that can board and control enemy ships. I could keep going for a long time. Every piece of this game isn't just a statistic that somehow affects the game. If you research something, you will be able to see it, and use it. If you give some technology to another race, they will remember your kindness (even if they remember it as they are using that same technology to annihalate you).Ive gone on for longer than i intended which just goes to show how much I like this game. In summary, StarDrive is an acquired taste. Like Dark Souls, coffee or Selena Gomez.			"

												I really like this game so far and recommend it to any 4x space fans.It is very lacking in the controllable options. Supposedly that will be updated. You can set video and play in a window which is good. It lets you watch certain info screens without auto pausing. You CAN pause, but you don't have to. It does not allow you to alt-tab unpaused. I hope they'll add that as an option.. When I am playing Stardrive, I play with twitter and such on my second screen, and would like if the game would continue to tic. Time is slow in outer space.

												I know there are a lot of negative reviews about this game but i can't see why ,StarDrive is a great game and very addictive, I prefer it over it's sequel which is basically endless space plus the ability to watch ships get boarded, which is pretty cool. I'd say StarDrive is a mix between endless space and supreme commander, there's a kinda turn timer and you have to build your units in real time.However, fair warning it will lag your computer a lot when you eventually get to having big battles and if you ever activate the in game story (It's kind of a story) and you don't have cruiser class ships everywhere you will die horribly.

												I found the game to be quite enjoyable if a bit rough on the edges.  The one downfal is how essential your starting placement is.  Dont have enough early colony's available with some expansion planets in them you will have a severe disadvantage moving forward.  That said, the long game is just that, long.  Expect to dedicate time to keeping your fleet up to date and include it in your stratagey.  Multiple smaller fleets are the way to push ahead so one can be out expanding your empire while another is defending it while another is being refit.  All in all I do say a 60% is a deserving score, and not bad for a first game out.  While there are better 4X games out there, I dont feel I got shorted on what I payed.  Put more than enough hours in to justify the money.  Its a shame that he has to scrap the whole game to change direction, but making the move to turn based in the sequil will play better with the modular ship design.			"

												StarDrive gameplay takes place in real time. During skirmishes with opponents a player can take direct control of any unit subordinate to it, which greatly enlivens the battle. The creators also took care of the possibility of customization of weapons and equipment of each spacecraft. With the appropriate modules, each of the spacecraft can be adapted to specific tasks (for example,. Putting mines, shielding other units, transportation of raw materials). The game is distinguished by aesthetic visuals. Attention is drawn primarily attractive views of space and animated feature films cutscenes. As a minus I add - no optimization of the game.

It just gets in the way of space combat!Diplomacy is straightforward; AI will either friend you, or declare war right off the bat. Makes things interesting. Although, the only way to win is to kill everyone. Even your friend, Mr. Treesong.Racial graphics look very nice, sort of a high quality Flash display with artistic flair.Space weapon effects are pretty good, especially the laser turrets.

Posted: January 3, 2015
												Having no idea of what the game was ""supposed"" to be, I simply bought the game expecting a fancier ""MOO2"" so to speak.    And given the negative reviews I kept reading about it, I lowered my expectations greatly and bought the game on massive sale.Once I actually played the game, I actually wound up enjoying it quite a bit.   I can't recall how many hours I've spent and how many ""races"" I've created in trying the game.  I'll try to rate the game on a 5-star system on each of the areas that I can think of:1.) Graphics - 4/5- I truly enjoyed the graphics.  I really did.  Being able to zoom in to my ships, the combat animations, the effects of each weapon being unique in their own right.  I especially like the unique ship designs for each race which attempted to match their species.  A little cliched, but then again, what game isn't nowadays?2.) UI - 3/5- Simple enough and inuitive.  A few grips would be on some screens where it seems like the UI was designed with a different resolution in mind.  I have an old monitor only capable of 1280 x 1024 and it stuggles on the setup screen due to odd text wrapping.  Other than that however, I felt the UI easy enough to navigate.3.) Gameplay - 3.5/5- I found myself in several sleepless nights playing that ""one more turn"" (or in this case, one more minute given it's real time).  The racial creation allows for varied types of empires to play around with and with each game randomizing the different empires behavior, it's always been a treat for me.  However, there is one glaring bug around the ""plot"" where if the AI winds up wiping out the triggers, you're SoL if that was your main goal for that particular round of gameplay.  I've actually had to go in to the XML save files to try to re-trigger the events which is never a good sign.  Still, that plot isn't the end-all-be-all of the game and isn't a deal-breaker for me.  - Another nice twist is the actual race creator.  Unlike a true ""creator"", you simply overwrite a species for the current game.  However, any designs you create while playing that ""race"" become available to the AI in succeeding games so you eventually wind up fighting your own designs which was a real treat when I saw it happen.- Related to gamelay, there are a few things which could have been improved on in my opinion.   Tech Tree, for one, is smaller compared to other 4X games.  It only feels large due to the amount of research points needed to unlock higher tiers.  The AI also sometimes behaves oddly despite their racial setting at game time (i.e. an Honorable AI will sometimes keep stealing from you despite being in an non-agression pact).4.)  Replayability - 3/5- I admit I keep replaying the game.  For me, it's been enjoyable.  However, I do see 2 problems which can hinder it in other cases:   a) Memory optimization: unlike other RTS games (which this game has flavors of), there is no unit cap other than your bank account (i.e. turn-by-turn income).  This is both a blessing and curse.  This means that you can build up quite the fleet and swarm your way through the galaxy.  Unfortunately this also means unless you've got godly amounts of RAM (and I'm talking 16+ GB of RAM), your game can quickly grind to a halt and crash as the AI will spam ships like no tomorrow.   Even the ""final plot story"" can break your game should you unlock it given that it also spams ships like no tomorrow (without the limitation of a factory's output to slow it down).  Related to this, beware of designing ""cheap"" gunboats.  As the race creator ""overwrites"" a species, any design you create becomes available to that AI race and it tends to favor spamming those cheap gunboats.   b) No multiplayer.  I never expected this feature as I never was an early backer.  I can see how this would put off others as the challenge of beating down your frenemies always extends the life of a game.  The lack of this feature can put off many people from getting the game.   c) Lack of a real ""custom"" race.  MOO2 had the same issues but it would have been nice to have a custom race that didn't overwrite existing ones.5.) Overall - 3/5- I liked MOO3.  Yes, I said it.  I actually came to like game.  StarDrive feels like what MOO3 tried to be.  4X strategy with RTS gameplay.  StarDrive for me is an enjoyable single-player 4X game which allows for some small to medium scale games.  Large games are completely out of the question due to the memory problem which would have raised the game to 4/5 or me.  If you ignore what was originally promised and take the game for what it is now, it's actually worth a try.I would purchase it when it's at least 50% off given the isssues and replayability challenges it may give others.   For the current price of $32.99 CDN, I would instead spend it on Space Empires V or Pandora as they have a bit more replayability for most in my opinion.			"

This is a 4x game unlike any other that I have played (many, many 4x games). There is space battles, ground battles, artifacts, and a backstory that develops as you progress through the game. I don't know what the game was like before it was patched and fixed, but this game, as it is now, is a really enjoyable game that I keep going back to over and over again.			"

												I feel compelled to review this game as it has been recieving alot of hate due to claims that the developer had promised more content and had since reneged, which if true is of course morally reprehensible. However from an objective standpoint i can't possibly call it a bad game, quite the opposite. As a person who doesn't play alot of strategy games but enjoys a select few, i not only think this game is excellent but my favorite space strategy game that I have ever played. The controls and interface are both simple and easy to use/learn, the graphics are excellent (for an indie game) and the diplomacy is amazing where you start in a neutral position and actually have options besides war against some races. The ship building is deep and complex and requires alot of thought and balancing. The whole game is exceptionally balanced (weapons, armor, species creation) and finally the races are varied and each have their own distinct personallity. If I have any gripes it would be that the ""tutorial"" doesn't really tell you much and there is alot you will need to figure out yourself (or google). I for one am looking foward to the sequel and also hope the developer has learned his lesson from all the negative reviews.			"

												Great game but it never lived up to its full potential.  Issues in late game playing make this game problematic but it is saved somewhat by the mods produced by the community, which expand upon its content and stability.  A game worth $9.99 and not a penny more, especially since the second is just around the corner.			"

												Very fun game, not all aspects polished but its fun. What ive heard is that the developer gave up on it though, so even though it looks like its a multiplayer game, it isnt. (There is even a convenient slot for where multiplayer would have been). The tech tree could use work, but hey thats what mods are for! Its a fun game if you like games like civ 5 and ones like that. I would of been a much better game if the developer actually cared about his own creation. YOU DONT LEAVE A CHILD ON THE STREET DO YOU?  Someone take over development!			"

												TL/DR: An average 4X game with a few charming features counterpointed by an overall feeling of an incomplete game.I picked up StarDrive through a bundle pack and I admit that after about half an hour I metaphorically put the game back on the shelf for a couple of months before trying it again in earnest.The learning curve is steep and the limited in-game help is definitely not intuitive, I wound up having the wiki and forums open on my second monitor and tabbing out to it every few minutes until I finally got the basics (about 8 hours and several games in).The Ai is... childlike, it's incredibly easy to trick and throws a diplomatic tantrum at the drop of a hat. It felt like I was playing against a group of stroppy children (not helped by the Pollop race's dialog) and after a while it ceased being humerous and just became annoying.The space combat is... interesting, the developers have obviously tried to use newtonian physics in the combat and it actually does feel quite good.... until your cruiser power-slides round a planet or your ships refuse to orbit a planet.The ground combat is..... horrific, and not in an amusing way either. it's clunky and feels like a bad browser game interface.The ship customisation though is a serious strong point for this game and for me it almost outweighs all the annoyances and the learning curve. I probably spent almost as much time in the shipyard over the past couple of days as I have actually playing the game.The tech tree and progression is okay, though it's pretty obvious that half the tech concepts are inspired by, if not simply ripped from, the Star Trek universe. Polaron, phasor (yes, they just swapped an e for an o), disruptor etc.In summary, if you get it with a bundle or you REALLY want to try it and it's a slow weekend then go for it. For all it's issues, I found the experience enjoyable overall... even if I probably won't be playing the game any more.			"

												I love games like this. I wanted to like this game. I don't. There's probably a good game in there somewhere. The biggest problem is I couldn't get past the interface to get to the game that I wanted to like so much. The 3d graphics look very nice and are very well done, but at the expense of gameplay. It's far too easy to click on the wrong thing, and when you finally get it you're not sure what to do with it. This may have been easily remedied with some-holding on the developer's part, but the ""tutorial"" is almost nonexistent, just a bunch of static pages hanging off of the main menu that do little to describe what's going on.My biggest disappointment isn't with what this game is. It has obviously had alot of effort and care poured into it. My biggest disappointment is what it could have been with just a little more.			"

												Don't buy this game.  Instead buy the sequel Stardrive 2.This game had a lot of great ideas and a lot of potential, but fell down because it tried to do it all on what screen.  This resulted in massive lag issues latter game.The sequel makes some things turn based, and puts combat into instances, which makes everything run so much smoother and lets the developer's great ideas shine through.

												This game is obviously out of date, so my review is obviously too late as well. However, I've bought the game, and now played the game, and so I review the game. It's too damned slow. It takes hours to get your single-player, one-shot empire going, and then it takes even MORE hours to prosecute any wars you get into. The ships take a week and a half to turn around and most of the time they ignore orders or at least show no sign of receiving said orders. I'm forced to constantly click them towards any planet I want bombarded, and then they ignore anyway, and attack useless enemy ships that will affect NOTHING in the game. I just ended up CTRL-ALT-DELing the game to close it because it also takes hours to open and close. I'd delete it from the system, but that will probably take hours too, so I'll wait until I go to sleep to do that.			"

												Looks great: design your race and your ships, automatize fleet building and colony management, conquer the galaxy or forge a galactic alliance. But then you send your flagship to check out the nearest planet and before you realize what's going on, it's destroyed. No auto-pause, no ""you are under attack"" warning and when you select the flagship and see it going red, it takes forever to get into the action and do something about it. Thanks, but no thanks.

												Edit: Having played the game for more than a couple of hours, I see the game falling apart in my hands. Glitches, crashes, saves corrupting, it all sucks. The basic gameplay is fun, but the game is unfinished, as-in prelaunch. It's a beta, not a finished product. The developers have completely moved onto a sequel instead of finished the game they already produced, and the reviews I'm hearing for that game sound exactly like this review. User content patches do what they can, but they can't finish the game for the producers.The overall gameplay is fun, if you can get past the awkward GUI.Ship building is complicated and fun. Building and conquering is well balanced. I just can't get past the GUI.Frankly, the GUI in this game is terrible, it's my number one complaint of this whole game. This is strange coming from the developers of Endless Space which has a perfect, smooth, awesome GUI. What's wrong with the GUI you ask? Several things.-Clicking on a button doesn't ""always"" click it. It just doesn't respond... it just.... doesn't....-Opening and closing the windows is awkward. The close button changes locations on every screen and disappears completely on others. -They tried to integrate some UI stuff from Endless Space, such as right clicking a window to make it close. However, it's not availble on every screen, so it just takes some testing and memorizing to find out which screen closes with right click which screen doesn't.-Information on several screens is just a mess, while on others it's just a massive block of text. Nothing seems to be organized very well or effeciently.-Ship selection is the biggest complaint I have of the GUI.      -You can make control groups just fine, but shift + # doesn't add the current selection to the #'d control group. Having the control group you want to add to selected and shift+click-drag doesn't help either because that selects non-military ships as well.     -You can't unselect a ship from the selection panel in the bottom left corner.     -Ships move at different speeds, but there's no way to make a fleet/control group to move at the speed of the slowest ship.Overall, it just feels strange to navigate the UI. Some may call this nit-picking, but I don't. A game like this needs a smooth and fluid UI to be able to manage everything easily and quickly, while getting all the information you need on the fly. This game does not deliver on that.Another con of this game is the sound design. When ships are fighting, most of the time, you don't hear anything at all. Sometimes you hear the ship firing, and you get a 1/100 chance for the sound of the weapons firing to BLOW OUT your speakers. Turning the volume down doesn't help because then you can't hear any of the other sounds in the game. So, inevitablly, you just end up turning off the sound completely to avoid the jump scare every few minutes.After muddling through this game's crummy GUI, getting my ears checked by my doctor, and reloading the game through the crashes and the MASSIVE glitches, I'd give this game a D. Would not recommend this headache.			"

												It has good promise. It has good looks.It unfortunately lacks polish.The game is unfinished in many regards, but to me more than anything else is the balancing system within it. It just doesn't feel rounded out well enough to truly be considered finished. There are some bugs, glitches, and at times a good deal of rough edges to it. The gameplay is clunky, its approach leaves it too easy to overlook the time spent and the overal mechanics are hit and miss. That issue of the feel hits me in two regards, and the major one is how the empire grows and develops feels forced, and does it in a way that makes growth sluggish untill you hit a stage of performance where you just jump leaps and bounds. the staggering hiccup there just jarrs the whole gameplay on edge. It shows in combat if you don't hit the growth right before the AI does and you try combat.Specifically the combat. systems designed to fulfil certain roles just don't. Many instances of the combat I am frustrated with how the AI will always outperform the player, and even on basic combat levels it shows to a starkingly annoying degree. The fleet system and ship controls on it sound good, but lacking that final polish to really make it a good system leaves much to be desired in combat - especially if you need to travel with ships capable of different speeds.I like the lpooks, some of the mechanics are done well I think - but lacking that balance and refinement to really turn this into a good game.If you want to see, wait for a good sale maybe, but I would argue just stay away.

												I reccomend it only in that you will have a fun game if you can keep the enemy from getting remenant technology and forcing a wonder victory on you. This game has a modding scene and they can help you out with that problem. A real plus for me is that you can copy the game and stick it on a thumbdrive and it works without steam. So if anything you can buy this one for the ability to build an offline library for your computer games. Like say if you travel a lot or cannot afford a constant internet connection. I don't think they patched this yet. Though if you like strategy games and are looking for an offline game, go buy Planetary Annihilation from the Uber Entertainment store. Not from Steam, if you want an offline copy for yourself to enjoy with the ability to host a LAN party. Star Drive does not have multiplayer local or otherwise. I'm on the fence about reccomending this, buy at your own risk. You can still have a load of fun with it though, perhaps wait for a sale or get Star Drive 2 if you don't care about DRM. Steam is DRM but it's only as restrictive as the developers want it to be, I do not know the DRM status of Star Drive 2.			"

												i really enjoyed this game.  put alot of time into it and really enjoyed the content and the unique style that the creator brought to the genre.  however i feel that this creator can not be trusted as he left this game with many bugs that were never fixed or resolved as he moved onto stardrive 2.  I hope that he does not repeat that in star drive 2.			"

												This game is a lesson in bad management and bad design practice.You simply do not promise features in a game if you cannot deliver them.  You can publish a list of features that you desire to add if possible, but you only promise the core elements.  And then once in production, you do not just abandon the project to start a new game, especially a sequel.  It is an unwritten contract between the dev and the buyer that you will deliver a working game with as few bug as possible.As this game exists, the dev simply wasted to many development hours on a single feature.  The ship designing options in this game are hands down one of the best that I have seen.  You have so much control within the constraints put in place.  However, the whole purpose of a ship design is to utilize it in its function, typically combat.  And while combat is decent and some what fun, you need an economy to support it, and Stardrive simply does not have a well working economic model.  In fact, the game ends up punishing you for the 1st 30 min to hour of play.  1st by making you feel like you need to grind a bunch of base technologies just to be capable of performing the basic functions of a 4x game.  You will need new planets to expand you economic abilities, but you will feel you need 4 technologies before you can successfully colonize a planet: a food tech, a production tech, an income tech, and the ability to expand on to prohibited terrain.  However, if you focus on these techs to quickly start expanding, the AI comes and smacks you around because your military is weak.  So lets say you focus on military techs (like guided missiles and armor; yah, no armor before this tech), your units are capable of carrying a basic fight, but the AI has now colonized any half-decent planet on the map.  But then you say to yourself, I've got a big military I will just invade a weaker AI.  Welp, hope your like rebels suddenly poping up on your worlds with no prior indication of unrest because your income rate cannot support even a half decent fleet unless you colonize new worlds.  But wait you say, I'll just build a smaller but higher tech fleet; nope.  Not enough fire power to successfully invade a AI held world because unsuprisingly the AI has a fleet just as big if just a bit smaller but like 3x the troops you were able to build.  And all of this early game will determine whether you will win or loose late game.However, this is not to say you cannot do well.  If you get lucky, the random map has placed habitable planets as neighboring systems, given you one of the less aggressive races as a neighbor, and not block those systems with hostile drones.  If you can survive this early game, the game can be a good bit of fun.  At least up until some late game bug or unfixed feature ends your fun.A game should not punish players for trying to perform the tasks the game demands or make them slog through a list of Techs that can make or brake their game just to successfully perform those tasks.

												This game is what I’ve always wanted out of a RTS, the game play is intuitive and extremely strategic. It does go to mention that I simple could not spend more than 3 hours trying to wrestle the unoptimised lag covered game play in which I had. This game is my dream and this is why it hurts me so much to see it unfinished. PLEASE Finish it I beg of you.			"

												Looks great: design your race and your ships, automatize fleet building and colony management, conquer the galaxy or forge a galactic alliance. But then you send your flagship to check out the nearest planet and before you realize what's going on, it's destroyed. No auto-pause, no ""you are under attack"" warning and when you select the flagship and see it going red, it takes forever to get into the action and do something about it. Thanks, but no thanks.

												It's a lot like MOO3 but it doesn't suck quite as much.  Though, I'm pretty sure it was actually aiming for more of a MOO2 feel (well, because it flagrantly copies MOO2).Many have criticised this game for not living up to expectations.  For me, it far exceeded my expectations but I was expecting almost nothing from a 1 man show developer working on an entirely derivative project.  It isn't the definitive 4x experience but I found it worthwhile and I really liked the spaceship customization feature.  I would play a sequel or buy an expac.			"

												From the brief time of early access to the first release of the game, there was no new update, since then, it has only been minor tweaks, few and far between. Before early access, there was promises of a fully fleshed out experience. During early access, those promises remained. A few moments after first release, the dev stated that he will no longer be working on this game, so he may have time on his newer game which will be almost exactly like this game, only in a different engine, and hopefully better. He has also said that he plans to give all those who have bought StarDrive a discount on his next game, whenever it's released on Steam. Who knows how much of a discount that will be. Take a risk, buy this game discounted heavily in hopes that it will make the next game cheaper than the full priced original. Play this as the alpha that will never be finished. Don't buy this as a finished game, or even one that you expect future development on.			"

												Take it as is, or leave it.  It's not changing much.  Mods can make a difference.  I noticed some saying something about multiplayer not being implemented.  Multiplayer?  There's a multiplayer mode?  Meh.  I'm a singleplayer type of gamer when it comes to RTS.Yes, clearly there is a feeling that this game is unfinished or severely lacking polish.  The dev may have dropped work on it as well... That said, if you can get a demo try that, if you like what you see, wait for a Steam sale to knock off 15-20$ before you buy, then peruse the mod community.  On a scale from 1 to Awesome, I give it a Meh+.  It did have so much potential.... looks so almost cool it hurts.			"

												An absolute blast.Stardrive is one of the many 'space-sims' currently on the market.Expand. Research. Build. Conquer.The same thing in all of them pretty much and i had alot of problems deciding wich one i'd settle with.Sure. This one might not have the graphics but it has alot of gameplay value. I love it and it didnt take long before it became my favorite space-sim.Mostly because of the sole fact that you can build your own spaceships. Decide what components goes where and strategically place the guns, engines, armor, fuel, batteries, sheilds, ammo, mass fabricators, wires, command modules... And the list goes on and on.Research and always be one step ahead of the enemy in various fields. Wether you try to improve the economy and food production or expansion. Wether that'd be by force or settleing on uncharted worlds.But building those capital-ships with onboard nukes. Boarding parties. Massive guns and fighter hangars? Wow. I love spending hours upon hours deciding the tiniest detail on my newest weapon of war.8/10 for this type of game. Only thing missing is current-gen graphics.			"

												This game is a complete and infinite sandbox amalgamation of two of history's most prominant pioneers of deep space pioneer exploration game franchises; Master of Orion 1&2 and Star Control 1&2. If you aren't aware of these games or their significancant contributions to the genre than I simply could not even begin to lend any insight with mere words. On the other hand the game does feel... Unfinished. It has blockbuster potential for a niche crowd, and without keymapping within the game's options it does have a particularly cumbersome control scheme, which very well could turn away even the most enthusiastic of novice players. I also found myself strongly desiring far more depth of interaction dynamics between the various species. If you haven't any experience with this type of game, you almost assuredly will dislike this game. For me though, two thumbs up.			"

												OK, good RTS type descendent of MoOII. You will run into a few problems though. The AI, DOES NOT LIKE TO LOSE. You WILL get a start point bordered on all sides by aggressive civilizations. HALF OR MORE of all worlds within easy warp distance will be inhabited by ""remnants"" (hostile powerful aliens) or one terrible planet or none habitable. HALF OR MORE or all colonies you establish that are not close to your capital will be destroyed by enemy raiders unless you have the credits to employ a large and useless early military that drags your economy down. The game WILL let you create a race with traits that will make it a completely unviable race. IF you do not research the agricultural/biodome line first, you will probably lose, but if you don't get to planetary defenses fast enough after, you will still lose.Good game, but still rough around the edges in the balance category. 7/10 - Fun but frustrateing.

												I bought this game 2 days ago and have played 14 hours of it, I still haven't finished my first game yet. The games are long but you are always kept busy between micro-managing each planet, and macro-managing your empire. The interface is not very intuative and is slightly buggy, but with a little practice it seems rather simple.The creating of your own unique ship's is a major part of the fun for me. Finding ways to optimize the standard ships is great fun, especially when a new teach finishes and a new strategy opens up.Overall I would say this game is an excellent space 4X game with very unique race, each with their own personalities, a large variaty of ships, and the pleasure of dominating your opponants on a galactic scale.

												Stardrive is a fun, innovative game with one of the best ship customization systems I've ever seen. That said, the game is horribly incomplete. The developers seemed to have just dropped the game shortly before finishing it. It's been out for quite some time, and there's still tons of placeholder material, game crashes...it's depressing really. All said though, it's still fun, and worth the price (when it's on sale).

												The spaceship customization in this game is almost unrivaled. Everything from gun placement to armor to generators can all determine outcomes in battles. It is an absolute blast to spend hours creating ships to annihilate your foes with. There are also different perks you get to choose from when you start that effect your gameplay, like being ""robotic"" where you race consumes no food but eats production instead.The only downsides of the game are that the rounds can be long. Really long. Like 3 hours depending on how fast/aggressive you are. Computers have an annoying habbit of constantly jumping planets when they are almost dead. Real pain to finish them off. Also, much of the game is focusing on taking over planets with something called ""Doom Drops"" where you fly a ton of soldier ships and just crash them into the planet to take it over (no spaceship fighting.) Its not a bad mechanic, but it somewhat invalidates the awesome spaceship creations you make and the computer (due to micromanagement) is REALLY good/annoying with them. You'll be pausing a lot to issue commands to keep up.Overall, still a lot of fun. Would defintely recommend.			"

												This game is fun and reminds me of a better version of Master of Orion. However there are some serious flaws and it appears that its only maybe 80% finished or so. Limited ship hulls especially orbital platforms. AI has problems sometimes doing things. Fun yes, But with a very steep learning curve. Building your own ships is fun at first but can be quite tedious. Moving them in combat formations even more so. some definate bugs with landing ground troops on planets and so on. The unfinished random events and bugs in this prevent it from being a breath of fresh air in a stangant genre and coming out like a waft of stale perfumed vapror of a fancy tomb.			"

												This game isnt great. After being released a while ago it still feels like an unfinished beta version of the game. Based on the forums, it doesnt look like the developer will ever finish the game because they've already started on thier next one. The game freezes, crashes, wierd buggyness, confusing as hell and is not polished in a lot of areas, but that all being said, its a lot of fun. Think a much slower and less refined civ game based in space. I dont want to compare it to the other space games. I put it on easy mode, researched everything explored every nook and such and still didnt understand some of the mechanics. Then i built several massive dreadnaut class capital warships with intertial dampeners, filled one with nukes and another with the best shields and weapons money could buy and just walked through everything. That was fun. I really wish the devs would take the time to really finish this game, build in the tooltips and not make it impractical to research and such. Ship building is awesome, its a bit much for me but if you really get into it, theres some crazy things you can do with it. Resource management is like any other civ game. Its a bit quirky but theres some nice differences to set it apart from the rest. The diplomacy stuff is meh, I was never good at dimplomacy but the 'tone' option you have on all responses really is a neat thing. The slowness is a good and bad thing, sometimes a speed adjustment would be nice, but other times I couldnt hit the pause button quick enough. Aside from any other unpolished based complaints, my big issue was with the notification system. My fleet could have gotten into a huge ambush or intercepted by the 'remnant' forces and I would have never known. It got me quite a bit of times and I'd never want it to be like civ which I think has notification overload but there needs to be more. I had a smaller map and its just too much to keep track of. I dont know the cost of the game now, its definitely worth checking out, I only spent like 8 bucks on the sale so that was worth it, but dont expect it to be the next MoO and if you dont know what that is, then thats good, just go with it. I'll check it out six months from now and maybe I'll change my tone from 'threatening' to 'pleading' for forgiveness and like the wasteland 2 game I hope it happens, but this isnt even an early release. Good luck out there.-Sincerely, http://www.thecomic-community.com "

												While perhaps not as deep or complex as other games in its category, and perhaps slightly derivative at times, with the Draylok Council and Human Federation being strangely reminiscient of Mass Effect's Asari and Human races, Stardrive still reperesents a good, accessible play for those who are unfamiliar with the vague ""Civilizations in Space"" genre. People who are more invested in the genre may find the game frustrating, however, and I recommend this product primarily as someone who is unfamiliar, but interested in the concept.			"

It's a fun game for anyone who likes space exploration / building /  combat, micromanaging (somewhat, there's always the auto button for skipping that part of the game...), and building their own ships.  If you have played any of the earlier Civilization games (up through ~3), you know how to get a ship built fast and how important the details for your cities, er planets are for getting things done.  I had a blast and this game is in my Favorites list.  If you're struggling to get Space Empires V to run on Windows 7, give this one a try!			"

There is great promise, building your own race, tech trees, nice visuals. . .but there is no diplomacy, no real mid-game goals, and after my first playthrough I will never build carriers or drone ships again.  Buggy AI will keep those ships in-between systems forever unless you babysit them.  I'm excited to see a more polished version of this game in Stardrive 2.			"

												I love this game so much. It still feels like it's in dev because there's still enough bugs and patches that are needed but it's still playable. Sadly the game feels like there is so much more potential yet it hasn't or will not tap into.The game itself allows you to customize your own ships with a large variety of weapons, shields, armor, equipment, and whatnot. You can then make fleets of those ships and fight against other factions. The diplomacy in the game is better than what the civilization series has accomplished. You actually get rewarded quite well for being diplomatic instead of being completely warlike. Also the galaxy exploration is fun too. You can send out scouts looking for suitable planets for colonization and you can build your solar galaxy in between planets and can connect them with trade systems and territorial markers. I would highly recommend this game if you love sci-fi space battles and the civilization series.			"

												Stardrive is like your normal 4X strategy, often slow to start up, but then builds it's stride.Unlike other games, the combat is completely real time,  taking place on a top down view.  You are also giving different ship frames where you can customize how it is armored and armed square by square. It's an interesting thing, but this leads to a few problems.Ship battles don't really have any sort of micromanagement, even smaller ships turn slowly. Ship AI is also lacking.  Also building new ship designs is also a timesink, especially when constantly researching new weapons.  This would be a huge problem in multiplayer.. which unfortunately there is none.The game is still getting updates, but it's hard to justify a fullpricetag.If it's on sale, it's is worth the time. "

												A little more action focused 4X game, since it's not turn based it has a fairly different feel to it, it has great ship designing as well as a nice modding community so overall it's a pretty sweet game, it's not perfect though of course, the developer is small so any updates are slow to arrive but I think that the game is more fun then it has problems so overall I will probably recommend it to any space rts/4x fans.

												This game is far too overambitious for its developer and suffers from a long list of minor (and bigger) issues that makes for a rarely entertaining experience in the long run.There's also a humongous amount of drama over recent censorship moderation on their forums, essentially banning anyone who has any criticism for the game or its updates - whether constructive or not. Add to that censorship of the Steam review system and you've got a developer you probably don't want to put your money towards unless you really - really love 4X games and have grown tired of every other one in existence.

												Well it looks nice. The big emphasis on combat makes it a♥♥♥♥♥♥benchmark for the ""4x space strategy genre"". Galaxy looks and feels lifeless, exploration doesn't feel as rewarding. Combat is good though with lots of pew pew pew. Think of it is a nice bigger scale RTS with some planetary development/colonisation attatched. Ship design is okay but because of a modular design based on visual schematics you are limited in what you can make. This is not the grand epic galaxy brought to life 4x game. This is pretty but no real depth or real sense of scale.			"

												In two words - splendid idea, but flawed implementation.I stumbled across this game searching for a ""Master of Orion"" clone, as many would say. Eventually, all 4X games become compared to it.StarDrive has many positive aspects - friendly interface, interesting gameplay, starship constructor (in which alone, you'll spend hours, customizing your ships). But all-in-all, in my opinion, it failed to implement these into a balanced game. Notorious AI and ship movement, bugs, balancing issues, weak diplomacy. Abscence of a storyline is OK for me, neither MoO did have one, but StarDrive feels in every way incomplete. Short tech-tree, strategy flaws (you can win almost every game in minutes, by producing soldiers and landing them onto enemy homeworlds - no defence for that. Ka-pow! And the enemy is either extict, or thrown into a stone age.)Moreover - as of 1.15 patch, it seems that there'll be no more updates, as developer focused on a second installement. Some complained it was a hit-and-run move, but I sense logic there. No use of trying to sew together a Frenkenstein. It's far easier and wiser to start from scratch, avoiding mistakes learned. Looking forward to trying the second game out.My opinion - the game is worth trying out, although overpriced. But a good addition to a 4X collection when sold at a discount.			"

												I loved this game mainly because of the vast customization of ships. It did have some issues initially, but as updates have been released they have become increasingly less common. The technology tree was kinda small, but it was enough for me frankly because of the time it took to research the best things. Dynamic planets were also a cool positive that added some randomness to resource distribution throughout the galaxy. I do also know there are several mods out for this game that are free, but have never tried them. The main problem was with the game (imo) was the AI. They are not very intelligent and it can be really difficult beginning a new game because if you encounter a hostile race they will more than likely troop rush you and destroy you within 15 minutes. Lack of multiplayer was no big deal to me, but to some people I can see that as being a deal breaker.			"

												Well, wow... I spend a fair amount of time with this game, and have for some time... To see all the really harsh reviews suprises me a bit.I've never noticed too many bugs frankly, certainly nothing that was a crash, or game killer.  Yes, the game does seem to have some unfinished bits here and there, but pretty minor stuff really. In my honest opinion it is one of the best 4x spacers available. What it really shines in is the ship construction. Once the tech tree starts to open up, the sky is the limit with what you can design your ships to do, though I generally end up doing the same strategies as some seem to be superior to others.Perhaps the pricetag is a little high, but I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from getting this game, I find it very enjoyable.

												This game is a great accomplishment, the developer is just one guy.  You won't find another game like this.   Find me another game where you punch through enemy shields and armor,  and then begin to damage internals effecting ships performance as ship modules are destroyed.  Knock out engines and the ships adrift.  Hit ammunition and you have a powder keg destroying half your ship or causing a chain reaction.  Destroy reactor lose power.  Have all your weapons shut down on one side because how you designed your ship when it takes damage.  My favorite is watching a ship spin off with destroyed engines or spin firing all weapons straight into the enemy flee.  This game is the next level of stategy and sets a new benchmark. I can forgive the few problems with the game.What are your alternatives?  The same old game,  do some damage and just simply down hitpoints until a ship explodes. I want to experience all of the above.  I think everyone posting negative reviews are just proffesional haters.  Maybe even other developers who are like,""Uh-o if this game gets to big it will set the standard and we'll have to do allot more work.""			"

												To be clear, I'll say up front that I very much enjoyed this game, played it for over 200 hours, and intend to snap up its sequel as soon as it's available.  What drew me to it the most is its innovative and thorough approach to ship design and combat.  If you'd enjoy spending 20 thought-filled  minutes crafting a customized inter-system war machine, this one's for you.  I should add that watching said war machine ply its trade is beautiful and enjoyable as well.  I loved almost everything about the design and implementation of the space combat in StarDrive.  Its real-time approach encompasses fighters, boarding parties, attack, defense, reinforcements, re-arming, repairing, bombarment, trade, support structures, warp speed and manuevering.  However, I must also acknowledge that this game never overcame a certain lack of polish.  Confused AI, glitches, and underdeveloped or dead-ending side stories riddle the game.  In order to fully enjoy its excellent space combat system, you must learn how to work with the game's quirks and carefully guide the challenge level into an ideal range with practiced care.  I am amazed and impressed with what this game's creator(s) were able to accomplish.  At the same time, I can see why its metacritic score didn't make it to the 90s; its great strengths are forced to associate with a series of weaknesses.			"

Its a nice chill game where you get a good space vibe, and good fun. The one thing other than the excessive mouseclicking is that the map is SQUARE, so you do reach the edge of the map witch seems somewhat limited when your trying to be that space guy. Ship design is alot of fun cause you can really customize and put stuff on your own designs. It is overall a nice Indie space 4x game and i might give it a whirl again soon.			"

												Realtime 2D Space 4X. Ship customisation is awesome, planet micro is not. The AI can handle a lot for you which is great (and a must). Ship/Fleet management is overwhelming and not very  necessary given Stardrive's game mechanics  - which is disappointing. Research tree is unnecessarily complicated (i.e. it is poor but not as bad as Sins of a Solar Empire). Did you understand all the jargon and enjoy MoO2? - then this is your game. Endless Space is better than Stardrive in all aspects but Endless Space has a completely different ship combat mechanic and is turn-based. If combat is the make or break choice: choose Stardive if you want to control swarms of 2d ships, choose Endless space for battle strategy and awesome combat visuals. Get it only on sale.			"

												This game is AWESOME. It really recaptures the whole vibe from my favorite game of all time, Master of Orion 2. Alas, it does not quite reach that height, but it certainly comes CLOSE. Closer perhaps than any other game of its type or genre. I just love building ships, designing how they work, what they use, the tactical considerations and concessions to various limitations.A lot of reviews criticize its lack of polish, but it is improving. There are community mods and expansions that extend the game considerably (I personally only use the Station Symmetry mod, the lopsided vanilla stations aggravate my OCD). I would say that it should have remained in ""beta"" for longer, but it it is still very fun to play.I would argue that it is actually a very stable game. There are scattered issues with the savegame, but nothing game-breaking. If you're having problems, don't forget to do the old ""Verify integrity of game cache"" option; I haven't seen that fail yet.			"

												Hi and Hello,DE:POSITIV, das Spiel ist genial. Für ein Mann oder kleine Gruppe ist das die beste Nachahmung und Verbesserung für Master Of Orion.Vor allem es ist fast Echtzeit-Spiel und mit einer super 3D-Grafik.Es gibt Kleinigkeiten die zu bemängeln gibt, aer hey, dafür das die großen Developers uns seit Jahren kein MMO-Remake bieten ist das GENIAL.Meine EMPFEHLUNG ):>ENG:POSITIV, I recommand this game. For a little Deeloper-team a very nice job. Specially when you see, that the BIG developers let us starving year after year for a good MMO Remake.And for a little developer it is a nice 3D-Game with many Elements of Master Of Orion with a nice Strategic and Tactical depth as a Real-Time-Strategy Remake.THUMBS UP!  ):>------------------------------If Zero would have stayed with it all the time, it wouls be now that what Stellaris is now!

												Closest spiritual succesor to MOO2 (others have come close, Endless Space to name one) with one of the best 4x ship combat to date.  Highly customizable; choosing ship engines, shield, weapons, and more.  The art direction is great, with a variety of races to play.  You can also change your race traits depending on your preferences.  If you are a fan of the 4x genre this is a must have.			"

												I dont undestand all the thumb downs... This is by far the best Indie 4X game.I recommend this game, the ship design is like none other, not even the big 4x game shops come close. In fact a bit ambitious. The only thing I miss is cinematic events when one colonizes, or discovers a tech, sort of like moo2. You all should be commending this game instead of bashing it.			"

												Very Enjoyable and it soaked up tons of hours of gameplay. Lots of features and missing features, but overall a very solid and great start to a fairly new type of 4X genre. The game was developed pretty much by 1 person and all i can say to that is WOW. I've played games that were developed by a platoon sized team and still not be as much fun as this game.I played this game from Alpha to Now and while i wish there was ""more"" i think the game at the moment is fun. I'm looking forward to the next game made by Zero  "

												I really like the feel of the game and they got alot of the 4x elements correct. I was/am hoping they create a DLC pack and add more tech, my one gripe about the game is that being at the top of the tech tree isnt as much of an advantage as just having a large fleet. The differences in the races makes the game quite interesting and its also one of the first games where the race seems to follow the politics they are designed around. Graphics are good and the game has replay value.			"

												While this is a great game worth a look, a ball was dropped somewhere that makes you feel like you bought half a game.    You can assume manual control over your ""flagship"" but this is sort of useless; I find myself never making use of the ability.  That, coupled with the fact that there's a game type selector but no game type except the default, tells me that this game started with the intent to develop something akin to StarFlight or Star Control II, but that inability to manage scope led it to becoming just another Sins of a Solar Empire clone.   That said, the AI is challenging, though it tends to make odd choices at times.   Unfortunately, the races are very predictable in behavior, and seem a bit like ripoffs themselves.   The Kulrathi warrior bear race reminds me a little much of the Kilrathi warrior cat race from old Wing Commander.   There's a race of squid-beings that have ships and philosophy very similar to the Reapers from Mass Effect.  I did enjoy playing this game for one or two playthroughs, and the modification of the ships is an interesting mechanic, but I found myself going back to Sins of a Solar Empire to get this sort of fix.   Between the lack of creativity on the alien races and the clear false-start of creating an ""adventure"" mode, I was never able to shake the feeling that the game was completed halfway and the rest was just phoned in.   It's a game worth playing if you can grab it on Steam Sale, but it's also a lesson in how scope creep can turn a great idea into an unfinished project.			"

												Game is absolutely tons of fun, when I first got it I racked up the hours bloody quick, good thing I was on holidays.I'm a huge fan of space basd strategy games and usually go for 4x turn based ones. I purchased this on a whim. Its all real time and done from a top down perspective, which I found unepexted and, at first unapealing. However, as I learned my way around the contrls and began combat, I realised how much fun this game can seriously get. The combat in this is tons and tons of fun, least of all because of the creative control you have on your ships. You get the blueprint of your ship, and then fill its insides with weapons, power, bridges, the lot. You then test your design out in combat. It has great visuals and beautiful weapon effects, all the races ships feel different and look cool. Its only downside is Empire building and the economy is pretty shallow. Buildings are generic and colonisation is always the same.The planets serve only as the economic base for your fleets, which you will be building enmasse			"

												Stardrive is one of the better 4X style games i've played. It's got a fluid ""turn-based"" system which keeps you informed and able to calculate, without slowing down the game. I find it a good blend of the 4X and RTS genres, retaining some of the better parts from both. Every 4X game i've played has had its flaws, and Stardrive is no exception. But out of the games i've played, i find it my favorite. Definitely a good buy.			"

												It's been very difficult for me to get into 4x games. I tried Galactic civ 2 a little while ago and got confused as anything, tried to play a bit of Sins of a solar empire but was completely overwhelmed with how much was involved in playing. Then I picked up Endless space, which I'm really wanting to get into but the learning curve again is huge for me. The only 4x I've enjoyed and have found easy to play but not spent a great deal of time on is Civ 5, which I plan on going back to sometime but for some reason I'm set on learning how to play a SPACE 4x. With Stardrive, I think I've found my 4x space training wheels. I've not found it as complex as the others, not turn based and for me, it's easing me into how 4x games essentially work. I can't say much about the negativity surrounding the game because I'm only new to the genre but as a game, I'm finding that it functions great so far. Graphically I can not complain, the music and sounds are nice. I'm sure as I play more, I'm going to find things I don't like and once I get used to the genre I'll start playing other 4x space games then look back on this and make comparisons but for now, this seems like a great entry level game to the genre.

												This game is what Master of Orion 2 (MoO 2) would feel like in real time.  The ship creation rules are well thought out and add a level of choice and design that tends to be sorely lacking in 4X games in this day and age.  It pays homage to MoO 2 without trying to BE MoO 2, and overall gives a satisfying playthrough.			"

												I'm somewhat on the fence about this game, but I think I can say I recommend it with reservations.The real-time approach is often a mistake in making a 4X game; StarDrive manages to avoid most of the big problems that other recent attempts (most notably the terribly disappointing Armada 2526) have had. The mechanics make sense, and the player can make informed choices to wring out advantages to actually win battles, wars, and the game. Custom ship designs are a key part of the value proposition of the game, and the implementation here is meaty and satisfying.Those good things said, the game has some big flaws in usability/playability. There is often only one way to perform an action  (scrap/refit a ship, scroll the map) when there should be several; information displays like the known-planets list and ships list are missing key features. Also, while the ship design module is a lot of fun early in the tech tree, as ships get larger the lack of any automated support makes filling in all the boxes of a design tedious instead of fun.I picked StarDrive up as part of the holiday sale, and I can say it was worth the discounted price to me, but I'm not sure it would be worth full price.

I'm not sure why people are saying this game is super buggy and crashes all the time. I have played it for many hours and have never had any game breaking bugs. A good buy for space civilization game lovers. Some features are lacking and others are glossed over, but the important ones are still there: good ship and empire designing and building.

Also if you want to cheat and mess around building space ships search up the cheats on google, it is offline so it is fine to use dev mode or screw around i guess.			"

												I see a lot of negative reviews for this game and I really don't agree with them. This is a solid game with a very distinct art style. It looks really good and yet very simple, which is not a bad thing. The game is very easy to learn and is quite deep in it's ship customization and you will spend many hours designing and perfecting your ship designs. There is nothing more satisfying than having your custom badass capitalship send out a swarm of your custom fighters and totaly anhialate an enemy fleet.Compared to a lot of other 4X games, Stardrive does not have as big of a techtree, there is still plenty of things to research but compared to games like Endless Space it's far from enough. One thing I really miss is more ways to improve your planets and concidering all the buildingspace you have left, there is room for a lot more.Pros:- Short learning curve- Deep shipdesign- Real-time gameplay- AddictingCons:- Not enough to research- Ground battles- Game crash after a few hours of play- Save files are way to big			"

The reason why rage kids post about its not beein finished is because the devssaid they will try and add multiplayer, but with time they found out that the core engine wont allowe it,so they abandoned the plan. Other then that, the game is 100% balanced and finished.Very nice and unique game, hope ST2 will bring us much of what we have right now, but with even better graphicsand more tech and races!			"

												With a lack of diverse 4x space games much less any sci-fi genre based games, I was getting desperate for my next fix; then came along StarDrive with its simple and intuitive design.Though not without its problems currently, some of the game's core features like ship design and combat is solid and alone has kept me entertained for sometimes hours at a time!

												I really wanted to like StarDrive.  It reminded me of the old Stars! game for Windows 3.1, where you would define your alien race, expand, conquere, research and design new ship layouts.  It sounded like a great modern update.  But after playing for a while, expanding a lot, and making a large fleet, I tried to attack a small faction and lost for no good reason.  It feels like there's a ""correct"" way to play this game and they never tell you anything about how to play it.  For instance, to conquer a planet, you have to take out the ships guarding it, and then send colonists over in separate transport ships to fight on the ground, which is heavily favoured to the defender.  You have to outnumber them like 10-1 to have a hope of taking the place.  So after spending an untold effort in trying to take ONE planet from a small faction, my faction gets into a civil war and my homeworld gets heavily attacked, at which point I lost all interest in this game.The mechanics are clunky and not at all expained.  To top it off, it seem like a lot of features where left unfinished in favour of working on the sequel, so overall, I would say avoid.  I mean really, 75% of the 4x games on steam are space based like this.  Search games by tag and find a good one to play.			"

												For its time, it was decent enough. The ship design was ok, the warfare was ok, was fun enough for me to not hate it completely. But now when you compare Stardrive to its current competition (Such as Stellaris, Space Engineers, or I would also recommend Sins of a Solar Empire) hopefully its obvious that you should avoid this. There are so many features, bugs, overall defects, and the games been out for years. Save your 6$ and go elsewhere.			"

												This is another galactic empire game where you are the all knowing ruler who must help your people to conqure all of space. Its merits include the fact that it is free flowing with a pretty organic feel. Each race has their own strengths and personalities which you can exploit or avoid. I've played this game so much that I have discoverd that my favorite form of life in this game is cybernetic. I'm sure you'll lik it if you love space fiction and the creation and maximization of your ships and empire.			"

												A fun 4x pausable game. But while the visuals are nice, the game isn't quite finished, which becomes rather evident when you fight against the Remnants - while the game's text suggests more is to come after the second mission, it is a dead end. As it seems the game will not be completed and Stardrive 2 is being made, this game cannot be recommended as it just doesn't live up to the features it claims to have.			"

												The game reminds me of MOO2, but it's in real time.  The ship customization is a strong point because it really matters how you build your ship.  With some of the very large ships this can get a bit daunting though.  You can take direct control of ships, but that's kind of pointless unless you want to just have a bit of fun with a cap ship or something.  Overall, a worthy addition to your library.			"

												Now that it's been officially released, I am going to recommend to everyone who sees this and enjoys 4X games to give StarDrive a test.StarDrive is a game of immense depth. You are provided the option of designing your entire fleets to your specifications -- you can create ships using a variety of weapon types and defenses. The game even facilitates some very interesting and not inherently obvious strategies surrounding your ship construction.The gameplay itself is basically a 4X RTS/TBS hybrid. ""Empire"" related things, such as economy, diplomacy, and colony management are done in timed turns where each turn is something like five seconds. ""Ship"" related things, such as flight, combat, and eventual destruction are handled in real time.This game sucked away more than 100 hours my play time before it was even released. It can do the same for you, too, if you would like it to.			"

												Un juego RTS x4 del espacio, probablemente uno de los mejores que han salido en mucho tiempo y, en lo personal, el mejor que he probado.  Lo mejor del juego y destacable sin duda, es su personalizacion en cuanto a naves.  Con un sistema de rejilla, puedes modificarlas y diseñarlas como quieras y las opciones son muy amplias. Por no mencionar que la IA tambien usara tus propios diseños contra ti en futuras partidas.Otro punto a favor son los mods, es muy facil modificar el juego por uno mismo, y en cuanto a mods hechos por modders hay algunos muy buenos que añaden toneladas de opciones, armas y modulos nuevos para tus naves. Asi como edificios y tecnologias.En conclusion, un juego muy bueno RTS, con algunos fallos pero que estan siendo corregidos por los desarrolladores (el juego sigue en desarrollo y parcheado casi diariamente). Lo recomiendo al 100%.			"
