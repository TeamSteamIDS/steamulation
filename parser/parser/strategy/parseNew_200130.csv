												Don't get me wrong. This game isn't too bad...thing is the first game was much better. They replaced the presents with a wheel you spin for letters and hint tokens. They changed some of the mechanics for some games (example: Fitword is kinda wonky. Instead of typing or drawing the letters, you have to drag and drop the words, and it's slightly annoying to do that.) Some instructions are vague (for example: Backwords. You have to shade in the wrong letters rather than the right letters, which is confusing.) Finally, they changed something from simple to very complicated (example again: Link A Pix. Instead of having a whole area on your screen to link the numbers, you get 1/4 of the screen to look at and you can't zoom out. This can be very confusing.) If you are looking for a sequel to Puzzler World, you shouldn't worry much. Just stick to the first game.			"

												The first Puzzler World was better in my opinion as far as the interface goes. This one made some unnecessary changes that only served to lessen the quality of the sequel.The new link-a-pix is a lot more annoying especially since you have to drag the screen around to find the corners of the puzzle. I'm not sure why they decided it was a good idea. They could have just as easily added in a zoom function.They removed codewords and added 2 other types of puzzles to replace it. Why was it removed to begin with?Aside from the 2 things I pointed out, the game is pretty much the same. It goes on sale often so it's a nice little purchase that can entertain you anywhere between 5-20 hours depending on your enthusiasm for puzzles both easy and challenging.			"

												Completion: about 20% of all puzzles.Why I consider myself complete: Obtained all Steam Achievements.Why I'm stopping now: Puzzler World 2 has a number of different style puzzles, sudokus, crosswords, link-a-pix, wordsearch etc. It has these as ""Challenger"" puzzles. It also has shorter quick puzzles you can do after completing each regular puzzle. It furthermore has master puzzles, which are longer harder versions of the standard puzzles. The main problem is that the ""Master"" puzzles get unlocked individually after completing a number of regular puzzles. So, trudge through 10 mindless wordsearches and unlock a super duper (also mindless) wordsearch! I will probably not delete this now, for the later Sudoku puzzles are a little challenging. I also enjoy the link-a-pix (the master was quite difficult). But I can't see myself bothering with the rest. Since the steam achievements are not at all linked to the in-game achievements I'm considering myself done (and wondering why they sloppily did this!). 5/10 - recommended on sale.			"

												Awesome game, one which I'd recommend to anyone who likes puzzles. I've put 5 hours into it as of time of writing this and I'm only 4% done, not counting master puzzles.There are 560 Challenge mode puzzles, after finishing each you get a small bonus puzzle. There are also Master Mode Puzzles which are bigger and therefore harder than ones from challenge modes.Puzzle types you'll find in Challenge and Master modes:· Wordsearch· Sudoku· Crossword· Hide & Seek· Link-a-pix· Fitword· Backwords· Pieceword· SilhouetteBonus puzzle types:· Hangman· Chain Letters· Sum-up· Picture quiz· Colour-in· Perfect Pairs· Splitwords· Add-up· Jigsaw "

												5.5/10 - More puzzles than you'd ever care to play!The puzzles themselves are pretty middle of the road. Randomly generated; crossword, Sudoku, word find and about 15 other puzzle types. It reminds me of buying one of those cheap puzzle books in the grocery checkout line.There are 560 puzzles plus bonus challenges on each; the total number of puzzles is said to exceed 1200! I'll never find out though; after a few hours I'm pretty bored of taxing my brain playing games I can find in the newspaper. This game is great for someone who just loves working crosswords and various puzzles though.Worth the $5! With over 1200 puzzles you can't lose with this one.

												This is more or less an reproduction of the first Puzzler World, but with a better mechanism for hint tokens, a nicer in-game trophy system and some slightly better execution of puzzles. I would recommend getting this over the first one, and as before it's geared towards a younger audience but still enjoyable for older players as well.Only con I can see is that the developers didn't link their in-game trophies to Steam achievements, so it only has the same simple set as the first game, which are fairly straightforward to play through for those of you looking for simple puzzle games or just a few more achievements to rack up.

												Puzzler World 2 is, unsurprisingly, a framework for several different types of puzzles.The Sudoku works, and lets you take basic notes, but it's not the best Sudoku game out there. The Crosswords are very difficult, because this is very obviously a UK-made game, and you would need a lot of UK-specific knowledge to solve them. Link-A-Pix puzzles are pretty neat, and the big ones get very challenging. The rest are too simple for an experienced puzzle solver, even at their hardest.The interface isn't very good, but it works well enough. The puzzle instructions are insufficient, but most puzzles aren't that hard. The bonus puzzle/hint system is enjoyable, and necessary if you're not an expert at UK crosswords. Master Mode lets you cut right to the toughest challenges. There are definitely enough puzzles to keep you busy for a while.This is definitely for puzzle fans only, but caters to beginners, casuals, and experts.			"

												This game is hard to rate.  On the one hand it has a lot of puzzles, most of which are quite easy to chew up a number of hours.  On the other it has bugs.  For me I am completely incapable ot navigating within the Master Mode - the scrolling is broken.  So I can't access the Crosswords, Soduko and two other types of puzzles in master mode.  Considering I like to Soduko best, this is quite annoying.   Trolling the Internet I found many others had encountered UI issues of varying issues, so my complaint is not isolated.     I also like my puzzles to be hard, and I spent 100+ hours unlocking all the puzzles by doing all the easy ones in Challenge mode just to find that a bunch of them are inaccessible.  ANNOYING!     Because they're at the bottom of the list, I can access the master silhouette puzzles and can click on black dots for 30 seconds - lucky me.  :S I still give it a thumbs up because I spent 100+ hours enjoying the puzzles that I could access even if they were easy.The developer should have more pride in their product than the dscontinuing of support for these UI issues.   Buy it 90% off and recognize you're likely to encounter UI issues.			"

												Is this game bad?  No.  But it does have problems.  And you cannot not compare this to the first one.  The puzzles are still here, and mostly good, but the new ones that they added aren't as good.  ""Backwards"" is effetively a combination word search and crossword puzzle that becomes trivially easy once you realize that, on a computer version, you can just black out the entire board and then erase the words.  They altered Fitwords so that you can grab and drag words onto the board, which is very useful... when it works.  They've updated a lot of features, made the resolution bigger, made Link-a-Pix be a scrollable window now instead of trying to jam everything onto one screen (a change I didn't like a first, but it is growing on me), they added a Master mode with harder puzzles once you've played through enough in Challenge mode.  They added a trophy room.  There are problems with Picture Quiz where some of the answers are subjectively wrong (for example, asking you to count something in the picture, but the answer is only from one portion when there are others visible elsewhere).  And, the biggest change from the first, this one seems to be locked in UK English.  So, for the American audience, there are going to be spelling errors and references/phrases that don't make sense.  All in all, if you really like these kinds of puzzles, and have already burned through the first game, then yea, pick this one up.  But if you haven't finished the first, stick with it.  You'll be glad you did.Further information: The game contains some fairly serious bugs.  Typing in ""0"" while in a Sudoku game will break the UI and render Sudoku unplayable until you restart the game.  In Master Mode, you can't scroll past the first 16 puzzles, even if there are more available.  You can click below them and get extra puzzles, but only four of them.  This means some puzzles, and thus some in-game trophies, are unobtainable.			"

There are also little graphical changes. Now you earn your hintpoints after a solved puzzle on a wheel of fortune.The biggest lack of this game is that it is only in english. Very hard for people outside the UK to solve some crosswords for example. Thats the reason I must invest lots of hint points into unknown expressions. But some of the old game modes and the mathematics riddles are still fun.			"

												A sequal to Puzzler World 1. Lots of assorted puzzles to solve with a few new themes and trophies to collect. Mini-puzzles to solve after solving the main one, however may be under a timer. Great for puzzle lovers of any age. Some puzzles are simple, easy, moderate, or hard depending on the theme, however difficulty per puzzle may influx instead of increasing.This is a game to kill time or distract yourself if you're feeling stressed. There is a hint system to help you give tips, solve a bit or the whole puzzle for you (especially for those that struggle with crosswords), but I strongly suggest you try much as you can before doing so.The price is good, no need to wait for a sale.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

Adding to this problem is the inexpert port from what what was clearly an iphone game, the viewing window is far to small, especially for Link-a-Pix, and it's annoying to have to point and drag, rather than more normal methods of, say, scrolling through a list, which is because it intends you to swipe.

												Slicker than Puzzler World 1, but can lead to frustration using the mouse for things the keyboard previously did (for me at least).  New puzzle types, but essentially the same game, volume 2.  Did not offer the option of ""American"" English vs ""British"" English, which has led to a few small instances of confusion.			"

												Compared to the first one, this is annoying to play.  Between the bugs, having to scroll on a puzzle that shouldn't need it, long wait for the extra hints screen to finish, and no longer able to use the keyboard on certain games it's just not worth it.  Only payed $0.50 so it's not a big loss, but I can think of some DLC I could have put that toward.  Go the first if you want a puzzle game to kill time but don't bother with this one.			"

												Got both Puzzler World games for 49 cents each. What a deal! So many puzzles in both games. In this one there are even more puzzles (like types). I thought crosswords were hard. Well, in ""Puzzler World 2"" there is one puzzle that was really hard for me so I had to spend a lot of hint tokens to complete it. As you see it took me 15 hours to get all the achievements, while the first game took me like 8. If you haven't played ""Puzzler World"", hint tokens are earned by completing a puzzle and can be used to solve one. However the way you earn them in this game is different than in 1. You can earn much higher amount of hint tokens in ""Puzzler World 2"". As we say in Bulgaria - ""The more, the more"" (literal translation). xD There is also a master mode which I think wasn't part of ""Puzzler World 1"". This is definitely my cup of tea. And at this price was a must-buy. If you like puzzles like I do, as well as challenges, just wait for a sale and grab them both. You won't regret it, I promise.P.S. Found the word ""waifu"" in a crossword. 10/10			"

												I've never played the first one, but Puzzler World 2 is a fun enough game for playing when you're watching TV or something.There are a variety of puzzles, so if you're not a fan of one type, it's not a problem.500 puzzles in total, so there is a lot of content to get through.Lots of ingame achievements, too.The only real problem I have is that there are no instructions. With puzzles like crossword or sodoku, this is no problem. With backwards and link a pix, however I needed a little instruction to figure them out.Aside from a few minor quirks, it's a nice game for the price if you're a fan of logic puzzles.			"

(for those who haven't played link-a-pix, imagine having only about 40% of a sudoku puzzle displayed on screen, and having to scroll around to see the whole thing.  now imagine that this is happening on a PC game, that has *tons* of dressing around the edges.also it has no sound options just like the original.I was willing to pay a few cents for a collection of games I know I could get for free online, but this isn't even trying anymore			"

												I had issues with the first game, enough to put it into the ""not recommended"" category, but was still able to put up with it enough to play the puzzles. The same cannot be said of the second game, which is readily apparent as being far inferior in quality. If a good game were equivalent to Ghostbusters, the first game was Batman Forever -- not good, but with enough redeeming values to be enjoyed. Puzzler World 2, however, is more on the level of Manos: The Hands of Fate; on several levels it doesn't just fall short of its goals, it fails to even be recognizable as making a worthwhile attempt.The issues of the first game not only remain, they are exacerbated. The ""picture quiz"" game, which has absolutely no business being in a puzzle publication on account of not being a puzzle (memorizing isn't problem solving), remains, as does the kindergarten-level Silhouette. Codeword, one of the more creative and intelligent games of the original, is removed. Hangman is still set at a level that is too easy for anybody who can read at a first grade level. The maximum number of wrong guesses one should be able to get in Hangman is 6, a quarter of the alphabet. PW2 allows eleven wrong guesses. Another irritation from the first game, that being crossword answers that have multiple viable spellings not being accepted (and not being blocked because it doesn't completely interlink the way a proper crossword should) also continues here... along with some clues just being wrong, at least by American definitions. (""Mooch"" does not mean ""skulk""; it means ""freeload"".)Still, issues of the puzzles' difficulty levels would be minor complaints on their own. What sinks this from a C average all the way to an uncontested F is the interface. There are numerous design changes in this version that are just baffling. The ""hint token"" prize boxes of the first game -- mildly annoying on their own -- are replaced by a ""Wheel of Fortune"" spinner, complete with requirement that you spin it with sufficient speed (remember, this is a puzzle game, not a skill game). The Fitword puzzle now requires that the words be manually dragged into their places rather than typed. The ""Sum Up"" puzzle has the answers floating around aimlessly for no reason other than to make it harder to see what you're trying to click on; the actual problem solving isn't made any more difficult, it's just the physical aspect that's made irritating. The crossword puzzles skip over filled in letters while you're typing -- so for example, if you already have the ""N"" in from another word, you can't type ""ORANGE"", you have to type ""ORAGE"". Worst of all, the Link-A-Pix puzzles, the most fun game from the original, are rendered completely unplayable by a decision to require the user to scroll around the screen instead of showing the full puzzle.As if these bad design decisions weren't enough, the game is also severely buggy. There's visible lag in response times, items don't always line up the way they should (the word search lines are often off-center), and worst of all, a lot of it just doesn't work. Scrolling in Challenge Mode can't be done with the mouse, but only with the keyboard. The scrolling in Master Mode and the Trophy Room don't even work with that. There are arrows there, but you can't click on them, you can't spin the mouse wheel, and you can't use the arrow keys. You're told there's stuff to scroll to, but you can't scroll to it. And to top it all off, there doesn't appear to be a ""QUIT"" button for the program. I had to use Task Manager to shut this piece of crap down. I won't be starting it up again.			"

												It's like they took everything about the first game and went, how can we make this less user friendly. Typing options for fit-words removed, replaced by the extremely laggy and hard to use drag interface, spot the differences removed in favor of the much more annoying and badly designed find small shapes in large squares, link-a-pix ultra zoomed in (presumably for the master puzzles) but no options to zoom out, and god forbid the arrow keys dont bug out and freeze in the middle forcing you to drag across, which just reacts badly with your already filled in squares. Illogically phrased crossword questions forcing a dragged out internet search which often doesn't help (this was in the first one also but was mildly annoying at best, and just adds to annoyance now), any typing puzzles now skip letters filled in instead of you typing out the whole word (especially annoying if you have a word wrong). Puzzles are actually quite good if you disregard above issues, with a nice gradual difficulty increase as you go, or the master puzzles are a good option for a challenge. Buy it on a good deal, I got it for 85% off which is an ok deal, 90-95% would be the best to aim for though.			"

												Coming up to 40 hours and just completed half the puzzles. A great little casual game to play when you want something a little less zombiekilly and peoplestabby. Turn off the in-game music and put some relaxing yiruma on (or some cannibal corpse, whatever floats you metaphorical music boat). As a sequel to the first puzzler world (hence the 2 at the end), I think it adds to the original premise of 'a ship load of puzzles' and expands on it adding new games and tweaking existing ones. Whilst some of the games have been tweaked to be 'easier' to play, personally some of them were a little annoying, such as having to drag around link-a-pix as it zooms in really close. Would really appreciate it if they had a zoom function on it to put it to how it was in the first puzzler world. Of course this allows for bigger puzzles (such as the ones featured in the master mode.Also implemented is the tokenator, or the spinnywheeltokengame which whilst it appealed to the 'ooh spinny thing' side of me, the token animations take about twice as long as the original puzzler world, which were just a little too long for my liking in the first one. No skipping this either so, everytime you beat a puzzle, you have to spin the wheel, wait for it to stop, watch the token bounce around for a bit and then redeem and then see all the tokens pour out like a game of coin solitaire. Whilst this is flashy, and probably what most of there budget went onto, slows everything down especially if you're going through puzzles fairly fast (some of them can be done in 10-15 seconds, such as the silhouette (I don't quite understand that game either?)).One thing that is amazing and probably makes this all okay is that you can spin the wheel backwards! Yes people, backwards compatibility! (Insert new-gen console jokes here).Some features they haven't included though such as screen resolution, it looks terrible even on my 1080p screen so windowed is the only way to go if you are a low-resophobe. I have puzzled on it full screen and it's not too distracting but it looks much nicer windowed.Also, whilst the in-game trophy system are a great incentive to actually clear all the puzzles, something the first one lacked as I stopped playing after about 200 (will return when I beat this though... probably), I feel a little let down with the steam achievements. Exactly the same as the first in requirement, I don't see why they couldn't have just linked the trophies with the steam achievements... This would've also removed the fact that there's no point in beating more then 10 of each puzzle in the original.I got this in a bundle (with the original) and probably paid about 20p for it. For 40 hours and only halfway complete (my GCSE maths tell me that it would therefore take about 80 hours, without taking the exponetionally rising difficulty of levels in further stages and brie, tea and wee breaks (I'm so british). Adding all that in could be around 100 hours). 20p has never seen so much mileage. Even at a fiver, you'll be stuck to find a game that will last you a good 80 hours!Despite some flaws, this simple game gives you a lot for a little, you'd be mildly braindead to not see the value in that!

												Puzzler World 2 is, unsurprisingly, a framework for several different types of puzzles.The Sudoku works, and lets you take basic notes, but it's not the best Sudoku game out there. The Crosswords are very difficult, because this is very obviously a UK-made game, and you would need a lot of UK-specific knowledge to solve them. Link-A-Pix puzzles are pretty neat, and the big ones get very challenging. The rest are too simple for an experienced puzzle solver, even at their hardest.The interface isn't very good, but it works well enough. The puzzle instructions are insufficient, but most puzzles aren't that hard. The bonus puzzle/hint system is enjoyable, and necessary if you're not an expert at UK crosswords. Master Mode lets you cut right to the toughest challenges. There are definitely enough puzzles to keep you busy for a while.This is definitely for puzzle fans only, but caters to beginners, casuals, and experts. Probably not worth $10, but great to pick up on sale.			"

												You would not believe how much fun this game is just by looking at it on the Store page. If you like puzzles like Crosswords, Hangman and Wordsearches, look no further, Seriously good value. *****			"

												Amazingly awful interface, inside the games and not. What other game assigns volume settings on a user-by-user basis? Some of the puzzles are fairly good, others are inscrutable unless you've found your way to the instructions. It's basically one of those thick volumes of assorted sudoku, crosswords, word searches and such made digital and fluorescent. Not bad if that's what you're looking for, and can get past the warts.

												Good ""casual"" gaming. Just don't expect much depth. You might not want to play this in one go or play it all the time. Instead you fire it up when you're bored and don't wanna play something heavy with plotlines and quests and lore.(imagine you worked overtime, the clients were terrible, you finally get home, take a beer from the fridge)You want some puzzle and it delivers and a ton of content too. Also more puzzles and variation compared to PW1.The game is designed completely basic and was probably a mobile app. "

												Everything about this game is pretty straight forward. If you didn't understand what the game was about by looking at the pictures and/or reading the description. You definately need this game. :) For everyone else, you should put down the controller for 15 mins, play some puzzles, and keep your brain in shape. I can and do recommend this to anyone and everyone!			"

												I find this game is better than the previous one; it plays much more smoothly, there are so many more hint coin things, I can click-and-drag the words in fitword, there are ingame achievements (not just steam's ones), there's a further set of more difficult puzzles and there are extra puzzle types.The downsides are that the PUZZLER bonus isn't worth getting until after the fifth time, I miss codebreak and the wheel-of-fortune thing takes too much time. Basically, don't get this if you want to play codebreak.			"

												Eh it's an alright game, pretty simple to get the hang of. There are some cool puzzles I've never seen before, but I wouldn't pass it off as a kids game right away, regardless of all of the bright colouring and blantant simplicity to some puzzles. Drives me crazy because I'm a completionist, but its got some easy achievements.			"

												A great fun little puzzle game that includes a diverse variety of different puzzles and challenges from word searches to picture matching to challenge your mind. Its a game that grows in challenge as you progress through the main puzzles.It has a great simple interface with fun graphics that won't be too taxing on just about any machine. Great for all ages though some of the word searches involve a bit of knowledge and reading skills more so than memory. A great way to keep that mind active.For the price this is one of those games that you'll jump in and play for ten minutes at a time for years or you might just play it right through in a single sitting if you're a puzzler addict.Highly recommended and a great gift for the price.

												Puzzler World 2 is the successor of Puzzler World, but is it as good?Well the game itself is quite similar, but Puzzler World 2 has even higher requirements to the player's English language skills. This becomes very evident in the ''Backword puzzles'' (that I spent almost all my hint points on). And no I am not sure it is as good as Puzzler World ...Conclusion:If you want to try a Puzzler World game, start with Puzzler World (1) and not this ...But if you've played Puzzler World (1) and liked it then this is the game for you ...

												The first game, Puzzler World, was excellent, though too easy. PW2 is just a reskin, with added annoyances, for instance making selectables floating around instead of standing still, etc. And some differences in some games doesn't make sense and isn't covered in the instructions, so you have to either experiment to make out the rules, or just blindly guess.Other annoyances really confused me a bit, until I figured out what the heck was going on, mainly link-a-pix: it may appear to not having all the pairs - this is because it doesn't show the whole playfield, it's zoomed in on just a part of it.They tried to make it different, but took away the fun in the process. I have rarely been so disappointed with any game before.Avoid PW2 like the plague, go play the first game instead.			"

												Basically the first game with some different types of puzzles and control changes.Trophies are a nice addition, some of the new controls are a litte awkward to use (basically any time you have to clicka and drag). 1 and 2 have the same problem where some of the instructions for certain puzzles are really not great but once you figure out what's going on they're really fun.Still a solid way to waste time with a ton of puzzles to do.

												I've enjoyed the sequel less than I did the original game. The new word-based modes aren't very fun, and Sudoku still doesn't have the function of putting multiple options into the same square to eliminate them as you work through the puzzle. You could probably squeeze 30-50 hours' playtime out of the sequel, but I think I've had my fill after just 10 hours.			"
