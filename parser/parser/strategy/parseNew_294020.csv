												The short version:Addictive but buggy, don't buy at full price but snap it up in a deal.The long version:As you have probably gathered this is a trading sim with a Heroes of Might & Magic sort of vibe, basically you ride around buying and selling stuff and getting really rich. There's also a storyline but I stopped following it pretty quick. Something to do with avenging your father's death (really).The difficulty curve in this game is INSANE when you start off. I think it took me at least 90 mins to get past the first quest of raising 4000 coins (or w/e the currency is), I was really close to giving up because it will seem like you're not getting anywhere. Some of the random events can be very unforgiving as well (e.g. 'high winds' meant your ship lost about 90% of its cargo)But if you get past that it gets a LOT easier to do cool stuff. And it is cool, for a while. But once you get to being a millionaire and reach the highest social rank, it's not 100% clear what you're supposed to do, apart from just get richer. There are quests but they usually amount to 'go to place, go to next place', and the payoff for each quest stays quite low - so you're making millions trading, but then spending 10 mins on a quest to be paid 3000. (Unless I'm missing something here).It's also kind of buggy; a couple of places (mines/monasteries) weren't accessible to me because they made my game crash, which meant I couldn't get a couple of the achievements. So a big recommendation: SAVE OFTEN because there is no autosave. Also there are places you can get trapped when the seasons change - you can't sail in winter so if you get trapped on an island you are pretty done because there's no 'sleep' option where you can just spend a day in the same place.But overall a nice way of wasting a few hours if you can get it on the cheap (from the looks of the forum the devs are pretty sharp at fixing bugs so some of this may be out of date soon anyway). Also - if anyone figures out how to play the knife game in the tavern, let me know!!			"

												Merchants of Kaidan is a trading simulation game (which you may be familiar with if you’ve played Sid Meier’s Pirates, or the Patrician series), where the fundamental game mechanic is buy low and sell high. Kaidan tries, and only sometimes succeeds, in spicing up the genre by adding a couple of different elements to the game. You can finish quests to boost your income, explore ruins and abandoned buildings, make investments by founding massage parlors, monasteries and other establishments, and hire different crew-members for your caravan of trade-wagons. And then there are the random events.Oh random events: drunken crew-members, weird old women, snakes...You have a “luck” score which presumably determines how bad your random events are going to be. Most of them tend to rob your hard-earned money or goods. Especially in the early parts of the game, I was incredibly frustrated by micro-catastrophes Kaidan kept throwing at me: cart breakdowns, thieving highwaymen, over-zealous tax-collectors, and bizarrely, gnomes trapped in treasure chests. Yes, all these events add flavor and randomness keeps things from getting stale, but for a strategy game, it seemed a little over-salted with random events that threw off the player.Unfortunately, it’s “strategy” where Kaidan is found lacking. Like I said, the core mechanic is about buying goods for low prices, and selling them for higher ones. To make good strategic choices, you have to be able to discern patterns and trends, and Kaidani makes that pretty difficult. Yeah, there’re some seasonal changes, and a couple of goods follow the rule-of-thumb of “buy in villages, sell in cities”, but even those weren’t guaranteed, and price fluctuations felt essentially arbitrary. Sometimes, your log may say things like “Feast in Town X! Price of olive oil is high!” but by the time your lowly horse-drawn cart finds its way there, the deal’s over and you’re left with an excess of expensive cargo. On top of that, you spend most of the first part of the game trading only furs and food, which are bulky and have slim profit margins, meaning you have a ton of grinding to do before you have enough money to rank up, and be deemed socially acceptable enough to buy lightweight luxuries such as spices and jewelry. You kinda forget the whole “I will avenge my father!” storyline as you wearily travel back and forth between towns, desperately trying to find a good buyer for that 600 kg of food you thought was a steal. After a couple of hours of play, I was getting thoroughly annoyed by the whole thing.Merchants of Kaidan gets some points for nice artwork, a decent musical score and with a couple of interesting gameplay features. Unfortunately, the core of the game feels unbalanced and underdeveloped. For a strategy title, unlike an adventure game, for example, where a good story can carry the game forward, that amounts to a cardinal sin. I wanted to feel like a powerful, capitalist, magnate, trading luxuries between the far corners of the world, raking in profits, and not like a petty pawnbroker, scraping the bottom of the barrel with scavenged goods.

Early Access Review
								EDIT*  Wave of bug fixes one day after posting a review. So far, the quest bugs, as well as button bugs seem to be fixed, and progression is once again possible. As such, we'll redo this review to the current state.The game gives you a decent pool of items to trade from, starting with a very basic 4 items and expanding as you level up. While larger cities may carry all goods, smaller outposts have a more limited variety. There are definite patterns from city to city which allows you to form strategy and design trade routes around the different items you are trying to trade. While it can sometimes be frustrating when prices aren't trending your way (especially considering the costs of travelling around the map while not making profit) it is quite possible to limit this by picking a smarter route and figuring out which cities might have cheaper prices in one item, with a nearby neighbor that buys consistently higher. You might still get burned sometimes, but that's part of the fun.If you're looking into this one purely as a trading game, there is definite promise.As alluded to by this edit, the Devs had a pretty fantastic response time to a pretty gamebreaking bug, which leaves hope for quick development and maybe some new features, locations, or an expanded list of tradeable goods.I did still note one minor graphical bug with one city background, which seemed to clear up upon leaving the city. The game likely won't be bug free, but it seems that major problems will be met with a fast response, and for that I'll give it a thumbs up.			"

												(tl;dr at the bottom of the post)Think of this game as a turn based trading board game you play by yourself.  It includes lots of random elements that are effectively dice rolls except that one of the dice has a broken wheel every turn and it takes an extra day to roll it.  If you play the storymode you start as a youth trying to avenge your father's death/betrayal brought on by his business partner who is never really mentioned after first hearing about him.  Now prepare yourself for what feels like a lifetime of gameplay not accomplishing much at all...Considering the developers are Polish I'm surprised how little ""polish"" this game has... I bought it on a recent sale where it went down well under $5.  I think it's is well worth <$5 but definitely not worth the non-sale price (~$15 right now).  Overall this game stinks of a development schedule that was cut short.  It's full of half-baked features, poor optimization and a general lack of refinement.  It seems more like a greenlit game than a full game... Oh wait!  That's because it was a greenlit game that was probably just rushed to market with the wonderful double game launch functionality Steam has invented.Unlike the main description exclaiming that the game has ""lots RPG elements"" there are in fact very few (no traditional exp / levels / etc...).  There is one stat point that determines whether or not you'll have a good time or if gameplay will be hellish.  This stat is ""Luck"" and can have a value of -3.0 or +3.0.  Ultimately it determines whether or not you have negative encounters while travelling (although carts seem to break down regardless of luck).  Once you figure out that you only have to boost this one stat (maybe by using some kind of diety based gambling mechanic?) then you have very few negative encounters and a ton of positive ones - effectively rigging the dice, feels more like cheating than anything.The UI is not very intuitive and has quite a few menus that only appear under specific conditions.  Playing through the storyline you'll also be bombarded with tons and tons of unnecessarily wordy text for quests (go to this place), or world events (excess amount or famine on certain goods).  All it would take is bolding on the keywords to eliminate the need for the text description but nope! - read this long block of pointless narrative when all we really want is for you to go from one location to another and then do that one or two more times and maybe buy something....There are many items in the game but they don't seem to do anything - they likely to do stuff but very few of them have clear indicator of what they do.  Some of them lower the price of certain goods but the lowered price is displayed in red so the immediate assumption is that it's set higher or you're being punished for doing a quest for the ""bad guys"".  Again - these suffer from the same UI problems (excessive text) I mentioned before and tend to have pretty vague interactions.There are also bugs but whatever.  They're less annoying than all the other issues...Eventually you start ignoring the bulk of the text and then scan for keywords, even further down the road you start just mindlessly clicking through the dialogs - you have +3.0 luck remember?  Surely with the broken mechanic in hand you can beat this awful game and put it to rest along all the others in your steam library.  Oh what;s that?  You accidentally gambled away 600 units of Arms for 600 units of Food?  Oh well, you managed to trade those back a bit later or maybe the $160,000 wasn't really important in the grand scheme of things.  Now you have your main character, a guy in a boat and a guy in an airship and a couple mines.  Every turn requires to to make three moves - for three distinct characters.  It's as if the developers said to themselves ""Hey - I know what would be more fun than playing this long arduous game with tons of dialogs and wordy text and slow progress!  Playing it three times at the same time so it takes three times as long to accomplish anything!"".  It's like the kid who plays the board game by himself only to find that it was made for other players so he brings out the other player pieces and starts playing with them too.  It's just dark and sad and pretty time consuming.Tl;drThis is a fun game with interesting gameplay but it has a lot of half-baked features that might make you regret any time/money you've invested in it.  I recommend consuming a moderate amount of alcohol to offset the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aspects of this game.			"

								Now that the two gamebreaking bugs are gone, you can finally enjoy being a merchant. Save and reload without fear of becoming broke and travel without getting stuck. If you like buying low and selling high, traveling around and killing people by sending them into shady caves, buy this game because you sir/madam will very likely enjoy it.  "

Early Access Review
								TL:DR: Look at other reviews for that :PFirst off iam no native english speaker so excuse my english if you find any grammatical mistakes.Iam not sure if i would recommend this game, i looked around for a long time to find a game where you be an actual merchant that doesnt own a ship and sail the ocean but really just uses his cart to travel. I was probably influenced by the Anime ""Spice and Wolf"" which is about a merchant travelling through the country selling goods and buying them. With the usual stuff like bandits, church war auctions, failures and sucess.So i looked at the game description and it seems fine so i bought it since 15€ aint alot for a game that could be the one iam looking for. But i didnt quite get what i was looking for.The tutorial was quite short and simple and i was able to proceed into the main game. The first thing that i really started to dislike are the weird buttons in the city. Why not just make it a Menu where you can choose where to go instead of making it a minigame of finding the button and remember where to go?After travelling through the Map i was confronted with random events and quest but no matter if i accepted some or not i still had them in my questlog, well whatever probably just a small bug. I also feared something bad would happen instantly if i decline. Because noblemen have power but nothing happend. Now the game description said you could buy furs in summer and sell them in winter. So i have not figured out which day of the year it is and when theres an actual summer or winter, or if its spring etc.Still traveling i noticed that even after visiting 20 cities most of the items i looked at had a average buy price of 0. So our merchant is to dumb to keep a log with prices? There should be a option or make it automaticly to memorize these prices without buying something in every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ place. Okay so iam kinda lost with the prices, lets go and buy some drinks for the people in the Tavern maybe i can get something useful. Well i got some Maps but no useful gossip. Noone knew anything useful thou. I would like if they could give you a hint for a good deal in the near locations like just 1 village away, you can also make it luck based either its true or not. Also no information at all where some of the stuff gets produced more. So i was buying and selling ore and was like ""Hey lets buy iron at this place near the mountains, its probably cheaper there then in the inland, where they have no mountains at all. How wrong i was. The cities near the mountains actually had the highest prices to buy and sell ore. And the cities in the inland had the best prices to buy and sell. Color me confused.Anyway my point is, theres villages and cities that produces specific goods that are usally known all over the country. Maybe northwest is specialized in weapons and arms, cities near forests usally have cheap pelts. And cities near a wide open space are great to get food. Stuff like that. Also adding a quality of wares. Like you could ask someone about a cities speciality and they answer ""this city has the finest and most expensive lumber, its made from these special trees that grow no where else blablablabla"". This wood is ofcourse much more expensive will probably attract more bandits and can only be sold in some special locations but it will make a hell of a profit.Also this game is missing War and Church. I know this is a fantasy setting but really what is a merchant trading game without these 2? A war makes the best trades for Weapon and Armor. The prices for Food could grow and you could get penalties for trading to much food since its used for the army. Armies could also overtake cities and you get better or worse prices depending on who you supported during the war. Or which region you belong to. The church on the other hand could be a good trading partner that could be way more powerful then a merchant guild. They can ban wares being traded or support the trading of specific wares. You could maybe even get blessings from the church.Iam not quite sure how you could implent it, but maybe you can add joining a religion too. Even more is coming yes!  So you said you will add even more regions? GREAT! But what i was always missing is the fact that there was only one currency. Different areas could use different currencies, that are worth more or less, like some cities produce silver coins that are worth much more and gold coins that are only worth pennies in moster other countries. You could also add ""counterfeit?"" money, uhm money that is actually worth way less because it has alot more lead in it to make it heavier or whatever. Iam no expert on this haha. All in all i would say, give the people more information and rework the interface and make it more intuitive. Thats the first thing you should work on. And find a way to note the prices of wares you find.			"

 Could be much better Basically the game is all about trading, making profit, collecting/investing money and climbing social ranks, there are also some rpg-like quests and other elements which makes it even more interesting. This said the game starts wonderfully, you only have around 1500 gold and one transport cart, whats more you are limited on what goods you can trade, all these factors make the game very fun and challenging (In the beginning!). You are pretty much always under pressure as you daily spend money to your crew, you pay prices when crossing bridges and so on. My point is you have to find some nice trade routes and make profit really fast... But! as the game advances and if you reach the midgame successfully it becomes very, very easy and it really breaks the experience. In mid and late stages of game, when you can trade all the goods, its so easy to find profit and you have so much money already, that you don't have to really  try  to do something, you just go on with the game like hot knife through butter. In fact the late game gets very repetitive - you have to just wonder through towns (Without caring or paying attention to anything) and whenever you see for example Jewerly uner 70 gold just buy it. The events also get very repetitive and boring.Overall  I can not give ""Not recommended"" to this one as you can have some fresh and new experience with it for some time, but I would give this one only 3 out of 5 stars. My suggestion is -  Dony buy  it if you are looking for a challenging game which will keep you hooked and interested for days and weeks.			"

												I love these kinds of trade games and this one had the potential to be really good but it's just such a hard drudge to progress. The cost to get between towns is so high on top of that I get attacked, my men get drunk, nobles take all my food - every bloody time! At such a low level you can only get access to a such a small portion of the game it just becomes a repetitive drudge. With such a nonsense economy (why can't you buy cheap ice from a mountain town? and why doesn't the price barely change from summer to winter?) I think $15 should buy me an easy mode.I really regret buying this game :-(			"

												I really enjoy Merchants of Kaidan. It fills a niche for a type of game I've been looking for, a non-linear Merchant game. After reading several negative reviews I started to get scared off but I was so curious I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't. The game has unlimited potential that it hasn't reached to this point but it is a good game as is. I'm hoping they really get to work and make it a great game. Some of the writing is strange but you get the point. Perhaps there are translation issues, dunno. The trading isn't completely random like others have stated. I used excel and have tracked every towns prices and the changes that take place as the seasons change. The prices aren't set in stone and that is a good thing as if they were you could just make the same runs over and over and that would be broken. The difficulty is pretty hard at the beginning as you struggle to find ways to make money due to the limited resources you are allowed to trade. But with a little patience and thought you figure it out. My guess is those that come into the game unwilling to map things out and make notes will not like this game without sticking with it. I for one hope the development team gets busy and adds more content to a wonderful base.			"

												The one mechanic and a reason for some of the negative reviews is that the game doesn't emphasise how luck makes a big impact on events.I started again and boosted my luck to 3 (with blessings and items) and I rarely had negative events impacting me. The game is still difficult but it makes it much more playable. It's an engaging game, the interface is smooth and with a bit of trial and error, you can work out how much each product buys and sells for.I had fun for a handful of days with it.			"

Posted: November 18, 2014
												*Update*After an update to the game and a couple messages from the developer, I decided to give Merchants of Kaidan another try. The game now has an ironically titled ""Realistic Prices Model"" option also known as Easy Mode. I find it an odd choice of words as it implies that the normal game setting uses an unrealistic price model but that's semantics, I suppose.This is highly recommended for anyone starting out in Merchants of Kaidan. This mode basically makes all the statements regarding city specialties and location-based pricing much more pronounced (read: actually noticeable). Now, when I went to the ore town, I more-or-less knew I would get a good price on ore. This mode also features a series of tabs showing you the prices from the cities you've visited for the last 10 turns, essentially managing the basic bookkeeping for you. It makes sense that the game would provide this since it does say that the person managing your cart is supposed to help with bookkeeping. You may still want to keep your own series of notes throughout the game, however, as this is far from giving you a global view of Kaidan's economics, plus it won't help with tracking seasonal changes.Ultimately, it's a mode that holds much more promise than the basic mode although it's mildly demeaning that requesting a realistic pricing model is listed as easy mode. The odd pricing scheme is still in effect where you can't sell products for the same amount as the guy next to you in any given town with any given product. Some odd quibbles still exist as well, after updating, including typos found in a couple of the written entries (""thron of airship"" instead of ""thrown off airship"" in the Thieves tip.) and the inability to scroll comfortably to the edge of the map, meaning edge towns remain more difficult to select than they need to be.I still can't recommend the game to the average player for these issues but it's certainly on the right track. If you are looking for a difficult economics game and don't mind putting serious effort into understanding the complex system, Merchants of Kaidan is worth a try. If that sounds daunting or even just tedious, this isn't the game for you.*Original Review*Merchants of Kaidan is a game with a fantastic premise that could have been so much more. Forsaking the common fantasy tropes of becoming a knight or a king, Merchants of Kaidan puts you in the role of just that, a merchant. There is no combat or magic or anything like that and while that may be offputting for many gamers, the fresh concept was very exciting for me.There are several modes you can play in MoK including a story mode, where you play as a young adult from a powerful merchant family who, following betrayal, has to start anew and avenge his father's death, and several free-play modes with goals like ""get to 1000000 gold"" or ""play for five (in-game) years"". All of them put you in the shoes of a fresh-faced merchant who has to travel around, increasing his renown and building up income. You do this by buying goods from one place and selling them in another, ideally for a profit. It's a simple concept but one that is immensely satisfying when mastered.The problem of the game lies in the mechanics and that's where MoK truly falters. Despite the game design claiming that they use a complex algorithm to create a realistic yet immensely complicated economic structure for the world, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for almost anything that happens. It starts with the base mechanic of buying versus selling. Namely, no matter where you are or what you're selling, you always sell a product for less than what you can buy it for in the same location. This means that you play as literally the worst merchant in the history of economics. You can't sell something for the same price the guy next to you is selling it for? Why? These aren't cars, they aren't losing their value. This mechanic would make sense if you were buying a product at a place it's produced (ore at a mine, for example) but this is the case for anything and everything no matter where you are. The game also tells you that cities specialize in certain products and that buying there will be cheaper than other places. While this seems to be the case some of the time, it's not the rule. Going to the central ore city is usually cheaper than buying ore other places but going to the town known for it's wines doesn't seem to make alcohol any cheaper than anywhere else. In fact, in my game, it was commonly the most expensive place to buy wine. Maybe that means it's higher quality but then why can't I sell this higher quality wine for a higher price elsewhere? Random events also cause a deep problem as they are based around a statistic known as your luck. Many of these events will decrease your luck stat while a select few will increase it. Since your luck determines how often you are to receive each type of event, this means you will almost always fall into a bad luck pit that you can never get out of. Expect constant cart breaks, delays and taxes since this is what you will have for the rest of the game.That's not to say the game is all bad though. While the quests are mostly take person A from point A to point B (then to point C and point D...), the fact that it has a quest system is an interesting boon and a strong motivator for pressing on through hardship. Your ability to search ruins for items and eventually wipe out the monsters and build up passive income buildings is also a lot of fun and can be satisfying. Ultimately, if you're willing to move past the randomness of the prices and the fact that all the mechanics are designed to make your life harder, there is a tough game here that some could enjoy. For most, however, Merchants of Kaidan is one investment you shouldn't make.			"

												This little addicting gem combines a turn-based trading-simulation game (very hard and unforgiving at times) with RPG and Adventure elements. It's not the best in any category, but this melded hybrid is very appealing. I haven't learnt and remembered 30+ cities by name for a game in a long-long time.The game unveils as you get higher up in rank (via quests) with very difficult phases in the beginning, so unless you're ready to spend time to rinse & repeat often, you won't like the abrupt start.Carefully crafted visual details or subtle quest hints may make you fall in love with it. E.g. press B and move the pages of the book with your cursor or watch the cities in different seasons. While at the same time, some of the mechanics and especially random events will raise your rage levels. C'est la vie. Literally.Continuous updates and answers from the developers so far make it a rare game.Conclusions:- DO BUY & TRY it if you want a trading game & complex mechanics (even if you'll only be able to reverse engineer over time - the opportunistic approach will ... barely ... keep you afloat financially). Especially if you've ever taken notes / keeping a spreadsheet to master a game.- DO NOT BUY if you don't have patience, don't want to be challenged by someone else's mechanics or have a tendency to rage-quit games you haven't finished in the first 3 hours.

												It's a good game if you pay less than $3 for it. I think I paid $1.50 and given that I played it for more than 10 hours, I definitely got my money's worth.The atmosphere and sound are very relaxing while still adding a sense of tension surrounding turning a profit. You need to come out ahead on every transaction, as losing even 1-2GP per cargo can be punishing after factoring in time lost, traveling fees, etc. Sometimes you'll be relieved just to break even.The strongest portion of the game, in my opinion, is when you are only operating a single cart. Later in the game you'll unlock a boat that can travel between ports and an airship that can travel pretty much anywhere, but managing this is tedious as you'll be constantly having to meet up to trade goods and coin between them to reach the next merchant tier. The mid-end game doesn't provide much of a challenge as you should, at this point, have enough of a buffer to easily cover any losses stemming from a bad transaction or two, versus the early game where every coin spent is carefully weighed against its risk/reward potential. The late game also suffers from a variety of systems that feel kind of tacked on - having a variety of carts is novel but the tools to manage them feel weak, storage of goods seems like an afterthought, you never need to actually purchase insurance, profits from installing monks/miners/brewers are pitifully low for how much effort you spend setting them up, cavecrawling feels extremely unrewarding (not to mention the QTE combat window is incredibly small, it must be less than 1/8th of a second at most). I could keep listing minor complaints about this section of the game, but in a nutshell it seems like the developers spent most of their brainpower making sure the core early game works well, which to their credit, it does.In spite of these flaws, you have a fairly engrossing simulator which takes enough time to figure out that it's well worth the modest sale price.7/10 would supply arms to both sides again			"

												Unlike some I really like the game. I won't spoil it for you by giving any major tips as figuring it out is the whole point of the game but I will confirm a few things-prices are not random but they do fluctuate in a wave, diffent towns have different ranges. seasons matter.-as you progress things get easier in some ways and harder in others-if your smart and perceptive its not that hard to start off; i have advanced to multicarts in under 10 mins of play-everything has its use though some items/specialists are mainly usful much laterthe only tips i'll leave you with is at the begining concentrate only on trading; don't hire specialists or special items- they are ment for later and you can go broke very quickly if you do.

												This is a fun and atmospheric trading game set in the mystical world of Kaidan.Pros:+ rich atmosphere. The hand-painted pictures and soundtrack are superb! + sophisticated economy. Prices will change depending on season, random events, luck etc.+ dozens of side quests. I was receiving so many that I began to turn them down.+ there's a few mini-games to break up the trading grind. Cons:- the early phase of the game can be very hard. You can only trade a few items. Some people may be deterred. - lack of character customisation. You're stuck playing the main character of the game. - lack of RPG. You have no traits, attributes, relationships etc. The only number that changes is your gold. I would've liked to be able to interact with the world of Kaidan in a more organic way. - a few bugs still exist in the game.- some spelling errors.  Overall, it's a fun game. If you love trading games like Elite, but also want to immerse yourself in a fantasy setting, this game should be on your list. During the last session I played, I lost sense of time and suddenly realised it was midnight. Games like this deserve a thumbs up.			"

												EDIT: Now that the game has been released, I am updating the review. The game has fully become what I had expected of it. It is a great game, very well worked out. When you like trading games, but don't want a boring buy-and-sell-only type of game, try this one!Here's my E.A. review, except for the bugs/typos, it's still quite accurate:This game is very nice already in its current state. Except for some typo's here and there, the texts are very readable (something you don't see often) and the story itself is simple yet nice.Except for one system hang (had to completely reset my pc), the game has not yet had any glitches with me.I was very afraid that the game would quickly become boring, but after 2 hours of playing (and enjoying), I can say that except for some events that have repeated a lot, most of the time I was discovering new things.The game is not yet finished, although I think it already is a very good game, much more finished than several other already released games, so I can't wait to see what's coming next.A very relaxing, but not at all boring, game. I am very glad that I have supported the development of this game and I hope they will finish it (but not too soon, this game has still much potential for even more gameplay, even though it already is great).

I also can't find out how you are supposed to put the specialists into ruins so that they can start there monasteries. I understand that it is still early release so hoepuly they will be able to fix those problems. also I can't find where to acess the travel log which would be helpful because sometimes there are market fluctuation hints.

												So far i've been very impressed by this game.  If you are looking for something a little different in the gaming world, this game is definitely that.  It deals within a complex economy that is built into the game and fluctuates just as an economy would in the real world.  At first, the trading is challenging as you learn different ways to take advantage of the market.....your efforts might seem fruitless at first, as did mine, but give it time and the beauty of the game takes shape. I think there are a few areas of improvement that could be made, a little more variation in events that occur during traveling(i mean seriously, how many stinkbeavers are there lol) would be nice.  Overall, it's been a lot of fun this far.			"

								This isn't a horrible game however the biggest problem is that there are so many games similar to this one that are so much better.  If you like trading games then you'd have much better luck with a game like port Royale 3.  The biggest issue with the trade system in this game is that you pretty much need to memorize the advrage vaules of every trade good which pretty much is going to turn into guess work.  Another issue is that the game really has the feel of a free game you'd play on newgrounds or something.  The game is still being worked on so who knows, maybe some of the problems will be fixed later, but it really seems to me like the game is flawed at it's core since it's most important feature is the trading yet that is so poorly done.  Oh and this is more of a personal complaint and more of a ""it's just me"" thing but I hate the art style.  Everyone in the game either looks like an ailen or they are inbreed to me.   "

								Ok let's try this.This Game is not good, but also not that bad either. It lacks a few Features, which I'll try to explain now:The ""flow"" of the Game is really smooth at the actual State of the Game. But what I don't really get are the Prices of towns. I didn't found any hint on how the Prices on different Items are affected. Ok, I understand, that some Items costs more in Winter and less in the Summer, but how is it Possible, that the Price of Food and/or Hide goes up/goes down about ~20% in ONE run from one Town to another and back? I didn't get this algorithm.One Feature that also would be cool is the following: I often get the ""Event"" where I can help a Merchant, which than told me, where I could sell something to a good price...the Second Time I didn't even found the namend Village...Something like a Highlighted Village or a ""Tooltip"" showing, while going over the Town with the Mouse.Tooltip: While going over a Town with your Mouse, let you show some Informations of your last Visit (the Price of Items the last Time you visited for Example).All together: The Game is a Funny Timesink atm, but needs a lot of work to be done. I love Games like this, just to chill and don't think that much about other stuff in life :)So: Buy it, but not now...or buy it and support the Developers.			"

Would highly recommend now.Previous Review:I was having a lot of fun playing this game for the first few hours I played it.  I'm a big fan of trading games and have played others in the past like tradewinds and patrician etc.  The biggest problem with this game is the fun is ruined the moment a game ruining bug happens.  I came across a bug after several hours of play yesterday causing me to not be able to move my cart after loading my game.  I've left a bug report, but so far I haven't heard back.  I can not recommend the game in its current state.  This is the first time i've ever saved and reloaded my game so needless to say i'm hesitant to even start another new game in Merchants of Kaidan as the same thing might happen again.  Regretting the purchase at the moment :(.			"

But at your journey you will found manykinds of event from meet other trader, bandits, cart damage, etc. To do the trading you need to know the average price of every item because there's no certain indicator that at certain town we can sell items at very high price or buy at the lowest price.

												This is a rather simplistic trading caravan game. With a basic picture interface, you can go to taverns, buy drinks for strangers, acquire new and sometimes useful information and even hire mercenaries to guard your caravans. You can earn money by trading, completing quests and objectives, as well as by upgrading your caravan to hold even more goods and merchandise. The simplistic style, combined with the unoriginal concept makes this game a little less palatable than some of the others out there. It isn't exactly a horrible game, but not one I would recommend buying. There are several other trading/caravan-type games out there which have more versatility.			"

												This is just my side of the story, which I was compelled to write after reading a number of negative reviews.This is a trading game with very solid mechanics. If you don't like this type of game, stay away from it. Making money and completing quests will get you up the merchant hierarchy ladder, which will gradually increase the amount of goods you can trade. The trading locations are fixed, so eventually there will be repetition as there is a limited number of locations and different goods to trade. That said, the games offers a ton of side quests to follow, side activities to earn extra cash which imply basic  character development, two extra playable trading characters, ... In summary, a good game that develops its full potential as you play. Two main criticisms:1.- You might want to check the easy play box in the start menu for prices to make any sense.2.- When playing with two or three characters, you can exchange the items they have. The problem is that many of those items have the same picture, but in the pop-up window to exchange them you cannot see their description, so you have no real idea which one you are transferring between characters. Eventually, that makes you stop customizing your characters as it becomes a real pain in the behind (if you know what I mean).3.- As most trading games, eventually it gets repetitive, meaning it lacks repeatability.Is Merchants of Kaidan a good trading game? No doubt. I liked it better than Patrician or Port RoyaleIs it one of 10 games I would take to a forgotten island? Definitely no.Is it worth full price? If you are REAL fan of trade games, yes. Otherwise, wait for a Steam sale.			"

												Merchants of Kaidan is one of those former ""early access"" games that was never quite finished. It is definitely a little rough around the edges, and the criticisms raised in the negative reviews are all valid.  However the parts that were finished -- the core of the game -- are good enough for me to give a solid recommendation, provided you understand what you are getting into.First of all, the trading mechanics in this game are very simple (I would even say casual). There is no realism or predictibility to the economic system whatsoever, and it is not possible to develop a long term strategy by identifying and exploiting favorable trade routes, for example. The excitement in Merchants of Kaidan is of the gambling variety -- the occasional thrill of hitting the jackpot when you randomly find a great deal on that cargo you've been lugging around for the past two weeks. In fact, playing this game reminds me very much of what it feels like to play video poker: getting by on marginal trades (pairs, jacks or better) while bidding your time waiting for the big score (straight flush) that will propel you to the next level.What really makes Merchants of Kaidan worth playing are its artistic qualities. The world building, artwork, and music are all beautifully done and very evocative. The world of Kaidan is what I can only describe as ""medieval steampunk"" -- the villages, horse drawn carts, and peasant workers all seem like something out of the late middle ages. But look more closely and you'll spot aliens underneath some of those hooded cloaks, and airships plying the trade routes alongside (or above) the wooden carts.I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in Kaidan. If you are not expecting a deep strategy experience, and if you can excuse the fact that the late game feels somewhat unfinished, it is definitely worth a try. At the very least, download the demo and do a little tavern hopping to get a feel for what the world of Kaidan is like.			"

												Most good trading games have an approachable trading engine at their core, with intriguing ""RPG"" extras on top. Merchants of Kaidan attempts that, but it's core trading mechanics are so unrewarding that it just make the whole endeavor annoying, and the ""RPG"" extras in the game are lost because of it. For the most part you are wandering the map at continual cross purposes, getting frustrated at the incremental progress you're making.

												I purchased this game for ~$1.25 and for what I paid for it it is worth it. The game itself, is a fun game. The text in the game is rife with grammatical errors which ruins the emersion. The music is nice, the quest tracking is rancid, there are four separate quest tracking tabs and if you're not careful you could accidentally time out a quest in an unmonitored tab. THere is a quest needs to be completed ! when there is about 5 days left on the quest which could trigger when you're at the very least distance away of two weeks. The slider selection tool for selecting troops and other such things is horrendous. When I try to reduce my units to send into a cave by 1, it goes to 0, not instantly, incrementally beyond my control, this is a bug because it bounces back and forth like it's playing pong all without any input from my device. It can't be my mouse, because nothing else is affected, not the mouse pointer, not other mouse based games. Once a unit is set in a location, ie.. Monk in a temple, with a botonist, fermentist, and agriculturist, none of the accessories (everything but the monk so to speak), can be retracted so they can be trained.This game is fun and is not worth more than $1.25 in its current state. The least they could do is proof read the English text, and if English isn't their first language, they should find someone who can proof read the translation, it looks like whoever wrote this game has English as a second language and based on its linear progression I would guess this comes from a Chinese developer or an 8th grade English drop out (no offense meant to the Chinese develeoper, my Mandarin is worse). And please fix the damn bugs, and ui issues. Not to mention the graphic optimization is terrible as well, I have an R9 290X graphics card and experience poor framerates on the top down map when there is rain or snow. For a game with these simple graphics that should not be.			"

												I really enjoyed this game, and played it every chance I got for a couple weeks. Granted, as the father of three young boys, that is not as impressive as it sounds. It took a couple of restarts to get the hang of the trading. I kept wanting to push to the higher priced goods too quickly.  There are a couple of complaints I had, but they were more nuisance than problem. The more concerning is that there are several random events where it doesn't seem to matter which option you choose. And not just the effects, the message is identical in either case.The other, hopefully soon fixed,  problem was typos. There are A LOT of typos. The one that happened often enough for me to remember is that when you use the blackmail material, it says you are not successful, but that you get 10,000 tirgons.Like I said, I enjoyed this game even with the problems. Enough that, if they come out with an update addressing this stuff, I'll probably play through it again. "

												This is an excellent trading game with a bit of a storyline and inspiring (albeit somewhat repetitive - only 5 tracks) music. Many people complain about the dodgyness of the economics, but I do understand it from the point of view of a trader. Starting off isn't easy and could take a bit, as you take into account the pricing and fluctuation of the system. Questing provides a sort of guideline on where to go next, and the addition of specialist and ""combat missions"" with dynamic rewards adds to the mix.Pick it up on special if you like economics/trading/tycoon games.

												Nice graphics, the scenery carries you into another world through small details, from the horses to the houses to the music, the game succeeds in creating its own identity. The few, agreable but quickly reached RPG elements add to the interest. However the game fails miserably on its main mechanics : storytelling and the economic simulation.Storytelling is overwrought and written in an English not necessarily broken, but often nonsensical. Intructions for quests follow the same pattern : too long and often incomprehensible. Sometimes place names or stuff names are wrong, good luck finishing the quests.The economic simulation doesn't work. They state the game uses a ""complex trading algorithm"", which means prices are completely random. You will never understand how and why they change, seasons mean nothing, supply and demand even less. On top of that the UI is often confusing, instead of helping you, you'll have no idea if you are making a good or a bad deal. The consequence will be that you'll spend an enormous amount of time just earning enough money to advance in the main quest, and trading will become boring.Merchants of Kaiden would have been a formidable game if the developers had concentrated their efforts on the core mechanics instead of losing time on silly minigames (BTW ""2 out of 10 implemented"" while development stopped March 2015).Do not buy full price.

												I have a lot of good to say about this game, but also a lot of bad. It's far from perfect, but in the end I finished it and had fun with it, so I'd recommend.Pros:+ The travelling merchant experience is there. If you are browsing this game, I'm guessing you are looking for a game that let's you travel from town to town buying low and selling high. Well, this game will deliver on that. I'd say the trading mechanics are pretty solid.+ The game has a story. It's not super creative or deep, but it does keep the game moving to some extent. This is a simple thing, but it's absent in too many of these economic/merchant type games.Cons:- Although I'm fine with the travelling merchant experience, it's just not enough. The game does get quite repetitive after a while. I have to confess that I considered quitting before the end. Once you get rich enough and experienced enough, there is nothing new under the sun. You are just kind of going through the motions. The game does make an effort in this regard, by allowing you to do things like clear dungeons and open massage parlors, but these things are kind of half-hearted and don't add much.-  The story has a tendency to stagnate, and there were times when I was just wandering around trying to figure out what I had to do to advance the story. As it turns out, many of the story events only trigger when you go to certain places. I eventually realized that you have to be careful to explore the whole world (not just your favorite trading routes) or you might never trigger the story's advancement.			"

												This is barely a game. Contrary to some of the other reviews, you don't need a spreadsheet or anything--just remember what the rough price range is for a few key commodities and you'll be in great shape. As you move up through the ranks, though, this becomes increasingly tedious, and none of the new features you unlock add anything meaningful. It's basically an exercise in how much annoyance you can put up with, from the incomprehensible ""quests"" to the awkward interface to the absolutely pointless ""partnership"" system (which basically ensures that 2/3 of your game is wasted on accumulating money your main character can't even use, no I'm not kidding). Give it a pass.			"

Early Access Review
								I liked the concept of this game but after 2x2 hour sessions I've had enough, you simply can't make a profit. Endless wagon breakdowns, robbers taxes and tolls take away any chance of making money. You can only realisticly work with one product, food, anything else you buy never shows a profit.  How long it would take to get 5000, to reach the next stage, is anyone's guess.  When I thought I was making a profit, bandits and customs and wagon breakdowns wiped it out. I'm bored with it and I regret paying £10.99 for it.  NOT WORTH A FIVER			"

												Not a bad game, but quite limited.The game has an interesting start when you get to know the game and is fighting for your survival and every earned coin, but it gets progressively easier and increasingly pointless. After 4 hours of game it no longer makes sense. For me the breaking point was getting another merchant to work for me, and realising I didn't really care. I tried starting over, but since there is only one small map and you are limited in what you are allowed to do to begin with, there is no actual replay value.The only good thing are the merchant rank progression quests which requires some skill, otherwise the main story line progresses apparently randomly and without skill, and all other quests are usually meaningless.If you like hoarding money for no apparent reason this game might appeal, otherwise you can get 3-4 hours of entertainment out of it until it gets too easy and the pointlessness of money hoarding gets to you.

												Merchants of Kaidan isn't a horrible game, however there are so many other games similar to it that are so much better and enjoyable. Most good trading games have a trading engine at their core, with  ""RPG"" extras. While this game attempts that, it's core trading mechanics are so unrewarding that it just makes it annoying, and the ""RPG"" extras in the game are virtually nonexistent. For the most part you are wandering the map, getting frustrated at the incremental progress you're making or lack of, which after awhile it gets repetitive and boring. The economy in the game makes no sense, it seems to be extremely flawed at it's core since it's most important feature is the trading and yet its so poorly done. Also, it takes over 6 hours for 3 cards to drop, ridiculous!			"

												I'm going to recommend it because of the low sale price and I like trading games.However, older games like Patrcician III, Port Royale 3, and  Rail Road Tycoon II are all more fun complex and immersive than this game.I thought I'd like the fantasy setting more, but not so much.  I gave it a chance, but will go back to playing the 3 other games I mentioned above whenever I feel the itch to play a trading game again.I'm still glad this particular game exists though, because it takes a lot of risks in such a small genre.  Would love to see more indie trading games on steam.  It's not a bad game, it's just not for me and I simply prefer other trading games that I already own.So still might be worth a try for someone who's never played trading games before.			"

												A surprisingly refreshing game where you play as a trader, carting and hawking your wares across a beautiful world map. There is freeplay and a story mode, lots of random events and semi-random quests, lots of items, NPCs and upgrades to help you on the way. The art and presentation are relatively minimal but are done very well and fit nicely. Easily recommendable if you're interested in trading sims and / or lightweight RPGs.			"

												I was thinking about getting this game for a bit now. After seeing many cool things and new features that were added almost every week (and updates still seem to keep coming weekly) I decided to finally pull the trigger. And I'm glad I did. After playing for a couple of days now I found out you can play this game in, at least, 3 different ways. You can seek best offers chasing disasters and events in different places while trying to make as much profit as possible, complete quests and get rewarded, utilize mine, ruins and (perhaps) other estates to increase your income or play a bit of everything and do whatever you like or whatever falls into your lap. I gotta admit I'm a bit hooked. I can't wait to uncover new things next time I level up. I already catch myself playing way too late into the night... but hey... after all  it's holiday season;).I also really like the fact that sometimes I have to choose between finishing my quest or getting a great deal I had lined up done and it's either one or the other. In most games you don't have to choose or worry about it because your quest will always wait for you to finish it or you can restart it anytime you want. I like that here it's more like things are in real life: you don't always have enough time to do everything you like. Well... at least not until you restart or load game (if you thought of saving in time, that is);).I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games that involve trading, RPG or both and looks for a game they could spend long winter evenings with.

												It's not a bad game, but it's filled with bugs and it's not that good either.Takes awhile to get your ropes in a knot, but once you understand the behavior of the game it get easier.The game crashes a lot so save a lot, locations you can't go when some factor is in play or simple you turn not ending when you gave you tavel orders.At first you are on your own with a small crew, eventually you can get a sea captian and an air captain to join you in your venture. But that's one part of the game I really don't like. They just seem to slow the pace, I got rid of them first, it was just annying to have them around and didn't really increase my profites, it just ment more management. But the problem is if you want to do the story... you f***ing need them. Yes I hated having them around that much. They can skip a turn but only once then they HAVE to move. I wouldn't have minded so much if I could just pay them a wage and use them when I need. But you absolutly have to spend time moving them around. That for me on top of the crashes and the bugs was a ral buzz killer.			"

												A humble trading game. Graphics are a bit poor for the likes of today, with fixed 2D pictures of places with link points, but are correct for the playing purposes. The mechanics are good, with many variable factors and random events, but like other games of the genre, requires perseverance to learn what goods are profitable, where buy and sell, and, over all, keep on moving on search of benefits, by air, earth and sea. And this is the true challenge of the game, with a main campaign with more than 100 ""missions"" in a little map of 40 cities and towns. Can buy special or magic items, hire professionals of various types and mercenaries, manage mines, distilleries and parlours. Maybe its not orgininal, shows a lot of unnecessary texts and requires at least Windows 7, but it should be welcomed among the trading titles. Like the game teaches, buy it with a generous discount!			"

Flawed, but a good, fun game overall.			"

Probably would have preferred if some commodities were slightly more static by destination.Overall, worth a gander, at pricing noted above--I am not regretting the time spent playing.			"

												Weeeeell this game is frustrating!Here are the good parts:- Now, the game runs well and has no bugs that i could see, so thats good- The graphics are pretty low so it should work on any old cr..a..p...py computer, device whatevar. In fact, there are no animations, only still images. But its ok for a trading game. I didn't mind- Sound is ok but repetitive. Might want to mute the music after awhile.The bad parts:- It's not a good trading game. It seems everything you do depends far more on luck than how competent you are at trading stuff. Just getting the 4000 gold to get into the merchant guild as your first quest took hours where i traveled around, made only money to stay even (at 1000 gold) when suddenly i got lucky and found a village selling low priced food right next to the capital who bought it at high price. There i made 3000 gold in 5 minutes. That's after 4 hours of play!- To make things even worse, price flucuates wildly for no reason most of the time. The only logical reason is because of the season change, One day food is priced at 6 gold and a few days later its 20 golds. And the season didn't change. And it can happen at any city or farming village. WTFuuuuuu..c...k? So trying  to establish a valuable trading route is impossible. It all depends on the luck you have to be at the right place at the right time. So most of the time, you move around with no cargo because its not worth it. But you still have to pay your guys each day.- To make things a lot worse, you got the concept of how lucky you are! It goes from -3 to +3. Positive is good and negative is very very bad. When in the positive, most of the time nothing happens when you travel, so thats pretty good. But if you misbegotten son of a wh....ore get into the negative, you are in deep troubles. At -1.4, i got dragons attacking me EVERY TRIP. They eat my wares so i lose cash over the maintenance i pay for each trip. And when you are unlucky, it is very difficult to get back to lucky or neutral again, because you get more and more unlucky events that drop your luck. You might say, just pay a sheet.load of money to get your luck back, but until you are very rich, you don't have the money to buy your way outta bad luck.WOW, what a concept! A game so based on luck that it doesn't matter what you do it all depends on chance!I don't like game of chance so this game is not for me. I prefer to play poker instead, i get better luck and its far more fun. "

												Its not horrible, but it is frustrating. Unless you're familiar with the map you'll do a lot of wandering around to get places, because you can't zoom out on the map enough to see all locations. The map lagged a lot for me too. There were way too many random events such as ""found a diamond"" or ""this mysterious person wants to travel to..."". Almost every trip I got one! And there really wasn't a lot of time to deliver the mystery people to their destinations. Also, in the time I spent playing, I found it hard to find places to make a profit on some goods. One good had a buy average of around a 120 but a sell average of about 30. I couldn't find anywhere to sell it for a profit! (I didn't buy any, but just checking prices as I travelled.) Right now am not really inspired to open the game again. I guess I will leave it a few days and try it again, and if I grow to like it I will change my review but in the meantime I cannot recommend it.			"

Great Trading GameMerchants of Kaidan is the obvious winner of the genre. Already from the beginning, it does not hold your hand, which is a nice change of pace by today's standard. There is no safe trades and it forces you to adapt and think by our own ways to squeeze every profit that you can get your hands on. The gameplay is simple and the progress is satisfying.Do not Quit when you fail!This game has answers, when you think RNG hits you in the face due to luck, think harder! There are forces in the game that allows you to influence RNG, so do not blame your failure in your sorry fate. Pick yourself up again and this time pay for the various luck blessings (Yes, they cost money, yes the game is not easy) that are available. If you fail, it means you do not try hard enough, and we all know how cutthroat it is doing business in the real world. Nobody will pick you up and hold your hand, do it yourself and I assure you that you will feel greatly rewarded when you beat the game using your business (or gaming, rather) acumen.			"

												Merchants of Kaidan is a trading simulator set in a fictitious, fantasy (setting) world. The main interface involves clicking around on various towns/cities to navigate your trade caravan and interact with the world. Your primary goal is to trade goods and make money via buying low and selling high.  Basic fetch/deliver quests also make up a significant part of the gameplay. You can also trade items, which bolster your caravan or character in various ways. During gameplay, random events can occur that will hurt or harm your business.Here's my short list of pros and cons.Pros:-Fun, albeit basic trading simulator. If you enjoy trading simulators similar to the 'Patrician' series, you'll probably like it.-The artwork and design is unique (in a good way).-Random events that occur while moving around the map keep the game fresh for a while.-Creating stationary businesses (massage parlors/mines/wineries) add a few other fun elements to the game.-Quest text can be interesting.Cons:-Some of the character dialogue can be really confusing due to what appear to be translation errors.-There are some bugs that require the game to be restarted or that crash the game completely (to be fair, I didn't find many gameplay bugs).-Some features are not explained very well, even with the various tooltips available in the game.-Some features don't appear to be fleshed out fully (partnerships could be so much better).-It can get VERY tedious trying to find special characters to join your caravan. Sometimes you will visit 100 pubs before you find the person you're looking for.-The UI for inventory/quests/map/etc. is really bad. I still have trouble finding and navigating the quests screen. The developer should have labeled the various symbols with words. UI windows also close if you click anywhere outside of them...I found this highly annoying as I had to constantly reopen UI windows.Overall, I'd recommend the game for the price. It has a certain charm to it that makes it very entertaining and it certainly has that 'just one more turn' feel to it.			"

												Intensely fun trading game.Pros:-As far as I can tell, it's a completely new world.  And I love it.-Alien Steampunk meets Count of Monte Cristo.-Several methods of transportation, and many alternate ways to make money.-Gritty.  Ugly-as hell aliens  make up the bulk of the population, but you need them, and they need you.-Hitting home the realistic ""right place at the right time"" / ""wrong place at the wrong time"" constantly.  You may feel like it's a luck-game, but in reality, you control your actions; you make your fortune while the odds are against you.-Assuming you don't bomb in the first thirty minutes of gameplay, the rest is fairly smooth sailing and quite enjoyable.-Alarmingly simple, once you get the hang of it.  Prices only change at the beginning of a new day, not as you buy/sell each item individually.  Hey, I said, ""intensely FUN"", not ""intensely REALISTIC"", and to me, that's actually a good thing.CONS:-Music is ridiculously calming.... ALL the time.... Don't get me wrong, it's good music, but you know.... maybe a 5 second long ""tragic"" tune when you get sprayed by a stinkbeaver, or when you get robbed.... Give me something here devs? I want some music to help me feel sorry for myself for those 5 seconds.....-Kind of grindy, especially if you're not intending on doing any of the quests.-If you don't catch on quick to the small-scale scheme at the beginning, you're in for a rough ride.  >>  Buy food cheap in the small villages that hunt, and sell in the big cities.  Upgrade your capacity and repeat.9/10It's rare that I find a game I can rate above 7/10 and not feel like I'm being merciful, much less find a game deserving of 9/10 at all.  But this one has won me over.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but it wouldn't let me.Probably one of the worst economic trading games you can find.  No rhyme or reason to the prices of things.  That's not just me saying it, it's also the giantbomb gameguide writer saying ""ya, totally random pricing, good luck"".  You got cities sometimes selling food for less than the rural villages.  Mountain towns selling ore for more than the villages on the plains.  And if they just came out and say ""ya, it's totally random"" at least you'd know what you are dealing with. But no, they insist on telling you over and over that certain cities are producers and others are consumers.  Well if that is true, sir, you are the worst buggiest programmer to every write an economy AI.And in a buck against the trend, this game starts brutally hard then (according to game guides) becomes extremely easy.  This must be to make some kind of point that starting easy and increasing the challenge as the player learns the game is all wrong.I don't know why they made a trading game where the new player can only trade in 4 of all the products.  And then make 2 of those 4 useless (you'll never find someone buying it for higher than you got it) so you have to GRIND your way to making the first 4,000 gold 50-100 gold at a time.  I spent 2hrs and only got 2,000 gold.  I give up.  I see no reason to grind in an unfun game just to hope it becomes fun later.			"

												Intensely fun trading game.Pros:-As far as I can tell, it's a completely new world.  And I love it.-Alien Steampunk meets Count of Monte Cristo.-Several methods of transportation, and many alternate ways to make money.-Gritty.  Ugly-as hell aliens  make up the bulk of the population, but you need them, and they need you.-Hitting home the realistic ""right place at the right time"" / ""wrong place at the wrong time"" constantly.  You may feel like it's a luck-game, but in reality, you control your actions; you make your fortune while the odds are against you.-Assuming you don't bomb in the first thirty minutes of gameplay, the rest is fairly smooth sailing and quite enjoyable.-Alarmingly simple, once you get the hang of it.  Prices only change at the beginning of a new day, not as you buy/sell each item individually.  Hey, I said, ""intensely FUN"", not ""intensely REALISTIC"", and to me, that's actually a good thing.CONS:-Music is ridiculously calming.... ALL the time.... Don't get me wrong, it's good music, but you know.... maybe a 5 second long ""tragic"" tune when you get sprayed by a stinkbeaver, or when you get robbed.... Give me something here devs? I want some music to help me feel sorry for myself for those 5 seconds.....-Kind of grindy, especially if you're not intending on doing any of the quests.-If you don't catch on quick to the small-scale scheme at the beginning, you're in for a rough ride.  >>  Buy food cheap in the small villages that hunt, and sell in the big cities.  Upgrade your capacity and repeat.9/10It's rare that I find a game I can rate above 7/10 and not feel like I'm being merciful, much less find a game deserving of 9/10 at all.  But this one has won me over.			"

												If you enjoy trading style games then this is for you. It offers lots of interesting events, quests and side businesses you can run that makes it highly enjoyable and  long lasting. Many trading games have this bad curve of struggle, struggle struggle, then bam you get it and once you figure it out it's easy and quickly gets boring. MOK throws some curve balls at you and keeps you needing more and more money , along with giving you more expenses and upkeep. So basically the cost  goes up along with the fun.  Most of these games have a very lack luster story involved,  MOK isn't anything amazing but it is decent and better than expected for the price of admission.			"

												I bought this because I enjoyed stuff like Patrician and Port Royale in the past, it's pretty polished but the problem is the pricing of goods is really wonky and there doesn't seem to be any one route that turns a reasonable profit. Even the cities that supposedly specialize in producing a good usually don't seem to offer a better deal than any random village you could wander into. also there's the whole hill herb thing, usually 120t to buy and can only seem to offload it anywhere for 30t at best, What the hell is that? I went to the barbarian cities to try and find hill herb cheaply and even there it would be ridiculous trying to run a route off of it.The only break they give you is that the starting city sells food cheaply for like a week and then it dries out and you're stuck wandering through all these cities looking for a single thing that can be traded for a profit.IMO your money would be better spent on Port Royale 2 or Patrician if you've never played those, really regret buying this because now it just sits unplayed.

												Your typical resource trading game, but with some unique twists. You go from town to town, buying low and selling high. You can get more carts and upgrade them as well as new steeds. The music and visuals are very pleasing and the game runs smoothly, the character portraits are a welcome touch as they give every character a sense of individuality.There are some issues I have with this game, though. Firstly, there's no way to check the buying and selling price of resources in towns that you are not in. The closest you get is a recording of the buy and sell history of resources you can look at while in the market. This method isn't very good because it only tells you the prices of resources AT THE TIME WHEN YOU WERE THERE LAST. This means that it does not tell you the current prices, which is useless. The ""2 days ago"" and ""8 days ago"" tabs are also unclickable. Whenever I tried to click on them, it would just close the market window.In addition to this the game also gets very samey after a few hours since the ""random events"" cease to be random after you encouter them a few dozen times. With all that said I still had a few good hours of fun with this game and would reccomend it to anyone else who likes games that allow you to become a successful merchant. After about 5-6 hours of gameplay I managed to go from $0 to $20'000, so there's plenty of profit to be made. I hope the Dev team makes updates to this game as I would love to come back to it to find fixes and new additions.			"

												I bought this game on sale for $1.24 or so with the last of my Steam money.  Was it worth it?  I believe so.I will probably be putting a lot more time into this game, but I noticed there were few recent reviews on this game, so I figured I'd write one.The game is a bit too simple to go through a huge list of Pros and Cons, but here's the gist:When you start the game, you have a couple different ways to play; A) Avenging the death of your father B) Reaching 1,000,000 coins or C) Two different time-based options.  I started with Option B, because I just wanted to get filthy rich.  They plop you in a town with a simple tutorial and nothing to start your business except your family ring, which you have to sell.  Once you get your bearings, the rest of the game is up to you.  There's TONS of small towns and cities to visit to trade your goods, hire mercenaries to protect you and said goods, different carts to buy and upgrade to carry said goods, and lots of random events.When travelling around you sort of have to plan ahead or you'll end up broke, or even dead.  You can find treasure on the road, little old ladies, get attacked by bandits, or even mauled by a bearwolfe, which sounds a lot worse than it is if you have enough mercs to protect you.All in all, I would very much consider this game worth getting when it's on sale, especially if you're into the whole Trading (buy low sell high) type of games.  The normal asking price is $15, which I'd probably never pay that much, but for less than the price of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ McDonald's burger, on sale it's totally worth it.7-8/10Also LOL @ the guy that wrote a review stating the grammatical errors in the game ruin the ""emersion"".  You'd think someone complaining about that would know how to spell it.			"

												Unless you have a lot of patience, stay away from this one. You are consistently robbed, travel costs are high, and profit is low at very early stages of the game. Very hard to gain momentum. I played for two hours before finally getting to a point where I could enjoy the game. Very easy to run out of money if you try to expand too soon.  BUT, If you are patient, and smart... you'll be able to master the game.   I give this about a 3 out of 5  but since this is a very slow paced game, I can't recommend it.			"

												Merchants of Kaidan is the good premise of a game. Your father was backstabbed and your family ruined. Now you must regain his glory by becoming the strongest trader in all the land in a tale of vengeance. Along the way you will encounter many random events which make every playthrough unique. That being said the actual gameplay of buying and selling and the very shallow dungeon crawler like exploration modes are just far too boring to be worth bothering with. The music and art are very nice tho.			"

												First impression: A reasonably solid trading sim so far, although scraping your way up out of the dirt is arduous.Second impression:  Some of the quests for the trader's guild are mysterious.  I was told to go make a profit on a trade between the barbarians and the empire, of at least fifty units of a single good.  When I did so, a notification popped up saying I'd accomplished one of four tasks!  ...  What?  So I went back to the capital to see if there was another stage to this quest, and there wasn't.  Then I went back to the barbarians, and did another trade, getting the popup for 2/4 tasks done.  So then I went back and forth between the barbarians and nearby imperial outposts, figuring I needed to trade four times -- no dice.  It only counts it when I do a valid trade a fraction of the time.  What the hell?  It also really doesn't help that there's a timer in days on this quest, making me have to start over every time I try to get it done.This game is poorly written and programmed, but I do like the idea?Third impression:  I am ridiculously back and forth on this game.  Once I got past the quest mentioned above (apparently I needed to do profitable trades, each direction, between THREE factions) I immediately went back to having fun.  There's typos everywhere, quests are a lot harder than I think they were designed to be, but in the end it's got the basics down.  I will say that you want to click on the easy mode thing when making your game : it makes the price fluctuations a lot less nonsensical, and makes it much easier to get profitable trades on most journeys.Would benefit from a walkthrough; but I can't deny I keep having fun.

												I'll be honest, I didn't play the game for very long, but it did not meet my expectations. I was hoping for more interactivity besides buying, selling, and a choice or two in random quests/events. Perhaps there's more to the game, but I get the feeling you only get to that after experiencing going from city to city to raise your capital. Not my type of game, maybe it's yours.So you start the game with some amount of gold, a cart, and a valuable item you need to sell for money to buy goods with. You start off with selling your valuable, buying a mercenary (initial charge and upkeep cost as well), and then you get the choice of buying your cargo. If you were dumb like me you won't think that you can actually scroll through the list of choices you can buy, so keep that in mind. Buy your cargo, go to different cities, sell when it's good. Random events with choices, may or may not help you. That's about all I experienced for a while until the game said ""Hey, we noticed you haven't actually gotten to the point we want you at so here's a reminder that you're not doing things wisely."" Of course prices fluctuate, are influenced based on where you're most likely to get certain cargo from and so on, but I hope this little review helps someone out with their choice of finding out if this game is for them or not.

												In the early 80s, the province of Ontario had the insane and needlessly expensive idea of developing its own special computer system for its schools. One of the games for those ""bionic beaver"" Unisys ICON computers was a game called Cargo Sailor where you (as Prestige Worldwide put it) ""sail around the world and go port to port"" (by furiously rolling the trackball that was built into the keyboard - the game didn't let you chart a course for your ship) buying and selling goods. There was no combat, no pirates to defend against, and that was really lame. But I understood that the school wouldn't let me play cool violent games, so at least Cargo Sailor was better than doing word searches or other busywork after I finished my work.But I graduated a long time ago, so I'm not stuck playing boring education games. MoK has some random events, but it's still just boring buying and selling. If I'm too much of a wussy merchant to kick butt, fine, but at least let me bribe some demons to attack a mine after I get a monopoly on all the ore or something. Supposedly a combat minigame will be added to game at some point, but how could it be any good if it's going to get shoehorned in that late in development?Go play Recettear if you really want a game like this.

												Solid game concidering discounts and visual + sound aspects. It really works well together and you can simply spend few hours with this without a problem. At certain point though events start to repeat you just move forward with buying and selling but not a lot is changing around despite of weather.Thats just the problem with these games. Lack of action and surprise. Give it a try but not at full prize just for elements of visual and sound, you will like them.			"

												I haven't dabbled in this genre previously, but Merchants of Kaidan has increased my interest. I was interested in exploring a fantasy world from the traveling merchant's point of view, and I am not disappointed. I like the game's art style and the mechanics seem reasonably balanced to me. My girlfriend and I both enjoy the quirky writing and customs, like, one common event of the road, when your carriage driver spots a woman carrying buckets and springs into frantic action to espy whether they are full or empty: whether the gods are sending you a good omen or ill.I haven't fully explored yet, but I've got a hold of the core experience now, I'm thinking, and I feel quite happy I tried it out. The very first time I did try it out, I was unmoved, but some time later I was more in the mood for what I'd seen and have been much more intrigued since then. Point being, I wasn't wholly taken with the game (it wasn't quite what I had imagined from my wish list), but having tried it out more I wanted to throw in my two cents because in my book it merits better ratings than I have sometimes seen.

												I'm sorry, but while the concept for this game is very interesting, the difficult level is much too high. The basic fluctuations make trading an almost fruitless pursuit. The cost of travel is nearly prohibitive to finding agreeable prices, and just when you think you're in a good space, you get thrown a random occurance that costs you most of your profits. The elements of realism, taxes, robbery, market fluctuations, make this game feel more like a job than anything ENJOYABLE. So, in short, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL NOT ENJOY IT.			"

												Although lacking a bit of polish, it's good enough to enjoy for quite a bit. I guess my biggest complaint is that after a while you get the gist and it's just repeating itself, not enough advancement, just the story.But the mechanics are fun, it's very deep and detailed, you have a lot of options and lots of things to do. So for a couple of hours at least the game is entertaining and fun. After that it gets a bit repetitive.I can recommend it for the right price. Probably not the full price though.			"

												Yeaah... No.  As a fan of casual games like this, this one is too buggy and internally inconsistant, at least so far.  I will try again after some more patches...************************************************Tried again, at least for a few more minutes.  It is better, but it just didn't provide any enjoyment whatsoever. I'm still sorry I spent money on this but at least they have given me reason for hope... The new history price/history feature is a GIGANTIC improvement, but you can still end up wandering around looking for a place to make a profit, (or even just trying to minimize your losses) WHEN (not if) prices drop too far too suddenly. The text is still poorly written/translated, and some of it is incredibly verbose (as in 'tldr'.)  Otherwise I didn't notice any major bugs at least.  Putting it back on the shelf again for now.  Sometime when I have more time I will give it one more try.			"

Early Access Review
								The trailer was quite misleading. I expected something like Anno meets Age of Empires meets Elderscrolls or something. I thought to myself ""Wow! I had better get this game while its cheap and just deal with the rough edges"". Boy did I waste my money (16.75USD)! This game as it is should have cost no more than 5$...if that. It seems in the early stages of development and is riddled with typos. I personally couldnt release anything this rough publicly, ask for almost 20$, and then feel ok with what I claim is my level of professionalism.Now that the [justified] ♥♥♥♥♥ing is out of the way I will say that the game, though overpriced, is fun for what it is and has alot of potential! I'll keep plugging away in hopes that somewhere down the line the game evolves beyond its current scope			"

Early Access Review
								My first impression review to this Early Access game:This game was not quite what I expected.  I had expected more of an RPG that was a visual game with actions rather than background screens with text pop-ups and picture menus.   Also, I don't see many RPG elements yet. This game appears to be a text/picture based version of The Guild without many of the things that made The Guild such a fun game. There were icons that were not very easy to identify. Icons for completing tasks are not obvious and traveling doesn't work well. The game locked up on me twice while attempting to travel.  This is one of the reasons I decided to just turn it off rather than continue.   The other reason is that it everything is very slow paced. This is frustrating for a person like me who likes things to move right along.  I'll give this more time later and update my review to reflect the additional time.  Right now, I don't recommend the game while reminding everyone (including myself) that it is early access.  Perhaps the developers need more time and input for improvements to be made.			"

								This game is SO BROKEN that I don't recommend it.  I saw a couple of reviews and decided to buy it anyway.  I really wished I had listened!  This game will inform you that you've lost a quest many times over, even when you didn't pick that quest up in the first place.  Time is of the essence, but you HAVE to stop at every single town along the way, which causes you to loose the quest that you actually did pick up.  The trading part?  To start you'll be given a map of what you think will be nice, decent trading posts.  Don't be fooled!  They carry the same stuff as the 10 cities/towns that you had to stop at and they carry nothing new.  This game was a complete waste of my money.  If it was a little better I'd be playing more, but frankly I'd rather choke to death.			"

Being perpetually stuck on the lowest possible luck, getting hit with the same few random events (some of them quite devastating) over and over again and dealing with the price mechanics which have little logic is not an example of good mechanics.The soundtrack is nice, but that's about all this has going for it.

												This is a great little trading game (with a fantasy theme nonetheless), with mini games for dungeon crawling and such. Do not let the indie feeling fool you. This is not a hastily put together game. From graphics, to the lore ever little detail is well thought off. Especially the economic mechanics... It looks to be too random at first, the fluctuations does not appear to make sense. Then you begin to realize the developer even thought of seasonal effects. Behind the apparent chaos is a well oiled economic engine. Unfortunately this also means, the game is harder in the beginning. With a small cart, it is harder to carry around a portfolio of goods to balance out the risks. Fortunately, as soon as you get to the second cart things get much easier. Just like in real life, ""poor gets poorer, while the rich gets richer"". I have to admit that, I have a weakness for trading games. Any game with a shred of trading activity going on enthralls me. Pirates!, Warband series, Vendetta... I love trading games. After having played so many trading games over the years, I must say that MOK is one of the better ones, with unexpected depth and novelty.

												This game is about trade, and all what comes with it. Compared with other trading sim games, like Patrician 3-4, Port Royale and Rise of Venice, you get the feeling that each time you leave a city anything can happen: bandits attacking, a storm, etc. And then, when you arrive to the next city, you discover that the prices have changed enough so that you hardly turn a profit! So in my view, this game is both simple and entertaining enough to make you feel as a medieval trader. Then, the fun begins. Once you have enough money / prestige / status, you are able to travel by sea / rivers, OR by air (yes, fantasy!)So I'd recommend this game to anyone who liked previous trading sims, but have in mind that is not supposed to be completely realistic. Still, it's a really good entertainment			"

												This is a great little trade/economy simulator with a fantasy setting. Runs great even on PC's with integrated graphics and has a surprising amount of depth if you devote some time to it. If you are looking for a game where you will be rolling in gold after an hour, look elsewhere.Pros:Unique world populated with characters and merchants not typically seen in ANY other fantasy setting (there are no elves, dwarves, or orcs in this world)Several fun quest lines including a pretty well thought out main storyline about avenging your father.Lots of items and trinkets to collect, some of which effect gameplay.The artwork in this game...just wow. For an indy game someone spent a LOT of time designing and then drawing these awesome characters and towns. No two locations share the same piece of artwork, and there is a diverse enough cast of NPC's and other quest givers that you don't often see the same species pop up more than once per town/questline.The music is fun, and the game even includes an option to just play the music without having to load the entire game.Rewards effort. It took me a couple days to get the hang of price fluctuations and to amass any significant amount of gold. Once you start expanding your merchant empire, the game REALLY opens up and adds several new types of travel and the ability to control multiple merchants at once, as well as own businesses. Clearing caves and mines out of treasure and monsters was a nice touch and helps to mix up the gameplay.Cons:The map is pretty small, especially if you come into this game expecting Civilization-size maps.Whoever proofread this game needs to be fired. I'm no grammar nazi, but there are enough spelling and grammar mistakes that it becomes very noticeable, especially after playing for a while.Slow start puts a LOT of people off, which is obvious from the number of negative reviews with only a few minutes or handful of hours playing, as well as the fact that most achievements on this game can be considered ""rare"", with the most acquired achievement sitting at 10% globally.Once your empire is huge and you've played for 10-20 hours, you've pretty much seen it all, although the other story/quest options allow for some replayability.Overall I got way more mileage out of this game than I thought I would. I had a coupon for it for 90% off and got it for $1.50 as a joke gift for my wife. She wound up playing it A LOT, so much so that I just HAD to play it too. I wound up purchasing it for full price and I have absolutely no regrets. "
