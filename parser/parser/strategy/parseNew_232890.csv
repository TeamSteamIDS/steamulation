												***Die-hard fans of the Stronghold series, please read this review before making your purchase.  You won't regret it.***As a long time fan of the Stronghold series, this game was such a let down.  Yes, it is *technically* a Stronghold game, and it technically is the sequel to Crusader, but overall it is not even close to being on par with the rest of the series.--First, the Good--At its core, the concept of Stronghold is still the same here.  You'll start off building a settlement, gathering resources via a supply chain, ultimately crafting weapons to arm a force of soldiers.There are familiar units: Archers, Macemen, Crossbowmen (Crusader).  Horse Archers, Slaves, Assassins(Arabic)..as well as some new ones, including the Healer and many other Arabic mercenaries not previously seen. You can build walls, towers, siege weapons and all sorts of defense mechanisms for keeping the black knight at bay.On top of that, many familiar faces return, such as The Rat, Richard the Lionheart and more.The game is, of course, a 3d Model game, bringing the Crusader series at least one generation ahead.And...that's about it.  Honestly.  If you were a fan of the original series, it may warm your heart to actually have some new Stronghold content to play with, but there really isn't anything new and exciting here.--Now, the Bad...where do I begin?--First of all, the game is somewhat broken.  There are plenty of times where characters models won't animate, and it's not uncommon for characters to simply float across the map in the standard model ""christ pose"" without any animation.  Even the oxen who carry the stone in the game would freeze when moving on an angle.  Stone walls are another mess.  Too often, staircases would end up with a wall piece right in the middle of them, creating a strange unrealistic graphical error.  These are only some of the visual phenomenen that occur while playing.That brings me to another issue...wall building.  Not only do walls cost way too much in this game, but there is pretty much no room for creativity when building your castle.  In the original/Crusader 1, you had so much control over every little aspect of your wall design.  You could build walls of all different heights, staircase pieces, granulated walls all down to the very last square.  This gave us castle builders so much of a blank canvas that virtually anything was possible if we knew how to use those pieces the right way.In Crusader 2, 90% of the wall building is done for you when clicking.  A wall piece is pre-built for you to include parapits on one side, a wall space, and parapits on the opposite side.  You can no longer just build a simple piece of stone wall, the basic building block (almost literally) of the original series' castle building element.  Sure, you can add towers and all kinds of siege weaponry, but the fun and joy of really creative a keep down to the last detail is completely lost here.The cost of walls adds to another huge gripe with this game...balance.  It's my understanding that a patch has re-balanced some of the economy issues, but the game is still WAY too unbalanced when trying to get your city up and running.  Too often I find myself running out of resources right at the beginning of a match, even when set to give myself a huge advantage over my AI counterparts.  For example, a windmill in this game costs 200 wood.  In the original? 20.  So it costs literally 10 times as much here.  That would be fine, except woodcutters don't harvest 10 times as much wood here.  They harvest roughly the same amount as before.  This leads to a TON of waiting around to gather resources right from the git-go of any match.  Sure, there was always that element in the original (as with any RTS), but there is a considerable difference here.  I feel like I'm not getting anywhere, even though I have what would otherwise be the basics of a civilization in place.Ah, civilization...a thriving, breathing melting pot of people going about their daily lives, each contributing to their society in their own way, all while maintaining their own unique personality...yeah, Stronghold Crusader 1 was a fantastic game.  Say goodbye to that here.  I mean, sure...you get to see the workers doing what they do in 3D, but it's not the same.  Peasants say NOTHING when you click on them.  No Monty Python-esque man impersonating a woman ""morning your lordship!"" or ""no taxes is good taxes, that's my motto!"", just silence.  No adding flowers, maypoles, dancing bears, gauntlets, guillotines, stretching racks...good/bad popularity control is just gone.Speaking of voices (ha), this might be one of the most dissapointing aspects of Crusader 2, and I honestly didn't see it coming.The voice acting in this game is TERRIBLE.  I mean that in every sense of the word.  I have friends who can do cooky voices that would have been better candidates.A great example is the men-at-arms.  Remember the way they sounded in Stronghold 2?  They were dopey lummixes, and rightfully so given their rank.  Or how about their original counterpart, the spearmen?  They were rough, working class fighters ready to stick a spear in whatever you tell them to.Here's what I want you to do:  We're gonna do a test.  I want you to read the next sentence I say in quotes out loud.  Don't use any exciting voice, or cooky impersonation, or anything.  Use your normal speaking voice.  Ready?  Okay, say this out loud:""Man at arms, ready.  Close ranks.""Congratulations!  You've just landed a gig providing voice over work for a video game! The level of enthusiasm in these vocal takes can only be described as the bare minimum.  Without trying to be funny, I've found myself honestly wondering if they simply had one of the programmers provide voices.  As annoying as he was, we all have to admit that at least The Rat had a memorable personality.  His voice has now been replaced with some Joe Everyguy off the street.  You'll forget him as soon as you end the game.To be fair, I need to point something else out, though, about the voice over work, and that's that there are a lot of recycled vocal takes from previous games.  Archers still sound like archers, crossbowmen like crossbowmen, etc.  However, it's about 50/50 as far as which characters use the classic voices, and which use Joe Everyguy.It might sound petty to be so bitter about this, but as (I'm assuming, since you've read this far) you are a die-hard Stronghold fan, then you KNOW how important the voices are to this series.  They are the character, the personality and the life of the game!  They're what make you feel like you are controlling living, breathing people of all different sorts, whose lives hang at your fingertips!  The original games did all of that in spades, and they weren't even 3D rendered!--The Bottom Line--I haven't played much of this game, but I'm fairly confident that won't change.  I could go on forever about the other issues that are impossible to ignore (such as the buildings and terrain feeling like they're from two different games), but I feel I've beaten my own horse to death here.From what I gather, a team of less than 10 people programmed this game.  I don't mean this review as offense to them specifically.  They created a game, like they said they would.  They accomplished something that I, of course, haven't...but it's almost like giving credit to Nickelback.  I may hate their music, but at the end of the day they're creating albums and I'm sitting behind my keyboard judging people.That being said, it doesn't mean that I have to LIKE Nickelback.That was a bad way to end this review. Sorry to take a punch at an easy target.Judge me all you want for that, just please don't buy this game.  It's something you can't take back. "

												Please read on before simply accepting this as another ""Yes"" review, because this a very mixed opinion. First, I would like to clarify this is from the Point of view of someone who has been playing Stronghold since the first game came out, and has consistently played every single installment to near completion - Aside from Kingdoms, which is mediocre imho. Maybe you'll agree, maybe you won't - Anywho, this is how I felt.The Good:- Solid skirmish mode, much like older renditions of the game.- Very old school Crusader vibe/feeling to it. Remake successful.- All of the new units are interesting, aside from the slave driver - Which I don't care for.     - New Unit special abilities are cool and add depth without overpowering or ruining units.- New Siege engines that are also interesting and for the most part useful.- Resource caches, Lion Dens, Outposts are all neat additions to the old crusader formula.- Varied AI characters like the original and a promise of DLC Lords in the future.- Really like the ""curtain walls."" I was skeptical of them until I used them in a trail mission.- Took the good things from SH3 while leaving out most of the bad things.- Neutral territory reminds me of the old territory system of SHC.- The new buildings (like the wooden barricades for example) are interesting.- Genuinely enjoyable game with as much replay value as the original.- New ally system where allies mood affects how willing they are to do your bidding.- Departure of Free form SH3 buidlings. Return of efficient, grid-based building system.- Better physics, especially in regards to arrows - which bounce off and break on walls.- More realism, such as troops pulling out pick axes and tools to smash walls down.- Beautiful destruction physics. I've gotten into trouble from watching castles go down.- Unit costs fixed or improved (Assassins especially brought back to reasonable price!)- Much simpler Editor than SH3, albeit still with as many options.- Able to play as other lords, and even choose what your lord looks like in skirmish.- Buildings change when playing Arabic or Crusader Lords.- Genuinely enjoyable game. Can't even lie, I will put 100 hours or more into this, easily.The Bad:- Stone is completely unbalanced. Walls cost 7 stone just for 1 square     - So, 100+ to make 15 Tiles of wall! WTF? So even a basic castle is 500 to 1000's of stone.     - Furthermore, walls also break much quicker - Causing lots of problems in the heat of battle.- Buildings have ridiculous costs, which is ridiculously high (200 wood for a Market? Seriously?)- Bare, boring, pathetic campaigns - So much for paying $10 extra for ""additional campaigns.""     - No campaign is longer than 4 Stages, and the mini campaigns are Only 2 stages long!- Cavalry units cannot attack buildings anymore, making them significantly less useful.- All of the Special Edition Features (cost an additional 10 dollars) were pathetic at best.     - Half of the artbook is on the official site for free, and it's only about 20-30 pages.     - The two mini campaigns take 10 minutes, and the 10 shields speak for itself in lame-ness.     - Only redeeming thing was the soundtrack. basically you paid 10 dollars for an old OST.- Missing the things introduced in SH2 that were memorable, like feasting, honour, etc.     - While many did not like those features, I feel like the economy is really bare without them.- Mediocre Maps. Crusader only had 3 or 4 maps I didn't like, this one has 3 or 4 I do like.     - Many maps don't have any resources available, or are too unbalanced to enjoy.     - Pretty much need the Map Editor if you want to have truly good maps.- some glitches and crashes, though this is to be expected.- pathetic sized unit caps and building caps.      - At 1 v 1 it's perfectly fine, but even 4 player matches feel very tiny.- Bland building selection, needs more towers, bastions, etc. SH3 had so many options!- Overpriced with the promise of even more (paid) DLC in the future.All in all, I feel like the game as a whole is really good - But I feel like it is horribly overpriced. 50 Dollars is too much. I felt like none of the features I got in my ""special Edition"" were all that special, and were not worth 10 dollars more. I feel like this game would've been much more fair to be sold at around 20-30 dollars instead (Crusader was 19.99 when I got it on release). Do yourself a favor and try and get it on sale, or at discount - it is a very fun game and I will keep playing, but it is incredibly over priced - Especially the ""special edition"" which was anything but special.

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is the successor to the successful RTS castle simulation game of the same name from 2002, With a full skirmish mode supporting up to eight total players (including fan beloved AI bots) and all new castle co-op skirmish mode, Crusader 2 is your ticket to castle simulation paradise. For new Stronghold players:Stronghold Crusader 2 is a real time strategy game set during the crusades, it has a stronger focus on combat as the ingame economy has been streamlined from the other Stronghold games. You are charged to provide food and entertainment for your workers who, in turn, form the backbone of your economy. Mine Stone, extract pitch, farm wheat, or chop wood. Once your stockpile has a steady flow of raw goods you are ready to refine them into weapons, drink, or processed food types. A strong economy is mandatory to support an ever growing military. On the militant side of the game you have one of the hallmarks of the Stronghold franchise, entirely modular defense system. The map has a grid superimposed upon it which is used to align and place structures. Each wall is placed piece by piece, every tower and gatehouse where you want them. Lay traps such as killing pits and pitch ditches for your enemies and garrison your archers atop your great towers. There are many defensive and offensive tactics to experiment with, sally forth and meet your enemy in the field or bring the fight to your castle and employ traps and tower mounted siege engines to your advantage. In skirmish mode the base objective is to kill all enemy lords, although multiplayer games have a greater range of victory conditions. The single player campaign has custom objectives and scripted invasions/events. When Steam Workshop becomes available for Stronghold Crusader 2 players will be able to create and share their own skirmish maps and custom missions. For existing Stronghold Crusader HD players:The biggest difference players coming from Crusader HD will notice is the transition to a full 3D game engine. Many of the same units feature in both games but I'll make a note of where they differentiate. Crusader HD fans will also notice a simpler overall economy with many previously gimmicky mechanics streamlined or just removed. Maps:The following times were recorded using the time it took an archer to traverse a flat terrain map and are done on the diagonal (corners: top left to bottom right). Stronghold Crusader 2 has an additional map size and all map sizes for Crusader HD use numbers to represent size (eg 200x200).Stronghold Crusader HDStronghold Crusader 2Map SizeTime in secondsMap SizeTime in secondsTiny20160x16046Small60200x20058Medium100300x30088Large140400x400118Extra Large220Buildings:-Changed!

Fear Factor has been removed, troops will no longer receive a malus or a boost based on your economy.-Removed! While not exactly a building, moats do not feature in the game. Units:-New!

Sassanid Knight - light knight with special charge attack-New! Ranger - proficient with both sword and bow but has poor range-New! Sergeant-at-Arms - units within range receive a HP boost-New! Conscript - basic weak units, no weapons required to recruit-New! Hussite War Wagon - can station units inside, provides protection and mobility-New! War Wolf - super catapult-New! Burning Cart - creates fire on impact, triggers traps-Changed! Spearman now called Man-at-Arms and can throw his spear-Changed! Maceman only requires a mace to recruit now-Changed! Knight now called Templar Knight and can fight mounted or on foot-Changed! Fire Thrower renamed to Oil Pot Thrower-Changed! Battering Ram - Can now only destroy Gatehouses-Changed! Catapult - can no longer throw diseased animals-Changed! Portable Shield renamed to Mantlet-Removed! Slinger-Removed! Ladderman-Removed! Siege Tower-Removed! TunnellerEngineers are no longer recruited but automatically provided if required when recruiting siege engines. Also, due to the 3D engine many of the map tricks previously used to create eye candy are impossible but there are a fair selection of set pieces to add some much welcomed variety.Note: for those wondering how to access the map editor, go to your steam library dropdown menu and elect to filter your library by Tools. The map editor should show up on the list of utilities as 'Stronghold Crusader 2 Map Editor'. After a small 2MB install you are ready to start map making.Check out TotalBiscuit's review of the game on YouTube:

												I am one of the stupid ones who got my hopes up after seeing reviews and hearing 'its the original game, but much improved with more additions bringing it up to date' ... and so i bought it.What a mistake!IT IS MISSING MANY THINGS FROM THE ORIGINAL!!!!!No laddermenNo seige towersNo moatsNo engineers! to use, build or put into your seige equipment. This changes gameplay massively, as it used to take time to get decent wall defences, because you had to first build the engineers workshop, produce engineers, and build a big enough tower, then build a ballista/mangonel etc on it, and then put your engineers in them for them to function. Now i just buy a bloody ballista tower as soon as the game starts and it begins shooting longrange hail marys from the get go.What about PIMPING my castle... **** in 2002 i could put flags and the likes around, not in this remake.No EVIL / NICE system in the castle. Gone are the days of building dungeons and setting out heads on spikes to scare your populace ****less so you can tax them etc... this also kills gameplay in a big way, that was so much of the fun!Have to agree with most of the other comments.. The WALLS come down like polysterene blocks, so effortlessly and quickly.Maps are tiny, one of the only flaws in original also. but its 2014 youd think they could have fixed that!!! Makes it annoyingly irritating to have resources far from castle so you can NEVER fully have your castle emcompass everything. You are always rebuilding or defending your resource buildings out in the middle of nowhere.No more leather armourNo info when you scroll over buildings etcNo more peasants saying provocative gestures when u click emNo tunneling men?? that ive seenThe AI keep repeating the same tripe over n over again, its 2014 ! get a heap of new sayings in there not just 1 or 2 !!!AI is not improved, they do the same **** over n over again from what ive experienced.Economy is broken. Just build candlestick maker buildings and sell them at market and basically dont have to build any other resource buildings cause you can buy goods at market from candlestick profits!Ahh the list is endless.THIS GAME HAS BEEN DUMBED DOWN !!!IT HAS LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL !!!Gameplay is not even as fun as original !!!!! :(It starts to freeze up on any settings medium or higher... on ultra it sucks as soon as you have over 2 ai one one map.Not my pc, i built a high specd rig with 4.8 eight core an 3g graphics card etc... poorly designed game. i run all other games on ultra no probs.Ok, rant over.Graphics not good, just ok. until it starts to freeze up.Only cool thing was haybale launcher thingy.So if your into firey haybales then fork over all your dough, otherwise DONT BUY ! I hope they fix this game but i highly doubt it !!!			"

The OpinionI wanted to love this game. I really did. After only three in-game hours, I can honestly say that THIS is not a Stronghold game. I've tried looking at it from all angles; seeing it as not a continuation to a series that was plagued by Stronghold 3, but as a sequel to the Stronghold game that stole my heart - Stronghold: Crusaders.Even as such, this game fails to deliver. Nothing was built upon - nothing - and if I were to be honest, I would even go as far as to say features were removed. Good features. Important features. What you've been left with feels like the Civilisation game released on the Xbox marketplace; it's cute, but not a full fledged Stronghold game.Where are my Engineers? Laddermen? Tunnelers? Moats? Why is building my castle so... generic?I wouldn't have minded a re-skin of Stronghold 2. Nor a remake of the original Crusaders. Given this as the alternative, I would've honestly rather pay an additional $54.99 (CAD) for Firefly to just add Skirmish to Stronghold 3, not release a half-game riding the coattails of previous successes.Will I continue to play? Yes. I refuse not to. This game may lack... everything... but damn it, if I want simplicity and don't feel like an RTS like the AoE series, I'll play this.Will I recommend this to friends? No. Friends, fellow fans, I've played scapegoat. I've lost this round. Continue reading if you're interested, I'll try to go more in-depth.More InformationPros: Looks Pretty (Despite a few weirder texture maps...) Different Style Maps (stone in one corner, iron in another) Community (whether angry fans or not, it's got a living community)Cons: No Laddermen No Moats Slower Resource Gathering (resulting in longer, uneventful games) No actual Engineers (I guess peasents just magically know how to man ballistae, trebuchets, and so-on) Poor enemy selection (The new enemies already feel generic) Many Stretched Textures (it may look pretty, but not as pretty as it could) Weird in-game stuttering and freezes (Before anyone explodes on me, blaming my rig, I have no issues running Shadow of Mordor on high at 1080p (60fps avg.), or Endless Legend, or Stronghold 2 or 3, or Tomb Raider)All-in-all, this game is not done. At least, it better not be.Visuals: 8/10Combat: 6/10Castle/Town Management: 4/10UI: 8/10Unit Differences: 3/10Enemy AI: 5/10Gameplay Feel: 4/10Do what you will with this, buy it if you want, Hell, you might even like it. But I cannot recommend this as an honest Stronghold game.Gamers may have changed, Firefly. Choosing to buy into industrious brands like ""Call of Duty"" and the like, but your audience has not. We have not grown stupid over the years, and we will continue to wait for an actual Stronghold Crusader 2.			"

												Let me start by saying that i am a huge fan of the Stronghold series, I just love the idea of an RTS with castles and siege weapons. I also purchased and played every part except stronghold 3, and I reeeeeeaaaally wanted this one not to suck.Now i spent some time with it and i will tell you what i think are the positives and negatives.positive:-New physics system-3d and its grid based, so it placing walls works without problems-the game overall looks quite cool-setting, music, atmosphere-its a stronghold game, wooooo-you can play coop on the same castle, which is a cool feature-new mercenary troops, like healer, flame pot thrower, slavedriver...and now the negative stuff:1) enjoyable competitive play is impossible because of the following:-super stupid troop maneuvering: lets say you have fast bowmen, slow mantlets (movable shields), and you want to attack a castle.it is not possible to make those troops move at the same speed, so your bowmen will approach faster than the mantlets, which gives you two possibilities: bowmen dying from enemy fire before the mantlets have moved to the destination, or babysitting your stupid troops without being able to do anything else.this was already done way better in stronghold legends, why did they fail at that in this game? -no build-up time for walls/buildings: when you want to build something, you click it and its there, boom. same goes for removing buildings. oh you attack my castle? well i better build another f*cking wall behind the wall you are attacking.oh you set my building on fire? i better just remove it so the fire doesnt spread. oh you destroyed my building with a trebuchet? i just place another one there for 50 wood.you cant build things near enemy troops, sure, but if you want to besiege a castle from afar the enemy just doesnt really care. he can stall you until your troops are dead.-no laddermen, no siege towers: well, focus on resources and build a 200m thick wall. im extaggerating here, but you get the idea. also, why arent they in the game? we already had that in the previous titles! :(-no fog of war: thats a real bummer. if you keep looking at your opponents castle (no problem with hotkeys), you know when and where hes attacking all the time. suprise attacks not possible.-siege equipment is expensive: there are some really cool things, like mantlets, trebuchets, fire wagons... but they are expensive and most of them are not viable because of the reasons stated above.So this leaves us with only one strategy that is viable in competitive play:Spam a ton of woodcutters. sell everything and buy wood. spam all other resources, and even more woodcutters, no walls needed. now you have 10 times more gold/resources than a guy that builds a cool castle. spam crossbowmen and knights, build 20 catapults, and go face. thats it. thats the entire competitive play. and everyone does it and its so boring.also, this just leaves out all the cool things that should make this game great. fancy siege weapons? nope. strategic play with special units and cool abilities? nope. long time besiegement with deep tactical play? noooope.just spam resources faster than the other guy and go face.2) AI opponent lords are as stupid as they were in all the previous games.and they all do the same thing: they build their castle until it has a certain size, and they just send troop waves in certain time intervals. like stronghold 1 from they f*cking year 2001.the only things that vary between the different enemies are: units used, amount of units used, type of food/resource buildings used, and the way the walls and towers are placed.i mean there is NO improvement since 2001. 3) the game has less features than the previous titles in general:no laddermen/siege towers, you cant choose which resource is produced by an allied province anymore, all those little things.so to sum it up, the game has the same flaws that every stronghold game had before for 14 years. competitive play is stupid (at least i think it is), and its not very feature rich.i really hoped this game would give me the old stronghold feeling back, but it has too much flaws to be great.if you are unsure:the game is fun if you just want to play with your friend or some casual battles against some AI lords. but you shouldnt buy it if you want a super fluid competitve experience.

												I've been a long time fan of SC. Played the original for countless hours and was syced for this release. BUT it has been a non stop disappointment.- Soldiers literally just stand around and doing nothing when an enemy is next to them- AI is no smarter than before. Downright boring actually.- The economy is slower and more difficult to get going- Everything about this game feels bulky and slow.- DID I ALREADY SAY THAT SOLDIERS STAND AROUND AND DON'T FIGHT WAY TOO OFTEN!!!!!- Armies are too small. Everything in this game is always just a skirmish. I could go on and on. Save your money.			"

LONG REVIEW!!WARNING!!: THE GAME IS 4 PLAYERS MAX IN LOBBY. This review will basically help you whether to buy this game or not , however , although I am recommending this game , am going to be neutral mentioning both good and bad aspects of this game genuinely .I have spent 100+ Hours on this game before I write this review , so please before you agree or disagree with me , try to complete reading this review.First of all , lets compare this game to the first version of it which is Stronghold Crusader 1.An Example.[i.imgur.com]-Clearly , since it has been released in 2014 , this game is in 3D and has a better amazing graphics , you can zoom too close to the objects and can see them clearly in a good view.-New lords and sounds in the game which makes it more fun.-You can set a rally point for the army to go to it once they are produced.-It has exactly the same buildings but in more realistic view , there\\\'s a Market now which lets u auto-sell and buy good on a limit you choose , instead of spamming mouse click to sell and buy allot of goods.-There are no trenches anymore , which makes the game more possible unlike the sc1 where you can dig a trench all over your castle and block the enemy from entering it.-You can now put your siege equipment at a point close to the enemy instead of those workers who u integrate with the equipment to make it work.-They added allot of new troops in both Arab and Crusader army. Like for example the healer which makes u heal your army , Rangers , sergeants at arms,,, etc.-Easier managment for the economy and goods from the panel on the top right of the screen to get more taxes. it tells you how much you produce and consume.-A new feature of occupying free lands in the map to take goods from them , wasn’t in SC1.Pros (in general)-The game is very realistic , there are 2 types of lords , Arabs and Crusaders , where both are very realistic in the army type and economy , for example there\\\'s a sheep farm and mosque instead of pig farm and church for Arab lords.Check here.[i.imgur.com]-The learning campaigns are realistic and Historically accurate , they are some about Antioch and Jerusalem , you should reach there and occupy it , you will enjoy the skirmish trials as well.-The game offers 4 DLC which add 2 new lords in each dlc with their skirmish trials. so 8+8=16 lords with dlcs.-Each lord has his own type of army and economy, and his unique castle design.-The Multiplayer side of the games seems stable most of the time , you can play with others in wide options of peace time and what\\\'s allowed and not( Assassins , trebuchets..etc) . and it has a cool feature which is if the host was P*ssy and left the game , the game migrates the host to another player in the game so there\\\'s no interruption in the gameplay.Check here.[i.imgur.com]-Easy use of army and positioning\\\\lining them , with the attack mode which tells the warrior what to do with enemies.-You will enjoy the soundtracks in the game , they are really exciting and fun.Cons-The game is unstable yet , it still has some bugs in it and needs frequent updates, last update was on april\\\\16 , so expect a glitch or a crash.-The cost of most things is generally high , walls for example will cost allot of stone , market and inn will cost much wood too..-The multiplayer system is unstable yet , sometimes u won’t be able to join a specific lobby , or it will appear empty.-The game sometimes doesn’t accept more than 4 players in multiplayer , so its 2v2 max.-The army stops sometimes when u move it , or it goes back and forward again.-The knights gets off their horses for no reason sometime , you have to put them back on it.-The mantlet health is high enough , if you put your army under 100 mantlets , i dont think the archers on the towers can stop you while catapulting them under mantlets.-The tower ballista damage is lower than the crossbow , looks weird for me.So shall I buy this game ?Well , if you love strategy games specially historical\\\\medieval ones , and you think you are smart enough to build and manage a desert castle, yes buy it. But if you think you can learn everything in the game and become an OP player in it in 2 hours , then don’t buy it.There are allot of videos and guides there you can watch or read to learn how to have strong economy and military power.A good video.Don’t look at the reviews percentage on steam store page , most of them are 1 lined review with no reasonable dislike. However, don’t buy this game unless it\\\'s on sales it gets really cheap, otherwise it’s too expensive and doesn’t really deserve its original price without sales.One more thing , don’t buy the special edition , it really adds silly things for nothing.The game is very addictive and you will enjoy it.Thank you for reading!My funny artworks xD.

												This game makes me want to cry inside...It's like they purposely set out to make the worst game ever.  Not only that but they took a concept that was really successful and tweaked it just enough to make it suck.  After Stronghold 2 came out I had high hopes.  I really don’t see how the franchise can continue with this big ugly pile of Sh#t staring them in the eye.  I mean, this game is so bad that if I was in a room with Hitler and a copy of this game and they gave me two bullets I would shoot the game twice in the hopes that no fragment of its existence could further taint the outside world.  Who ever made this game I just want you to know…..the day you made this a box of puppies died.  I own all but one of the Stronghold games but I am afraid this will be the last.  I have completely lost faith in them after this.  Here is why…1. Building a castle is just not possible.  The block segments just don’t want to line up and sometimes when you build  gatehouse it just simply deletes wall segments that would connect it to the wall.  If there is any kind of incline or attitude to the building surface the game cannot compensate and the wall won't close up.  2.  The economics in the game are so F&*%ed they could double as a Call Girl in Bangkok. They tried to make everything more realistic by increasing prices but failed to adjust for it properly.  With a zero growth population one min you have 400 food and the next it is all gone.  Stone, Iron, Wood, and food gather rates all fluctuate or no reason!3.  Unkillable units.  Sometimes there will be a unit on a wall and it will be in such a position that it will not be visible to archers and your units can't reach it. This means that they can fire at you but you cannot get to them.  I have played the game for 11 hours and already lost 2 assaults in this fashion because the units get confused between two targets and just go back and forth.  4. DLC….so wait, you want me to buy more of your crap after I see this broken POS? I have two words, Get F$%#ed! This is such a pathetic tactic.  If you are a game that is as good as AOE or The Total War Series then yes, you can hold content hostage because the game is good enough!  YOUR GAME ISNT EVEN CLOSE!   I got this game on sale for 1/5th the retail price and I STILL regret buying it.  If you are thinking about buying this game, do not.  Take the money, wipe you’re a#$ with it and toss it in the toilet because that would be of more use and you would likely receive more satisfaction from that.   "

												No, it's not the world's best sequel - the amount of stuff added to this game in comparison to crusader 1 is minimal, which is sort of upsetting considering this game has come out 12 years after its' predecessor. However, I do not find my money wasted on this game. As a fan of the stronghold series and a proud owner of all the games (save one that I'm not too proud of...you can guess which), I will happily say that this game is the first stronghold game to not be a total waste of your time since 2002 with crusader 1 itself. On top of that, I highly recommend buying this if for nothing else than supporting the small indie studio Firefly Studios in hopes that, now without their 2K publisher forcing release dates on them, we can begin to see some proper sequels in the stronghold lineup to recover from...a troubling past, to say the least. Perhaps a stronghold 4, or even the possibility of a Legends 2 (Don't kill me, we all know somewhere inside we want a better legends :D)With gamespy down, this is also the only remaining stronghold game besides the abysmal pile that was stronghold 3 to have functional multiplayer without the assistance of a 3rd party tool that can sometimes, to inexperienced users, be a large pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to use properly. So for crusader multiplayer with ease, this runs through the steam servers allowing you to simply invite your friends and such as you would for Team Fortress 2 or something.Buy this to support firefly and enjoy the first stronghold game in 12 years to not suck right out of the box...or download in this case. And if not, do yourself at least the favor of, if you don't already, going and purchasing Stronghold HD and Stronghold Crusader HD on steam or GoG.com or somewhere - those 2 games, alongside this one, will not fail to give you hours of fun.

												This is one of the few games where it's blatantly obvious the AI is cheating.You can raze farmlands, cut off AI opponents from their industry, and yet they can still feed their people and raise armies from nowhere.Even for five bucks, I regret this purchase.			"

Short VersionI have finally gotten my hands on a copy of this medieval RTS Simulation game after it being wishlisted since its initial pre-release announcement. The reviews have been a mixed bag of tricks from the start so I wanted to give Firefly Studios plenty of time to bang out any kinks in the ol' armor before launching my assault and possibly bludgeoning this game into fragmented code. After a lengthy (and sometimes exhausting) battle, the dust has settled and as my gaze reflects upon the still-burning fires, the blood-soaked desert sands, and the rubbled remains of what once was a towering and majestic castle, I muster up the strength to utter a few last words with my last breath fading away - ""I strongly recommend this game...""Ok, so why the mixed reviews? A couple of reasons. First, this is an expensive game even after being released for almost a year. Not uncommon for many AAA titles, but let's face it - this is Steam and the majority of Steam users are known for pinching pennies and expecting everything on the cheap. Not totally unreasonable and for those who pay the hefty full price for this game, I understand why there may be some mixed feelings about it. The game is good, has a lot to offer, and is entertaining. But at the same time, there are a few bugs and issues in it still and don't appear to be getting fixed any time soon. They aren't necessarily being ignored though and Firefly Studios is still actively working on the game and new content for it.  Keep in mind, Stronghold Crusader 2 is a AAA title and its normal for periodical updates to be released as major patches that address many things at once rather than a multitude of weekly updates that may address one specific element as seen with smaller indie-type games. Many gamers who have played the original Stronghold Crusader  before grabbing this long awaited sequel have been openly critical because the graphics are only slightly improved after more than a decade. Stronghold Crusader is very similar to the original, in fact, almost identical at first glance. But there are some differences -  new units (and special abilities added to others), a modified economic system, a change in the housing dynamic, co-op mode for multiplayer games, an automated purchase/sell system added to the market, weather/natural disaster random events, some new AI characters (and more planned as future DLC), troop formations added and improved, and a few other changes  or removed content from the original (such as the removal of moats and feasts). However, for the most part, Stronghold Crusader 2 is identical to its predecessor at a much loftier price so it draws a lot of criticism for this. So why would I give this game my recommendation?I review games individually based on their own content and whether they offer up gaming enjoyment to its players. This game is a lot of fun and has plenty to offer. The graphics are 3-D, unlike the original Crusader game. They will not leave you with that ""wow"" feeling, but they are still solid and detailed for a real-time strategy sim. The soundtrack to this game is a harmonic masterpiece that injects the player with a true sense of the environment and time period. There are several different game modes and each of them offer a numerous amount of gameplay. Hundreds of hours can be spent playing without ever trying out each one. There are a multitude of buildings that can be built and a nice variety of units available. A map editor has been included for easily creating and sharing your own designs with the Steam Community. And don't forget the most popular feature - Castle Building. This is what really makes the crusader series so great. Its one of the best castle building systems in gaming and while slightly different from previous versions, it still performs smoothly and allows for simple and fun creativity to give your kingdom its own personal touch.Gameplay BasicsIn Stronghold Crusader 2 players will need to gather resources for building structures, creating weapons to train armed units, and produce enough food to support the populus. Fortifying your base is an important aspect as well, so players will want to protect their kingdom with castle walls and defensive structures like towers and traps. Naturally, you will need an army to defend your kingdom and attack your opponents. Each troop type requires specific weapons or armor to be crafted first and also have a price in gold. Gold can be earned by collecting taxes or by selling excess goods on the market. Troops can also be purchased from a mercenary post with gold. Governing your kingdom is very basic. It is based on overall happiness and there are several ways players can influence this statistic positively or negatively. To claim victory you must simply defeat all of the opposing lords on the map.Game ModesStronghold Crusader 2 is packed full of gameplay content offered in a variety of game modes to ensure countless hours of entertainment. They include single player, co-op and multiplayer options. There are a variety of customization settings available to adjust the level of difficulty a player wishes to encounter, configure for team play, and map selection (in some cases). Computer AI players can be substituted or added in place of additional human players and each AI character has its own habits, strengths, and weaknesses that also influence how challenging the game will be.Learning Campaigns - Tutorial campaigns that play out as a campaign while progressively teaching the game's         concepts.Skirmish Trails - A chain of skirmishes versus AI characters that increase in difficulty as you progress.Custom Skirmish - Up to 8 players and team play. Players can be human or AI. Custom settings including map selection.Sandbox - Build your mighty kingdom in peace and without fear of being attacked from any opponents.Multiplayer - Players can either join a server from the list or host their own game and can be played individually or as teams. There is also a simple in-game text chat available by pressing ""Enter.""Community Maps - Skirmish maps designed by the Steam Community.The Good:+  Challenging gameplay+  Solid 3-D graphics+  Excellent soundtrack and quality voice acting+  Simple controls and a smooth user interface+  Beginner's tutorial included+  Multiple customization settings+  Variety of game types available+  Many distinctive units with their own abilities/uses+  Nice selection of buildings and resources+  Great castle building system+  Custom map editor included+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+  Some DLC content added for free+  Continued development and support post-release+  No heavy CPU strain for systems mid-range or aboveThe Bad:-  Very expensive at full price-  Still contains some minor bugs. (Not game breaking)-  The graphics are stale and unimpressive for modern gamers-  Updates are periodic so fixes and improvements are not quickly availableFinal Thoughts:Stronghold Crusader 2 is a very entertaining medieval RTS castle-building simulation that is packed with gameplay and will continue to get better with time as more content is added. However, it does come at a considerable price. I recommend this game to all RTS lovers, but if you're on a tight gaming budget then i would wishlist it and wait for a sale. In the meantime, you might also consider buying the original Stronghold Crusader game to get a taste of the crusader experience.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												5/10     I wont lie, I was a little dissapionted with this game when I first stared playing, I was a big fan of its predecessor 'Stonghold crusader', this was by far one of my favorite games when I was younger.Pros and cons:PROS- The graphics in-game have been updated, although not as much as you might hope for, especially for the fact that the old one came out 12 years ago.- It is much harder to appease the peasants who flock to your castle, this does make the game a bit more challenging when it comes down to 'laying siege' to an enemies castle, at least in multiplayer. You can starve your enemy in a manner of speaking. - There are new units, athough most of these are nearly identical to the predecessors, using some of the same quotes and one-liners.- The walls fall down in 3D, instead of dissapearing, - Destruction of castle walls and towers, looks better,CONS- the Opening menu was a major dissapointment, i dont really know what i expected but the predecessors kicked♥♥♥♥♥compared to this new one.- The new AI sucks, really sucks, (eg. the enemy computer always gets free siege equipment) - The graphics aren't that imppressive for the amount of processing power it takes to run the game.- The price tag for what you get is practically extortion. - If you arent familiar with the game it is quite hard to understand the mechanics of the game, depsite the introduction campaign/scenario- The new voice acting for the AI is just generally annoying, in my personal opinion they should have used the old voices from the last game.- The mulitiplayer menu, is the same as the opening menu, a dissapointment- There is a building and troop limit, whilst understandably for lower end computers is unchangeable, but there should be a way to adjust it.All in all the game leaves you feeling a little underwhelmed, to be honest if your thinking of buying this game do yourself a favour and wait until a sale, save yourself the dissapointment of spending a lot of money on something that isn't quite up to standard. I do know that Firefly are releasing updates and extensions so hopefully in the future they may be able to fix some of the problems, and annoyances.  "

												I was a die hard original stronghold fan and after playing SH3 decided to never touch this series again, saying that my die hard fan part took over because lets face it stronghold was boss back in the day. So I ponied up to buy this game to give it a chance, the real question here is how the ♥♥♥♥ did they ♥♥♥♥ this game up so bad? I mean I'm impressed, I dont think their is anything more that they could have done to make this game any worse!!! Lag, bugs, complete economic balance meltdowns, more lag, more bugs, complete military balance meltdowns, more bugs for days. Take your pick, the entire game dynamic has been ♥♥♥♥ed to the point were you will feel mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whilst trying to execute anything in this game. The sad part is that they took stronghold which was a completely enjoyable game and churned out this steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ a game nobody would play for more than 30 minutes if they werent trying to give it the chance to be half as good as the originals.If you are thinking of buying this game my advice to you would be to spend your money on a big bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as you will probably enjoy owning a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥more than this game!

												I honestly want to get into this game. As a kid both my brother and I put 1000 plus hours into SC1 easily so you could say we are big fans. The whole game just feels clunky and the entire possibility of running your own castle and making it a happy or horrid place to live in is totally gone. The game shifted towards more rts style and the graphics were better off as sprites in the old games. Sadly I wont be able to get any nostalgia  (or my money's worth) out of this unpolished, glitchy, foul turd. The only reason I bought it was to support FireFly Studios with the hopes that eventually they go back to the old style or ammend this F***ery by pumping out a SC1 expantion pack to take me back to chewing through a whole quench gum tin in a single game against 7 Wolfs.

												First things first, let me tell you that I'm a veteran stronghold player/fan from the old days, ever since the first stronghold came out I've played all stronghold titles except stronghold 3 and stronghold kingdoms up to this point. And also I've played this game both before the optimisation patch came out and after that. And I must say, I really can't join the obvious hate train on this one. Maybe you'll dismiss me after these words, but first hear me out.Not only will I bring some closure on some of the infamous aspects the other reviewers have pointed out about the game in it's early stages, but I will also recommend you which Stronghold game you should look for according to your interests.About the claims saying that this game is unbalanced. Let me point out that this game, is both warfare-wise and economy-wise, is more balanced than any other stronghold game that I've played. In older games, bread production was the way to go in all situations, and sword production was the thing you should go for, simply because all other melee units were simply trash compared to swordsmen and knights, removing the reason/need for more than half of weapon workshop options and the soldier options. Mantlets and horse archers were simply overpowered, and it was the best choice to amass them. In Stronghold 2, siege engines were so broken that you could defend a ""castle"" without building a single wall, or you didn't need to actually move in your melee units to kill advancing swordsmen, because they couldn't even get close. But in this game, you can see that all of those issues I mentioned above don't exist anymore.In first crusader game, everything was so cheap that money virtually didn't cost anything after you've set your core economy in place, having thousands upon thousands of gold and not even being able to find a way to spend all of that was simply meaningless, and at the same time arabian units were simply way too expensive to train early on. But in this game, you can always feel the pressure of being short for money, from all the way from beginning to the endgame, as it should be. And this doesn't mean that it's impossible to build a rich settlement, there are actually new features that immensely help with that!For example, in this game a market is not required to sell or buy goods, but still there is a market building option. Why? Because this market building provides autosell and autobuy options. And stockpile, granary and armory buildings have unlimited space. Honestly, these are the most important reasons why this game is actually superior to any other stronghold game (stronghold 2 didn't have unlimited stockpile). Anyone who've played enough stronghold games can know, that it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥both trying to manage the stockpile by selling excess stone so that your bread production chain won't crumble upon itself, and trying to command your units in battle at the same time. Let's say that you don't have iron reserves but you really need some armor in your armory. But you cannot stop what you are doing and buy iron because the enemy is keeping you busy all the time. Worry not! Just set some iron to autobuy, and the system is already set in stone. You just set your autosell and autobuy options and sit back and enjoy warfare while the money counts itself. The new minimap and UI are also way better than the older games. It's easier to spot units on map, and UI is customizable and you can see how much goods you have in your stores at the top of your screen all the time, if you wish so. The new popularity chart is vastly superior to the older games, aside from the default popularity displays, you can see both the daily income and consume of food, ale, and candles, so when you increase the rate of rations you don't have to pay attention to your granary all the time to figure out if they are declining or not. Which makes setting taxes and setting your economy a lot easier than it was in older games. Another example that points out that it's still easy to have a rich settlement: the default tax rate is ""low taxes"" now, and it doesn't exert a negative effect in your popularity.Roughly all buildings are more than 2 times as expensive than it was in older games, and that is a welcome addition. It's a bit harder to spam quarries to get rich early on, and it's still possible. Now there is a reason to set up other types of food farms as well, and even at the beginning you are still able to set up bread production if you play right. And also multiple food types provide way more popularity bonus than it did in original games, now you can raise your tax rate by one level just by having all food types in your granary. So having multiple types of food production is relatively not something so useless contrary to how it was in original games.Now, there are 2 more important melee fighter options alongside swordsmen. Sergeant at arms and templar knights, which (other than armor) requires pikes and maces, respectively. Sword production is not the only important weapon production anymore. In this game, european archers are better than arabic archers, so opting to craft regular longbows are not obsolete anymore. Horse archers are way more squishy and fire way slower while on the move, all archers are way more accurate and they do not miss horse archers anymore. Mantlets are way weaker to arrow damage, it's not possible to just create 100 mantlets and have an invincible army. Mantlets cannot go on walls anymore, so you can't just build one tower and a few archers and a mantlet, and have the most unbreakable defense ever. Knights, sergeant at arms, and arabian melee cavalry are all very expensive units, so training swordsmen does not become something obsolete when you are short on money. Some siege engines are way more expensive than they were in original games, and some of them are also even cheaper, making them relatively more balanced. If you want to have a strong army, you will have to train some of those expensive units, and that will constantly keep your economy in check and you won't be swimming in meaningless amounts of gold. Gold will be important throughout the game. All of the things I've counted by now clearly shows how more balanced and therefore, a better gameplay this game provides compared to previous games.The siege engines do not knockback units they hit as they did in Stronghold 2 anymore. Even though it was fun to watch your hapless enemies in that situation, it was inarguably overpowered. However, siege engines do knock soldiers down from walls when they hit them, and that is an instant kill regardless of what type of soldier it is. (and in Stronghold 2, crossbowmen would survive those falls) This is much better, and more realistic.Did I mention that the game got an optimisation update roughly more than 6 months ago? Yes, I already did. I must admit, the game looked promising but it was literally unplayable before the patch came out because of the massive FPS drops in skirmish games. But now, that's all gone, it only happens rarely when you are nearing the maximum number of buildings limit in a full on 8 player game. And it mostly depends on how strong your computer is, really. If your system cannot run some of the games that came out last year, it might as well be pretty normal that you are having problems while trying to run this game. For that, I would only advise you to upgrade your machine. Other than FPS problems, a lot of bugs the reviewers have pointed out are also gone as well, sure still a few might happen from time to time like cross positioned models, knights not being able to mount horses and archers not being able to mount war wagon while they are moving, but it occurs rarely and doesn't make the game anything short of enjoyable.-Because of the maximum word count Steam review system enforces, I will continue my review in this review's comment section, and you can read there if you are interested- "

												Do you want a castle sim? Do you want that medieval atmosphere of Stronhold 1? Dealing with famine, diseases, economy and war? Well, my friend, then you [not] are in luck! .... For this is indeed not the game you were looking for!I get that the devs gave it a shot. The game has a heart. As someone who throughout the year followed firefly studios, it is clear that it is now but a shadow of what it used to be. With very little resources they wanted to do their best.However, as hard of a shot they gave, to me, everything just fell apart from the very moment you start the game, and here is why:The artwork is just sad. Egyptian hieroglyph looks better than what we see here. UI is terrible, it feels very alpha. *cough* look at that type font *cough*No economy, just a lifeless corpse of a castle that spits out little clones to either attack or defend it.If you wanted a sim, like me, you wont see people chatting and going about their lives, there is no micro management. Nothing to see. Where are the citizens, the animations?Take SH1, just awe at the amount of detail that it had, moss in the walls, cracks in the wood and stone. Even wind ffs.Unfortunatly, you cannot stop and think: is this just a SH3 reskin with less bugs?Is it a waste of time? God no. The gameplay is bland but at times, you may find some joy in it. Fans will do a fair bit of it out of pure nostalgia. Smashing walls can be fun.In the end, the game just doesn’t do much for you to like it for very long.			"

												I smashed every enemy woodcutter hut, burned every farm, destroyed every mine, ground every hovel into the dust, then as I basked in the glory of my victory and gloated over my fallen foe laughing as my archers cut down every single peasent that dared set foot outside the keep I was horrified to see all the  building instantly rebuilt from nothing. How was this possible when they had nothing left to build with?Truly it was a miracle and that was when I accepted Jesus into my heart.			"

												It's just not Stronghold. The designers took away so much of what made this game unique. The little quotes of the peasants that gave them personalities, the fun setting up your castle the way you want it, the mini economy you have to babysit in order to keep things happy, ect.I have alot of hours into Stronghold and I'll come right out and say niether Crusader game impressed me. They're both too watered down. If you want a sim that's just like every other one with fast paced war and go go go pace than by all means grab this game! If you want a game thats complex yet not frustrating, engaging yet not overwhelming, and goofy with gore mixed in get Stronghold 2 and you'll understand why so many of us veteran players can't stand this game			"

												I feel this game gets a lot more flack than it deserves. Is it as good as Crusader 1? Of course not. Is it worth $50? Certainly not. But for $10 I've had a blast with my friends playing co-op custom skirmishes. I can't speak for the single player aspect as my favorite part of any SH game has been the custom skirmishes, but I can say I enjoy the updated graphics and new troops in Crusader 2. Yeah, it's a bummer that they left out some of the troops from Crusader 1. Yes, there is the ocassional bug or random crash. But for it's current price of $7.49, and with some friends, I would certainly recommend this game. (I also adore the ability to start multiplayer matches via Steam, wish they would patch the other SH games to include this functionality so I wouldn't have to fiddle around with Game Ranger anymore!)EDIT: You haven't lived until you and your friends put your lords in a single push cart and watch them patrol your kingdoms in style.

												I really wanted to like this because I loved the original Stronghold Crusader, but daaaaaaaamnnnnn the AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥Long story short:The AI processes WAY WAY WAY too fast (We're talking fully built castle in 3 seconds) and doesn't have to deal with resources, meaning they are free to spam attack you at all times and they never really let up.Its not really fun, its just stupid I guess...It's not terrible if you play against friends though, so unless you and some buddies are looking to play together I'd stay away :(DISCLAIMER: I won't rule out the possibility I'm just♥♥♥♥♥♥at RTSes but I can win in Stronghold Crusader 1; in this one, I can't even get a foothold.

												Edit as of 1/17, scroll down for current reviewYou know what wasn't so good? Stronghold 3. You know what is comparatively better? Stronghold Crusader 2. Be warned, there are a few 'day one' glitches and bugs, but nothing game breaking and unfixable like in SH3. As stated in other reviews, the game does feel a bit clunky as of now, but I believe these issues can be ironed out in the next week or two. Take note of the system specs, because my desktop meets the minimum but not the recommended and it's definitely noticeable. Assuming you have that, both die hard fans and ones new to the series won't be disappointed with the options to start with. Skirmish mode, (hooray!) multiple campaigns, and sandbox are all playable. I also like the new art style and updated graphics. Overall, it feels like an updated SH:C with more features, hopefully more to be added through DLC. (Additional units, both new and rebooted AI, all new campaigns, etc) In addition, the Arab lords no longer have to build churches; mosques have finally been added. A small thing, but really helps with the balance between Crusaders and Arabs.      The game takes a different spin on how it approaches the Crusades, and now the 'right side' is whichever side you're fighting for. There's no 'good' side, as both sides view themselves as freedom fighters locked in a righteous struggle against the infidels.      There is multiplayer, but I have not tested it yet, so take that with a grain of salt. I somewhat agree with the opinon that Firefly sacrificed some content for a more realistic game, but that is not nearly as off-putting here as it was in SH3. I'm excited to see where Firefly takes SH:C2, especially after the SH3 letdown, and hope to enjoy this game quite a bit in the future.EDIT: (Since day one was quite a while ago, and the above review is outdated) I don't think considering this as a solid 'yes' review would be correct. Firefly has put in effort to fix the bugs, but the game is still not optimized. As stated in other reviews, really expect those performance drops during sieges. The game does feel somewhat lacking in certain aspects, namely graphics and troop types. As a fan of the Stronghold series since Stronghold 2, (which is still a really fun game for its shortcomings) I will say that, given the price tag, this isn't a 'gateway' Stronghold game. New to the series? Play the original Crusader, or Stronghold 1. Enjoy skirmishing? Stronghold 2 has an above-average skirmish mode, and a nice, easy to use map maker as well. It's not the trainwreck of Stronghold 3, but Stronghold Crusader 2 still mediocre.			"

Posted: September 24, 2014
												Stronghold Crusader II is a game developed by Firefly Studios in a long line of the Stronghold series.  First, some background on me.  I was playing games when DOS was still around and when Age of Empires 1 was the new thing on the MSN gaming zone.  My video game history encompases every genre but primarily focuses on Strategy games, FPS games, and the occasional RPG.  Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader were essentially the same game with a different atmosphere and some unit changes.  Both were excellent games and the sucessors to follow did not so well.  Stronghold 2 was mediocre at best, the fantasy mythic Stronghold and Stronghold 3 were bad.  Firefly split from their old publisher and became their own, just as many developers are doing these days because publishers like to add their two cents to game they know nothing about.  Stronghold Crusader II takes what the original did and improves upon it further.  The music and sound and very similar from the first and well done.  Some of the original quotes from the units are still there as you move your catapults and archers.  The villagers no longer speak to you when you click on them, instead it simply tells you what they are doing.  One of the things that made Stronghold so great for me back in the day was destroying the castles and watching the walls crumble.  The massive armies going at it with each other and heads rolling.  The physics in this game are much improved as to be expected.  When catapults slam their boulders into a wall bodies standing near the point of impact are screwed.  See those thirty archers in a tight group?  Well now they are at the bottom in a pile where they belong.  Trebuchets have great range and destructive power and still need to be setup while the catapults have less range and can be shot by archers. Overall the military feels well done, especially that mace men frenzy charge that leaves nothing standing as they spit and scream their way into battle.  While on the topic of military, some things have been reworked.  The laddermen are gone, which wasn't really a surprise, who ever used them anyways?  Moats and tunnelers have also been removed. At the time of this review sieging a castle isn't an easy task.  Strongwalls are not an option but the time it takes for any military unit to chip away at a wall or gatehouse isn't worth that route.  Almost your entire military force would be dead while they were picking away at the walls.  While I would still like the strongwall option, it works well as it stands.  As said before, catapults, trebuchets that fire boulders, cows, camelheads, and pigs, a bigger version of a catapult, rams, firecarts, and troop carriers are all the siege units.Archers have remained the same but the crossbows no longer use animal hide as armor.  The swordsmen are still slow but the knights can get horses to get them from point A to point B quickly.  There is a new unit called the Sergeant at Arms which gives a bonus to troops within an area of effect, this can boost your other swordsmen, pikes, or whatever else you got nearby.  Of course, the higher military units cost a fortune to field but can essentially soak up arrows while your catapults lay waste to the walls and mace men haul tail into the base to wreck everything.While building a military you will notice that you run out of gold quick unless you run an efficient economy.  Churches, breweries, and extra rations are all ways to keep your citizens happy to so you can generate more taxes.  The market will let you auto-sell and/or auto-purchase items.  This can be set as high or as low as you want.  Iron, stone, wood, pitch, all the basic resources sell for the least while the armors and weapons sell for the most.  Unlike the previous Crusader game, Inns providing ale do not need to be spammed but rather you adjust how much ale is consumed much in the same way as you would food.  This will increase happiness to get you the desired level but just make sure you have the hops farms and breweries to accomodate the usage level.  Churches act in much the same way in that you only need one but have to provide them with candles.  Once again, here you can adjust how many candles are used for the desired happiness.So far I have played through the tutorial and the lionheart campaign.  The story isn't that great but the game does a good job at preparing you for harder battles.  Some are so difficult that if you don't complete the level quick enough the army forces become so numerous it is a massive chore to keep them at bay while you invade.  Additionally, I have played many skirmish matches, which is where the game is at for me.  I like setting up from scratch and playing massive 4v4 battles.  The game hosts 8 players, human or computer.  As in the old ones, the rat is the worst player while the wolf and some of the new comers bring a better challenge.  I have only had one crash to the desktop at the time of this review and that was right after intial installation and launching of a skirmish.  I loaded that same map again a second time and it worked fine.That brings me to the bugs.  Most people were holding off on this game because of the reputation Firefly has.  Since Firefly is now technically a ""indie"" developer as they separated from their publisher, I would like to take away the fears of  purchasing this game.  Other than a few issues with selecting units or them getting stuck in a gatehouse I haven't had any issues.  Below are my specs just in case you are wondering and want to compare.i5-2500k OC'd to 4.4 Ghz16 GB of G Skill Ripjaws RAMDual 7970 RadeonsEVGA FTW Motherboard2 OCZ Vector SSDs in RAID 01200 Watt PSU gold from CorsairH100i CPU CoolerWith that setup I have no issues.  Some people have reported problems while others have not.  I am not sure how well they maintain their computer or what they have going on, as a system is going to be different from the next.  I run a tight ship on mine and have zero problems with running the game.Final Thoughts:Stronghold Crusader II is a well designed game that is being constantly updated with both fixes and soon to be new content.  On their forums they have laid out a plan on how they wish to progress with supporting this game.  It appears as though their heart is where it should be and a fleshed out game was designed.  Is it worth 50 dollars is the next question?  I would say no, 30 or 40 dollars maybe but not 50.  There isn't enough new content to justify the price but if you are a big fan of the original then price might not matter much to you.  I waited for 24 hours and looked at what people were saying before I purchased the game.  I hope this review helps you decide for yourself but please watch YouTube videos of the gameplay and try to find the glitches some are talking about and the ones I spoke of.  If any of that puts you off, give it a week or two then come back.			"

												Long time fan of the Stronghold francise. And I too saw the ""Mixed reviews"" for the newest edition of the Crusader family. So I picked it up on sale, but much to my suprise, I really like it. The gamplay feels smooth and refined, the graphics are stable, and the fundimentals are the same as past games. It has almost a Stronghold 2 feel. the gameplay is focused more on combat then economics. As a whole, it doesn't deviate much from the working stronghold recipe, but still holds its own. Looking forward to trying the DLC.			"

It's like herding cats.- Clicking is very fiddly- Campaign is extremely short and uninspired. POSITIVES:+ Steam now allows refunds			"

												This is a good game that does not get the credit it deserves. I think people have warped expectations and do not review this game fairly. When you take this game out and refrain from comparing to the other games in the series, this is a great stand alone castle building and war simulation. There are some pros and cons with every game, but this is a game I'd definitely recommend. The Pros: - This game really has the spirit of Stronghold: Crusader. It reminds me of my many crusades I went on in that game. - The game is hard. People give it a bad rating because they can't handle the challenge of a real time strategy game. Ideally, I try to focus my economy on producing bread and crossbowmen, but some missions just don't provide you with enough to get off the ground like that and you really have to think on your feet. That's a pro, in my opinion. - There are a lot of missions and expansion packs to keep the fight going.- It looks and sounds beautiful. The graphics look great and the voice acting is fine. They really listened to the community and changed the voices where people complained (Spearman, Narrator, etc). - The map editor is very powerful, but with a steep learning curve. - The sandbox mode is great. Take as much time as you'd like to build a huge castle and economy, then destroy it. - The game feels very balanced and well tested.- The game is way less buggy than any of the other SH games. The Cons:- That being said, the achilles heel of Firefly; the game is still slightly buggy. When you have a small studio making massive games, it's bound to happen. Overall, the game is significantly less buggy than previous renditions, but below I list a few bugs I've found. - Perhaps they do this for balancing / to add to the difficulty, but the AI gets free troops. I've monitored the 'greatest lords' menu, see an opponent with 0 - 10 gold, but mass building an army right before an attack, or building catapults and walls no issue. I've leveled granaries and churches, yet no citizens flee their work stations. That was always a nice part of SH2, you could kill someone by cutting off their economy and preventing them from creating new soldiers. Really felt like a siege. - There's not as much depth (perhaps that's my SH2 bias). The skirmish trail is great, but once you beat them all, well, you beat them. You can spend time building in free play, but I hate how they limit it to one siege at a time, and they don't let you pick where the siege comes from. - They removed the free roaming camera. Before, you could look top down, zoom way in or out, or change angles, which was useful for video making and for castle building. Bugs I've found:1. When I build large castles, I like to set units to patrol, one because it looks cool and two for functionality. However, the path finding messes up and they won't 'reach' their destination, thus stopping their patrol. 2. Sometimes, you can build walls that are not passable and not even know it. If it is too close to a cliff, if there is a small rock or brush underneath, or if the ground is uneven, it will still let you place the wall but you can't access it. Either don't let us place the wall, or let us access it. The same goes for towers; I could only place 1 archer on a tower because half of it was over a rock which I didn't even realize. 3. Speaking of walls near cliffs, I love that I can build my walls right into a cliff, however this causes problems when I'm on a plateau and trying to build my wall close to the edge to maximize my space. Sometimes, a wall will get built underneath the plateau, but it will be invisible, so you can't delete it or build above it. I noticed this playing the sandbox mission with all the bandit camps. 4. I constantly get peasants who say they can't access their work building, yet they will either be in the building running it or just stand there even though it is clearly accessable. Usually deleting and rebuilding the building works, but it's a waste of precious resources. 5. Every now and then, the game just crashes. It does this on both of my gaming systems, usually after an hour or two of play. 6. Some troops don't seem to engage in combat correctly. For instance, when I put pikemen in ""Guard"" mode, they put their spears down, but units run literally right through them. 7. I have trouble running with 3 monitors. Either the cursor goes out of bounds, or it gets locked on the wrong display. Putting it in and out of windowed mode seems to fix it, but it's annoying that I have to do that every time I load. 8. VERY annoyingly, the AI can build anywhere... Including on top of your buildings. In one of the missions where you are allies with two 'Rats', I had a large wall around my castle, yet every time the Rat would go to siege, he would build his siege camp RIGHT in the middle of my walls. Once his camp was gone, the walls would come back, but any archers on top of the walls would be on the ground beside him. Also, I've had enemy AI place their stone masons and pitch diggers right next to or replacing mine, even if I had troops near by.  In 2005, I bought Stronghold 2 in stores (back when people still did that) and instantly fell in love. I played it for hours on end; even built a respectable youtube following with over a million views from my SH2 videos showing advanced map building techniques, mods, and fight videos. I became hooked, and branched out and have purchased every game in the series, and will continue to do so to support Firefly and, occasionally, find gems like this. No game is perfect, but if you lower your expectations, this game is great for what it is and will definitely provide hours of fun.  "

												I loved the Stronghold crusader 1 as a kid, so as soon as i saw Crusader 2? i hit the instabuy button. Boy was that a bad idea after playing the game. (i havent touched the multiplayer so i wont comment on that part)I'll list some of my pros and cons about the game so far:Cons:------------- In General ------------------------------Menu, really simple (looks too ""clean/old fashioned"") [maybe just me? but thats what i thought]-Artwork, Seems a little simple and cartoony for this sort of game.-Options, Severe lack of options customisation! No controls changing! No advanced graphic settings (for a 2014 game).-------------Moving to gameplay now----------------Unit Pathfinding sucks. utter terrible. (could be improved with a patch so wouldnt worry too much)-Wall building system is terrible, i could place a wall then try to delete and not work.the wall is still there! (probably a bug)-No moats! What happened to Crusader 1's moats??-Everything is over simplified by a lot compared tot he original.-No tooltips or explanations ( have to look on game wiki but i think the devs are being lazy here)-Graphics in general,Textures are horrible! for a 2014 game-LESS buildings than the original, YES, LESS STUFF, (isnt the point of a sequel is to expand the original?? not take stuff out!)-Maps arent well designed, not many trees, not enough grass etc.-Expensive! Everything is so expensive and selling doesnt get you much, (maybe needs a balance)-They got rid of the happiness, decorations system! (sandbox without decorations?! thats suicidal)-Units dont look as good as they should for a 2014 game, (maybe i should include this in graphics?)-Right/left clicking was weird, cant change controls for these.-Building against a natural ditch or water doesnt work very well, wall might cut off randomly without the battlements.-Natural disasters!! Who the heck thought it was a good idea to include this??! (well at least you could turn it off xD)-Did they recycle voices from the original? (i dont really mind but might not sit well with some people)Pros: ( lets end witht he happy stuff)-AI changes were much better than the original, although they still fall for the same tricks used in the original.-Likes the market auto sell system!, nice touch!-Got the same old Crusader 1 feel to the game!-Liked some of the new defensive attachments.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Somethings devs might want to consider:-INFORMATION! Add more tips! -When your resources are low make it blink or something!-Can still repair walls instantly while enemy blowing up walls with trebs.-Add moats back in.-Maybe try some better graphics? ( dont know if its possible at this point).Also just a note to the devs!We love your work, we dont mind how long it takes to come out, be it 10 years or 20 years but please make it a great game worthy of the firefly title. I know you guys can do it from seeing crusader 1. Keep up the good work! Shroompat out. "

												Stronghold Crusader 2 offers very little change from the previous Crusader (2001). Hardcore fans and achievement hunters will be the only ones who will appreciate SC2. The ""Campaign"" trails are back from the original. They offer no more than a series of AI skirmish challenges that vary in difficulty. There's a dozen or so tutorial missions the have some kind of ""Narrative"" but I use that word loosely.Melee Fighting: Winning consists of massing a blob of units into another player's castle to kill thier avatar ""Lord."" I say ""blob"" because the units clip into each other It's not pleasing on the eyes when a group of a hundred pikemen can't be distinguished between a single guy. To make matters worse, during a fight they all clip into smaller blob. To make matters EVEN worse, a well placed pitch pot can decimate a group of hundreds.Castle Smashing: The castle walls are no more than ten feet high and seem as strong as paper mache't. A few catapults can blast through a wall very quickly.  Probably why they removed ladder men and seige towers from the previous games. They added ""ragdoll"" physics, when a unit is arrowed they will tumble off the wall, if their foot doesn't get stuck and trap them hanging like maniquins for a few seconds before they disappear. When a tower falls with units on top the ragdoll levitates like Wil-e- Coyote holding up a sign before they fall to the ground.Themes: The music is the only thing done right. Really great Crusade feeling soundtrack. As for the two religions, a lot of care was taken to avoid controversy. The Islamic Saracens dont eat the ""pig"" food ration (they grow sheep farms instead) and don't drink Ale, another handicap seeing as how they can't gain the happines benifits from Bars, and no other feature was put in place instead. Churches and Mosques are only distuinguishable from a little moon and star above the Mosque. TL:DR= Only for fans of Stronghold. a lot of features done poorly, none really dont right. It's old Stronghold with new spit polish. Nab it on a sale and knock out the generous achievements.			"

												I have played all of the previous stronghold crusader games and enjoyed them.  This one is totally terrible however.  At first glance it seems totally awesome.  There are additional units that have been added, and the graphics are excellent.  Unfortunately the AI is ridiculous.  In the old Stronghold crusader you could actually use tactics and choke off your enemy by hitting his supply lines.  In this one, he randomly generates additional units, and no matter how low his supplies are, each wave keeps getting harder and harder.  I made it through half the campaigns and started with hard, and then went to normal and then to easy.  Never had this problem before, and I've played all sorts of strategy games, including warcraft, starcraft, crusader, etc.  The tutorial is very basic and its up to you to figure out how the new units actually work, so not much fun there either.

												TLDR:The game is great. Most negative reviews are from fans of the Stronghold series and how this game lacks some features that were in other Stronghold games.I heavily recommend this game.Get it on sale, I've heard prices drop under 10USD which is well worth the game compared to this hefty buck.-------------------------------------------First off, I spent my whole childhood playing the Stronghold series, while it may put you off that I lack hours to form a proper review, I can assure you that I have spent hundred of hours on previous titles.Negative reviews of this game will put you off, however what players need to understand is that this game IS GOOD, the negative reviews are from fans of the series that are disapointed with how this game was made as there are a lot of features they expected this game to have from Stronghold Crusader & Stronghold Crusader Extreme.So should you get this game? Definitely, note that the community is small but it has to grow.When this review was written there is an average of 300 users online at a time.How is the gameplay? The gameplay is good, however if you've played and enjoyed the previous Stronghold Crusader then gameplay may fall short in some places.			"

												Having played the original Stronghold Cusader extensively, when I initially played this game I thought this was a dumbed down version of the original however there is more to this game than that.I feel that this game is somewhat more balanced in the sense that stalemate seems to be less common, I attribute this to the fact that walls and towers are less powerful (and significatly more expensive) and archers on towers can be killed much more easily than in the original.Another element which was improved in this second iteration of this game is the UI. The UI in the 1st game was already quite good, however this time around the UI tells you more information such as food generated vs food eaten and In addition to this there are elements that make the game much more accessable and remove some of the quirks usually associated with older titles such as the clunky engineer system and confusing camera rotation. There are some elements which I miss form the original game, such as the fear factor system, the moats and the somewhat more advanced walling and tower system.In Conclusion I think that this game is better that it is made out to be, I understand this is not the ideal successor to Stronghold Crusader however it does improve on some key areas that make the game feel more polished.

												Note: Bought the game on special, but it was on my wishlist.What a sorely disappointing game. They did a few things right - credit granted. However, the negative aspects of the game clearly beat up the positive aspects... without much re-consideration. If you're a fan of the Stronghold series then sure, go spend your hard-earned dollars. You might enjoy it. I, however, did not.Update: Here's the thing: If you're looking for a remake of Stronghold Crusader, then this most likely isn't your game. If you're looking for a cool RTS, then you could have some fun. There's a few buggy issues with the game which I'll log throughout my experience with it. I would, however, only recommend buying this game on SPECIAL. It definitely isn't worth the normal retail value.5.5/10.Mission: Saladin Learning Campaign 4Collected the 500g cache behind the first wall. The gold cache registered as collected as the ""pop-up"" was visible. Condition: I used a catapult to knock down the wall and charged a Sassanid Knight in to collect it. At first, it wouldn't register as I assumed it was because there were enemy players near it? However, as I ran my knight out it did. This leads be to believe that A) The enemy got it, or B) It didn't work in the aforementioned condition. Result: My gold did not increase by 500.Note: The timer on that mission is impractical (Medium difficulty). I always manage to make it to the last gate as the timer runs out. This was after trying both routes (high-ground and low-ground). -----------------------------------------------------Update: 16/06/20161) The enemy (i.e. The Rat) is able to create units WITHOUT an armoury. This is further applied to having no GOLD available either, as we know it requires gold to produce units. I monitor his resources through the greatest lord panel. 2) Trebuchets are highly effective siege units. However, the trebuchets damage versus an armoury is rather disappointing. It requires upwards from 10 direct hits for the armoury to be destroyed, whereas a barracks requires far less than that.3) I’ve noticed that the healers (produced from the mercenary camp) sometimes don’t move after being given an instruction (i.e. to go atop a tower). The unit model implies movement (i.e. he is walking), but there’s no actual movement at all. It’s only until I reissue the command does he do it correctly.4) Enemy magically makes resources appear out of thing air? I’ve noticed this on a few occasions now. This refers to my first point, whereby I monitor his resources through the greatest lord panel. He literally averages below 50g while I’m sieging him, but still managers to buy stone (and all know how &*#$ing expensive that is – which brings me to another point.5) The economy is slightly broken. You can buy wheat from upwards of 150g. However, when selling wheat (presumably a scarce commodity based on the cost price) sells for 5-10g. How did you work that one out? You should implement some sort of economy system (i.e. selling dilutes the market and lowers the value received per quantity. On the other hand, buying wheat creates greater demand thus raising the price). It’s rather simple economics.			"

												I dont understand why they dont just take everything that was good about the first games and use it in their new games...and i sure as hell dont unnderstand how you can fail at making a worthy sequel 3 times in a row...If you loved the feeling and immersion of Stronghold 1 and Strondhold: Crusader 1 like i did with the awesome voice acting, peasants with personalities, the dirty medieval setting... dont come looking for it here. ive lost all faith in firefly studios and wont be buying any more games from them...

												Amazing Strategy Game, I never played Stronghold before but a lot of other Strategy Games like AOE1+2, Eath of Empire, Settlers and many more and I realy like this Game.As a beginner the Tutorial is not realy what Tutorial should explain, you have 3 Missions and they are pretty easy, but no Tutorial how to build, make peoples happy or witch Army is better too use, how much they can stand and all the buildings you can build, like church and market. I also miss the tutorial how you play for example how you let the game run faster. For me the first 3 missions are just missions but not a tutorial, so for me as a beginner it was realy hard to understand that game, I had to watch some gameplay videos to learn more about that game.So as a beginner the missions are realy hard its much different then playing AOE or Settlers, you also can`t change the game mode to easy, normal or hard. But you can play Sandbox, the only problem on playing Sandbox is that there is no enemy and after a small time it`s boring. Multiplayer is fun if you know the game, as a beginner its pretty hard to enter a match and don`t lose imediately, I hope they will add a better tutorial later or more missions to learn the game and all you have to know.Game makes realy fun at all and its challanging what keeps me playing this game and learn more every day. Graphic is nice, game works good with a few bugs sometimes, crash or freezes, but thats nothing they can fix with a patch.My Pro:challanginggraphicmusiclong matcheseasy to build a castlebuildings dont need time to buildmultiplayer with friends My Contra:bad tutorial for beginnersno informations about building and armyNPC seems to have unlimited resources and money (they build realy fast a complete castle+ big army)fight agains computer start pretty fast, no time to build if you like it slowno settings to play the game on easy/normal/hard for missionsI give this game a 7 of 10 points, would give it a 9 of 10 if there would be a better tutorial for peoples who never played Stronghold Crusader.

												Quite likely long review incoming.I have gone into the game with having its predecessor played for years upon years.I have always played either skirmish or multiplayer with  friends, so compaign was never, and will not be considered from my pov. I have immediately launched into skirmishes to figure out what is new, how are the systems changed and so on.I have to say, some aspects have been made simpler. (There is generally an easier relationship between buildings&mechnisms, such  as 1 temple only, you make a couple  candle workshops and you can figure out how many more you need for the best effect, opposed to the %of people blessed via priests in the first game)I do not necessarily consider it a good or a bad point, so long as either fits the game, which it imho does here.However, I really miss the popularity system. That added a lot to the feels and complexity of crusader. (nice lord/ cruel lord)The look of the game is  the best they have done in 3d, but the art of the original made it visually impressive and timeless, which I miss to some degree.Also, it seems some settings arent perfectly optimised yet, because despite my PC's strenght, framedrops were present after a couple hundred troops started battling. My greatest concern was with the pathfinding of units in general. Peasants are working allright, but troops seem to glitch out rather often. If they go near impassable terrain in a large group (lets say because of a rally point) some of them will freeze and dont move unless commanded again. The assassins are even glitchier if you control more than 5 of them, they just stop or clump up in certain areas of the castle they should figure out how to use. (stairs seem to confuse them a  great deal)Despite it silly  problems, I do not see anything that could not be fixed with patches. For those who have loved how the archers arrows were shot in the original game (in nice, somewhat slowish arcs), that is not how it is done here. Arrows travel almost instantly. Ranged combat resolves faster imo, probably because they wanted to  make the game combat feel faster, more responsive. It certainly feels a bit odd though, on how the arrows travel. Melee combat however, felt slower. I think because units do not stack up to the ridiculous extent they did in the original crusader, and hence 50 units cant swing their swords in a 1 square meter area. I do not really mind this change of feel that much.Walls are extremely weak vs any sort of catapult, and need to be made extremely thick to be effective. (which is sad because it takes away so much space)As for the new units and features, I actually like them more than I thought I would. The abilities of units are welcome, the new units are (mostly) interesting.TL,DR: Has potential to be a really good long lasting experience, speaking from a  skirmish/multiplayer mindset. If you want to be on the safe side, wait for some meaningful patches to roll out, which would fix the bad(glitchy) pathfinding,  occcasional random crashes, poor optimisation, and odd fps drops.Most maps are also somewhat small.Biggest beef with the game by far: There is no space grid watch. As in, one used to be able to press the spacebar to see an up-top view of the building grid for better building placement, and unit directing near difficult terrain/high buildings. It is of utmost importance, and  sadly, it isnt included. Not yet at least.			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is the latest entry in Firefly Studios’ castle-building RTS franchise, which began way back in 2001 with the original Stronghold. I haven’t played all of the Stronghold games — in fact, I don’t think I’ve played one since 2005’s Stronghold 2 — but from what I can tell, not much has changed. Most of the game mechanics remain the same, but many options have been removed to make the game sleeker and easier to play, which not coincidentally coincides with Firefly’s desire for the game to be more about quick multiplayer skirmishes than long castle defenses. In Stronghold Crusader 2 like in the other Stronghold games, you have to run a castle. You lord over peasants who perform the necessary jobs, but they’re not just mindless drones. You have to keep them happy by providing them with housing, food, ale, and / or religious services, and the happier you make them, the more you can tax them. Taxes are your main source for gold, which you need for recruiting soldiers to join your army. You also have to quarry stone for castles, wood for buildings, and iron for weapons.The economic models for the Stronghold games are more complex than you usually see in an RTS, and they involve lots of buildings and moving parts. In Stronghold Crusader 2, there are over 30 types of buildings, from fletchers to dairy farms to churches, and they give you numerous options for how to build your castle. For example, when feeding your people, do you opt for apple orchards which are quick and cheap but inefficient, or do you go for bread which requires wheat farms, mills, and bakeries, and which takes longer to set up? There are also nearly 30 types of military units you can use, from archers to knights to the new “wolf” ballista. Do you go offensive and take the battle to your enemies, or do you sit back and defend? And do you take the time to construct the weapons necessary for your troops, or do you just hire more expensive mercenaries? I always like it when games give me options, and the various Stronghold incarnations have always provided that in spades. So how does Stronghold Crusader 2 differ from Stronghold Crusader? Mostly it’s in the focus of the game. The original Stronghold Crusader was a slower-paced mostly single-player game where you built and defended castles. There were some castle assaults included, but  they didn’t work very well, and they were a rarity. Now in Stronghold Crusader 2, the game is all about multiplayer skirmishes. The pace is much faster, the interface is easier to deal with (in particular it’s now much easier to check and adjust peasant happiness, tax rates, and things of that nature), and there is more of a balance between attacking and defending. In fact, while Stronghold Crusader 2 has a pair of campaigns, they’re “learning campaigns,” and they’re about as fun as they sound. Instead, the bulk of the gameplay is devoted to six “skirmish trails” where you fight 24 skirmish battles against AI players, including longtime opponents the Rat and the Wolf. I was completely unenthusiastic about Stronghold Crusader 2 after completing its campaigns, which took me only a few hours. But then I tried out the skirmish trails, and surprisingly that changed my opinion. The nice thing about the skirmishes is that you almost always start out in a bad position (such as at the bottom of a valley with no resources) against multiple opponents, and so what you have to do right away is build and defend your castle, which makes the skirmishes a little like playing the original Stronghold games. Each skirmish is sort of a puzzle where you have to figure out a building strategy that will allow you to survive and thrive, and I enjoyed that part of the game. The problem is that once you get your castle running, actually defeating your opponents is sort of a tedious grind, especially since the enemy AI isn’t great. Computer players are good about running their economy (and they cheat a lot, which no doubt helps), but they’re hopeless at running their military, frequently attacking you with the same force from the same position over and over again. The thing that surprised me the most about Stronghold Crusader 2 is how many things got taken out of the game. There are no longer feasts or jousting tournaments, your peasants no longer commit crimes or catch diseases, siege units like laddermen and engineers were removed, European castles only get three types of towers, you no longer have to resupply catapults or trebuchets with stone, you no longer have to expand granaries or the stockpile and more. Usually sequels go in the opposite direction, adding lots of new things, but for some reason Firefly went back to the basics here. Some of the removals make perfect sense, but why would you remove castle and siege options in a game about building and attacking castles? That just seems bizarre. Stronghold Crusader 2 also has a handful of unfortunate problems. It’s possible to have permanent fires start up in your castle, which can ruin your game if it occurs along a path that your peasants take. You can order your soldiers to attack something, but instead they’ll just attack whatever gets in their way, which is annoying when you’re trying to take down a trebuchet or some other specific unit. If you order your troops to attack-move, then your melee soldiers will do just that but your archers will move until they attack something and then they’ll stop, which makes it difficult to keep your troops together and assault castles.But overall, even with the problems, I still sorta kinda enjoyed my time with Stronghold Crusader 2. I didn’t like it as much as the original Stronghold, but it has castle building and defending, it’s easy to play, it looks and sounds fine, and everything works reasonably well. As long as you don’t mind that the game doesn’t really have a campaign and instead relies on skirmishes, then it can provide you with a worthwhile gaming experience.			"

												The Good:-Game is functional and has little completely FUBARness like wolves climbing ladders.The Bad:-AI cheats up the wazoo, but is not actually more challenging-The graphics. The game only barely looks better than Stronghold 2, a game released in 2004. The models are off proportion and rather amateurish, and the art ranges from passable to horrid.-Random events negatively impact your popularity. Who honestly thought this was a good idea?-No real innovation. The only new things here are the Templar Sergeant, the Slave Driver, the Arabian equivalent of the Crusader Knight, that stupid♥♥♥♥♥dude with the dreadlocks, the War Wolf (which is just a catapult with more HP) and the Hussite Clown Car. Weather is new, but it serves no purpose other than to hinder progress.-No collision detection in an RTS. As a result, melee fights degenerate into blobs of stacked units flailing about.-The UI. Why whoever designed the UI chose to ignore the perfectly sensible UI seen in the first two games and decide that the best solution would be spread all relevant information to the far corners of the screen is anyone's guess.-The game is missing quite a few things from the first(Siege Towers, etc)Conclusion:This game is bad buy Stronghold Crusader HD			"

												As a huge fan of the orignial Stronghold Crusader I had high expections for this game. I was pretty weary of it after the whole Stronghold 3 ordeal. At first it was kinda weird, but that went away fast. The units and buildings are great. I love the seige weapons in this game. Their expensive, but they really do some damage. The graphics are great as well. I realll like the weather dynamic. A storm came over my kingdom and a lighnting struck my archer. He caught fire and started running down the wall until he parished. I would like to see a flooding added into the weathter dynamic. Overall, the game feels great and is a blast to play.+Graphics+Great core gameplay +More units and buildings+Powerful seige weapons "

												I love Stronghold Crusader, it's a really awesome game and it's very enjoyable. I still play it with my friends, it's really awesome. I was excited for Stronghold Crusader II, updated graphics would be awesome, maybe some more complicated mechanics and new units would be an improvement. But this game takes several steps back from it's predecessor. It doesn't have the same UI tools, such as flattening buildings into a floorplan format for building castles, and rotating builds is increbily clunky. The game has been blakanized into 5 DLC packs, where even your choice in icons is limited if you don't buy all of them. For me personally, I wouldn't buy this game until they seriously patch is and sell all the DLC bundled in one edition for about $30. I already paid way too much for it.			"

												As a Fan of the crusader series, it pained my heart to see stronghold crusader seen dripping down with stronghold 2, stronghold legends(junk), and stronghold 3 (you even dared to publish that?).the bad stuff:However i think the graphical issue has been improved even tough some things are VERY unrealistic; units glide over the terrain. Mounted siege equipment does not need engeniers and the woodne construction magicly comes to life. The smelter now has limited only 2 engeniers?? many of the figthing soldiers and some shooting soldiers were the animations simply don't match.And some game mechanics...Stronghold 2 had some of the best ideas that simply had to be balanced to working conditions...-The crime scene easely could been implanted if it was not so complicated and big.-The lords kitchen with parties (and the lords wife!) in the keep was so magnificent (but leave it there cuzz when the lord leaves the keep the problem with stupid sneak attacks is to great) ashame to not do that! You could have easely made him eat the same food as your peasents and give a bonus in gold or popularity or somehting like that when you feast. In SH2 it was also awsome to see the armys march first into the keep on the stairs and only then upstairs.-The removal of fear factor is realy a shame since everyone wants to pick the side of either the evil lord or the good lord with both its benefits and penalties.-The original mechanic of priests was so creative why do you have to make it almost the same as the inn?Converting peasents lead to some care over the population this game initially don't want you to care about.-The houses are way to big or they should have had more people living in them (like double or so)-Farms are to small and to less productive. Making a farm bigger and more productive make  amore interesting side.or perhaps just build huts and let workers plant there plants on the land themselfs could also be great-on original SHC it was the same but i still think arabian troops need a weapon cost as well.-i miss the function to flatten ervything so i have a good layout of my castle-better zooming in and out would have bene great-the hoarding on towers is bugged and stays on the same hight as normal walls-Magicly appearing siege camps and magiccly let an entire army of catapults purr out??? seriously i tought you had learned your lesson about that! when someone is not paying attention and you build a siege camp behind there castle evrything lies in ruins in less then 30 seconds... The engeniers system like in SHC1 was fine it only needed to be able to build easyiers more siege equipment. p.s. NO ladders??? no siege towers????? no Moat??? wtf!!!Also the city simply didn't feel as lively as the original stronghold crusader did. Everything goes to slow the peasents jobs are very boring and the city is pretty empty. The original crusader had problems with not being able to build over people but it least it had mothers caring over children, children playign around, drunkers getting wasted and simply more people that did more interesting stuff, Let people enjoy your castle to... (the apothacary could have been healing your lord and your peasents and make him wandering about). The economy also goes far to slow wich can easily be solved by doubling EVERY peasents there walking speed and there spawn speed. perhaps an auto create soldiers function could be a great idea toThe good stuff:-Graphics are well updated despites the poor animations.-You can now choose some apearance to your lord and by it how the keep looks. Choosing from christian or arabian lords result in building either square towers or round towers wich is an excelent way to make the castle look instantly diffrent. (if u realy want to spoil fans why not make a custom outfitter to create an own lord with custimizeble loadouts from helmets armor weapons and mantle... Fans would LOVE this)Also the churches for christian lords and mosques for arabian lords are well done(despites there mechanics).-Some units ability's are a good way to increase the way how your soldiers want to react to threats and gives more influence on the outcome of a battle.-Everything is VERY WELL organized really compliments on this one! You can on multiple ways see and adjust some of the most importent things about your economy, also the market with auto buy and auto sell option while you can buy and sell everything from the beginningin there respective storage depot is absolutely well done.-Infinite store space in the stockpile and granery, perhaps unrealistic but for smooth gameplay this is a must and you have did it great! (however the stockpile being a square rather then a straight lane would have been even better!)-How the flying cows, lions, donkeys, and camel head explode on impact when launched from a catapult awsome!!It would have been SO MUCH greater if u used more of the same gore with the fighting troops (meelee fighters cutting other soldiers heads arms and leggs off) I know that in 3d gore is more difficult but it realy could have been better done.-You need only one church and one inn and the effects are custimizeble. This is a good way to keep castles more realistic but it also makes the castle more boring.-You can now create walls without een auto platform for units to walk on, now you can create mulitple layers of walls without auto connecting all of them!-the iron mines are much better done! longer and nice animations but the birng up more iron every turn. (this would also have been great for the stone quarry)-The fact that people always can get to there working spaces due to narrow corridors.-The greater numbers on popularity and economy resources are also much better done-The continious increase of gold true taxes gives you a much better vieuw of how much gold you get from them.-The prices of the market realy encourges you to make everything yourself and not producing to much since selling it is hardly worth it, however it would have been nicer to see a changing market based on what all the people buy and sell in the market to see more rare materials and more common materials result in price change.-Reduces range of archers catapults and averything that fires SHC1 realyt had a problem there with archers that kills people on ranges a sniper rifle would hardley do the trick.So overal i will say i still reccommend this game but i do hope the developers are not going to do something else cuzz this game needs lots of updates and perhaps an expansion or 2-3 before it will be realy good. I thank you! "

												I really liked the first Crusader game, so I thought I would Like this one. I enjoyed the ability to spin the map, and I like the building designs. But what I do not like is that it is too fast paced. Walls and buildings fall  far too easily; not only to catapults but also to foot soldiers. Fires spread and destroy buildings far too quickly.  Defences cost far too much. The ability to properly command one's troop is appaling: go there and attack, nope, I do not want to attack the walls or climb the stairs, I will do what I want. Get on that tower, no, I want to stand on the walls. Blah blah blah.If you are a diehard fan of the series, I would recommend getting it simply to have it in your Stronghold collection. Only, wait until it is on sale though. The original Stronghold Crusader is a better buy. I have played that one for hundres of hours, from its release to this day.			"

												I bought this game in the sale because I love the Stonghold series. A lot of reviews on here moan about the lack of features and little improvement from Crusader, I was one of those people at first.  I was originally disapointed with some of the removed features such as moats and wasn't blown away initially. However, one of the biggest things for me is that I am more engaged with the skirmishes, the original game I found them to be fairly simple but some are incredibly challenging on normal mode for this new version. Honest advice, I wouldn't pay full retail for it, but if it is in the sale then it is well worth it.			"

												The Stronghold series has always been extremely difficult to summarise, but I guess the unfortunate word that I tend to use is ""frustrating"". It hasn't ever recaptured that momentum that Stronghold Crusader delivered back in 2002, producing games that didn't deliver for a variety of different reasons.Unfortunately, I don't think newcomers to the game will enjoy the game as much as we do. It still has a lot of content missing, and areas such as the menu's and HUD are definitely missing a much-needed improvement. The graphics aren't as good as you'd expect, and the AI is broken at times. Troops refuse to obey your commands due to bugs, and so on. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting, thats for sure. With this said, I do rate Stronghold Crusader 2, and I do enjoy playing it. It has been great for a player like myself who grew up playing the original. Just to have the feel of Stronghold again, to get a taste of what originally made it so successful. Character dialogue is witty, the gameplay is fast, and the numerous scenario's that you partake in provide excellent replayability. The tutorial and majority of skirmishes are brilliant, even for me a few of them I kinda thought ""..how the hell am I supposed to do that?!"" but you eventually get into the groove of how the game dynamics work. Its good to progressively see yourself get better & better, as you challenge yourself further by adding multiple AI and restricting yourself to using certain units/buildings. I haven't completed the campaign as of yet, but so far its been extremely good fun.So for fans of previous Stronghold titles, I am sure you will learn to appreciate the game for the quality it has, though somewhat trapped inside a conglomerate of faults. For newcomers I am skeptical as to how much you'd enjoy it, as there are other titles in this genre that do much more then what Stronghold Crusader 2 provides. Still, SC2 provides some memorable moments and entertaining game scenario's, yet lacks the full package we truly want to see that follows in the originals footsteps.			"

												First thing that pops up is account creation. Only get basic shields for your profile until you unlock the rest. You can sign up for emails from firefly to get 10 additional shields...seems odd for a full price AAA game, but alright. Couldn't figure out how to continue, so I had to restart the game.Into the homescreen. First thing I notice are DLC's being advertised down the bottom of my screen. Not too in my face, but still a bad sign. Menus seem easy to navigate. Setting up my first custom skirmish.No idea what the faction-like button is and nothing explains it - no tooltips either. Nice to see some familliar faces in the enemy AI (Rat, Wolf, Sultan). About half of the faction-like head things are not available to me to pick, so I assume they are the DLC they were advertising on the homescreen. Set up a 1v1 with medium difficulty and a slight cash advantage for me because I haven't played this in a while.Start of the game seems pretty similar to Stronghold that I remember. Buildings look a little more 3D but nothing too great for 2016 graphics. Lack of tooltips still makes the game pretty confusing to pick up; thankfully my knowledge of SH will get me through the first trials. Apple orchards seem a lot smaller than I remember them, not sure how this will turn out. - Large mercenary-guarded short-cut routes could make the game interesting- Strategic resources guarded by animals- Smaller resource deposits- Food seemed incredibly difficult to secure (at least on the map I was playing on)- Mercenaries launch attacks on you (ARGHH)- AI doesn't suicide men into your walls if there is a long way around- Archers are much more realistic- Resources seem to take a lot longer to aquire than I remember- AI targets strategic resources when attacking - wood, stone and iron camps- Wall building is incredibly different. No different wall heights and simplified building. Still can't have diagonal gates for some reason either. Expensive AF.- There are estates which players can capture which bring resources in for your empire- Barricades make an interesting addition- I like the new weapon-making buildings. Removing leather armour was a good idea- Strategic resource bar on the side is a helpful addition- I wish there was some way to build a small tower outside your 'build zone' similar to the baracades. Like a wooden tower or somethingEdited connclusion: I would give this game a solid 7/10 once I played it a couple more times on an easier difficulty which helped me sit back and see more of the game. Estates are a cool idea and there are a surprisingly large amount of different ways to cross a map which I think is good. The new resource bars are a welcome addition. Overall, I think the game is an improvement over Crusader in many ways. Lack of tooltips and some overall bad ui makes the game a bit annoying. Edit 1: What I think this game really needs is a GAME TIME ADJUSTER. This is a unique RTS in that instead of starting off with simple mircomanaging and then making your way slowly towards complex systems and buildings it dumps you right into the middle of the game. You need to move FAST or you get left behind. Having a pause button (for single player anyways) would help new players get a handle on the beginning of the game. The AI can place buildings all over the map simulatneously whilst a new player must navigate around and figure everything out. Having 2 and 4 times speed would really help with the painfully slow resource intake.Edit 2: Changed some things about earlier after second playthrough			"

												Pros:1. Physics engine ( Watching your seige units take down a castle wall, watching it fall brick by brick, more destruction on a solid hit than one the barely hits the wall. 10/10 dude.)2. Castle building ( Lots of strategies to building your walls, you can make a lot of small walls making it annoying to try and reach the interior, or just build up huge thick walls and laugh as your enemy ""tries"" to break through.)3. Epic battles ( Some of the best times i've had in this game was just building up the largest military i could and attack the enemies castle, watching their archers taking out my infantry on the way to the walls, my seige units destroying towers with archers on them, then watching my army rush in and pillage the town after they breach the walls.)4 .Fun to play with friends ( The true way to play this game.)Cons:1.AI is absolutely horrible ( All enemies literally play the same way except for minor differences like castle layouts and perfered unit.)2.Maps (Lots of them but only a few decent ones.)3.Playability ( I can only stand to play a game or two before switching to a superior game.)4.AI again because its so bad it deserves 2 spots ( The enemy literally has no strategy to their attacks, they will just send wave after wave of units. the 1st wave will be decent in size but if you survive it the rest of the game consists of many small units just walking up to your walls, hitting em once or twice, die, repeat.)5.Building space ( Each map gives each team a certain amount opf land to build on. You use this space for your walls, farms, houseing ect. You can place some military buildings anywhere as long as it isnt in enemy territory. Before you think that sounds like its not that bad just wait till you have an enemy spawn 3 seige tents right behind you without any warning since they just pop up, no peasents have to construct it or anything.)Summary:Overall its an OK game, it can be really fun with friends and PvP is probably the way to play this game, but playing the single player is very difficult due to how dumb the AI is. I'll still recommend this game due to the fun times ive had with my friends but thats the only reason really, couldve been a lot better.			"

												Having played every single game in the stronghold series except Kingdoms and 3, I can quite assuredly say this game is mediocre at best, at worst it's trying really hard to capture crusader 1's spirit but failing horribly, and it fails to improve upon strongold 2's features and keeps the horrible ones from what I assume was 3. In my mind, 2 was the best game due to its complexity, and features such as towers actually having an inside, revunne from estates, and feasts among other things. This game has none of improvments of 2, nor most of the features from the original crusader, such has different sized walls and gates and actually different tower designs. Towers in SHC2 are the exact same model only upscaled in size. Going back to what the game has from SH2, there are candle makers who magically create wax, the terrible formation system which is useless once you're in the heat of battle, oh and here it is also useful to mention a unit cap which only seems to increase for every enemy you defeat, which is a bit counter intuitive to met at least, as i always prefered fighting two or three strong enemies over several seiges than anything else. THis game tries so hard to be an RTS which it is not and never will be, when it was perfectly fine beign stronghold. I will still play this game, and hope that updates will come out that improve it, but that won't be likely unless they are radical changes. I would recommend SH2 before SHC2 if you're lookign for a good combination between castle buildign sim and RTS, and SHC1 if you want an excellent medieval strategy game.			"

Back to the roots! - 7/10Introduction:As a big fan of Stronghold 1 and Stronghold Crusader 1 I was really happy to read and see, that a new Stronghold Crusader was planned and what the devs wanted to do with it. After just a mediocre Stronghold 2 (and yes it was, at least in my opinion) and the disastrous Stronghold 3 (and yes, IT WAS) it's no wonder, if people are a bit sceptical about another ""try"". After watching pre-alpha gameplay and the dev diary I could see 'the old crusader 1' in it. The devs wanted to go back to the roots and that's exactly what I wanted. Therefore I have decided to throw in some Euros into the gambling house (preorder) and to cross my fingers, that Firefly won't mess it up this time or it would be their last game for sure. Long story, short answer: this time they could deliver!Pro:the old 'crusader feeling' from the past!it's always fun to build castles and to destroy the stuff of other peoplerebalanced and new units (no more unstoppable horse archers)smarter construction of buildingslearning campaign + skirmish trails will offer ~30 hours of singleplayer funcustom skirmish battles with AI possible (and you can change your own color now too)VERY hard final skirmish trail mission (yup, it's fun for your brain)working multiplayera lot of maps (the old classic maps of SHC1 are also planned to be added later)map editorSteam Workshop support is plannedgood soundtrackyou can throw several animals through the airsome of the old german voice actors are backthe release version was very playable with only some minor bugs (my experience, maybe not yours)the devs actually care about the game and have further plans for ityou can brew beer, germans love beerNeutral:mediocre graphics (it's not bad but it isn't too great too, could be better, but I don't care that much about it)not much visual variety...because of the crusader setting of the game which means desert, desert, desert, some palms, some oasis, some rivers, mountains and have I already mentioned desert? (that's no contra)no moats anymore (I miss them, because they contribute to a more challenging defense, but let's be honest...moats don't make that much sense in a desert)no leather armors anymore (crossbowmen need and wear steel armor now, macemen need no armor anymore)Contra:not all promised features are in yet (Coop playing as the same lord, strongwall option)...but they will be added laterlittle lags in multiplayer, if there are a lot of units running aroundmain menu artwork isn't that greathorrible ingame info-vids of the AI players, when they decide to attack or want stuff...poorly done!the AI hasn't changed much...they can be pretty tough, but they're predictable, don't act that smart and cheatno 'good karma' (monuments, garden, ...) and 'bad karma' (gallows, cages) buildings anymore [popularity bonus of church services, beer production, food and taxes is still in]no laddermen anymore (no tunnel diggers too, but I don't miss them, because they were bad in the original)I REALLY miss the voice reactions of the peasants, if you click at themConclusion:Stronghold Crusader 2 isn't revolutionary. Nothing spectacular has changed compared to Stronghold Crusader 1. Some new stuff got added, some stuff has been changed, some stuff got cut out and everything is presented with new graphics in 3D now. As a yummy topping you're now able to play Multiplayer with no problems or workarounds. There is some stuff I really miss though. Is it bad, because there's no major advance? No, not if you ask me. Why should you change a formula, which works well? All I wanted was a updated version of Stronghold Crusader 1 with a working multiplayer via Steam, nothing more. And that's what I almost got. I'm happy with my purchase and can recommend it to all the old fans of the old Stronghold titles, which share my expectation. If you're looking for brand new mechanics and stuff, then you won't be that satisfied.7/10----------------------~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion? Feel free to make a comment. "

												As a big Stronghold franchise fan, I can say that this game is worth buying.It's not that great as the original Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader was, but for me it delivers fun.Pros:+Sieges are really fun, especially against AIs (they don't send 40crossbowman and archers on one tower)+Troops are balanced, you can do well with both Arabian soldiers and European ones+Wolf, Saladin and Richard are really well made and fun to play against.+You don't have to train engineers in orded to make siege equipment, which was really boring in original SC (you can simply buy siege equipment in siege camp, which is more convenient)+Devs are still trying to patch the game  despite it's low popularity+Some good old music from original SC+Co-op mode kind of thingCons:-Bad looking buildings (most of them are just boxes and also farms, exept the hops farms are ugly as heck)-Badly animated AIs messages-Badly voiced AIs (i'm talking about Polish version here)-DLCs... although they contain really well made AIs i wouldn't spend 5$ for each of them.-You can't sustain on the battlefield with little, low populated castle, you pretty much can not go below 50 peasants, unless you are playing against Rat.Overall, this game is much better than people draw it to be...but if you are not into Stronghold series, i don't think you will be happy with this game (lack of story in campaign sadly and mutiplayer is not the best option for a newb)			"

												And somehow all the ratings for my review is gone. Wellplayed Firefly!I am sorry the language i use here but i hope it got the devs attentions and i just want another true Stronghold game to be made again!PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,  from Humble Bundle for 6 EUR i got this game and about 7-8 other games including Prison Architech which is of great value. Basicly i spent 0.6 EUR for this game and i am still having a bit  of a regret. Why ?This review is for the ones who played and love the old Stronghold Crusader and still wonder if you should return to the beloved franchise with  Crusader 2 ! If you are new to the stronghold franchise and only played  stronghold  since Stronghold 2, this is not the review you should read.Now i only played this game for 7.2hrs and some might say it's not enough to judge the game but for me it's enough to compare it with Crusader 1. Let's start with the cons first:- The game was released on Sep 23, 2014 . I did not buy it despite being a huge stronghold fan because It simply does not worth the asking price and the graphic was bad and there was way way too many bugs. Two years later, you would expect the devs to spent the last 2 years polishing the game right ? Nope!- The graphic is still very very bad: Do not believe those beautiful screenshots, the game does not look that nice in action.- The game is still poorly optimized: Having a high-end pc and the game still have this drops from 60fps to 30-40 every 5-7 mins. (auto save can cause that too but i already disable it)- The camera control is awful: you move using the WASD key and you would expect to rotate the camera using the middle mouse or maybe Q or E ? NOPE! hold Alt+A/D to rotate! Who does that really ? It's akward as hell!- Remember the knights that you hate, the ones your friends used to rush and use them to mow down your buildings while you hopelessly defend with a few weak archer with no way to pierce those thick armours ? well do not worry cuz Firefly got your back, knights are now useless since they do not know how to destroy a building.-I use to love having Horse archer as a horde of 100 or 200 just run 2 rounds around enemy's castle and just kill everyone. It's pure fun. But i guess Firefly figure since it's Crusader 2.0 they have make it feel different in order to be ""True to its roots "". How? Well horse archer are slow as hell now and the 100 or 200 horde is now pretty much useless with their poor accuracy or maybe because archers  can never miss while they are on walls now ?- Remember that clank sound when your fletcher put a new bow in your armoury? Remember when you could see those small weapons stash inside the building and the fun seeing them stack up for your troops ? Well they are gone!- Remember when you change the tax rate each peasant would react to it when you click on them? Or just a simple "" Mornin ur lordship!"" ? Well they are GONE! - In crusader 1 you can use Fear Factor to affect your peasants, you make them happy with decors around your stronghold, they are happier, doing less work but buff 25% hp of your troops or you scare the living hell of of them with those torture devices, forcing them to work 200% output but suffer the -25% troop hp debuff. Well it's gone too!    That system allows me 2 play style, 1 is the GOOD lord who LOVES his peasants, who make money by heavy taxing and even that out by making his people happy and love him and get that +25% Hp or be cruel, forcing 200% output labours and make money through selling goods. When you stock up on Armour, stone, Iron after 200 units or so you can sell them for more money. Well in Crusader 2 you can stock up 1000 and the price stays the same. So the only way to play is to kiss your peasants a#¤, make them happy and tax them. That's it, make money by taxing. - The thing that makes me stick to Crusader for 100+ hrs is its AI, they have personality, they are fun to fight against, they make you curse their name while they mow down your castle. Well this game introduce AIs both old and new and none of  them, I REPEAT, NONE OF THEM are fun to play with. The iconic Pig character is now locked behind a paid DLC. Really Firefly ? REALLY ? HAVE YOU GUYS CHECKED OUT THE RECENT COSSACK 3? It's the remake of their original COSSACK 1 and GUESS WHAT ?! THEY WILL PROVIDE PLAYER WITH 8......... that's right EIGHT free-LC nations for player to play with and you... you have the guts to ask us to pay 5 euros for 2 AIs ? REALLY ? Do you remember Marshal? The Sherriff ? Those free AI that you gave us on your websites all those years ago ? Are you guys too greedy now ?- New units are fun to play with, I like the Ranger at lot but those new ones with AOE effects, it's not stronghold anymore .................. Say what you want about Laddermens and Seige Tower, but WHY WHY WHY would you left them out of the GAME ? Are you trying to ecourage the 20 catapult mow down anything strat ?-It's not a castle sim anymore . Instead it's a fast-paced RTS mix with a bit with castle sim.- And the economy is still unbalanced, after 2 years, wow, bravo you have out done yourself. Lets make this simple calculation between Crusader 1 and 2. Wood cutter hut and Wood camp, they both output the same amout of planks. In Crusader 1 you need 20 planks for a Mill, that number is x10 in Crusader 2. WOW. JUST WOW. I spend 10' early game struggling with woods, I never have to do that in Crusader 1...................-Where are my drunken peasants ? - Where is my patrolling headless knight ?- ""Here lies the poor bones of..."" yeah that's gone too!- You introduce the bulk traning in stronghold legend and now you went ""True to its roots"" by removingthat system ?Really ? - Buildings limits , Unit caps at 1000. Every stronghold have unit caps, Crusader have that too at about 2000+ but this means that if you try 1v7 AIs, you cannot win because you cannot scale your economy when your wood stock ran low all the time and it limits your building to 50.......... ""BUT IT'S Strategy"".............................for unit yes you have to plan your attack with only 125 troops at hand but really it's just to hide your engine limitation. -Also, your troops have brain dead AI............... I tried the good old destroy-their-gate-rush-100 swordmans. Guess what, even when you set the stance to Agressive, when you ask them to charge to the top of the keep, they simply walk down to destroy the buildings below only to get shot down by archers on the wall. It's suppose to be a keep rush. ""Well turn off the agressive stance"" you might argue, i tried that, and my swordmans just stare The Wolf in the face 1cm away from him ""just w8 till the player turn agressive stance on you old man!""- And the list goes on............The pros: - Havok Phyx (MUCH WOW).- It's in glorious 3D.- The tower shakes a bit when you hit it with a boulder.- ""True to its roots ""(bull""#¤t)- You can manage your economy easier now, you know how much your people eat per day and how much you make per day so you can balance that out. It's really neat. - The Church service system help buff your popularity though it's been there since Crusader 1, it's just more consistent now. - That's it, I cant really point out any good thing about this game....................Please Firefly, you tried with Stronghold 2, You experiment with Legend, You failed with Stronghold 3 and blaming the publisher, You self-publish the game now and is it any better ? NOPE!. I do not know what is your plan for 2017 but please return to the TRUE ROOT, not the crappy ""True to its roots "" above.Check out how they are doing it with Cossack 3, they are commited, they respect their fans. A simple Crusader Remasted to 3D. That's all i ask, not Stronghold 4 nor Legend 2 nor Crusader 3. Nope!			"

												This is my updated review for SHC2 after 3 patches and 100+ hours of gameplay...The name of the game should have the word"" redemption"" attached to the title because it is exactly that. Leagues better then SH3, better then SHL and a tad better then SH2.With the exception of a few crashes in multiplayer the game does run very well on my system.AMD 83508 Gigs Ram@1600Gigabyte HD 7870 2GBWindows 7/64While the graphics are not top notch nor cutting edge for a castle sim/medieval warfare title they{especially coming from a small gaming studio} are more then adequate.The gameplay is quite simple......Build a castle/ecomony as well as an army then go looking for something to kill. While the game is fun in single player i do consider multiplayer to be where its at and it is interesting seeing all the different build and play styles that players have to offer. The game while good is not perfect and still needs some small balance and bug issues addressed. Knights cannot cross bridges w/o dismounting their horses which is odd considering that trebuchets can and they weigh more.Multiplayer also needs some small balancing issues as it stands right now it is way to easy to get a thriving economy using candles/bread/ale. Dervishes also seem to be a bit OP.Ideas for the future....As far a s DLC goes a European map pack/unit pack would be something i would definetely get behind. More lush green forested maps......longbowmen possibly added as a unit.For my review after 100 hours of gameplay and 3 patches i hereby give SHC2 a....8.3/ 10Depending on future updates/DLC this number can easily rise.

												Well this game was a bit of a let down for me. I enjoyed playing the first one and bought this game when it came out. It felt just like playing the orignal. All that has changed is the graphics and slight gameplay tweaks that were problematic in the original. Other then that its exactly the same game. Only their are more people playing this one in multiplayer but I am sure that will die out as their is little that is enticing to the repetative gameplay. Key bindings is a huge downfall I really would like to customize my key bindings to optimize my gameplay but I have not figured out how. Its not in the options page (first place you would think to look...) If you like the first one and own it dont bother paying for this because its exactly like the first one. I have not played any multiplayer matches to me a game should hold its own in singleplayer and branch from there. Game is unpolished and lacks replayability. Overall 3/10 in my opinion			"

												5 hours into single player campaign and some skirmish and I'm loving SC2. A vast improvement on the devastatingly disappointing Stronghold 3. Yes, it's quite different from Stronghold Crusader, and it's probably more user-friendly for newcomers to the series, which is fine by me. As far as building castles and invading other's castles goes, this is the dogs ballistas.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Stronghold series. Please keep the games coming :)... I do however have a small concern with the balance of the AI on Stronghold Crusader 2. I am mainly a single player person and prefer to play skirmishes with computer lords (AI) only. I have noticed during games with computer lords that the computer lords are able to spend/use gold and resources which they do not even have stored!! This makes playing with AI a little unbalanced and unrealistic :(. This was not the case in the first Stronghold Crusader. To give you an example, at the beginning of skirmishes with computer lords you can see them training troops and completing walls with little to no stone in their stockpile and even with the starting resources set to Low. It also makes it difficult to win sieges in 1v1 matches vs AI as they can immediately rebuild their castles with no stone at all!! Computer lords can attack with very expensive and tough troops during the first 5 minutes of the game due to this....I enjoy the game, I just believe in keeping it fair. Please look into this issue for a loyal customer. Thanks!			"

												On one hand, it's filled with the sort of sh*t that I've come to expect from Firefly.On the other, it's the best that Firefly did with the Stronghold series since the original Stronghold Crusader.It ain't perfect, even after 4 DLCs still has some annoying bugs, the AI models and messages are completely uninspired, based on over the top stereotypes and the food economy seems to always be either ""BREAD BREAD"" or ""Buy enough apples for 1/2 rations"". On the upsides however, unlike the trainwreck that is Stronghold 3 it's quite playable and has surprisingly well balanced military troops, where no single unit can be considered useless. The AI does also put up much more of a challenge than in the previous games in the series and multiplayer potential is quite high.I say go grab it on a discount, expect as little as you can and you will not be disappointed. Approach it as you would anything that Firefly made.			"

Then to top it off they generally have a major resource, gold, and map advantage.  I got this as part of a bundle and even I feel I paid too much for it.			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is a worth sequel. It had some bugs and crashs at start which got fixed soon. The integration into steam and its workshop is a nice feature.To the game: The ""campagin"" has sadly no real story and it is just skirmish maps. To be fair, crusader 1 was the same.The unit balancing is well made and this game needs more strategy thinking because of the special of the units. It is not just possible to spam one or two unit types to win.I played over 270h now and still like it and it makes fun to play it in multiplayer.			"

												For the longest time, I've ignored the ""cheating"" AI because I actually enjoyed the game. How ever I had something happen that I just cant ignore anymore when it comes to cheating AI... The AI built a siege camp right where my wall was, it made the wall disappear and they were able to come in as they wanted. I now longer recomend this game because of this even tho I still like the game.evidence of my issue - 


well now i have just lost faith in this game

												For those coming from the multiple years of playing Stronghold: Crusader and all its variations, (HD, Extreme) This game fails on what could've been something so much more. Overall, FireFly really just took the game into a different, unsuccessful direction that cripples the game from the start. The failures of this game pile up the longer you play, and you won’t be playing for long. Most of the positive reviews are from players who have never touched Stronghold:Crusader before, and are probably bots being spammed to promote sales. Almost all of the negative reviews you see for this game are from veteran players like myself whose hopes of seeing an even DECENT modern Stronghold game fade away. -What turns me off as a 10+ year Stronghold:Crusader player--Stronghold:Crusader 2 just doesn’t seem like a finished game. Animations aren’t complete, this is most noticeable when watching the Duc Volpe (The Wolf’s) message animations, which are well done and smooth, to the paper mache, 5 frame animation for Saladin. -The game is dumbed down. There are no more moats, engineers, fear factor, decorative items, or laddermen. -The UI is ugly, and appears rushed. This looks like anyone without decent drawing skills could have done the art for the menu screens/ The main menu screen in Stronghold: Crusader looks better than the main menu in 2. The lobby UI for multiplayer doesn’t even show other players in the lobby. While some details are cool, the overall vibe is Aladdin than a brutal strategy game set in crusader times. -The map sizes are so small, they counter this by slowing everyones economies down, to the point where its simply not fun because you have to wait forever to get resources. -Stronghold:Crusader had epic campaigns, and Stronghold: Crusader 2 can only offer 3-5 mission mini stories that don’t feel as grand or as impactful as the original.-The gameplay is slow. This is due to the horrendous changes they made to building costs. 20 Wood for an apple farm is reasonable, but 60 wood for a dairy farm? 100 wood for a mill? How are people supposed to develop economies without falling asleep? You are guaranteed to spend all of your starting gold on wood, or die due to you being crippled by having to wait 10 minutes to collect 100 wood.-Castle building was thrown out the window. This is primarily due to the small map size and new clunky and slow resource mechanics. There are two wall options, thin and regular, and considering how weak walls are, if you want an enclosed keep, you have to spend at least 500-1000 stone, which by the way, will take you half an hour to accrue. -While the graphics are nice, you would be better off playing Age of Empires 3. Those are the primary concerns with the game. Bad gameplay, slow economy development, bad and ugly UI, and an unfinished feel, this game robs hopes of FireFly every making something as epic, or downright fun to play as Stronghold, and Stronghold:Crusader. This game is a horrendous attempt as a successor, and many veteran players would gladly go back to playing the original than wasting their time with this unfinished mess.The anger and frustration in this review comes from the countless failed attempts FireFly has made. Stronghold 2. Stronghold 3, and now Stronghold:Crusader 2 are miserable failures, and it’s hard to comprehend why nothing has changed regarding the production of these sequels to the God-Games, Stronghold and Stronghold:Crusader. $50 is theft for an unfinished game that would never sell if it didn’t have the Stronghold name. I wouldn’t even play this game if it was free. 0/10. For $50, they are stealing money from hopeful fans. There is nothing fun or exciting about this game. You are better of buying Stronghold:Crusader HD.			"

												I've been a Stronghold fan since the begining. The original Stronghold was one of the first PC games I ever played. Crusader was one of the first games I ever wasted months of life addictively playing. And it's been all downhill from there. Stronghold 2 and Legends were both horrible. Stronghold 3 was respectable attempt at a game, but still it fell way, way short. And then we come to this. Stronghold Crusader 2 might be one of the biggest letdowns of my gaming life. Firefly has officially ruined their Stronghold franchise. They nuetered Castle Building. They threw troops out of balance. They took the balance out of the economy. Building up your economy is so quick and lacking in challenge that its turned tedious and boring. The game almost completely lacks a ""story mode"". The campaigns they do have are a quick joke. And, from what I think I'm observing, All of the single player campaing content is offered as 6 dollar chunks of DLC. It shouldn't matter though, because stronghold is all about skirmishes right? Well they've screwed that up aswell. Their maps all suck. Even the maps that echo some of my favorite Crusader maps are completely ruined. The only maps that are any good are player made, and at least we get workshop to facilitate that(this might be the ONLY thing you could call an improvement over the original crusader). Seige equipment and the whole ""seige camp"" approach over the old engineers guild is garbage. Seige units suck and their too expensive, but simultaniously present themselves as the only way to take on a well built castle which leads me to another thing. You produce way too much, and way too quickly, for the frankly tiny troop caps ive experienced so far. I was, in my second attempt at a skirmish, able to produce enough resources to churn out armies as big as the 250-300 what ever unit cap every 5-7 minutes or so(limited only by how quickly peasants become available). And yet that same army doesn't stand a chance against even a computer oponent unless you pick at them with archers and seige quipment for 15 minutes first. Which the latter makes sense, but if I'm producing resource as quickly as I am, I want to be able to use them to throw 2-3000 unit army at someones walls and watch the world burn. But no. In short, don't buy it, even if you want to complete your steam collection like I did. This game is garbage. You will not get 3 hours of quality entertainment out of it. And it will stain your respect for Firefly and the franchise.			"

												For someone who's first ever game on the PC and with a love of medieval warfare and so on. The Stronghold franchise is one I have stood by through everything. Sure, there are new, more technical, more advanced games now, with new technology but you can't compare an FPS to a strategy. I started with Stronghold 2 and have played every other game since. You may have seen a lot of negative reviews on Stronghold Crusader II, allow me to counter those reasons.""It's completely different to the first one""- It isn't 'completely different' at all- It has NEW features and units, it would be different- The whole point of a NEW game is that it isn't 'identical' to the previous, why would you buy a sequel that was exactly the same?""It's poorly optimised""- I can run this game in 1080p and keep a solid 60FPS in most cases with all my settings on medium. I have a 3.1GHz processor and a discrete GPU, come on- They recently released a new patch with a huge bunch of optimisation tweaks""I hate it, so will you""- Possibly the most ignorant review ever- If you like Stronghold 2 and you like Stronghold Crusader, you will most likely enjoy this tooThe new features really appeal to me. Not just in-game but lobby personalisation. Allowing you to set certain tradable goods, peace time, teams etc. Sure these were available in Stronghold 3 but the options are far better now.If you are a lover of the Stronghold franchise, then give this game a chance. It's well worth the money, I assure you :)			"

												Stronghold Crusader II asks you a lot of questions. Should I Invest in Iron? should I have Arabic Troops or English? where will my walls be best defended? and what resources do my allies have? The Campaign Is interesting But real strategy lies in skirmish mode. Strategy I have not seen in a lot of games these days. A avid fan of stronghold 1 and crusader I have spent countless hours into those games. I feel the same strategy applies here. Not to mention castle raids feel epic. tower collapse and enemies fall from them. Its everything I wanted from a stronghold remake. If your a fan of medieval warfare I greatly recommend. stacking is a bit weird and AI is not perfect but It feels like a stronghold game should. not like 2 and 3 and that weird one where there was magic and monsters???Stronghold crusader 2 is a must for anyone looking to strategically defend and build a functioning castle in the heart of the crusades.

												Is it great?-noIs it bad?-noIs it mediocre then?-yesSoo it's pretty much Stronghold Crusader at the roots. But a tad more simplified. Graphics are meh(probably to help when your army gets bigger). Sound is good. Gameplay misses some SHC I stuff.Would I reccomend it?-yes and noWhat do I mean by yes and no?-I'd reccomend the game to players new to the series, Might help them learn the system faster. Also to nostalgic fans of the series that can stand a dumbed down yet more balanced Stronghold game.-I wouldn't reccomend it to die hard fans of the series.Pros:-easier to learn and a bit more intuitive-glorious 3D graphics(he he)-It's a castle management game-it's a tad more balanced than the old one.Cons:-UI gets smaller on higher resolutions(you need to have good eyes to play @4k on a 28inch display.-UI is also a bit ugly-low quality textures.-Not really that classic Stronghold feeling but still has the roots.

												I thought that Stronghold Crusader 2 would have been a good game as the developers could have remedied the issues that came up in Stronghold 3 and applied it to this game. My hopes have been let down yet again. There is an insane amount of lag like Stronghold 3, when you click on the icons they do not always respond, when you mouse over the icon information like cost and materials does not always pop up, I have had buildings vanish as though I never built them even though the materials are gone, and too many other problems to count. I have wasted my money yet again on this game series. Never again. To hell with those that made this game and to hell with those that gave birth to them. I would recommend spending your hard earned money on something better.			"

												First off, I'm a HUGE fan of the Stronghold series. Probably one of my all-time favorite RTS games. Stronghold Crusader was one of my all-time favorite games too. Crusader 2, in my opinion is not as good as the original, but still just as much fun. The DLC: The Princess and the Pig added maps, achievements, new characters and a new skirmish trail and added an addition to this game. I usually play through the skirmish trails and single player skirmishes with the AI. I also tried multiplayer and thought it was a lot of fun. I would definetely say this is worth the $50. Don't listen to the nay-sayers, this is a great game and I think its worth every penny. 9/10. Worth buying			"

												It is very hard for me to review this game, if it comes to physical engine this game is great, same with graphics, but you can see flaws very quicly on game mechanics, AI who have unfair advantage over player, multiplayer which should support 8 players but to this day it is optimised only for 4 players. Soldiers having trouble in pathfinding.There are way more flaws, but there was one thing which forces me to write this negative review. Despite having a lot of bugs, dev's focused on releasing DLC's for quite big sums of money, instead of fixing major bugs.To sums everything up: Game is great, but amount of bugs and releasing DLC's instead of fixing those bugs make this game giant step backward in franchise. At least is somewhat better than Stronghold 3.			"

												Singly the largest disappointment in distant memory.  I’m a longtime fan of the Stronghold franchise, boy is this game a letdown.    It does have nice graphics, descent sound track and a somewhat intuitive interface, but the game SUCKS!  I’ve played about halfway through the anemic single player campaign, to the point of forcing myself to continue; thinking it has got to get better, but it has not.  There is not AI strategy to speak of and I guess the game developer thought it would be a good idea to slap a turn timer on just about every mission; so much for taking your time and enjoying the game.  I wish I could get my money back, not only because the game play is terrible, but more so, that this team of developers don’t unleash another POS on the public.  Tic-Tac-Toe is a better game.			"

Though I’ve read it only happens to people to use AMD cores it needs a lot of work to run better and I wouldn’t recommend this game to someone until the problem is fixed. I can play WoW and diablo 3 on max graphics while doing just about anything else and it doesn’t even phase my computer but as soon as i start to play SHC2 all of my cores spike and the game begins to lag intensely. I look forward to you all fixing the problem, though if you don't i probably will no longer purchase games from any of you.			"

												True to its roots and resurrected in a 3D engine. This game adds more varied unit types over the first Crusader but it is unfortunate they couldn't do more with the new game engine. This Stronghold surpasses Stronghold 2 when it comes to skirmishes - with a pretty good selection of maps, a slew of relatively interesting AI's, and a chain of increasingly difficult skirmish challenges. Unfortunately, a lot of the great castle sim features of Stronghold 2 are absent. In fact, even the castle management parts of SHC have been ""dumbed down.""  "

Shronghold Crusader 2 is a complex-er , better looking *ahem* EXTREMLY better looking, game that is very fun. Learning different strats for different spawing conditions is apealing to me.

Comparing this with the original, I still prefer the original but this is a more refined version that I will certainly continue playing.

The AI is the best ever seen in a Stronghold game and the graphics are far superior. The new map editor allows the creation of great maps and I have spent 60+ hours on that alone.Warning, do not buy this game if you want a strong campaing, there is only a series of skirmishes and very little/no story line. Also like the earlier stronghold crusaders there are no foods for feasts, and criminal punishments, so do not expect those, as they are special to the Stronghold games NOT Strongold Crusader.9/10			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is yet another attempt by Firefly Studios to capture the success of the old cult hits Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader. Yes, yet another - there have been three other installations that tried exactly that and failed hard. But as the old saying goes, third time's the charm... err, fourth time's the charm. Or, after the third time, a desert setting's the charm?Not really.The appeal of the original Stronghold and its standalone addon, Stronghold Crusader, was pretty clear. Unlike other RTS games at the time, it was very focused on style and believability, building a nice looking castle, seeing its populace bustle about as they produced goods. The block size for a wall was about 1x1m which was great for making highly individual castles.Sadly the devs don't seem to understand that, and to my understanding, they've been trying to make the Stronghold games more like other RTS, at the expense of the small details that I loved the original games for.Stronghold Crusader 2 is no exception for that. The block size for walls chunky, which doesn't exactly allow for sophisticated castle building. Towers don't seem to fit in very well. Many aspects were ""gamified"", defensive siege weapons for example work without a crew and are moving magically. Siege camps are built inside your castle instead of in front of the enemy, and immediately churn out catapults like in something like AoE. Also, many production chains were simplified.Immersion took a second or third place to so-called ""playability"", perhaps to make it faster, more appealing to RTS fans.Except those still won't touch this game with a 10 foot pole. The way units are produced, buildings are built, repairs are done instantly, the lack of fog of war and many of the other shortcomings just don't make for very good RTS gameplay.For the rest of us, the whole immersion aspect went down the drain.Personally, there is something else that quite annoys me about this game. Thing is, Stronghold Crusader was a standalone extension to Stronghold, which meant that a lot of aspects were simply copied over. For example, most buildings still had the same cost in wood, even though they're made of stone, which also makes more sense to use in a desert environment. Also, Arabian units felt very ""tacked on"", as they cost money instead of requiring weapons and armor. And even though the whole setting screams for two factions, all players had the same available buildings and units, with only the lord looking different.Stronghold Crusader 2 not being an addon to anything else, I'd have expected it to fix these issues. But it didn't.Furthermore, this game is a technical mess. There is no borderless windowed mode, no anti-aliasing. SSAO produces ugly scan lines all over the screen. Performance tanks once a game picks up some action. The AI is garbage, your allies will constantly demand goods from you from the first second. There are bugs all over the place, some that I noticed when it released 2 years ago. And with all that, it still has the graphics of an ancient game. Look at Company of Heroes and this, and tell me that one came out 8 years before the other.Last but not least, I'd like to give a honorable mention to the completely horrendous art in the game's menus. The average 15 year old on DeviantArt could draw something better.			"

												Had a lot of fun playing Co-Op! I think they did a great job with the game. Some requests. So far not one bug. It's NOT SH3 again.I played Co-Op with a friend on Multiplayer and had a blast. I think they did a great job and it takes me back to the begining days of the first one (minus the moats :p). It was fun playing as long as we were on voice chat. Not sure how you could possibly play Co-Op without talking to eachother. One person handled the logistics and the building, while I handled the military aspects. I also built all the miltary devices I needed and they built the walls. I would simply state I need gold for x and wait for my partner to grant it to me.Some minor things:I wish catapults would take out troops. Maybe it needs more testing but it seemed I couldn't use my catapults to take out troops.If you play as co-op on a single team and the host surrenders the game, the second person is left in the game and made host. I think that it should surrender your partner as well but there might be an argument for the way it is now.I would really like to play the Campaign on Co-Op. It would make for a more engaging game, as playing deathmatch gets old after awhile. I'd rather sandbox build with eneimes on the map or play the campaigns with a story line. That would be the ultimate. Over all I like the mechanics and the game play and the controls. I had no issues at all. It's definitely not SH3.			"

												Please.. I really like the game  but every time I play it it feels somehow unfinished...After almost finishing the campaign, with almost 50h spent which is way more then most people here have...To sum it up:+ Cool new AI+ Removed useless buildings+ Better unit balance- Crashes a lot (which is with the lags the main argument against this game)- you need to copy autosaves manually out of your Documents/Stronghold Crusader 2/Autosaves dir into the main folder- Lags (I can play GTA V on high)- Units do sometimes what they want.. run back to the group even when they have no formation- Units get stuck in gates -> you need to tell them again where to go- Wrong enemy unit numbers (when you toggle the greatest lord report / stat window)3 / 10They really need to update the game instead of releasing new dlc...

												Before seeing the not recommended, please read as there is much to talk about. Being such a fan from the Orginal Stronghold Crusader I saw this and bought it thinking it would be new and just as fun as the orginal, sadly I was misguided. The game wasn't even close to my expectations however it does bring back some stuff Iw as thankful for, such as Ai opponents I loved, skirmish mode and crusader trails. However it was missing lots and lots of things (overtiem these could be added) many siege equitments are gone in the game to name jsut one. The graphics of the game (personally) don't fit the experience. The troop cap is to little and the maps offer to little rescources (one map does but only 1 map, for noobs like myselft at Crusader 2 more maps with more rescources would of been better), in game map builder is gone and instead it is with steam level editor which is much more complicated for the AVERAGE person to use. The variety of the game gets dull quick and it doesn't flow very good (in my opinion). All in all I was disapointed with it and I would get it when it is on sale definately not worth $50 U.S. I give it 6/10			"

												Bought this game awhile ago from the Humble Bundle, thought it was really cool, but I couldn't make it past the learning curve. tbh, entirely my fault that I didn't play more. Tried to do too much, too quickly, and then couldn't make it through the tutorial because I already understood the basics that the first few missions teach you. It's like a more advanced version of Age of Mythology, if you're old enough to remember that game. Don't need a god computer to run it, does look like it was made in 2004 for me to be able to run it, but for me, that just makes the game better having everything look like polygons were thrown together into tree and human shapes.

It's a game that was built better 8 years ago.-Very buggy, will crash often for no apparent reason.-AI sucks. Will do the same thing over and over and over. Online play is ok minus the above. -Very shallow in terms of strategy, buildings and units.Overall, I was very disappointed in this release and would not recommend a purchase until heavily discounted.If you love strategy games as I do, you might get limited enjoyment out of it- just wait until the price drops below $20.

												Stronghold Crusader 2Stronghold Crusader 2 is the simplest of RTS games. It is the follow up to the critically acclaimed Stronghold Crusader and builds up on its predecessor. Stronghold Crusader 2 features all the elements you would expect from a game of its genre but nothing intuitive enough that you would be really amazed by. The singleplayer campaign is labelled as only a learning campaign but is unable to fulfil even that job. You play either as Saladin’s or King Richard’s forces against the other. The campaign does nothing else but pits large waves of enemy troops before you can keep up with your production. It is based as a multiplayer skirmish game and it suffices the job. In Stronghold Crusader 2, you start  by building your economy and building your troops. You need to attract to come and live in your keep by making buildings such as Inns and Temples. Once you set up the castle, you need to protect it and try to demolish your opponent’s at the same time. The maps available in Stronghold Crusader 2 are so small that you can literally see the other player’s progress at the same time. There are multiple choke points but these maps are prone to get very quickly rushed and that tactic is the only thing you will see players doing in the multiplayer. The no. of unit types available to you are very basic. There was not a single unit which I had not seen before in a RTS game. After the castle is set up and your economy is building itself, it remains but a match of who will produce faster. The only satisfaction comes from destroying the enemy castles with your siege weapons as your army can’t really get through the walls by itself. When you do demolish your opponent’s castle, it gives you a sense of achievement which is where the game shines the most.The visuals of Stronghold Crusader 2 are average to poor. There is no real variety in seeing units crashing against units. The building designs are  fairly simple but it looks really good once you have set up your keep and it is churning out units. What really makes Stronghold Crusader 2 fall is the amount of bugs it has. Enemy units plainly running in through the walls, frequent crashes and freezes are only some of them. It is wrong for me to expect them to patch up as it has been nearly 2 years since the game came out. Even then if you can look past the bugs and other problems, what awaits you is a fairly Run of the mill RTS game which may provide you with a couple of fun hours.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												     The only valid argument against this game that I can find is it's price and people having optimization problems, which I myself have suffered from but not severely. I'll agree with anyone who says that $50 dollars for this game is pretty steep, however If you get it while it's on sale I feel that it's completely worth buying. I have played Stronghold, Stronghold 2, and Stronghold Crusader. They are all really great games and I feel that this game is just as good as those.     Mechanics wise the only gripe I would have with this one is the way houses are made. The closer your house is to your Stronghold the more populated the house becomes, however it also increases in size, so therefore it costs more wood. This isn't a problem on big maps where you can build a house on the border of your territory and it only adds 2 to 3 peasants to your overall population and costs less wood, but in small maps it's difficult because you don't have enough room to make those smaller houses, and all of your houses end up being big with 6-7 more peasants added to the popultaion which naturally means you have that many more mouths to feed, so then you need more farms while the map already has little room to spare.Overall I give this game a 7/10 I really enjoyed it.

												We're looking for family co-op games to play.  This one is a lot of fun.Stronghold Crusader 2 is city building - RTS fusion that allows shared-control co-op.  Shared control co-op is a fantastic family experience.  It turns out that the women prefer to do the city building, and the guys control the army.  The game is intuitive and everything makes sense and is relatively straightforward to control, e.g., to increase happiness in your town provide enough food, lower taxes, and increase ale!While there are battles, it has the feeling of low level of violence.Please developers, make more of this type of shared-control co-op, family friendly games.It's even good single player.

												This game is a great addition to the stronghold series. While stronghold 3 was horrible, this game truly brought back the wonderful stronghold feel to all the players and fans of the series. The graphics are very good, the gameplay is fun and nostalgic, the amount of different units and buildings is quite amazing, and the amount of content is something to behold. While I cannot say I am a die hard fan of the game franchise, I can say that I have played all of the stronghold games and I have enjoyed them all very much and this one is by far a new favorite of mine. It'll keep the series alive. Also, many have said that the voice acting is bad: this is simply bull-sh*t. They used may of the same exact voice lines from the other games and added new ones for the new lords. The swordsmen still say ""our swords are yours!"", the macemen still say ""need some muscule?"", the archers still say ""our bows shall sing!"". They are the exact lines from the other games.One note though: I tried alt-tabbing out of the game for a minute and it crashed my pc. I thought it was just a fluke so I did it again a few hours later and it crashed my pc again. Serious problem there.			"

												This game is slightly disappointing to say the least. The first game, while lacking in good graphics had a LOT more options for castle building, and management.        For Example, you could choose what kind of ruler to be. Feared, or Loved. Choosing Feared meant having torture instruments placed around your castle, and having higher taxes. This would reflect on your peasants' attitudes toward you, making them less happy but more hardworking.       Choosing to have a more peaceful castle meant lowering taxes and having the option to places statues or flower gardens in your castle to make your peasants happier, but work less hard. Regardless this added a lot more immersion and made you really feel like a Ruler, instead of just the castle's contractor placing walls and buildings. While the graphics ARE indeed a large improvement, there seems to be a serious lack of unit types in this game.        Sure it has slaves, assassins, horses, archers and different types of swordsmen, but not much else other than the addition of the Sergeants, and conscripts (Crusaders) and the Whirling Dervishes (Arabic). I remember a time when we could make siege engineers at a Siege Guild building and have them man a variety of useful siege equipment, (Siege Towers, Ladders, Tower Defenses, etc)It is easy to tell this game was rushed, and doesn't offer much except for shiny new graphics and the same old ""Can't place that there m'lord"" voice in the sky. Please please please devs, give us more to manage/produce next time you plan on releasing a game. What we have now is terribly bland, and basically the same as the last game. (With the exceptions I've listed above. The other thing that really bugs me too is the lack of inventiveness on the devs part with the AI enemies. They have the same washed up foes we fought in the first game, and maybe a few more (that cost real money to have by the way). I think this is very unfair, and more should have been done before the initia release to introduce these new enemies beforehand so that we wouldn't have to cough up our precious cash to BUY them. I wish I hadn't. (P.S. Whoever animates your enemies when they talk to you makes me laugh every time at how bad they are) The map editor is very simple to use and create wonderful maps, however. But like I said before, there is not a lot to work with, and sometimes even mods can't fix that. If anyone reads this, I would really like to say I do recommend this game, however it doesn't offer much in the way of troop management and castle building, other than placing a few buildings, collecting resources, and making weapons/ale/candles/etc. I am sorry if you disagree with me, but it is how I feel on how this game turned out. On the plus side, I once watched a tornado rip through an entire force of enemy troops which totally saved my life by the way. Had a rough start.#RIPTornadoBro			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is a okay game. But there are some bugs still not fixed. The main reason i don't recommend this game are some missing features present in the original Crusader (HD) and the gameplay doesn't feel that amazing as it should for an Stronghold. If you want to buy it consider watching some reviews. Also the performance in the endgame can be better. Many people still have the bug if turned SSAO on there are some fine lines across the screen when you're scrolling. I think Crusader in it's HD remaster is still the better game overall. Graphics in SC2 are okay and the UI looks very good.Here are some pros at a glance♦ Solid graphics♦ Achievements♦ Nice UI♦ Refined multiplayer♦ Good mapsFor the AI ... i think there should be more enemies like in the old Crusader.

												I played the original HD remake of this game a while ago, and didn't really like the way the game functioned, comparing it to other similar medieval era strategy games, this one is very cut throat and I found it very hard to get into. Then there is the sequel, Stronghold Crusader 2, which is pretty much the same game in 3D... but a lot of feature have also been removed. I even got this on sale for something like 5 USD and I still don't think this game is worth it. Slow and tedious, if you enjoy having most of your production buildings far away from your base and being constantly raided with less features than it's predecessor then you might enjoy this.			"

												I bought the game and as soon as I saw that horrible intro video, I had a pretty good idea of how the game was going to be. The addition of a 3D interface was not neccessary, the art-style of the old games was perfect, and it has actually brought the gameplay backwards here. There is no evolution in any gameplay aspect. They weren't even able to make the battles seem larger and more intense than the first SH Crusader despite having squads instead of single units, and there are no tactics whatsover. It is really hard to grasp as to how this dev team has failed to make a worthy sequel after how good SH 1 and Crusader were with such simple technology and graphics. They clearly did not listen to their fans and instead tried to turn it into a mainstream series. Just a lazy and uninspiring sequel from Firefly and from what I can see it was not improved upon in any significant way in it's first year post-launch.  5/10			"

												Controlling troops is a little bit clunkier than other stronghold games so far, but it's fun to say the least. I have high hopes for this to become even better. It could easily become the best in the series with fine-tuning.			"

												A year later the game still sucks♥♥♥♥♥ Running it on a GTX 1080 still only hitting 30-40fps with constant lag that freezes the screen for a second. Graphics are terrible for such a taxing game, occasionally map bugs out goes black and frequent CTD. This game is not worth it. It does not live up to predecessors it was a rushed piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that should never of left development. Very disappointed i backed the development of this game.			"

												This game is very good by itself but there are some things.WARNING MOST OF CONS MIGHT BE FIXEDPros:More TroopsFun Multiplayer (Opinion)A CampaingMap EditorSteam WorkshopNew Systems of GameplayAnd maybe some mores things.Cons:Very Laggy even though it was on the store for a while.Glitches, well every game has some but this has some that can make you restart it.FireFly being very unfair, for example Ultimate Edition, its 80$ You get the Special Edition+All DLC+ ANOTHER COPY, Its just 20$ more the special edition, BUT GUESS WHAT is you already got the SPECIAL EDITION which was the best before the ultimate edition, You will have to spend 70$+ ON THE SAME THINGS! I would be pleased if they would let us get the ULTIMATE EDITION for 20$ Because FireFly is being somewhat unfair. Everyone would want tha because it just better. CONCLUSION:Firefly is just trying to suck all of our money with bad and unfinished games, like many other games. FireFly had great games if your a Stronghold fan like I am, go play some Stronghold 2/ Legends they might have no multiplayer because GameSpy also had enough of FireFly's♥♥♥♥♥♥ FireFly doesn't even fix it! FireFly puts too much money on making the games more ♥♥♥♥♥♥. You see that 50-80$ In your hand/ credit card? Go buy Stronghold Collection or Fallout 4, a much better use of money, UNLESS FIREFLY STOPS BEING A ♥♥♥♥♥ AND STARTS WORKING TO MAKE THIS GAME BETTER, NOT HORRIBLE MAKE THE PRICES FAIR AT LEAST, AT LEAST TO THE OLDER PLAYERS. Buy this game, ONLY AT YOUR ON RISK! And buy for it being popular, buy it if you think its good, I think Its good but you need a lot of ♥♥♥♥ing money.			"

												This game brings back so much Nostalgia! I used to play this game all the way back in 2004, when I was a young dude. The new version is just the old version but way better! New troops, new ways of attacking, new ways of planning your strategic approach! It's just better! Also with the new engine and touched up graphics the whole game is way more immersive. Blowing a wall to pieces with a trebuchet to see the archers fall off is just WAY too satisfying!			"

												This game is worse than Stronghold Crusader I. or I. HD because lots of things aren't in SHC2 from SHC1 and more things are from SH3 and this game is like a Stronghold but you can play Skirmish.... Nothing more to tell. Who played SHC 1 must know that this is terrible.... Players need more Crusader things no more things from Stronghold... Stronghold is totally some other game and mostly is missing right-click menu which was in SHC 1.Game:- unbalanced in economy- less buildings than in SHC 1- some bad animations- totally other controls than in SHC 1- No one like this sh**** zooming & map rotating- ??? weapon/armor system (better in Crusader #1)- more than 70% of this game is more worse than Crusader I.- when you don't need help, AI already defending your castle- when you play balanced game, Enemy AI already attacking you instead of attacking other allies, too.- you can't build walls/tower/etc. anywhere => you have given place where you can only build buildings and your castle like in a Stronghold 1-3- you can build building with catapults and rams everywhere on map- your army is recruited from Barracks instead of slaves' campfire (like in a SHC 1)- Better Graphics (99%)Rating:GameSpot: 6/10MetaCritic: 65/100GameWatcher: 8.0/10.0PC Gamer: 64%More here: PC Gamer SHC 2 Review○○○ Who wants to buy Stronghold Crusader game then I recommend Crusader #1 ○○○Stronghold Crusader #1 - Steam link: Crusader #1 "

YouTube™ Video: Stronghold Crusader 2 Hard Campaign - Preparation Part 1: Arrival 

			Views: 432		

			Stronghold 2 Crusader is a real time strategy game in which you have to create resources and use those resources to build units to kill the enemy's castle.		

Stronghold Crusader 2 is your classic siege RTS game.  It is like Stronghold Crusader in almost every possible way with some minor improvements to user interface and control.  Stronghold 3 was a buggy piece of crap, this by comparison is a masterpiece of a game.  It comes with a full campaign, a skirmish trial (similar to that of Stronghold Crusader), multiplayer, and computer skirmishing.  It is in fact a very full game.  Looking forward to DLC campaigns.

												NOTE: I played through a couple of the tutorial campaign missions and one and a half skirmishes.It's probably the best Stronghold out of the box since Stronghold Crusader, and while it adds some complexity with walls and building placement it doesn't have the depth of complexity that Stronghold 2 promised (and, thanks to bugs, took a hell of a long time to deliver).The Graphics aren't outstanding, and probably sit on par with Stronghold 3, while the sound design is probably the best in the series.This could be a lot, lot better. But having said that, it could be so much worse. If you want a taste of this, I'd recommend waiting for a sale, but you can easily buy worse games that cost more.			"

												Bought on steam sale.  At about 10 hours into it, I can say I do not recommend you waste your money.  It is extremely hard, which is sometimes rewarding.  The AI seems to collect resources without sources.  You can cut off their source of said items, but yet they can still spam.  I found the interface to be terrible, non-intuitive, clunky.  Rally points seem to hardly work, the users troops seem awfully ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ compared to the AI.  I've had to rely on various internet sources for information not readily found in the game itself. Overall, thumbs down and uninstalled.			"

												Stronghold Crusaders 2 somewhat fills the empty hallow that Stronghold 3 gave us. It does somethings well that older Stronghold fans like myself love, but FireFly Studios continues to fail to make a high quality Stronghold game since Stronghold 2 (My personal favorite, but the originial Stronghold is great of course). Pros:-Great soundtrack-Graphics are absolutely OUTSTANDING and the best they have ever been. I thought Stronghold 3's graphics were impressive but SC3 takes it to a whole new level! It seems that FireFly has put immensive detail into every buildings, character models, and textures. But the most coolest part about the graphics was that you see the farmers walk into the grainary and physically put the apples/cheese/meats inside in their proper place; even the most smallest of details amazes me-Some of the orginal voiceovers remain for the units inside the barracks (except the men at arms, they seem very unmotivated and poorly made).-My personal favorite part was that when you try to place a building that requires wood, the same man continues to tell you ""We need more wood!"" That has been in the game since Stronghold 2 and it is absolutely glorious! The best part was when he said ""Oh I give up"" he actually gave up, left, and never came back. I absolutely lost it.-The curtain walls return and it makes castle building fun as it should-Buildings take up MUCH MUCH less space than ever before! This means you have more room to work with and place more buildings.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-The absolutely dreadful housing system returns from Stronghold 3, which means the further you place a hovel from your keep, the less peasants you get. Which is absolutely annoying to play with when you want to play freeplay and make grand cities like before and all you can make are small huts that only support 2 peasants.-The Arabian voiceovers are abysmal. The older voiceovers from the original Crusaders were well made. These voiceovers sound like somebody just screamed random words into the microphone. It sounds made up and racist really. I don't speak the langauge but some more effort could of been put into it.-For some reason, Firefly will NEVER allow you to build walls or gate houses inside your estates. I never understood why. -Continuing with estates, for some reason in freebuild you can't even place buildings in them!! Even if you own it the game fails to put any buildings to enhance production or produce different resources!-The game seems to limit you like a parent forcing a curfew at age 22. Any sort of quarry or mine can only have a max of 4 ox teathers per building. This is extremely annoying especially if they have a long walk to the stockpile. The game is forcing me not to be able to maximize my resources. -You can no longer put Mangols or Billistas on top of your towers. Instead you spend more wood resouces to put them on a half-fasted wooden platform. Which it looks ridiculous and poorly made. The design of this is awful.-For some reason you can't place a carters post. The only have prebuilt ones for you during freebuild, but thats it. Really disappointed in that.------------------------------------Final Verdict: Barebones CrusadersThe game isn't bad, HOWEVER its far from good. The game feels much better than Stronghold 3 and has caught my attention much longer as well. BUT ITS NOT WORTH 49.99USD. Please, do not buy this game for that much, you're EXTREMELY overpaying for this title. If you're itching to play it, go buy it on a sale. But not at full retail. You can wait to buy it. But overall, its a solid playing experience.			"

												7 out of 10 stars.Pros:+ More army types+ More buildings+ Army formationsCons:- Bad graphics- Right now some bugs do exist (e.g. my assassins couldn't climb the enemy walls in critical battle)Remarks:Gameplay has changed a little bit because of some new buildings and army types, though it's ok when you get used to them. The old-gold tactics still work, and I could win with fast assassins at start like in previous games. But some of the old tactics will ot work because of the changes, so you should be ready to learn/think about new tactics. Anyway, right now (apr 2, 2016) I would not buy the game and would wait until it gets better.			"

												I actually really like this game mostly for the reason that it is one of the few games that combines city building and RTS gameplay together well.  In most other RTSs you just have buildings that are related to the military aspect of you base.  Here you actually have to manage things that don't directly relate to the military and I think that adds some much needed depth.  Now yes, the game lacks a certian amount of polish, however if you're looking for something that blends City Building and RTS gameplay together well, this is certainly scratch that itch.			"

												Stop, dont go any further. If you were considering this game wether it is worth a purchase. Ill tell you right now, it is definitely not.Its a piece of trash garbage game that was forcefully defacated unto the faces of its true loyal supporters and fan base, the people who brought you the orignal Stronghold that was beloved and missed were long gone during the unholy birthing of this atrocity.I have played and deconstructed every stronghold and dozens of rts games back in the day and know what it was about each game that people adored and what it was that people despised. Stronghold Crusader 2 is the 8th game out of the franchise and a sequel to a release that came out 12 years ago, despite the huge gap between the 2 games. It is unquestionably clear that the predecessor is the better game out of the 2.Newcomers to the Stronghold franchise may not be able to tell the severe lack in development, innovation and progress within the newer titles and most of the old core supporters and fans of the series are overwhelmingly biased and blinded by nostalgia to properly give a straight and honest answer/review of the game.This is where i come in, i payed full price for this indie developed garbage that was spewed out by a studio that was on the brink of bankruptcy. I was one of those loyal supporters, i remembered when the developers required financial help and requested their fanbase for financial support to fund the development of the game.And when the day came, Crusader 2 was launched. Thankfully it fared better than Stronghold 3, it wasn't a horrendous glitchy bug filled infestation that its older brother was.It was fairly polished and seemed decent at the time, only to realize that a decade wide gap between predeccessor and successor was closed and fully explored in less than 10 minutes... 10 MINUTES!There is literally almost nothing new about Crusader 2, it is the most barebones sequel to have ever been developed. It has the most reused and recycled content and material out of any video game i have seen.-Units-Dialogue-Buildings-Combat-SountracksSountracks are unremarkable, graphics are a joke and despite sticking to a simple 3d game engine the game is poorly and laughably optimized.For 15 ♥♥♥♥ing years this franchise has been around and yet we see the same ♥♥♥♥ing basic units in every single game, ♥♥♥♥ing archers, spearmen, macemen, and swordsmen.Archers, spearmen, macemen and swordsmen, again, again, again and again.There is no variation, the game is deprived of creativity and has been picked bone dry.The developers had a true and rare 2nd chance to re-spark and breathe new life into the franchise, Steam is a good and cheap platform for them to launch their game and they could have followed up on issues and add on future content and it was a great way to receive feedback and ideas to help the game grow and develop.But once again. They proved their inabilty to give a ♥♥♥♥ and they took the fans money and ♥♥♥♥ed right off, they could have made the game better with proper dlc, instead of adding much needed new units, soundtracks, buildings, mechanics, animals, maps, storyline, diplomacy system.They just added apparently new enemy characters with different castle designs and a change in tactics and military approach. It is almost inhumanly inconceivable as to how little of an effort the studio put in, in order to crank out these pallete swapped enemies for the dlcs.Despite being the latest installment for the stronghold series, Crusader 2 will only future a handful of new units:-Sasanid Knight-Templar Knight-Sergeant At Arms (Status effect unit: Buffs Armour)-Conscript-Ranger (Hybrid Unit, archer+swordsmen/ costly and ineffective)-Slave Driver (Status effect: Buffs Slaves)-Healer-Whirling Dirvish (Employs the strategy of a 5 year old to deal damage)(Has 2 swords and spins in circles)(facepalm)(OP,pls nerf)This may seem alot to the uninitiated but it does not come close to the content value and depth of previous titles.Economy and production are nearly identical to previous titles, it has not been tweaked or improved upon over the 10 year period. Just slapped on with new paint and good to go for the next new release.Castle life simulation has been dialed down to non-existant, no morality system nor a justice system. Stronghold was inaddition to being an Rts game was also a castle sim. To simulate life in a castle, which Crusader 2 does not have... at all.It abandoned that aspect of the game altogether cause it hopes to deliver a more combat and military focused gaming experience which it also fails miserably since Crusader 1 could provide both without issue and due to the mind numbingly dull and poorly balanced units and unit variety.Sync kills animation is not something to be seen here, only present in total war and dawn of war at the moment.Building variety has also been carried over from the previous title, each building has been redesigned ofcourse but the function and purpose remains unchanged.There is no new buildings to be built and there is no variety for the current existing buildings.Also buildings are still built instantly, i will let this one slide since Stronghold has been doing that since 2001, but for some reason it just looks weird seeing square 3d buildings magically manifest and appear out of nowhere in Crusader 2.Castle towers feel like there are made out of styrofoam and walls feel like they are mostly composed off millions of lego pieces, seeing that a single catapult is more than capable of demolishing a 10 layer thick wall. Why bother?Castles can only be built by 1 type of stone, no wooden walls or wooden garrisons nor any upgrade or improvement systems for structures.Castle traps are lack luster and shamefully lacking compared to its predeccesor Stronghold Legends.Farming buildings remain unchanged the basic 4 foods are still around: bread, fruit, meat, cheese. There is no variation with each food either and production for consumables remain the same. 4 farms, a baker and a windmill is all you need and is all thats available to you.I would continue to♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game but there isn't much to♥♥♥♥♥♥on to begin with, everythings the same. Everything that was good was left out and everything that was added in and remained was lackluster, uninspired and resonates tedium.The devs didnt even bother to further optimize the game to enable those with weaker lower end pcs to be able to play smoothly. Even with graphics set to lowest frame rates were still choppy, inconsistent and unstable. Gameplay is a joke for a game that was released in 2014. Do your self a favour and do not purchase this game, i wish i had written this review sooner. Do not trust any reviewer or any fan that says this is an 8 out of 10 game. ITS NOT.To the uninitiated it should not be scored higher than a 5.5 out of 10 let alone 8, and if you are a die hard Stronghold veteran like my self who is not blinded by nostalgia, you will know what Stronghold could have been and what Stronghold was, and that this shameless piece of thrash is deserving of nothing more than a 3.5 out of 10.FINAL VERDICT: Roomies with Stronghold 3 in video game hell.DONT BUY IT!

												I thought ""it can't be that bad"" but it is. Huge step back in the series. Buggy, ugly, has an overwhelming unfinishd feel. At first I thought that I accadently got a beta version. Game play simplified so much that it basically plays its self. Lost all fun in the game. I won't be getting another stronghold again. Stronghold 1 and 2 worth so much more. Please save your money. Even if it's 99% off, go buy a candy bar.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game is fine. If you haven't played any of the other Stronghold games, this is a good place to start. It is a really good castle building sim. However, being a person who played the previous games in the series, I was disappointed with the game because there were hardly any changes with the gameplay. The graphics are nice but in my opinion it is not worth the $50 price tag.			"

												A real letdown of a game that also has the balls to have so much DLC. Everything feels so much slower, unbalanced, and just plain lacking compared to the first stronghold and crusader games. Some buildings cost an unreasonable amount and produce so slowly. An easy tactic is to just use mercs and wreck those buildings early on, crippling your enemy for good. Woodcutter camps cost wood to build. Anyone see a problem with that? There isn't much in the sense of castle defenses either. Hoardings are insanely expensive, there are no logs to drop and take advantage of physics, build space tends to be tiny, you can't place siege weapons on big towers anymore (they're a fragile automated tower unit now), some units are insanely strong... it's just a real mess.

												STAY AWAY IF YOU RUN WINDOWS 10!I bought the bundle this weekend when on sale. I am running windows 10 and cannot get a SINGLE title from this bundle to run properly or even at all! Crusader II runs, but i have the option of a BIG  UGLY 1024x768 resolution...OR... as firefly's support says I can DELETE my options.xml file EVERY TIME, BEFORE I FIRE THE GAME UP, to reset it to whatever my desktop resolution is. But then, when you exit the game, it re-writes the options file to the messed up settings and you start at square one again. LOL!!!!That solution they provided merely makes the game run the same resolution as your desktop for THE FIRST TIME ONLY (as it recreates the options.xml file AGAIN). BUT THEN... sure its at 1920x1080 and looks to be all good but the MOUSE IS THEN OFFSET by like 10 pixels DOWN and to the RIGHT of every button in the game!!!!!!! You have to actually NOT point at buttons/things and PURPOSELY click in the wrong spot on the screen to make them click! Ridiculous!!!Very frustrating. But it doesn't end there! The OTHER 2 titles that come with this awesome sale bundle price of $60(sarcasm there folks) do not run on windows 10 AT ALL!Both Crusader HD/Extreme HD TRY to install ""game ranger"" (REALLY? FREAKING GAME RANGER?? for multiplayer???) Give me a break!  Anyway, the gameranger install crashes because of a .NET Framework issue with compatibility in windows 10. So then the install process just crashes over and over again... the BOTTOM LINE IS...NOT ONE SINGLE TITLE IN THIS BUNDLE WOULD RUN AFTER more than 3 hours of my time trying to hunt down solutions for these problems only to find out ... there ARE NO LEGITIMATE SOLUTIONS AT THIS TIME. ***Not satisfied to say the least!***I requested a refund of course!

												As a longtime fan of the original Crusader, I always knew that I would buy this game be it good or bad. While loading it up, I was prepared for the worst (based on the mediocre Stronghold 2 and disastrous Stronghold 3 release) but after playing for a few minutes I was surprised at how much I was enjoying it. Crusader II fully flushes out what they were trying to do with the Stronghold 3 economy. Every building in the game is expensive yet does its job well, meaning you'll constantly be weighing different strategies. Limited oasis space makes these decisions even more difficult yet rewarding. Is it better to tie up valuable space with hops farms to create ale, or make candles safely within your castle but then spend the resources on the much more expensive church? Of course, you have to defend yourself from constant attack while making these decisions.The greatest improvement in this game over the original is the difficulty. While not being at all welcoming to newcomers of the series, veterans should be pleased at how much time you (usually) have to invest in every match before claiming victory. The AI attacks early and often, and truly grows stronger as the game progresses (much stronger). They know how to defend themselves as well. Compared to the original, you will need a much larger army to kill your opponent with a single siege. This review is already longer than I intended but I have to touch on the combat balance as well. It is exceptionally well done. Every unit has a clear purpose and fills that role well while ignoring all other tasks. Archers, for example, are excellent against non-armoured units but next to useless against swordsmen (especially if they are escorted by a sergeant) and even conscripted peasants with pitchforks kill them easily with melee. I could come up with an example for every unit type but that would be redundant. Suffice it to say, the combat feels excellent.With more enemy lords and campaigns being added down the road, this is definitely the game I have been waiting 12 years for.			"

												New Stronghold games are not getting much positive reactions, and for Stronghold III I can only say that I agree with that. Now however, Stronghold Crusader II is not that well received either, which is not just. For a successor of Stronghold Crusader I, this is just a decent game. Why?-Decent graphical updates-Lots of free content, many campaigns-New units and buildings-More advanced AI-Many detailed improvementsNow, sure, there are some cons as well. There still could be more variety in castle structures, controls are not always in favour of the player and eventhough it got a nice graphical update, it still is behind on the latest standard. Nonetheless, it is just a fun game. It makes you relive the Stronghold Crusader nostalgia, and the campaign makes you lose track of time.			"

												(Be aware, I am new to the series, this brush doesn't stroke the other titles)This was one of those few games I'd constantly see either on sale or at the forefront of my store page. During the sale some month ago, I gave in and purchased it, having heard good things about the franchise. Although the generalised rating for this title in particular was 'mixed' at the time - note, this hasn't changed - I was curious to try it out. I'm a big fan of RTS games, ranging from CA's Total War, to Age of Empires, Supreme Commander, and even as far back as Emperor: Battle for Dune. This seemed to be a bit of a different take on the genre and this also spurred my intrigue.Let me begin by telling you that my experience was mixed, much the same as the score status. But even though I enjoyed the game itself, I cannot recommend this. My reasoning comes down to technical issues and performance.I thoroughly enjoyed the core gameplay, what very little of it I experienced anyway. The population/town management was fun, the combat wasn't too fancy, but enjoyable, and the soundtrack wasn't awful either. The Scribes voice becomes a bit obnoxious but he's handy to have around.No, my issue comes with the games performance; visual artefacts like horizontal lines with certain settings enabled. A poor framerate (25fps average on a rig that can run The Witcher 3 at 1440p 50-60 fps), and game stutter. I'm not the only case for these problems, a quick online search yields a plethora of cases of others experiencing the same issues, some offer 'fixes' others are yet to be answered. Ranging from Steam launch options, to Nvidia settings, to driver reinstalls, nothing seems to help my predicament. Some of these issues have even been present since launch I hear. With the game being this old, whatever wasn't fixed by now never will be. This seems to be a hit and miss title. Whilst people complained that the AI cheats, which I guess I never really witnessed regarding my fresh hours of the game, my main issues came with its performance, and I cannot devote myself to a game that runs worse than some Pre-Alpha Early Access title with stock Unity assets. My time spent here was bittersweet. I had hopes for this game, and whilst the core gameplay was fun and it was something I found I could slog a few hours into. Unfortunately I couldn't bare to stand those hours dealing with a stuttering, lagging, visual mess.My ultimate verdict: Pick the game up on a huge price drop, that way, if you experience what I have, the sting is far less than what it could have been.

												Played it while it was on the free weekend thing. Here's my experienceGet into an AI skirmish after playing tutorial, build 5 woodcutter huts and 2 stone quarries. No starting peace, so I decided to rush the enemy production to cripple them. I thoroughly destroyed every single woodcutter hut and farm they placed in their oasis, continued to rush slaves, and even managed to get a siege camp up with 3 trebuchet continuously firing at their castle. I build some mantlets to protect my trebuchet from ranged fire. My AI adversary just kept re-building walls and farms/woodcutters, and I kept destroying them. He even started building siege tower defense, but it didn't matter. I just kept destroying them.This is the weird thing though. No matter how much I destroyed, he just kept building. No matter how long I besieged him he just kept building. I managed to destroy the same little area of his castle over and over again, but it just didn't matter.This was irritating enough. My plan was to starve him to death essentially, not just with food, but with resources as well. I figured he would keep building until he ran out, and then when he was on the verge of economic collapse I would send the huge army that I'd been building to absolutely crush him inside of his castle. that economic collapse never came. Even though he wasn't producing stone anymore, he just kept rebuilding his walls, and even though his gold economy had probably died, and his wood production was non-existant, he kept building siege towers which I kept destroying.The straw that broke the camels back however, was when I was finally ready to crush him. My plan was to send in 5 flaming cards through a hole in the wall, then hit his fortress with camel heads, then send in 25 slaves followed by 2 wagons full of crossbowman, mantlets, and about 40 swordsman. I spawned the 5 flaming cards and directed them into the fortress. As soon as they touched my trebuchet, they exploded instantly and destroyed all my mantlets and my 3 trebuchet.No thanks.			"

												I like it.  When I first bought the game, there were a ton of issues.  At times it was unplayable.  Major lag issues during battles. Somewhere around the winter update, maybe an update later, I noticed the game was playable.  Almost no lag issues now.  I have only played single player so far, but now that it's playable, I find the game to be as challenging/easy as the original.  I've seen a lot of people complaining about the game missing the laddermen and tunnelers.  I never used them so I don't care about that.   I don't understand the purpose of the market though.   Why have a market when you can buy things from the stock pile?  Am I missing something here?  I do miss a few things;  Engineers guild, leather armor, and the fear factor.  I thought fear factor was a great way to identify yourself as a ruler.  Overall, I think the game is fun, but was released too early.  I hope they make a Stronghold 1 expansion pack.  I prefer the green environment to the desert.			"

												I wan't to start off by saying I am a huge fan of stronghold crusader 1 and I started playing it like 15 years ago. I've been let down by every Stronghold game released after that (Stronghold 2 was alright but it was still pretty bad). I didn't purchase Stronghold Crusader 2 right away because I got burned multiple times by Firefly and I wanted to wait for the reviews. I finally got the game for $4 off of the humble bundle and I must say people are giving this game bad reviews for no reason. Yes the game is not as good as the orginal but that is usually the case because it is hard to improve a game that was so good. That being said the game right now is in a pretty good state and I am really enjoying it, some things I prefer over the original and some I don't. My biggest complaint with the game is that a lot of the animations are poorly done and there are some visual bugs, like units going into their T pose after an animation is complete. Other then that the game is really fun and I recommend getting it if its 50% off or more.			"

												Don't buy this POS unless you save your game every five minutes. I've lost count of how many times this game has crashed on me, finally uninstalled it out of frustration when it crashed on me and I lost a ton of progress AGAIN. Also their auto save feature is a joke, saves maybe once or twice every few hours and the only way to access the autosave file is rummaging through your game files and moving the right files into the right folders, then when you've finally figured it out and load up the autosave it's nowhere near where you were when the game crashed.

												Love this game mainly for the building aspect, A.I is not really a challenge becuase its never in for the long haul and just sends small to medium skermish attcks that are easily delt with, instead of sending a decent force to defend againt. Attacking is not a problem if you build a decent army, i like a mix of 500 units plus half a dozen trebuchet, that usually gets the job done, with a swift dispatch of your enemy. Overall though its a just one more click and i'll call it a day game, 5 hours later lol. Having said that worth every penny.			"

												This game is great, I enjoy spending time on my castle and playing the computer players, the AI could do with some work but I'm sure it will come with due time. If your an actual fan of the stronghold series and  not a whinny cry baby like most of the new comers and rage complaints this game is for you. If you're expecting something thats perfect in everyway to fit your needs in every fashion, or if you just like to complain about games I suggest staying away.			"

												Not coming from first Stronghold Crusader, I cannot really compare the two to say which one was better. But this game for me was worth the price, it has a great physics system and a large combination of buildings and units and really gives you the feel of a castle simulation RTS. The graphics are stunning, as well are not overdone so it can run easily on PC's that are less powerful than others. Currently I very much enjoy this game, however this game is rather difficult to master, and the balancing of resources and the strategy you slowly develop takes a lot of time for you to properly enjoy the game. Currently the game is not very polished, but I assume in the future they will finish some quite 'bland' features.Overall, 8.5/10Easily the best castle simulation on steam right now.			"

												I just recently upgraded my computer and thats why i am changing my review, but this game is seriously amazing if you have a decent comp!! even tho it has a sort of cartoony feel to it, it still feels amazing to play! the firefly team is constantly supporting and updating the game which is fantastic and i honestly mean this when i say its worth buying to support the developers of a much loved series. Im a huge fan of the stronghold series... I've played hundreds of hours on the origional games and i still continue to play them! the bonus about the old games was that even tho online play was a thing of the past you could still get countless hours of enjoyment out of the games. This game continues that feel while although having a less enjoyable single player now adds a great multiplayer expierience.			"

												This game is definetly worth the money. It has a lot of good features, though I do wish that it had less lag. That is the major thing that needs to be fixed. But it is playable, and if you can work with it the game itself runs fine. I like the new villages and outposts feature, but I wish they had kept the tower top defensive weapons. These new wooden towers seem too flimsy to me, i would prefer the build up to it theme from the previous game. However, while there are a few minor bugs that need to be worked out, overall the game is definetly worth it.			"

												I have yet to really get deep into the game but so far from what I've played, I would recemond this game to anyone who has played the Stronghold Series. Its a really nice game with a clean layout. The AI and the descriptions of their pay style really help you get a grasp of how you can be attacking certain types of player's. Another thing I enjoy is the troops. They all seem to be really great troops and well made. There are also some glitches ive encountered with the game. If I am in a mutiplayer game with my friend and there are more than 4 players in the map, We both get alot of syncing problems. Thesyncing problems happen anywhere from 2-5 minutes a pop from what i saw. Another problem I had was that I have crashed twice mid-game and have not been able to complete that many games on multiplayer. I know that alot of people will be saying ""oh its his computer that sucks"" but i have a pretty beefy computer and it just happens every now and then. Apart from all of the glitches, The soundtrack and countless hours of gameplay and options there are for the game weigh out the syncing and crashing problems. Good luck with deciding on buying it or not. Hope you make the right choice and enjoy the game! :)			"

In my eyes i see Stronghold Crusader 2 is a Great addition to the franchise as it has improved a lot in meny areas such as graphics.Bad points:The campaign is not as long as the original stronghold crusader and it seems that it is being sold as DLC's Q_QThe overall campaign seems to be a lot less challanging compared to previous stronghold games			"

												As a person who's been playing Stronghold since the first one and enjoyed it throughly, Crusaders is part of my top RTSes of all time. Stronghold 2 was okay, but faaaar too difficult for someone who is horrible at RTS like me. Stronghold 3, got bored within the first ten minutes. Legends, also bored within minutes.  Stronghold Kingdoms never played, but can tell it was a horrible online game.After so many years of losing hope for Firefly Studios with the later games. They had finally listened to their fanbase and come to their sense with a whole new game... Stronghold Crusaders 2!Stronghold Crusaders 2 is what all these Stronghold I find boring should have been. It has everything that a stronghold fan like me wants. Mechanics from the previous Crusaders, very fun and intense gameplay. The popularity meter is more focused, as they added a disaster event such as Twisters and Locust swarms. Food, Taxes, Ale rate is still on the popularity list, though I never seen a hovel popularity rate in a Stronghold game.Of course, you got the amazingly fun battle mechanics with the iconic armymen with the spearmen, who throws spears now it seems, archers, knight, swordsman, and the siege camps and the mercenary posts. Using siege weapons to take down the enemy's castle, shooting from a distance with the archer, and many strategies to take down the enemy lord! Yes, the focus of beating stronghold is killing the enemy's lord.Yes, these is, of course, the fun Skirmishes and Multiplayer. Just enjoying with a good match in the battlefield with a AI or another player is another great fun!After all the years of waiting for a good stronghold, I found it! Get it! Get it! Get it!			"

												I know that this game won't be able to give Stronghold players the spirit of original Stronghold Crusader but still it's a Stronghold and it has the same basics .Like having the same Castle building and expand system and almost the same units system. Maybe some glitches like graphical ones and some lacks like not having short walls bother old players but still its great seeing our old beloved game up and running with new engine.So buy this game not only because of showing your love to stronghold series but also supporting firefly studios for their tireless efforts in making these series.DLCs really bother the gamers because they are too many. Even mini campaigns had their own pack. BTW having just 2 characters and some castles won't be enough to make a DLC for it. Making a complete pack helped it but why they should put a copy of game  and some (useless) kingdoms pack in this wonderful idea and ruin it. only made the price unpleasant to buy . I hope developers  do something and put DLCs in a solid pack only containing them with or without the  game itself , with a logical price so all player will be willing to buy this wonderful game with all of its after season products.

												I'm not sure why everyone has been so negative on this game.  Is it worth $60.00?  Definitely not.  But is it pretty much what stronghold 3 should have been years ago, definitely yes.  This is a great game, yes, there are some very minor flaws where people stop walking and glide to their destination, but that really is not important as the mechanics are still the same.   If you loved the first strong hold, then you will love this game too.  Sometimes the lacking in graphics is a good thing and I would say this shows the creators listened to their loyal base and went back to what really worked.			"

												People say it's bad, that it's missing stuff from the original Crusader.

Bought it on sale (3.5e) and  I'm having fun. Multiplayer works fine. It's even missing some things from Stronghold 2 which i think is the best Stronghold. Not worth  the full price, but its a good game if it's on sale. I love the battle cry of the army. Definitely missing the single player aspect. Only about 10 missions + more skirmish missions. (Without DLCs)EDIT: AI is sometimes cheating (their troops appear from their castle. It's impossible to do 1v3 (1000g vs 3000 gold) skirmish trail, because they just keep recruiting and attacking, it's impossible to defend anything. but still good to play with friends.			"

												I got it whilst it was on sale and i gotta say: it was worth its money THEN.While it is a good game, it needs more content. I was dissapointed by lack of troop diversity as well as AI diversity.While there are many AI characters, their difficulty has a huge gap. Half of them are pushovers whilst the others are a constant uphill battle.The game has a decently sized campaign though, which was alot of fun but slightly repetitive towards the end.Not worth the $50 it currently is, but still a good game.

												After playing through the first two skrmish trails, I can confidently recommend this game to my friends. Many medevil RTS publishers can be compared to the Call of Duty franchise.  I was expecting a game that would be disappointing compared to my childhood experiances with the original Stronghold Crusader.  I am glad that the publishers made a game that feels like the original game and has better performance and visuals.  I am extremely satisfied with this game, and if you enjoy playing games like stronghold 2 or Stronghold crusader it is deffinately worth it!			"

												Stronghold Crusader is the successor of Firefly Studio's Stronghold. It is a real time (midevil) strategy game set in the Middle-East Crusades. Stronghold Crusader 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed original crusader which sets you back in the middle east versing some familiar foes (Rat, Lion, Shah, etc) and some new comers to the series.As this game came out recently (September 23rd, 2014) it can obviously be expected that there are some minor bugs that occur (such as small series of lag, misplace of troops, etc) In comparison to Stronghold 3 this game is far better as it has a better hosting connectivity, less troop lag, and improved physics. Massive armies, easy to lay castle wall design, and town square layout design makes this game far easier to play. I have heard mixed reviews of this game- but after 6 hours in my first sitting I can say that it brings me back to the days of the Original Crusader. With massive armies, tactical maps, and strategic footholds- I am impressed with my first hands on experience. I would recommend this game to those who loved the original crusader as it is very much like the original.Pros: -Ability to amass huge armies of up to 500 units.-Ability to heal units using Arabic healers-Quick place buildings in a easy to use square metrics system-Smooth wall building and stair integration-Army formations (Columns, Lines, etc)-Variety of siege equipment bonuses-Map variety-Skirmishes mode-Build your own multiplayer mapsCons:-Small community available-Easy to defend (turtle) castles-Some connectivity issues-Soldiers sometimes bug out when you are replacing features of your castle (i.e. Barracks/Gate into wall)-No Moats-No Tunnelers			"

												From what little time I have been able to play Stronghold Crusader 2, I would say it is a highly enjoyable, if charmingly simple RTS civ type game, and I would recommend anyone who likes RTS games give it a look.Usually I would want to put more time in before I cast judgement on a game as big as this, but when a busy weekend meets a Steam free weekend, little time is what we get.NOTE: From the salt I have been seeing from Stronghold fans, I would say Crusader II is pretty different from the previous games, so if you are coming from a previous Stronghold game you probably should look deeper than most before purchasing.

												Actually a really enjoyable game, the Stronghold Crusader's series hasn't let me down yet.I was suprised to find a good new Stronghold game, after the other dissapointments that claimed to be Stronghold eg Stronghold 3 was awful, but this really has bought the franchise back to it's former glory, the good Stronghold's like Stronghold 1, and Stronghold Crusader 1 are dear favourites of mine and most people's Stronghold games, this certainly can now be among those great Stronghold games.Granted, some of the new voice actors for this game are quite, well, awful, but it's nice to see that most of the crusaders still have the voices they had back in England, let alone how good those guys are at voice acting.Overrall, all I have to say, you've really outdone yourselves, Stronghold. I see this game was rushed but it's still amazing, buy this game!			"

												I paid full price for this game when it first came out...Even though I actually played and bought Stronghold 3 at full price, I should have known better. Yet Stronghold crusaders the orginal and extreme were great, heck most people got into the franchise becuase of Crusader. They couldn't mess it up, could they?They went back a stepNo longer: Gardens, Torturer  devices, less towers, can't dig trenches, can't scale under walls, can't mount a weapon on a tower platform, no slave slingers, less castle defenses. Added: Few new units which some are good like the sgt of arms that boosts your soliders health. Rangers on the other hand are archers with a sword who last an extra second in battle, but took away the slaves that sling rocks.What the game does do right is the economics. You can't rely on selling materials anymore and things cost more when you attack you got to make it count. I wanted to see the horse back archers nerfed down which were greatly, but too much because even in a large horde they get cut down with doing almost no damage. I thought multiplayer was going to catch on this time around, but no the lounge is still empty or if you do get into a game, pepole leave.The graphics haven't really improved though really I don't think that was a big concern for the fan base. They added a bunch of different shields and characters that I could care less about, there is no real big back story to them. I don't want the game to become pay to win, but perhaps it would have been interesting if you would have taken someone like the pig to get a buff on mace men being cheapier or stronger, or if you played Richard foot soilders cost less.So what it comes down to it, if you enjoyed the first Crusaders I doubt you will hate this, but it's not a 50 dollar game. If you spend under 15 or 20 even your going to get more than your money's worth and spend some time in between games playing this. It's a good game to have if been playing another game for a while and want a short break.I got to give it a thumbs up because it provides some enjoyment but it's not the crusaders we all been waiting for.

 NOT WHAT YOU SINGED UP FORThis game,in it's very core is the Stronghold Crusader. However certain tweaks and changes in the gameplay are showing.Resource management is quite different and slow-paced compared to the original.Some units are nerfed and some are buffed (Crossbowman are now Gods amongst soldiers and Horse Archers are not the harass units that will carry your game any longer.)Some units that was added to the game ARE wonderful (Healers,for instance will heal your soldiers and Lord,allowing to sustain your army without depleting treasury and allow your Lord to get into engagements giving him a more active role in defence of your keep)Some units are not. (Sergeant is an heavly armored unit that buff the soldiers around him.If mass produced,he just creates an army of Mary Sue's that is very hard to counter.)The castle building system is atricious. For example,instead of putting your tower mounted siege weapons on the top of the castle towers which was one of the trademark features of the Stronghold franchise devs decided to put the on ugly looking wooden turrets that come with the onagers. You have no option of putting them on turrets neither. There are no ditches,which was just cringe for me. No low walls so you could stop laddermen from climbing up. Towers also give little to no protection for your archers against the enemy archers which are low ground. I have seen my 42 arabian archers get completely annahilated by crossbowmen that were low ground. Towers are in variety also extremely lacking. There are only 3 types of towers in the game. They all look like the defensive turrets from SC in varying sizes which was just extremely sad thing for me to see.Good graphics makes watching your citizens work and complete production cycles even more fun. Housing system is also quite brilliant. Closer the hovels to the keep more population it brings to you (maximum being 8 and minimum 2) however that drastically changes their cost.Variety in buildings were quite disturbing. Lack of chapels and cathedrels are filled with Church. There are no ''good and bad''  buildings from the original series neither (gallows,bear dance,gallows,statues...)I would also like to state that besides the burning haystack throwing onager the mounted siege weapons are also pretty much useless.This game is NOT the Stronghold Crusader that we played and loved years ago. However it is still worth a shot since devs are updating. I am hoping they will bring back the good old buildings from the original game and HOPEFULLY fix the atricious mounted siege equipments. This hope is the reason I recommend this. I guess being a die-hard fan also helps. This game is fun,however if you are expecting SC you will be dissapointed. "

												I have been a huge fan of previous stronghold games, but I hadn't touched Stronghold 3, or Stronghold Crusader 2 until recently due to bad reviews. I was grateful for the chance to play for free for the weekend. Here are my honest thoughts.First of all, it is NOT worth $50. Not ever. Not under any circumstance. It is an insult the game originally sold for so much.It is worth $10, which is how much it is on sale right now. It brings up the first Stronghold Crusader on par with Stronghold 2 and Stronghold legends. Those games came out in 2005 and 2006 respectively. There are changes to gameplay mechanics (changes, not improvements), and slight improvements to the graphics. The models are relatively the same, with a few new units added. They work the same. The voice acting is still the same. The AI still follow the same patterns of play, and are beat with the same strategies. In fact, Stronghold Legends added 100x more to the franchise as a step up from Stronghold 2, than Stronghold Crusader 2 had in the 10 years since Legend's releaseBUT, Stronghold 2, Stronghold Legends, and Stronghold Crusader 2 in and of themselves are really awesome games. They are a ton of fun to play, especially with friends. I'd highly recommend any of them at $10. Just keep in mind you are buying a clone of a 10+ year old game with new paint.			"

												I think the game does some great steps (compared to stronghold legends or stronghold 3) in the right direction. Still, several things bother me - primary because i absolutely loved stronghold, stronghold crusader and stronghold 2, especially their atmosphere. Im going to focus on the points that destroy the atmosphere in SHC2 for me in this review.- First of all, the AI-castles look all very similar to me. In Crusader 1 every lord had his own design with his special towers and fear factor buildings. They all look similar to me in SHC2. For instance, the main difference between european and arabic lords is the look of the battlements (you might not even see it if you dont zoom in). Also, all walls are in this ""sandstone-look"" and look pretty much like the ground, so everything looks a little bit muddy. I think it would be awesome if european castles were darker and more grey.- The AI-animations look unlovingly created, they did not even took the time to sync their lips with the speakers. - What bothers me the most is that they were too lazy to create better AI-lords, so they get ressources and troops out of nowhere to make it more difficult for the player. I dont know if it was also the case in Crusader 1 - at least i didnt notice it there.If you dont mind that points, you might have some fun with this game.			"

												Very tentative YES on this one.Its like all the fun parts of Age of Empires II in terms of castle v castle warefare and economy management. The logistics side of things is much more important here as you must carefully manage your resources lest you totally screw yourself over (run out of food, money, weapons).It is much more siege-like than other RTS games I feel. Don't let the trailers fool you, no one fields armies that big. Most maps don't support forts large enough to generate such armies and it takes an hour+ to even get to the start of that scale of things. Most battles are small, between packs of units and such. Finishing long before reaching epic war levels.Additionally - It is a slower paced RTS, which I think is nice. You really must siege your enemy to win. Its almost impossible to storm a castle in one go. Instead you need to take control of resources, starve the enemy, wear them down, and then launch multiple assaults that push progressively farther and father into their defenses to get to the lord.So, if you like those things, then yay, you'll probably have fun.Lastly, my chief complaint is that the AI is absolutely aweful. There's no difficulty controls at all. All AI are just what they are. They are also braindead and cheaters. I've burned all my opponents' food, iron, and stone only to watch them continue to send units at me without bothering to rebuild those resources. Lemme tell you... no food = no troops. Its like fighting someone from a scripted campaign where troops are just auto-generated for the story. Its atrocious. This is a complicated game to learn. The economy is not like other strategy games and is hard to master. I've never had a problem beating the AI, even on my first aweful try where I ran out of food and had no iron for half the game.For the only good figthts, you'll have to PvP. That's a big disappointment for me cause I hate RTS PvP. As such, I can't tell you anything about what options there are here for that.			"

												Being a long time Stronghold Crusader player, I had the expectation for this game to deliver the original Crusader experience, and I must say, Stronghold Crusader 2 doesn't fail in it.- The gameplay and the units are still the same: build your castle, your army and defeat the enemy lords with your superior economy and military. It really feels good to command endless units in desert warfare, while fighting with the constant need for gold, popularity and supplies. SHC2 gameplay is a bit more stale in the economic side, but more mobile in the military side and the new units+buildings fit very much into it.- The Skirmish mode is what carries the game on its back: largely customizable games against and with the AI and human players provide virtually endless possibilities. You can even work on the same castle with your friend, and the AI can be quite challenging even for veteran players with its offensive attitude. Creating and shaping castles on your own style is the true beauty of this game and succeeding in defending it gives a rare feeling of accomplishment, even from game to game.- Player customization feels alright. You can choose your own crest, your own name and building style, and there is no more need for some casual play. However, there is no option to differentiate yourself more with i.e. some lifetime stats or ranks. There are achievements, sure, but they don't feel as much yours as some custom accomplishments, as everyone can earn them.- In story and character detail, Crusader 2 is sort of a setback compared to Stronghold or Stronghold Crusader's skirmish trails. There is virtually no story in any point of the game, and AI characters have descriptions no longer than a few lines. While the game partially succeeds in hiding the importance of a story for playing skirmishes all the time, the skirmish trails still feel bland for not having at least an average storyline.All in all, while Stronghold Crusader 2 may not appear strong story-wise, it delivers excellent gameplay and a great feeling for it. 8/10			"

This game is an actrocity.It came out in 2014, alongside games like Age of Wonders 3, Endless Legend and others that were good looking and very playable. THIS however, is neither. It looks like it comes from the cursed age were sprites (2D) evolved into these ugly low poly 3D models.It handles way worse than Stronhold Crusader 1, a 12 years older game!The charm of its predecessors is gone, it feels devoid of any ambition and heart from the developers. No funny lines if you click a worker, no satisfying sounds when clicking buildings, a hollow and boring advisor.This game should have never existed in the first place, it is just a nostalgia cash grab.

												Do I reccomend this game? Eh. In all honestly, It's not as bad as Stronghold 3, but it's not as great as Crusader 1.With the new update, it has broken the game to where Knights will randomly go turn-coat and kill your men and some of the units will not have any animations and just stand there.  With  great framerate issues on a good PC and horrible lag in multiplayer. I can't reccomend this game at the moment. Hopefully they will clean their act up.EDIT: The game has been fixed alot, but it has also has 4 $6 DLC that adds extra AI for Skirmish...not really worth it unless it is on sale. It is still a fun game though.			"

I tryied it like anyone who has played the first one and was stun by what i was seeing.This review is for those who have played the first stronghold because if you haven't its a great game buy it when it's in sale, it will be worth, but for me there is just to much WHY!Why are farm 10 times smaller but cost twice the woodWhy is wood even more a problem than it wasWhy does a market cost 100 woodWhy is the only good new feature i see is new soldiersWhy does the religion needs candle to produce happinessWhy is there no civiliansWhy are house sheltering more people the closer to the keepWhy are voice actor so boringWhy is the rat even attacking? xD (ok this one is a joke)Why are building looking has♥♥♥♥♥♥in a 2014 gameWhy are building destoying walls when i put them to closeWhy can't i diffence in a split second what building does whatWhy is the granary and stockpile so small but the armory so bigWhy is there a map in which i had no ironWhy is there conscrit if there's a mercenary postWhy are workshop so costly if we need a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonWhy haven't they only add feature?Why?! (ok that one was cheap)why is the game 50$Why is there better graphic but i still love the graphic and design better in the first oneWhy have i wasted 4 hours when i could have played the first oneand everything else you can think of...Again, this is for those who played the first one. if you haven't played it go ahead and buy, it will be fun.

												Multiplayer only possible with 4 human players and only 25-50fps on high end gaming rigs and V-DSL, this seriously got to be a joke. Compared to the original Crusader I can so far tell that you need ages to build up an army because you barely get gold to manage your system. Units are limited to 147 and you can only have 57 buildings with overall 7 players. For somebody who is familiar with the old Stronghold 2D games I cannot recommend it. If you are new to the series you could have a look at it while it is on sale.			"

												The game has a lot of nice visuals, but it doesn't make up for poor game handling, opaque systems, and a campaign where even after pushing deep into the enemy base, their units can spawn behind you.  Further, without a means to heal your units, there's no point in unit rotation from the front ... use them until they die ... which deminishes the value of high cost units.			"

												I loved the original Crusader and got this game for 5$ through Humble Bundle. When it comes to changes, I like that the villagers are just moved when you try to build on top of them and that you don't have to build 50 churches and 20 inns to get a nice popularity boost, while having high population. Everything else was changed for the worse though, so while I think original Crusader is worth 10$, this one isn't even good for 5.			"

												Not worth it. It's missing some elements from the original crusader, there is no single player campaign other than skirmishes and multiplayer has so many issues. It lags a lot, there is an incredibly slow nr of units allowed on a 8 player map and you can only play with other 3 players which means the maximum is 4 players on a map. IF you disconnect from the game you can't reconnect and really often you get disconnected from no reason. Keep your money, look for something better.			"

												How much I want to say I love this game, I really don't. Yes, it's got everything from the other Stronghold games and that is exactly what the problem is [to me]. There's very few additions to it. Just a reskinned Stronghold 3 with the desert setting of Stronghold Crusader. Not only that, but what kind of main menu were the developers trying to go for? Stick with Crusader menu, that was spectacular IMO. Just for input, the developers need to add more to catch my eye in the near future. Buy it if you want it for the campaign and multiplayer. Don't buy it if you're expecting a refined type of gameplay.			"

												While the game play runs smoothly on my computer and the people in my village and army all move with out a problem and my mouse scrolls just find from corner to corner on the map, I cannot play the game. This is suppose to be fast paced and you have to be quick to build up your castle and army I cant even begin. When i click to place any buildings i have to click the building 3 to 4 times before its highlighted and then i drag it to where i would like to place and i have to click it again 3 to 4 times to place the building and theres times where it doesnt place at all. This makes it impossible to move fast, i go the pace of a snail which makes the game unplayable. I thought it could be my computer as it only has a Nvidia GeForce 9300m GS 512MB graphics card but that cant be the case as i dont have any problems with the actual game play. I thought i would wait a few months to see if they have any patchs released and i havent seen any to fix this issue. I cant even write this review on what the game is like (tho from the few minutes i managed to play its nothing like the old crusader) as I have played every stronghold game before this with Stronghold Crusader being my favorite but this is a huge let down. I dont understand why change something that works and has a huge following, is the graphics in the old one great or amazing no, but it makes sense and was alot more appealing and user friendly then this 3-D crap which has been in all strongholds since stronghold 2 and i just find it to be a killer for the franchise which is so sad as it was one of my favorite computer games.

												Well, at first I didn't understand why so many people gave this game a bad review? When I first started I thought they could have done more with the graphics. I noticed they got rid of things like having honor to train troops, trenches/moats, gate with a draw bridge (I really liked it), and a lot of castle cosmetics such as a basket of rock to place on wall to drop on enemies.I did like how they changed the way you do battle in skirmish mode. You can set it up to battle against every lord on the map instead of them battling among themselves. In other words they focus completely on you. That’s a really nice feature they added. They have some new troops or at least to me. There are some troops that throw fire bombs. They’re great for defending your gate. Get enough of them throwing bombs in one spot and watch enemies turn into crispy critters. Being able to download new maps in Steams workshop is also nice.BUT the game crashes and acts funny too much for what they’re asking for it. For example I noticed there were a few troops sitting outside my gate that wouldn’t die. No Problem right? Well I couldn’t repair my walls and had to reload game because they were close to breaching my walls. Also, they were killing all of my bowman I had sitting in a tower. After reloading game I saw the troops in question all at once die.Other things like dragging and dropping were you want to be on the map stops working after a battle. I'm so sick of having to reload the game for small problems. it does work but it seems the more I play it the more bugs I notice. The bugs must be like germen cockroaches because they can't seem to get rid of them and the game has been out long enough.I felt I got ripped off myself and I bought the game on sale. It’s an okay game. But this has to do with whether I would recommend it or not. That’s why I’m giving it a thumbs down.			"

												Wood needed m'lordStronghold Crusader 2 is the sucssessor of Stronghold Crusader 1. After 12 years of the orginal Crusader 1, the sequel has finally come out. At the moment this game is missing a couple of things like AI lords but whats completely new is the new 3D engine which makes castle siegeing alot more exciting with the new 3D collapsing walls and towers.

It is overall a worse game than the original Stronghold Crusader.Stronghold Crusader 2 misses alot of the old features from Stronghold Crusader and is alot more simplified, and generally alot more boring in my honest opinion.If graphics matter to you, get this game. If not, then get the original Stronghold Crusader game.DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF IT'S NOT ON SALE!			"

My favorite mode casle builder is back, and you can now on some maps take over small villages that can produce some stuff for you. Tip: if you want to attack the villages for fun, dont distroy the food stock. I did that, and later i clamed the village, and all the villagers keeps dieing from starving, couse the dindt had a food storage left. (and they dont want to use mine).New units, and of corse a lot of good units back from crusader 1. New good traps, and the walls, well in stronghold 1 they are stronger, so i need this time think about a bigger wall.It looks good, and it is good			"

(Pic links below)-Not to many new features as I have seen.I feel I should have not paid $50 for this seeing that this could have been an expansion rather than a standalone game.Links as mentioned above:

Example; when horses archers die the horse falls onto the ground but the rider just sinks into the ground strat away. - The wood huts are very uneffecient early game and houses and weopon production and food production buildings are expensive on wood.

												I honestly cant recommend this game for 20 bucks. I bought it on sale, in one last hope that Firefly Worlds would get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. Apparently not, even though they took their time, published the game themselves, and worked out the kinks from a typical (post SH1/SC1) buggy release. Many complaints of fans are left unadressed, such as tiny maps, and lack of any modability. It takes elements from All games and blends them together, for some undesirable results.I never thought building a castle would feel like a game of tetris. this wasn't a huge issue in the old games. Quite frankly, it's clear the developers dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unless their new project completely blows my mind i intend to never buy a single thing from firefly again.In summary... If you liked SH2 and SC1, you'll probably have some cheap thrills from this game. Wait till it goes for 10 bucks unless you're dying to play it now. As is, its only marginally better than Sh2, and i wont even meantion SH3 because that didn't count. The developers seem to think that way too with their ""Gold"" turd being completely disavowed.			"

												Not as great as the original Crusader,but still a good game overall,some mechanics on the gameplay and building are a bit off,but once you get used to it,it's fine i guess.And to those who expected it to be just like the 1st Crusader or similar to the other Stronghold games,you will be disappointed,but to those who are playing it for the first time you'll probably enjoy it~ (though what'd you expect? it's a new game using a new engine and on 3D,of course it's going to be different than the older ones~) :P "

												This is one of my favorite games in a series so this will be harsh2014 AND YOU COULD NOT IMPROVE THIS GAME?!?! Seriously 2002 produced better games... NO LADDERMENNO ENGINEERS OR TUNNELRS(THAT I FOUND)RESOURCES SMALL AND FARTHER AWAYON  A SMALLER MAP THAN EVERMULTIPLAYER FREEZES AFTER 20-30 MINUTES ON LOWEST GRAPHICS EVENLIMITED BUILDINGS SIMILIAR TO A POPULATION LIMIT WHERES MY CASTLE EMPIRE AT ?!??!?!?! GRAPHICS ARE IMPROVED BUT AT THE COST OF THE ORIGINAL  GAME?! AI DOES THE SAME ROUTINE OVER AND OVER ... (LESS AI PLAYERS TOO)YOU END UP PROTECTING RESOURCES THE ENTIRE GAME NEVER ACOMPISHING ANYTHING FOR HOURS.Rant is almost over now...Seriously in 2014 you have to dumb down a game because it might ... yes ""MIGHT"" confuse people... let them be confused dont ruin a good game for the idiots.. 2002 version is better dont be fooled when a company on the downhill like these people say "" NEW GRAHPICS AND IMPROVED FROM ORIGNAL"" or whatever they state. This is a disapointment anyone whos read this far please dont waste your money... This was a money grabing release .... no care to community no updates.. no customer service (i received only copy and paste replys untill i gave up looking for updates) -10/10 ...Edit: Game sent me an email asking for reviews for chance to win DLC (AGAIN dlc ruins games release ONE expansion not 5-7 and tell me i still have to pay 50+ dollars for a game)  Edited rating -12/10 ... just for the begging for reviews.

												Single player review: Overall i enjoy this game it has everything it should and more from the older games to keep you going. if you like the old ones there is no reason why you would not enjoy this.One issue i have though is there is Easy mode and normal mode not hard mode officially, but for me normal and easy are very far apart ie: easy is too easy but can take up to an hour plus to win latter maps and normal is too hard on certain small maps, there is nothing inbetween which does take away from the game for me. In normal mode u just seem to get an endless wave of troops coming at you so if you do not get a good defense up in lightening speed your screwed cause they just keep on coming and once they reach ur walls ur dead cause u cannot repair them while they are attacking your walls. So yeah the ai has very little tactic it either just does the slow mode on easy or a constant flow of troops on normal. But its still fun but not worth full price imo6.8/10			"

												Supreme Commander -> SC: Forged Alliance -> Supreme Commander 2.Stronghold -> Stronghold: Crusaders -> Stronghold 2.Same story all over again. Take a time proven concept for a great game and mangle it beyond recognition in an underwhelming effort of squelching the last few bucks out of a great franchise.Seriously? A maximum of troops and buildings in multiplayer games? Still limited to 24 peasants in the recruitment pool? Way less options to customize your stronghold? Worse ballistics than Stronghold Crusaders which at least captured the feel of a volley of arrows where this game just... just... no.PLayed HUNDREDS of hours with the original games. This is already getting on my nerves after half a dozen.STAY AWAY FROM IT IF YOU LIKED CRUSADERS AND KEEP THE MEMORIES OF A GREAT GAME IN YOUR MIND. Or even better: Pick up the Original Crusaders. It´s better than this POS.			"

												This game is so absoultely freaking awful, horribly imbalanced. Walls are made of paper, Whirling dervishes are the most OP, absolutely game breaking unit I've ever seen, I have 40 crusader swordsman killed in 4 or 5 seconds by 6 whirling dervishes, how is that even fair? Honestly, one of the worst games I've ever played, I hope Firefly never makes another game, I wish I could backcharge for this vile piece of garbage. Stronghold crusader 1 was a great game, this is practically a holocaust of the series and of balance. Awful, awful, awful game, in case you didn't understand so far, do not buy this piece of fecal matter, wish I could have thrown my money down a hole, would have been more enjoyable than this piece of chit.

This is a downgrade of the original Stronghold CrusaderAlmost everything except graphics was marginally changed and not in a good way. I really tried to give it a proper try nevertheless my conclusion is save your time and money and just play the good old Stronghold Crusader HD.+Better Graphics-Everything Else5.5 /10 Could be really great, now its just a bit over average.

												I loved the old Stronghold games! Hence I thought I might give this one a shot as I got it in a bundle. Not the best reviews, but whatever. After playing the tutorials I am very disappointed. The game looks a bit weird. Lots of clipping failures around the trees, the buildings and units are not given as much love as in the previous games. Okay.. not too bad, I can live with that.. But the game also runs very bad. Not only does it feel kinda odd, but the units are ""lagging"" all the time, disappearing only to reappear somewhere near. That is just bad. Also, nice feature to introduce formations, however even the first rome:total war did this way better years ago. I got this game almost for free, but it still disappoints :-( I should have listened to the other reviews, this game makes the whole series look bad.			"

												This game is horrible.  Don't Waste your time.  This coming from someone who has played most similar base building empire games over the years.  Civilization, Total Annihilatin, Empire Earth, Age of Empires just to name a few.  This is the worst Ive ever had the displeasure of playing.First the game freezes every few minutes.  Takes 10-20 seconds to unfreeze and start working again.  Usually at least once during a mission it will crash completely.  So save frequently.  I can't think of another game that crashes more than once in a blue moon.  So its not my system.  Besides the techincal issues its just a horrible game.Why?  Long story short.  The tutorials are incredibly insuficient.  You get told to do something or take out a base with no idea how to build anything or what to do.  You generally have incredibly limited resources and time.  You can't build anywhere on the map except on a tiny area called your ""estate"".  Your resources are usually placed on the front side of your base and since you can't build off your ""estate"" you can't defend your most vital buildings.  One enemy makes in it with a torch (and yes they will run straight past your units) and your whole econmy burns to the ground.   The economy itself is a joke.  Its a very intricate balance of food, popularity, taxes and so on.  If you are too popular your population increases faster than you can feed them.  If not popular enough your vilagers abandon you so fast you usually can't recover in time.  Its incredibly hard to do the economy properly.  That said most players just exploit this horribly and bypass it all together.  They give their villagers ZERO food but tons of beer.  This makes the popularity meeter go through the roof and so then they can raise taxes to max giving them way more gold income than anyone would ever be able to manage playing the game as intended and then they can barely hold off the initial rush tactics of the clearly cheating computer oponents.  I say cheating b/c they dont have anything even resembling a meaningful economy but somehow they can dish out units 5x faster than you can with a fully function economy of your own.So you have 2 options.  Get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked over and over by a cheating AI b/c you are trying to actually play the game with a proper economy.  Or submitt to the inevitability that you will alway use the beer popularity exploit that everyone else seem to.  Then you can technically win the missions but lose self respect knowing that shouldn't work at all and you couldn't win doing it the right way.  But... you can't win doing it the right way b/c the game developers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and bumped up the AI dificulty to max.This game was not fun.  Was incredibly frustrating, and was a huge disapointment to spend a few hours to finally find out that you can't even get through the tutorial without exploiting.			"

												It had so much potential. The first Crusader game was great-- easy to learn, smooth gameplay, easy on the OS, understandable concepts, and crisp, clean graphics. Toss all those in the trash can, and out comes Stronghold Crusader II. The whole game lacks strength in any way, and the ""advanced graphics"" actually look worse than the first game, by far. The gameplay is annoying and clunky-- building refuse to be built in certain spots, even when the game says they can be placed there. When you build anything, there is delay between click and result, which is extremely annoying compared to Crusader I, in which everything you did was instant and smooth. Whoever designed and built the software for the 2nd installment had no clue how to make an enjoyable RTS game. Glad I only lost $12 on this-- it isn't even worth anywhere close to that, but trying to charge $50 for this disaster is criminal.			"

												Mediocre.It's an easy game to get into, not because of simple mechanics, but because of mindless AI that is easily exploited. Numerous times, I've been ""seiged"" by cheating (a LOT of cheating) AI where, by having a single tiny hole in my castle walls at the very back of my castle, the enemy sends everything they have through that hole, walking past, through, and over traps, defenses, and archers. Never once have I really felt a challenge from the AI that wasn't related to their massive economic cheats.The bugs are relatively ok, I haven't encountered any major, gamebreaking bugs (nothing like SH3's ""dogs walk up ladders"").Pathfinding: Walls are to be seiged or used by archers, nothing else. One of the first campaign missions asks you to seige a small, minor AI settlement. It is defended by 2 towers with a handful of enemies. My first approach was to amass as many small units as I could and send them up to the towers to kill the archers. However, my units were completely incapable of using new fangled technologies like ""stairs"" to the point their 5(?) archers killed 20 of my units because no matter how many commands I gave them, ""stairs"" and ""walking"" became too complex for them. This was only the 2nd or 3rd mission, a tutorial mission, that was rendered impossible to win because my units literally could not walk to the enemy.If you want a good SH game, go buy SH Crusader 1, it's a good game, it's not 3d, but it has better/more mechanics with less bugs and far better gameplay.

												  TL/DR ---> THIS GAME IS GOOD!   If you liked any other Stronghold game I would think you'd like this too. I sure do. Myself I'm kind of new to the Stronghold Series, having only discovered Crusader HD about 2.5 months ago. After looking 1st at this game, the reviews sent me back to the older verison. Which I really enjoy. Also I scooped the original Stronghold game to refine my skills. But I kept looking at this game. Having watched a few vids I decided to risk $9.97 Cdn for the Special Edition with the soundtrack while the sale was on. It's been money well spent!   It runs just fine on my older system and I've not noticed any bugs myself. There are some differences from the past version, however for me at least, the crucial elements of the game remain. Having read a lot of reviews regarding this game it seems the tough AI's are putting some people off. It took me a few days practice and watching vids to "" git gud "" enough to beat the first 2 Skirmish Trail missions against The Shah and The Rat, which I did last night. Looking forwards to more Skirmishes.  Having got this at 85% off it's been a good buy. I did also splurg a little more and buy The Princess and The Pig DLC while the sale was still on. Currently have a Custom Skirmish raging on vs The Pig and am enjoying the heck out of it. The next Skirmish Trail mission has me vs The Shah and The Rat together. Ought to be fun. If you are rich buy this game with the soundtrack now! If you are like me and not rich, watch some youtube videos and wait for the next sale... It's worth it!			"

												Its a reasonable game and is a fair continuation of the series. It doesn't add anything groundbreaking and feels almost like a rehashed version of the previous crusader. I recommend this for the following people: Never played a Stronghold game and is interested in giving it a try.Looking to scratch that Crusader itch but cant stand the previous games graphics.I do not recommend this for anyone looking for something new in the series. Firefly studios has failed to do anything substantive with their series and its following ever since the first Crusader was a success. This Stronghold proudly follows in this manner.The following did annoy me a bit:The UI is clunky and outdated. Things are hidden away or put in obscure places that dont need to be.Pathing is terrible. The pathing example for first time coders, 'Ants' on Netbeans does a better job.Units dont seem to like being on walls.Quirks from the previous Crusader like the tongue in cheek humour from clicking on peasents is gone.Unit graphics are over all poor.To me this just seems largely reflective of the gaming industry as a whole. Lacking direction and decisiveness specifically in regard to a singular vision. "

												Great and fun game. Some parts of SHC are missing, other new parts were added. Overall I think there's a proper balance between what was lost and what was added. The unit special abilities and formations allow for some really neat approaches to combat which I think are the best part of the game. At times, commanding your group of units and timing their abilities properly feels like playing something like a RPG and gives you the feeling of extra control over who wins the battle :)That being said, the asking price of 34,99€ (currently) is a bit high. I think something like 15€ is more appropriate since you'll most likely want to buy the DLC (~5 eur each) once you get into the game. The DLCs add new characters and campaigns, so they're a must-buy if you enjoy the game.			"

												This is a really good game, don't let the negative reviews fool you if your a fan of stronghold. (Although if you played them all this one might burn you out a bit.) This game is a lot of fun, the battles get very intense, there is not too many ""grace periods"" like in Age of Empires or something like that, its very VERY back and forth. My only complaint is the lack of variance, I wish each AI warlord had there own unique unit or building piece or something like that, there actual LORD unit is usually unique, but ehh.Anyway, this is a really good game, if you were thinking on picking it up, I would recommend, or wait until its on sale if your sceptical. Gameplay is very addicting, and hard as hell. Almost made me feel like a complete noob at one point where I was getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked, on a training trial, on easy....yeah... -_-			"

												It is an updated version of the original Stronghold Crusaders game. Best to get during a sale, but it has given me hours of entertainment and will continue to for the forseable future. It is definetly is not worthy of all the negativety it has gotten as it is much better than Stronghold 3 and only has very minor bugs. I hope this is not the last of stronghold and that they will continue to improve since Stronghold 3. This was a step in the right direction. I recommend it if you enjoyed Stronghold Crusaders and if your favorite missions in the original Stronghold were Castle vs. Castle ones.			"

												This is not what i expect from stronghold. and last time i checked this is not an early access. 60 bucks is alot of money for a game made by your interns. i started playing pc on the original crusader and it was a damn good game but this is glitchy at best. the mounting system for knights is so flawed that  even tho i had the stables and a horse for each knight i was lucky to get a couple mounted. im not sure what your feeding your archers but when they kill someone there victims fly like theyve been shot with a 25mm cannon. also in some maps id like you to change the map name to babysit your defending units from a tornado for an hour. as another review said you got rid of honour and feast and the gameplay is very boring between hurricane katrina and pounding the mount button. if you guys were short on cash you should have launched a kickstarter instead of releasing this unfinnished garbage. as for the good graphics were nice(er?) and the seargent at arms is a solid new addition, the walls are easy to manage could use a little more HP. i like the skirmish mode the other stronghold were limiting for all out combat but this one is good. the unit count feels right and have never needed more building. i voting no on this, but know that its purchased i will write a review in a couple months, ive never been let down from you stronghold and im hoping you were in a finacial bind and had to release. and that the money you got goes back into this game.

												Stronghold Crusader 2, a fun gaming experience that contains castle building, sieges on your enemy, amassing large armies of mass destruction, and building your economy to support your empire. As a game worthy of the Crusader title, I would recommend it for it's nice looking graphics, smooth and fun gameplay, and large scale battles.    But as a player of their previous games in the franchise, and I think others would say the same, I feel like there's so much potential to make this an even greater game than its predecessors. Coming back to this game after playing some of the older titles makes it feel a little bland in the amount of detail that you can put into your economy and castle. With only a handful of castle design options the game doesn't leave you many choices to make a really awesome creation. Moving to the economy side of things I feel that the missing ability of an option like fear factor takes a whole lot of character out of the game. This option in previous games could really personalize your play style, and that of the AI as well. You are either the lord loved by his people who serve him with loyalty, or you become the most cruel master, your castle being littered with every kind of torturer device of that time period.   As much as I love to hear that the company is working on new DLC updates with AI, I really think Firefly Studios needs to look at adding more depth to this game with new gameplay features, to get the player more immersed into the desert warfare. Stronghold Crusader 2 is a good game, and I do like some new features that they brought in that were not in the original, but to make it the best of the series, the developers at Firefly need to make this desert experience like none other, giving the player more ways to conquer this dry landscape.   This is my humble two cents to a game that has lots of potential, and a game I really want to see succeed.			"

												I don't review games often, but I felt like I really needed to add to the general cry of ""foul"" to the developer on this one.  This game feels like a step down from previous iterations of the Stronghold series.  Given time and funds, Firefly couldn't manage to give even a moderate improvement to the game.  The graphics aren't any better in my mind, and the game itself doesn't introduce any new gameplay elements.  If you're interested in a good castle-building sim, any of the previous Stronghold games would give you the same experience as this one, but for far, far cheaper.			"

												There is a lot for FIreFly to get over with this new game.  I see it like this:1. those who know the old game, know it well.  That means the most frustrating thing will be learning how to play this new game where it does not match the old one, and there are lots of differences, especially in the convenience corner.  It irks me for example that I have not found yet any way to change the speed of the game to give me think time, and that a lot of my old tricks won't work any more.2. but in the end, many suffer from the same addiction problem as I, which is we really liked the old game (even with its pittiful AI), but have also played it till the cows come home and there is nothing left in it for us.  When I bring up a scenario in the Crusader I already know how it will go and how it will end, no surprises.  So we have little choice but to get the new game if we want to get a new fix.3. another dissappointment for me is the apparent lack of campaign missions.  You will recall from Crusader  there are 100 missions, 80 across only two of the campaigns.  This new game has maybe 15.  So there is little replayability here.  This leaves us to look towards multiplayer (maybe a good thing) and playing the computer in freeplay (like starcraft though not as good).So I have to say, I think FireFly would have done way better if they had just taken the old Crusader game, enhanced the AI in it, and created another 50 mission campaign that they sold as DLC for that game.  @10$, everyone who played the game would have bought it.  Well... there is still time.  If they want to do this they will find a willing audience for it.I am going to recommend the game, in part hoping that it might be like Stronghold3.  This game was immediately hated too, but for those who thought about the game and what it was really doing it turned out to be much better than originally thought with a more sophistcated resource and industry change in it that I think added depth.  It was a successful attempt to keep the old game feel, but add new options.  But  you have to be patient to see it.So Stronghold Crusader 2, not an instant hit, not a lot of single player replayability, but if you are looking for a stronghold fix what choice do you have.  Maybe it will grow on us.			"

												After wasting 35 euros by preordering this ''thing'' and being forced to see the minimum requirements changing on the last minute before release i'm still waiting for a patch to make the game more optimized for the ugly graphics it actually has (update, that patch will never come)By having played ALL the stronghold saga games i'm surprised how lot of people consider this game a better and improved version of SC1, i'm sure it's just the exact opposite.This looks more like a medieval dlc of the sims instead of a stronghold game.I'll just talk about the little i've experienced in my 111 minutes online and 10 hours offline gameplay:PROS:-There's ''Stronghold'' in it's titleCONS:-optimization: i don't have a powerful gaming PC but it still satisfies the minimum reqs, and i still can't play the game at more than 20 fps into the tutorial-graphs: ugly ugly and ugly, even Stronghold 2 had better graphics-interface: horrible SC3 hud, more than half of the screen it's hud, can't even see what i'm doing because of the hud, the captioned chat covers what remains hud-free on the screen, why even bother making a game at this point, just cover all the monitor with an hud-buildings: the proportions between walls/towers and eco building are completely wrong, walls are so thick you could grow a farm into them and towers are horribly flat-castle building: the finished castle looks always ugly, there's literally no physical space for creativity-units: they have been fixed but the cp still doesn't work 100%, and there are missing too many of them from the original one, they ofted wander around -economy: they have been rebalanced but they're still completely wrong imho, ♥♥♥♥♥ 200 wood for a windmill whaaaaat-ai: can't say that much, game crashes with 2+ ai-price: no, just noKeep playing at stronghold crusader 1 instead.I've sure over-hyped this game but at this point i seriously hope Firefly won't ruin Stronghold saga even more than they already did with this game			"

												It's really just an old-school RTS that successfully captures the flavour of the earlier games, although maybe some of the personality is missing.The graphics and performance are all good, the missions are pretty varied .. I personally like the idea of building and defending my society though .. balancing all of the needs of the community, being an evil despot or a benevolent lord .. all of the decorative, punishment, societal stuff isn't really featured here.So the basic emphasis is largely war based, build & defend your castle, destroy the enemies castle.It's a good game, I just feel like it's a missed opportunity to be something -more-.At least it isn't the festival of bugs and bad decisions that was Stronghold 3.  It's functional and seems reasonably balanced to me as well.			"

												This is seriously what they're going to produce after what Stronghold Crusader brought to the table? A slapped mashup of Stronghold 2 and some texture packs? The biggest slap on the face was the junior high drawing of an assassin on the main menu.I didn't touch the campaign because I honestly don't give an F. If I wanted someone to guide me through a video game I'd get real drunk and go on Twitch.Pros:1. YOUCANTTAKEMYCASTLE,KNAVE,TRY. Seriously, using the catapault on other dudes' castles was hella nice.2. YOURFOODSTOCKSAREGROWING. The devs did get some of the charm from the original game.3. Stronghold Crusader in 3d is good looking.4. The Rat can smack talk you... in 3d!Cons:1. GOODMORNINGYOURLORDSHIP and silly profile quips when clicking on peasants are missing. This was one of my favorite parts of the original game. Small, subtle, but it's this kind of charm that you can't leave out due to taking a AA name.2. Can't issue more than one order to troops at a time. This was how it was done in Stronghold Crusader, but it's 2014. Look at Planetary Annihilation, a successful RTS, and you can get a rough idea of how troop command should be handled.3. Hated the territory system from the other games, extraordinarily disappointed in myself for not realizing it would be in this game. Disappointed in the devs for implementing it here as well.4. Renamed Spearman - seriously.They had 12 years to understand how to merge Stronghold Crusader and the current set of expectations for video games. They dropped the ball. There is so much wasted potential here.Avoid, definitely, avoid. Unless it's on sale for like $5 in 2016, then definitely get.			"

												After the mediocre Stronghold 3 and Stronghold Legends, Crusader 2 brings the series back to their roots.The developers tried to copy the positive aspects of Crusader 1 and improve them with new features.However, instead of ending up as an improved version of the first Crusader, the game became a much more RTS-like title. which plays much more different than Crusader 1 than I expected.What the developers did is basically simplified the whole castle building to a state where almost every building makes sense. This gives the game a much more fast-paced gameplay in the Skirmish Mode.Compared to Crusader 1 or SH2, the units also seem to be better balanced. Spamming Horse Archers or Knights is for example much more difficult than in the previous game(s), because they can now be countered easily by macemen or whirling dervishes. The whole combat system in general is improved by special abilites the units have. So instead of having useless and useful units like in Crusader 1, the game has offensive and defensive units with their own abilities. This gives armies a certain variety that can also be seen in games like Age of Empires 2.I also feel like the current AI Lords are way harder to beat than in Crusader 1:When the Rat is building catapults (so his sieges are not completely useless ;D) and the Wolf builds a stronghold that lets your castle look like a hovel, you know♥♥♥♥♥♥just got serious :DBut despite these aspects the game still has many flaws that need be patched and improved.The most important would be performance improvement and bug fixing.On big maps with many opponents the framerate drops under 20fps even on good PCs.Also knights are sometimes unable to get on their horses or units stop moving entirely.In terms of balancing there are still some things the developers need to change:They already lowered the wood cost of woodcutters in previous patches, but there are still some buildings that seem a little bit too expensive, for example the market that becomes unvaluable through its 500 gold price or mills that cost 200 wood each (guys I want my awesome bread empire back :D).Despite that they need to add some more NPC Lords( Ssssnake plz :D), Units and buildings that are missing ( for example ladders, tunnels, moats, Gardens and voice overs for your peasents). All in all this game is different from the Stronghold games. It may not feel that much like a complex castle simulator anymore, but more like a well balanced Strategy Game with castle building elements.Fact is, there aren´t many games today that have this kind of gameplay, so Crusader 2 has a unique gameplay.Depite its current issues I recommend this game to everyone that likes strategy games and/or the stronghold series, but keep in mind that there are patches coming that may be improving the game that much, that games like Aoe2 or Command and Conquer have a serious competitor.In Germany we would say:""Abwarten und Tee trinken."" :D			"

												I'm  a long Stronghold fan and this game needs some work.  The single player skirmish mode is way too hard.  The advantage to the computer player makes it impossible to win.  I'm not sure what they were thinking here.  Not everyone is an expert gamer.  Get a grip on reality.  You need to put a way for a player to manipulate starting gold, position, etc.  Right now, it sucks.  Sorry guys, but you kinda failed on this one.  The game has potential but it's also screwed up in many ways.  And I'm not even touching on all the little problems, like troops walking backwards.... you need to fix this or your game launch will be a failure.			"

												To buy, or not to buy. If it is the craving for the style of the old stronghold games that you are looking for, you will be massively disapointed. If it was a fun and involving strategy game that you are looking for, again, you are to be disapointed. If you are looking for an in depth city/castle builder, unless you've played all the Anno, Age Of Empires, and earlier stronghold games until you simply cannot stand to play them any longer, then this MIGHT be worth the buy if it is on sale.I bought this game whilst it was on sale, undetered by the overwhelmingly negative reviews i had read earlier, I foolishly bought the game with the low expectation that it would be at most a poorly re-done stronghold 3. Even with those low expectations I was still let down. The campaign takes well over an hour of unskippable grinding gamplay that inst even remotely interesting before you even get to do anything remotely interesting. To make matters worse, there was no mention or easily recognisable option that would speed up the game speed, and so it was almost when i was at the end of my patience when i discovered that the only way to change game speed is with the hotkeys ""+ or -"", making this game a hell of a drag for the beginning of any single player matchThe multiplayer is barely any better, it shows none of the fast paced action of stronghold 2 or its predecessors, and the matchmaking was very poor and scarce.In summary, unless you have played every other strategy game you own until you cannont bear to play them for one moment longer, do not buy this game. I would instead recommend watching the opening cinematics for AOE1 in 240x 180p than recommend somebody actually buy this game and play it			"

												Nice, game... Im a big fan of the first game and this one as well. Hopefully there is alot more of DLC on its way as I have bought all of them so far.Everytime I turn off the game, I just want to reload it back up again and keep on playing.This game got me into stragetic games and so did the first one aswell.In conclusion, you should buy the game if you are into the Crusaders or the Arabics. Im not sure about the price though, if it goes down then I would totally recommend it but you should still buy it as it is a fun and addictic (for me) game to play.			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is the better Version of Stronghold Crusader. Very nice graphics without losing the SC feeling.I loved playing it on Windows 98 and even played Stronghold Crusader: Extreme later on Windows 7.SC2 got a lot of new missions and is fun to play in the good working multiplayer :)ALL in ALL -> 5 Stars or what ever is the best rating ;-)			"

												To buy, or not to buy. If it is the craving for the style of the old stronghold games that you are looking for, you will be massively disapointed. If it was a fun and involving strategy game that you are looking for, again, you are to be disapointed. If you are looking for an in depth city/castle builder, unless you've played all the Anno, Age Of Empires, and earlier stronghold games until you simply cannot stand to play them any longer, then this MIGHT be worth the buy if it is on sale.I bought this game whilst it was on sale, undetered by the overwhelmingly negative reviews i had read earlier, I foolishly bought the game with the low expectation that it would be at most a poorly re-done stronghold 3. Even with those low expectations I was still let down. The campaign takes well over an hour of unskippable grinding gamplay that inst even remotely interesting before you even get to do anything remotely interesting. To make matters worse, there was no mention or easily recognisable option that would speed up the game speed, and so it was almost when i was at the end of my patience when i discovered that the only way to change game speed is with the hotkeys ""+ or -"", making this game a hell of a drag for the beginning of any single player matchThe multiplayer is barely any better, it shows none of the fast paced action of stronghold 2 or its predecessors, and the matchmaking was very poor and scarce.In summary, unless you have played every other strategy game you own until you cannont bear to play them for one moment longer, do not buy this game. I would instead recommend watching the opening cinematics for AOE1 in 240x 180p than recommend somebody actually buy this game and play it			"

												This game has been out for two years, it is still glitchy. Allies will put buiildings directly through your closed walls opening them to the enemy. The walls through a main gate is often impassable in spite of the wall itself being as wide as a highway on both sides of it. The controls are clunky and you often spend time just trying to control the game.The senarios are lazy and frustrating, they do not create interesting problems but merely make you play niche stratagies by depriving you of nearly all resources till you overwhealm your opponent with your economy. In the end the game was so bad that I went to look up the publisher for producing such rubbish so that I could remember to avoid their games in the future. Publisher is Firefly.  I paid 5 dollars for this game and do not consider that sum to be a value.			"

												I'm impressed. After the bad experience with stronghold 3 firefly is showing us that they are actually listening to the community and finally catered their final product in a way that can be enjoyable for old fans of the series and new alike. I feel it's more slow paced in comparison to Stronghold Crusader. The economy is ""slow"" to kick in but this actually gives you more time to efficiently ""plan and not spam"". Big thumb up !			"

												Tryed in the free weekend. Even on sale for  a few quid this game is poor value. Unlike the original it has absolutly no sence of humour. The balance is terrible. It takes way too long to gather wood leaving you a sitting duck until you can get your castle up and running, The pub that in the original was populated by drunks is empty bar the inkeeper. Come on devs sort it out. Lets see peasants packing up and leaving when taxes are raised. Throwing themselves off the battlements when they are cruel. A brothel that the priest cant keep away from.... It needs some originality rather than a slavish & poor copy of the original. The basics are there. It wouln;t take much to sort it out. It needs to be fun to play. And funny. This is like watching paint dry...... Even free I can't be bothered to play it.			"

												First time Stronghold Crusader's player. Not a completely terrible play. I did enjoy this game but did have issues with the game crashing constantly and often at undesirable times. There is also a large amount of glitches which happen during gameplay (i.e. troops don't always respond to commands) . Really takes away from the fun and control of the game. I also noticed that the computer/AI gets some unfair advantages which is frustrating (i.e. destroying all source of food or income and yet still produces loads of troops). I would prefer to give this game a neutral rating but will give a yes cause I enjoy the strategy but this is why you see such mixed reviews.			"

												Summary: Stronghold crusader 2=More balanced stronghold crusader gameGame mechanics has changed, players would not be able to exploit all the little bugs and tricks associated with the old stronghold crusader. High cost of buildings makes mistakes more costly. The introduction of the healer unit was a welcome breath of fresh air which has helped to offset the impact of the nerfs across the board i.e. long cooldown between launching mad cows and more, which have helped to balance the game. Pikemen have now become strategic chokepoint units, something which makes pikemen more relevant as the ultimate defensive unit. Players can look forward to a certain degree of challenge when playing this game. (Coming from someone who completed the entire stronghold crusader series) However, something is wrong with the pitch pits, sometimes the workers just cant get out of the pitch pits and there isn't any fancy options for decorating your castle.

												This is a fun and great game! The single player and multiplayer is amazing! A few things I would love the creators to add is: 1. A Global chat for the multi-player so you can advritise your game and get players in faster2. A Multi-player ranking stucture so you can have a win to loss ratio, ect (like Dawn of war, or Age of empires)3. When you exit a game there should be a Main Lobby for player to afk in, with globalchat where you can see all the players ranks and all the players online, then to find game click a tab to view games; because when you exit a game it takes you to the games main menu and not back to the multi-player menu4. Have an option to randomize teams on multi-player, or have the players pick themselfs, because its not totally fair if the host picks all the time.Other than that, this game is amazing.

												I had such high hopes for this game. I have been a Stronghold Crusader fan for a long time.  I have Crusader HD extreme, and still play that every day. I have all versions of the game, and Crusdaer is by far the best.I even did alfa and Beta testing for Srtonghold Kingdoms.  This is more like latest version is more like Stonghold, the original. But it's not so much that part, It's the part that causes the game to freeze when you finish a mission. That's not good.Or maybe it was because my anti-virus detected it a malware, even after unistalling, seting an exception for the game, and reinstalling, still detected as malware. Still, not good.Try again Firefly.			"

The former atmosphere of the predecessors is gone, no peasants talking to you, no buildings which display the real life of a medieval castle anymore. It is all gone. Like my money. Too bad...If you still can't decide, just take a look into the forum here. You will notice a lot of ongoing disapointment. You don't want to enlist in this abandoned community. Play Strongholds 2 instead, where managing your castle played the first role and conducting war the second.			"

												This game got a bad rap but its actually pretty good. Basically, you build up your fortress and army and try to destroy your opponents'. It's a simple RTS that can be very entertaining and the variety of different AI personalities means you can't develop a one-size-fits-all strategy to defeat all of your enemies. I would recommend this game on a discount			"

												Always a fan of Stronghold, and super excited to see an all-new Stronghold Crusader 2. The first moment I hit the game, the nostalgic feeling rush back at me. The new version, obviously, have a better graphic, and yet still able to retain its originality from the previous Stronghold. The game system is so much smoother and easier to handle. The armies are much more massive than before, and with different perks for each characters. The campaign is a challenge just like the old one, and there's an open world where you can do whatever you want. What really makes me love this Crusader 2 is the new, better, concise method of building the wall. It gets so much better and easy to coordinate while building the wall !If you love a castle-sim + war + mercenaries + siege, then you are going to love this game.			"

												Best stronghold after Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader. Must have!Великолепно! Такого Strongholda я давно ждал, лучшая часть со времен Stronghold и Stronghold Crusader, всем фанатам однозначно рекомендую купить. Минусы конечно есть, в основном нарекания только к движку, опять он местами кривоват, но наконец-то допилен до играбельного уровня. Маловато миссий, примерно в 2 раза меньше, чем в Stronghold Crusader. Плюсов все же больше:  экономика сбалансирована, миссии сложны и разнообразны, передана атмосфера Stronghold Crusader, т.е. развитие вражеских замков идет параллельно с развитием вашего замка.

												Its a reasonable game and is a fair continuation of the series. It doesn't add anything groundbreaking and feels almost like a rehashed version of the previous crusader. I recommend this for the following people: Never played a Stronghold game and is interested in giving it a try.Looking to scratch that Crusader itch but cant stand the previous games graphics.I do not recommend this for anyone looking for something new in the series. Firefly studios has failed to do anything substantive with their series and its following ever since the first Crusader was a success. This Stronghold proudly follows in this manner.The following did annoy me a bit:The UI is clunky and outdated. Things are hidden away or put in obscure places that dont need to be.Pathing is terrible. The pathing example for first time coders, 'Ants' on Netbeans does a better job.Units dont seem to like being on walls.Quirks from the previous Crusader like the tongue in cheek humour from clicking on peasents is gone.Unit graphics are over all poor.To me this just seems largely reflective of the gaming industry as a whole. Lacking direction and decisiveness specifically in regard to a singular vision. "

The AI is very good at bankrupting themseleves, so that is intresting.  Other then that I think walls need a boost of HP and add Siege towers and ladders like the old games.

There are not enough castle deffences and i hate that you can not build certain buildings outside of your 'estate'. I love this game it has given me hours of entertainment and it looks beautiful. love it and the maps people create on the Workshop are great. I like it a lot, but that is my opnion.			"

												I can still recommend the game but I cant help feeling this updated stronghold lacks the raw edge of the original stronghold and stronghold crusader. It somehow  lacks that viewing perspective that made castle warfare so immersive in stronghold/crusader.The game is decent but nothing is done that makes you think ""wow, they certainly improved that part of the game""The difficulty level does seem a little tough  but maybe thats a good thing for stronghold veterans.I'd recommend it at £15, but not £29.99. I'd rate it at 7.2/10			"

												Great and fun game. Some parts of SHC are missing, other new parts were added. Overall I think there's a proper balance between what was lost and what was added. The unit special abilities and formations allow for some really neat approaches to combat which I think are the best part of the game. At times, commanding your group of units and timing their abilities properly feels like playing something like a RPG and gives you the feeling of extra control over who wins the battle :)That being said, the asking price of 34,99€ (currently) is a bit high. I think something like 15€ is more appropriate since you'll most likely want to buy the DLC (~5 eur each) once you get into the game. The DLCs add new characters and campaigns, so they're a must-buy if you enjoy the game.			"

												This is a really good game, don't let the negative reviews fool you if your a fan of stronghold. (Although if you played them all this one might burn you out a bit.) This game is a lot of fun, the battles get very intense, there is not too many ""grace periods"" like in Age of Empires or something like that, its very VERY back and forth. My only complaint is the lack of variance, I wish each AI warlord had there own unique unit or building piece or something like that, there actual LORD unit is usually unique, but ehh.Anyway, this is a really good game, if you were thinking on picking it up, I would recommend, or wait until its on sale if your sceptical. Gameplay is very addicting, and hard as hell. Almost made me feel like a complete noob at one point where I was getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked, on a training trial, on easy....yeah... -_-			"

It is definetly is not worthy of all the negativety it has gotten as it is much better than Stronghold 3 and only has very minor bugs. I hope this is not the last of stronghold and that they will continue to improve since Stronghold 3. This was a step in the right direction. I recommend it if you enjoyed Stronghold Crusaders and if your favorite missions in the original Stronghold were Castle vs. Castle ones.			"

												WARNING: do not spend money on this game at this kind of a price, ITS NOT WORTH IT. So the game itself plays decently according to the Stronghold games but only on certain mechanics of its RTS base ground. NONE of its uniqueness carried on with this game at all. Matter of fact it’s all gone now, the dancing bears, decorations, what made your castle feel like a castle and not a regular RTS base builder base. It used to have vast problems to fix with your people, people even just running around and little things like executions and punishments you can watch them all do that you can’t do here anymore because they made it streamlined. I made the mistake of trusting the game but not even an hour in game told me that I definitely wasted my 50$ that I could have spent ALOT better elsewhere. Get this at a lower price if you want it, ignore peaceful mode unless you just want to stare into nothingness due the games now basing a lot on the RTS side and not its castle sim side which made peaceful mode at least slightly entertaining. But now the game unless a patch improves this IS NOT considered in my opinion a castle building simulator due to its lack of castle life that used to exist that made the other games more unique and different. the entire franchise except the past 2 have been going quite well, unfortunately this games not getting the taste of stronghold I hoped for, but I do hope they add it back in the future because that’s one of the things that made stronghold a different RTS game.

												(This game would be fine as a standalone but crusader 1 fans should read this) As an avid fan of the original stronghold crusader, I cannot say that this game does the original any justice whatsoever.  Many useful buildings (such as the much needed popularity buildings, and the replacement of the different religious buildings with a one-size-fits-all church or mosque) and beloved characters, including the dastardly pig, snake, etc. have been removed in exchange for a handful of what in my opinion are much worse characters.  The economy has lost much depth from one game to the next, many systems (such as leather or hunting) have been trashed in favor of unifying the materials needed to recruit troops (ex: crossbowmen now use plate armor rather than leather).  Not to mention that units such as the horseback archer, engineer, laddermen, miners, and monks have all been discarded, removing an entire aspect of seige warfare from the game. This being said, however, there have been a few good additions to the game, namely more in-depth castle defense (meaning a handful of new defense buildings), even though the developers got rid of moats.  Those of you who have played Stronghold 3 will be glad to know that hoardings and barricades have survived into Crusader II, along with seige engine towers.  The (formerly much-needed) healer unit can now be recruited at the mercenary post.  I'm sure I missed many other changes, but those were the biggest changes that I could recall.I'll stop here since I'm just plain tired, but in conclusion, Stronghold 1 fans should avoid purchasing this (overall disappointing) game.

												I enjoy  the thought playing this game but do not recommend this game to anyone who cant stand bugs and crashing. When i Try to play there is always a high risk of it freezing or crashing. Not to mention all the mechanic bugs during game play. This makes it hard to organize a good attack or try and defend. Troops will run back and forth and never go to the point where they need to be. I don't mind the differences from the first Crusader id just play that if i wanted to its the crashing and bugs that get me. I think This game has good potential but is just too annoying to play. The least the makers could do would be to fix some of the bugs and The crashing There is no point in even playing if you know the game is going to freeze or crash.

												I had such high hopes for this game. I have been a Stronghold Crusader fan for a long time.  I have Crusader HD extreme, and still play that every day. I have all versions of the game, and Crusdaer is by far the best.I even did alfa and Beta testing for Srtonghold Kingdoms.  This is more like latest version is more like Stonghold, the original. But it's not so much that part, It's the part that causes the game to freeze when you finish a mission. That's not good.Or maybe it was because my anti-virus detected it a malware, even after unistalling, seting an exception for the game, and reinstalling, still detected as malware. Still, not good.Try again Firefly.			"

												Worse than the old Strongholds...Boring and a waste of money...Combat is stupid- it takes an age for someone to die. The bit that was always fun about Stronghold- the building and resource harvesting, is fun for a while but becomes pretty one dimentional after a while. I've had the game since it came out but have only got 13 hours on it... says it all i reckon! stick to the old ones and dont waste £30!			"

												paid 50 dollars for the game, i feel like its not worth 10. maybe if this was 1995 the game would be cool. theres not much diversity your buildings, or in troops. or in the maps for that matter. its just a really short loop basically. itll take you an hour or two to figure out the game then its just repeating that hour over and over.

												I loved Stronghold Crusader 1 and I am addicted to Stronghold Crusaders 2! If you are into castle building and fighting off hordes of people then this is your game! The single player is decent and challenging, but it seems that the multiplayer community/gameplay lacks luster. However, Firefly seems to be very persistent in with developing additional DLC for this game to continue fan interest. Overall, if I would have to give this a fair score I would rate it as 8/10 as a Fan from the series and a 7/10 for someone who is just starting out with Firefly games.			"

I played the older games, and well they are 2D but they are probably more fun. This doesn't have very good graphics, even put up all the way. I had never played a stronghold game, and this game seemed supurb to me, then I played the other ones. It doesn't seem like a upgrade to the old games. It feels about the same. There are a lot of issues with the game, it seems more like a downgrade from the older titles.			"

												Dear Firefly,	I really wanted to love Stronghold Crusader 2, but I don't. I was disappointed right from the start. I will address my issues in the order I came across them. Forgive me if I sound petty but I had such excitement for this game and to come across an intro that looks like it came from a 15 year old game was utterly disheartening. I tried to push the fail image of two poorly animated warriors, one who vaguely looks of jack sparrow, out of my mind upon entering the game. The menu seemed ok, nothing wrong at first glance. Looking at the single player options though I was again remorseful. Hardly any missions and nothing that matched the wonderful historic castle mode from the first game. I played every castle in the original stronghold and hoped to see it return with an Arab twist but foolish me. I then chose to see how the game play was. I gasped when it loaded, it seemed like a direct copy of stronghold 2. To say my excitement was dead is an understatement. Pretty epic though, you killed my desire to keep playing this new game in fifteen minutes.	Somehow I managed to keep going despite this sickening feeling in my stomach. I think the final blow was the stunning lack of features I had come to love. It baffles me how you choose to keep such a mundane feature like STAIRS on the barracks but completely destroy all the cool towers and their features. I thought that being able to put troops inside towers was one of the coolest features. Putting siege equipment on large towers a no-brainer, to now be left with stupid ballista scaffolds.... WHAT?! Those would be a great addition to have but not the only option. If you would finally add wooden palisades from the first Stronghold and create some further options with that, then you might have a great set of features. However like I have come to expect from your company you bring more disappointment than Bungie's new story free MMOFPS garbage. Not to mention the lack of innovative wall traps, stone baskets, monks, leather armor, wax for candles (currently material free production), siege towers, diggers, ladder men, moats, workers who repair walls automatically, short walls, and one of the most annoying the ability to lower building height so I can avoid everything getting in my way. Have you tried to build walls it your own game? It can take like 30 seconds to get the wall icon to appear in an area because it is on a corner or near a building. Unless the idea is just build a square and forget about actually making an interesting castle..... IN A CASTLE SIM. Pretty sad when you can't improve on a game you made almost 15 years ago.	I got the game so I could play it with my wife. Stronghold crusader was one of the few games we enjoyed together. Besides for the new one lacking anything exciting or innovative, we need to deal with the worst optimization I have ever experienced. I bought two new computers in anticipation of this games release. To say it runs like dog excrement would be praise. Playing this game over steam with anything over three players on lowest setting is impossible for us. The only thing I have to say to you as a company is this. You are just as useless as EA and Activision if you think you can phone it in like this and promise to make it better with DLC. Why should I give you more money to fail? These things should have already been in the game! It is clear to see you took the mass market video game cookie cutter formula. Make a game and promise how awesome it will be. Focus test everything, then remove every part that might confuse a simpleton. I am surprised you still include Crusaders and Arabs, they might offend someone.			"

												Loved Stronghold Crusader but the 2 is kind of a love hate relationship. There was lots of lag issues when playing with more then 3 players. The more troops we make the harder the game would start to lag. I hope that firefly will fix this because it gets to a point where it is unplayable just because te game doesn't respond to the imput. However I like the new wall breaking animations the new units the new building options the siege warfare and stuff like that is very much fun if you don't have massive large armies that slow down the game.I still recommend this game, not for the ful price of 35€ but when it's on sale you should give it a tryfor the RTS gamer SC 2 is a good addition to your game library and as soon as the lag issues get fixed this game will be worth the 35€  "

												I've put about 4-6 hours into this game before posting this review and overall, I'm pretty unhappy with it. First of all, if your a fan of the series, wait till this game goes on sale. For a big name game being just released, this is pretty sad for the most part. The graphics are good, not great or at least not great compared to other games you are paying for these days. The battle side of the game is pretty frusterating... The units move very quickly and instead of using ""strategy"" to bring a castle down, pretty much need to just throw overwhelming odds of troops to win each battle/castle. Bottomline, not much strategy is necessary. Like city building? This game isn't for you either, it could take you hours to get your castle built and tweeked just the way you like it but it will get destroyed in seconds. The walls basically buy you a minute or two to react or they are coming down. Overall, this is a $20 game or less, not up to date with today's standards. The AI is also horrible, its impossible to play against them, you basically need to build up a defense ASAP and hold off their waves they are sending at you while you build up a wave of your own, they essentually have unlimited resources too which is annoying. The game is pretty laggy too which is sad, I exceed all of the requirements and even toned back the not so great graphics so I'm guessing this is still alittle buggy. Even if the AIs are fixed, the overall battling is poor and lacks any strategy. Its hard to experiment with troops when their impact is only noticed if they have armor or not. Overall... buy this on sale.Update 10/17They updated the game, they fixed the resources issue for AIs (They seemed to have unlimited before) They did not fix gameplay performance however... still very glitchy, some aspects have gotten worse. Some units glitch and glide across the map now. It would be a huge improvement if they would just slow down the speed of units and attack of units, its hard to use the features/benefits of the units when the units move and attack so fast, by the time you decide on troop placement, the battle is probably over and the winning side is clearly winning. The game now crashes, never had this issue. The glitchy movement is still very present while playing, making some commands unregistered. Not a great release still, not worth the money spent upfront either yet unfortunately, i'll start playing again when they release another update.			"

												Hmm, what I can say.Crusader 2 certainly ain't no proper sequel to Crusader in terms of quality.First and foremost, the game feels much more like Stronghold 2, Legends and 3 than Crusaders in terms of gameplay.This mustn't automatically mean the game was bad but due to Crusader 2 being very floaty in its controls and Unit & Building management feels like a slap in the face of people who might have thought ""Neat, a sequel to one of the comfiest games ever made? Gotta buy that♥♥♥♥♥♥"" because this ain't it.What's more is the overall lower quality of the game.Yes, the game now is full 3D, for the better or worse, but going 3D meant leaving the aesthically pleasing look of Crusaders in the dust (Pun intented) replacing it with a shiny look of ""Hi PC, I'm here, you seeing that neat glow around me?"" which might have been a necessity due to how many modern RTS are visualizing their creations.Still, the old 2D seemingly allowed for a far more detailed and thematically fitting look.Also the sound files of all the random speech-tidbits your Scribe might give or how Units respond feels extremly amateurish to how they were in FireFly Studios prior games, Stronghold 3 excluded. For a lack of better words, the new VA somehow sound too clean. This is especially noticeable in how most of the arabian mercenaries respond. They sound jarringly western in Crusader 2 whilst in Crusader they sounded arabian alright. (can't say anything about their pronounciation or of how certain words are meant to be carried with intoning and such all)And I'm quite disgruntled that Crusader 2 is severly lacking in castle building options.Only having 3 towers to build, ridicilously sized gatehouses, set staircases, no lower walls, moats, drawbridges.....all the fun stuff of a Castle you might exspect.Also, where did the notion come from to nerf range on pretty much all units excepts bowmen to this extent? What good is a towermounted ballista if it only manages to fire ONCE prior to be fired upon by enemy archers itself?Or catapults/warwolfs being seemingly OUTRANGED by bowmen?Overall I would neither recommend getting Crusader 2 based on it being a ""sequel"" to a top-notch game nor because the game itself was good.It's bad, its controlschemes and overall playerfreedom are floaty and the game feels like it was made somewhere around 2004.A real blunder FireFly Studios :/The one thing I will recommend tho is if you're interested in a medieval castle simulator, you should just check out Stronghold Crusader/Extreme.It offers pretty much all this game does + way more, allows for far greater personal choice when it comes to castle layouts, bigger maps, bigger ""estates"" (who comes up with this crap?) much bigger armies and a more varied cast of characters with more established characters.Also a pretty damn neat singleplayer Challengecourse			"

												Pros:-lots of troop types-castle wall building and options is well made-good maps-projectiles cant just fly over anything or through, walls and mountains will stop themCons:-Shallow game base with no tec advancements -limited to designated map zone, I dislike only having one home base-war is too simplistic-A.I. is clearly cheating, you cant cut off resources-limited troop formationsConclusion:All in all I had fun to start and enjoyed building my castle but once it was complete I was unable to advance out side my zone and can't capture new zones and I found the tec advancement to be non existent resulting in a poor mid to end game.I don't think they will ever correct the disappointment I had in this game but if they do I will change my vote.

												Ive been a fan of the stronghold series since the early 2000s, ive played the original stronghold, and moved up from there, and looking back, the game has come a long way, we got some new troops, in crusader, and some more mechanics here and there, with these new characters coming out, this is shaping up to be good, except i feel like we deserve more, more units more types of buildings, the selection has not changed much, in the time the games have been out, and that is dissapointing itself. The games are great, and i will continue following and playing, but wish for more selection in  buildings and troops that we should have gotten along the way.			"

												A return to form for Firefly studios and you should purchase this game if you're at all interested in the premise.The gameplay is a development on the originals but still solid and deeply compelling.  Complementing the past titles rather than replacing them. Firefly has shown a commitment to improving the game and there's no doubt its a future classic of the genre.			"

												Sadly, I don't. This game was great when I was younger - this title seems to be made with so little effort. Very disapointed in FireFly studios. Its like they didn't update he game at all from the previous titles. Poor Graphics and video options. Thje graphics look like the literally have not changed since the previous titles.Game is buggy as hell and its a year old. You can't even alt-tab without crashing.			"

												JUST SO YOU KNOW because i did not, this is actually a triple a title! (AAA) ha! i had no idea man do they know how to diguise this game as a small project. and now that i know this is a AAA game i feel like they just said it was that and then just simply said heres the game. few months later they release dlc?!?  even when this TRIPLE A GAME STILL ISNT PLAYABLE BY MOST OF YOUR CONSUMERS. so most of my new found hatred is because this is supposed to be a triple a game. i have the same love hate with eso. accept they atleast have a playable game before they release dlc.unplayable without a godly computer i'd say i have a medium/low computer only cause of the gpu and cpu are the same card... but i can play games lik rust and stuff with low graphics just fine i turn it on for this game... i just can't play with computers...  so i feel like i instead just kick started a game, or just gave an old devolpement company money to help it stay alive... for 40$ no, just no buy the older stronghold crusader for a fraction of the price. same thing happend with aoe. they focused on graphics and looks rather then gameplay in age of empires three ITS STILL A GREAT GAME DONT GET ME WRONG but there were a lot of uneeded things that couldve been options such as maxed houses to help lower end pc's. anyways this game does the same sort of thing they redress old things that dont need to be fixed. and add in pointless things and units. an example in both aoe 3 and this game is how fast buildings and walls go. if this game is supposed to be realistic then why do walls fall so fast compared to stronghold crusader? i cant even give this game a fair rating simply because i can't play it. without more then 4 fps.  SIMPLY PUT: dont buy unless you have god computer.don't buy unless you get this game first then the older strongholds to make those more appreciative compared to this what i would call unplayable garbage... until they fix these i cannot change this otherwise.

												Given my experiences with this game, I would be hard-pressed to reccomend this game to friends, especially with the current asking price.  Firefly Studios rigorously distanced themselves from Stronghold 2 when promoting this game, and rightfully so, the former being a disaster of a game that tried too many things with too little map space.  Firefly also touted this game as being a return to its roots, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader.  Unfortunately, while the same level of complexity in the game was restored, many gameplay elements leave something to be desired and are lacking.My first con for this game is the maps.  My favorite maps in Stronghold Crusader were:  I can't remember the names, but hopefully anyone reading this that has played Crusader knows which ones I am talking about and then continue with my review:  1) The map in which one player is in the center on top of a hill with all grassland.  There is then one player in the top left, and two in each of the other corners.  Grasslands are available in the corners and along the sides for a bit.  2) A Friend Indeed I think its called, 6 player map, you start within screen width of your ally, most of the map is grass.  And a map where it is all a dense forest with little to no Iron, 6 players.  As one might gather, I have a preference for maps in which food is plentiful but one would be hardpressed to defend the vast area, allowing one to strategically build casles rather than strategically defend a small scarce (or non-existant) farm land.  Stronghold Crusader 2 does not offer this option.  All of the maps have either small amounts of grass, no grass at all, or have it right next to your castle so you cannot build walls without surrounding the grass or building over it.  The fact this game does not offer maps such as that dissappoints me.  The game tries to make it easier to gather food by increasing each facilities output (I only need 4 wheat farms and 4 bakeries to support a population of 60), but that takes away from the experience for me.Next, they tweaked how castle defences work, for the worse I think.  One cannot build castle artillery on towers anymore, instead requiring wooden towers that are placed over straight sections of wall.  This would be tolerable, if one could place these wooden towers diagonally, since I favor walls on the corners of my castles.  In Crusader I would favor the strategy of building many large towers on the corners of my castle and stack them with balistae.  Not possible here.  They also changed how military units work: removing the need for leather armor on macemen, requiring metal armor for crossbowmen, etc.  Not a big deal maybe, but these small things made the strategy for me.  On top of that, a small group of bowmen can kill a similar number of knights' horses, nutralizing the appeal of mounted knights...I would expect horses in armor to have smilar health to a pikeman, not fall to ~2-3 arrows.The ""estate"" system they have decided to keep is also an irk of mine.  You cannot build walls in areas that are not assigned to an estate.  In some cases, this means you cannot build walls 10 squares away from your castle. (~1/4 screen width).  This is very annoying.They also decided to keep the same graphics of Stronghold 2, Legends, 3, etc.  I find it ironic that the sprites of Stronghold Crusader look better than these new graphics.  I also find it semi annoying that there is no unit collision.  Lack of collision kills the strategy of melee on melee formations and blockading.  I recall numeroues times I defeated opponents that had a superior melee force by just running a majority of my force past their units, since that is an exploit with this system.Ok one might say, I should expect changes in a sequel to balance the gameplay.  I don't think these things are balanced.  I find them to be a pain (balistae towers) and unrealistic (unarmored macemen).    Because of all of these unfavorable changes, the lack of map variation, etc, I cannot reccomend this game to any of my friends.			"

												Welcome to the Stronghold Crusader II Review!Starting words: I really dislike writing Reviews but for this game there are so many lack luster reviews it saddens me and they are not really reviews just garbage and people complainin about bugs, wich has nothing to do in a review but in the support forums of firefly and bug support.... so i was thinking my self i do a review.First up, i do nor own the dlc's yet soon as i get them i will get to do a review on them aswellPro's and Con's:______________________________________________________________+The grafics arent as bad as everyone is claiming them to be, they are solid.[and Grafics are not really important for the amount of fun you can have with a game!!!]______________________________________________________________+The AI is punishing especially on very low resources makes for some great game[the AI cheats but it does nowa days in everygame!)______________________________________________________________+Map versatility there are a good amount of different maps to play with and it can be interessting fightin an all out last stand against 7 AI's______________________________________________________________+Gameplay is far better than in other Stronghold's, battle is more intense more often and you can have a 500 strong man corps wich is very large!______________________________________________________________+Music is just great, i don't get why people say it is not epic??? most of it is from the Original Crusader______________________________________________________________+Multiplayer with AI( very important for me since i hate playing with random douches..)______________________________________________________________+The UI is simple and easy to use/get used to, wich is great for newcomers______________________________________________________________+It is actually dedicated to the Former Crusader fans therefore it is not a new supremecommander,Starcraft 2 or any other RTS it actually stays true to the FANBASE[ the universe can't comprehend this many Pro's i am giving for this fact!).______________________________________________________________-The AI is using more and more little ambushing troops instead of massing units and siege you allout, wich makes it some times bothersome to play specific AI.______________________________________________________________-Map's are not Large enough(for me that is) and there for no one needs horses ?!(and horses are lackluster).______________________________________________________________-Ballista does not one shot units ????? i think it should no man or Woman can survive a 2 meterslong bolt throug their body?.______________________________________________________________-Unit stacking on Towers(really really unencouraging people to build big nice looking castles and get people on the walls...______________________________________________________________For me this is what i love and Hate bout the game, the AI is far Superior to Crusader, but only for the aggressive part dfeensive they are really not doing anything except using traps,(differs from AI to AI) the weak AI enemys are not utiilisyng anything that could let them survive a serious besiege'ing wich is.. sad. They are also not using the full potential of there Castels there are rarely any units on the walls..______________________________________________________________So why do you need to buy this game?______________________________________________________________Well the Anwser is easy, really;  It is a Great GAME that gives you alot of time to play around there is even a Map Editor wich you can play hours with it before actually creating you're own map and SHARE it on Steam Workshop, if you have friends you can have some tight battles against the ai if you combine different strength lvls on AI it is getting even more interesting.______________________________________________________________BTW: i did not encounter any bugs, they have been tended to, and been fixed.Please ignore those reviews who are just writting something on 1 Dislike basis and one stupid bug... games where never perfect and they just get more complex so they never will be perfect!______________________________________________________________i can Reccomend the vanilla game for full price, you won't regret it if you love building you're own castle and then battle it all out!

												I am appalled at what Stronghold Crusader 2 has become. I am a huge fan of the original game. This is just horrendous. Let me list a few of the biggest flaws. 50/50 Building Limit? are you f*king kidding me? A limit? There was no limit in the first game, you could build as big as you wanted too. I was in a multiplier game, and then I hit this limit, I immediately exited the game. I will not play with limitations, my computer has 32gb of memory, 4.6ghz processing power. I can play multiple games at the same time and experience no lag, and yet I'm limited to a measly 50 building and 125 people, what the f*ck is wrong with you?What do you think happened to Maxis with Simcity5 and their ""We will not build bigger maps"" excuse., they're no longer in business! Everyone was fired. And now City Skylines has taking over that arena with millions of players. and has no limitations. Its brilliant. best game ever made for modders. Ok, on to the next, There is absolutely nothing new to this game at all, its the same assets with 3d graphics.Which is fine, if it was made correctly. The graphics actually suck. They're pathetic, like they could of been made 5 years ago. The animations are just terrible. Bugs:Mouse Disappears consistently.Horse archers don't even shoot when attacked they sit there and die.GAME IS UNBALANCED, resources take too long. And with a building limit, ultimately. you're screwed.You have like 20 apple, cheese, pig farms and yet you're running out of food for no reason (too slow)The BEST part of this game, is the stone walls, the animation as its breaking down, and the building of how they interact with the buildings. By far this is one of the worst games I have every played, yet I loved the original. You ruined it. Destroyed what could of been something good. Whoever thought this was a finish game should go hang themselves right now, it's so pathetic. I wouldn't pay a god damn dime for this horse sh*t. Thank god I bought it on sale, otherwise I'd be asking for a refund and then ask for pay for the time I spent testing this unfinished unreasonable product. The people who built this game fit this tag: amatures			"

												Don't let nostalgia fool you. After Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader, this series went straight to hell. Fireflys studios has either been replaced with all new people, or the old team has lost their creative spark. I really enjoyed the first two games for their minimalist approach on medieval warfare, but that has since been replaced with excessive features and components. This game is just cluttered with soldiers, peasants (villagers), and other buildings and requirements that you have to worry about. It doesn't have a smooth flow to it, and it underperforms greatly for the year in which it was released.This studio has been leeching off the success of its games released over a decade ago. They have failed to come out with anything good in relation to the ""Stronghold"" series since those first two games. Don't take my word for it, look at metacritic. This game is not fun.Lastly, Firefly Studios, you really disappointed me with your customer service. I ordered the game with a description stating that I *would* receive the bonus campaigns, but I never received them. To my surprise, your support was less than willing to help in any way possible. Because of that, I had an extremely short campaign experience. It's laughable that you sell your game like this to all new customers now. Holding back on content never helps the consumer.It appears both the game and team behind the game are of lack-luster quality. To all potential customers, spend your money elsewhere.			"

												I strongly recommend this game, in that I've been an avid Stronghold Series fan, and have been for a long time, with, ironically enough, the first game I played being Stronghold Crusader. I've spent 90 hours playing this game (I'm sure people play(ed) this longer than I have), and am still impressed with how the devs went with this game. The only downside I have is the map editor being its seperate program, but that's just me, it's still an awesome program regardless. My only issue with the main gameplay, however, is the Caliph... ¬~¬ (that is the only time I'll have a face on here, ever) He looks TOO CLOSE to being an Englishman, rather than an Arab inhabitant of the desert. I'd prefer the turban and bandit face mask he had from the first Stronghold Crusader game, than this guy with the face of an Englishman and the beard of a muslim, with the voice of an Englishman's attempt at an Arabic-English-influenced accent. Fix that one part to where he should be originally, then I'm pretty much good and set for the rest of the gameplay. Yes, there are others who are posting NEGATIVE comments about this game, but from what I can tell, most of them have valid arguments regarding what they think are the biggest issues, but there are also those who think ""Oh, this game is too damn expensive."" That's because they either a) didn't work in a job, or b) would rather be cheapskates and buy it for the lowest price possible. Here's a life lesson tip for ya, and I learned this the hard way: Gaming IS NOT a stock market! You don't haggle the price, the donors to the companies who makes these games DO. We just buy a provided product. Deal with it. The ones with the most valid arguments are largely about the in-game issues, such as the lag and the bugs and all the other things; I want to make it known here and now in the next paragraph below.The issues about the problems in-game?THESE WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED IN TIME!! TRUST YOUR DEVELOPING OVERLORDS AT FIREFLY! Yes, it was a joke they're the overlords, but the analogy suggests why I included the term anyway; the issues found about bugs and lag and terrible multiplayer gameplay WILL be addressed, but with TIME can it be done. Yes, they will release patches, but the sheer amount of coding it takes for these issues to be released as a massive conglomerate of coding fixes for the bugs and the lag and multiplayer gameplay takes a huge amount of time, so ALL PLAYERS NEED TO BE PATIENT FOR THEIR RELEASE(S)! Please respect the amount of work the developers put into this game for YOU guys to judge this, BASED ON what you experienced already. The developers will take the time out of their lives to provide for you guys the fixes you demand, so PLEASE respect their time, devotion, and dedication to make you guys happy. Accept what they are and what they HAVE given you. Now, this game's many issues I've experienced, but I have no quarrel with them, as I experience lag a lot on Minecraft and Sins of a Solar Empire, compared to this. That is nothing to me. Bugs? I flick them off as I do real ones. Price? REASONABLE! Buy it at Target, if you want it cheap. I payed $20.00 for this game and 2 extra non-included DLC as I would only get the regular game from this store page. Long story short, this game is great, has major/minor in-game issues, players need to respect developer dedication and work to this game, and price is very reasonable, stop being crusty cheapskates.

												Thank goodness I got this game for 80% off on a sale. It is in no way a $50 AAA title. Graphics are a throwback to a good 10 years ago. Game momentarily freezes every time it does a save and then jerks around your last input request as it catches up. Crashed or locked up a couple times already. The game's overall pacing is much quicker than I recall, too, being less like a ""castle sim"" and more like a standard RTS that happens to have slightly more advanced than usual wall construction. Control inputs and notifications are out-of-date (no queing of orders? no notice when enemies are knocking down my buildings?)A.I. is a nice challenge. Very well done in that regard. It's the only reason I'm tempted to recommend this game. The technical problems and downfalls overall will keep me from going all the way to complete the game, though, I can feel it dragging at me already. And seriously, this was a $20 title at best. It would only be a $50 title of this was the year 2000, because that it clearly where it hails from, controls, graphics and all.			"

Brief Review:""Place your stockpile sire!"" ~ Right in the nostalgic feels. I've been playing the Stronghold games on hard-copy ever since I was a nipper and I've spent untold amount of hours on these bloody games, over-throwing the wolf in the original campaign and making dozens of different scenarios in Stronghold: Crusader's customizable skirmishes. We won't mention Stronghold 2 or 3 however. So you can imagine just how excited I was when I see Stronghold: Crusader II announced! First Impressions: Nostalgic feeling. Gameplay & controls are the same.  Graphics are the same as Stronghold 2/3. Hardly much improvement. If any.Positives: Retains all the qualities of a Stronghold game. Have I already mentioned it's nostalgic? Plenty of campaign options and DLC for bonus content. Thankfully they've incorporated a custom skirmish mode, unlike some previous Stronghold games.  Multiplayer is fun - but testing. Negatives: They've removed some content; Such as when you click on a building, you could select between ""Bow"" and ""Crossbow"" for example. Now you need to build separate buildings for these and many other things you used to once be able to make your buildings multi-purpose. They've removed mini-video content of the buildings when you used to click on them.  There's very little that's new. This just feels like the first Stronghold Crusader - very disappointing. Overall:This game is most definitely NOT worth the price it's been retailed at. I am a massive Stronghold fan and sure, they've had their ups and downs with previous games, but I thought they might've made this game the polished diamond of the series thus far - however, it falls very short of being anything better than the first Stronghold Crusader game.I'm very saddened they haven't ventured anywhere new with the game. The units are the same, apart from a few new additional units you can purchase from the Mercenary Camp. Otherwise, they've taken A LOT of the content away and made the game feel very bare... No, I'm not even joking. I'd rate this game 4/10, it's very disappointing. They've gone nowhere new with it and even stripped it back, making it feel empty. Disappointed sums it up.			"

												Game can be fun, singleplayer is fun, and the game is more challenging. my real concern is the multiplayer and the in game images that the developers are using. First off the multiplayer: is is all about building thick walls at the borders, man them up with crossbowmen, healers and banner carriers and harrash other players with horse archers and then finnish them of, really fun... the other this is the propaganda images that the developers are using. It shows huge castles, huge armies but I have never, ever, EVER seen those thing when playing the game. the housing and money making system is a bit f*cked as well.			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 HD is probably the best installment of the Stronghold series. This is the version I keep finding myself coming back to time after time after time. The units, buildings, and economics run smoother and more intuitively in this version than in any other. The action is fast paced though so if war isn't your thing, make sure to jump into the economic series!			"

												Excellent GameAll the bad reviews doesn't give the game a good reflection. Its my 1st stronghold game and I love it. I played ages of empires 3 for years and I loved it to bits. But I must say, that the depth of stronghold 2 beat age of empires. Buy the game and make your own opinion. In my opinion is it really worth it. I see myself playing this for along time. The way the AI interact with you is a huge bonus. With age of empire , after a while everything feels the same and it looses some appeal. But with stronghold there's a new challenge every time you play. Even the AI are much more intelligent. This game gets a 8/10 from me. "

Product received for free
												I am a fan of the stronghold series. I played Stronghold 1 and the original Stronghold:Crusader. They were all great. they gave the player the feeling that he was controling actual human beings. When you clicked on them they would give you their oppinion of your way of ruling, taxes, and so on. Now when i click on somebody i hear only the clicking of my mouse. Nothing. Only silence. The economy system here is imbalanced. Most structures(if not all) reqire a lot of resources, but the harvesters and workers don't produse enought. The cost has increased dramatically in commparison to the original but the gatherers produse the same. So often you will find yourself in urgent need of recourses no matter no much you start with. The A.I. is a cheat, and they do not need their recource buildings to produce more of everything. I tested it. Destroyed all economy buildings of the computer and yet he continued to amass an army to block out the sun! Yes i admit this game is better than Stronghold 3, but making a game better than another in the franchise doesn't always mean that it will be a sucsess. The game is something no doubt about it, but if the player doesn't wanna get his a## kicked by the easiest A.I. no matter he gave it minimum recources and himself maximum available he should play multiplayer. Random events keep the game fresh true, but some are way too powerful and can turn the tide of a battle-I like it! All in all it is up to the reader to decide watever if he wants to play the game. It is a great multiplayer experience but the singleplayer if f##k hard because the A.I. is a cheat(as i said earlier). The game is best at bringing back my nostalgia to original Stronghold games. The first were the best. Those who liek the game have eider never played a TRUE stronghold came(AKA the original 2 about i keep ranting about obviously!) or keeps on nostalgia and it is stronger that fan rage(probably a rare individual). If any of you unfortunate souls want to play like  real stronghold's ruler play the 2 originals. I strongly recomend the original Crusader(man, i miss its features-too bad most were F##KING REMOVED!).			"

												I have loved the Stronghold games for years. In my mind, Stronghold Crusader 1 was the best of all of them. I was so exceited for Stronghold Crusader 2, hoping for a worth sequel, unfortunately, this is not at all it. I was hopeful since it is far more streamlined than Stronghold 2, actually had skirmish mode unlike 3. Instead of capitalizing on the strengths of the first Crusader, everthing was re-done, the units lost all their balance, the productivity of the buildings was completely marred to where the economics of the game are completely unbalanced and in my mind completely broken. Further the AI went down the toilet. They actually presented challeneges in Crusader 1. In 2 they are slow and absolutly the worst at defending, Further, the AI in Crusader 1 were bound by the human players rules, no cheating which was refreshing. Now the AI can just spawn stuff. This completely ruins alliances. In SC1, when you sent good to your ally, you were actually helping them out, not in SC2 its completely irrelevent. All of this would be forgivable, except that the game now crawls. It is so slow, so borring, it just drags along until you economy finlly catched up and you can attack your oponents. The actual gameplay and progression is horribly broken. It takes forever to get your economy on its feet before you can even think of attacking. Overall, this game is a complete dissapointment. I need to learn to stop buying their new games, nothing can top Stronghold 1, and Crusader 1. Not because of nastalgia, but because the games are simply better. The game speed, progression, unit and economy balancing, everything. MAJOR FAIL.			"

												Non je ne recommande pas ce jeu ! Pour moi firefly c'est encore bien lourdé ! c'est une déception...Etant un gros joueur du premier crusader celui ci me laisse un gout amere..-Les graphismes bon ok ce n'est pas le plus important mais c'est a peine plus beau que stronghold 2 sortit en 2005 ! Pourquoi diable firefly s'entête à faire leur jeux en 3D?? Ils n'y arrivent pas ! c'est mal optimisé pour ce que c'est et c'est moche , vide... ! Un belle 2D aurai été grandement plus bénéfique .-Le gameplay mon dieux que c'est lent ! sauf pour les IA bizzarement mdr tout est plus chere que le premier ce qui tue la fluidité et la rapidité du jeu qui étais bonne dans le premier quand on connaissais les ficelles de l'économie. BIensur le nombre de troupe est ULTRA LIMITE et merci qui ? merci au moteur 3D qui pue...Certain élément du premiers ont disparue comme les douves , moin de construction pour les défenses du chateaux : pas de tour carré , ronde , de défense ext.. juste une de guet , tour moyenne et grande et pis basta au final les chateaux se ressemble tous plus ou moin bof ! -Le son bah rien d'extraordinaire mise a part les voix qui nous donnes envie de nous jeter par la fenetre avec l'ordi mdrLes voix sont RIDICULE , déja un peu dans le premier mais ils avaient leur charme ! la c'est vraiment d'un surjoué ! et puis bon dieux quand le scribe annonce un message de l'ia c'est vraiment craignos exemple : Vous avez un message de richard... mdr on parle de richard coeur de lion pas de richard le pagu du coin !♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sa c'est du détaille qui fais tache !

												I love the Stronghold series, but I cant reccomend this game. They got a lot wrong here in an effort to make it a game more based on war rather then economy, and the end result is unfortunately not all that fun. let me explain why.The devs said over and over while the game was in development that they were trying to recreate the fast paced skirmish mode feel you got when you played the origional stronghold crusader. While this is a good intention, the end result pretty much adds up to the enemy sending countless waves of small suicide squadrons to your castle CONSTANTLY, never bothering to create larger seige forces as a reaction to your castle growing larger. It is flat out tedious. At the end of a skirmish match when it says you killed literally around 3,000 enemy archers, you just want to smack yourself in the face.They also majorly streamlined the popularity and economic systems from previous games, so now keeping your people happy is as simple as making sure they have food. Making money boils down to making ridiculously high numbers of breweries and candle shops so your peasants are happy enough that you can raise your taxes. So your castle will always be the biggest candle factory and beer company in the Holy Land. Thats very realistic.Apart from that, they also decided to take out the funny little things your peasants said when you click on them, which is kinda sad, and they descided to release more AI opponents two by two in DLCs, after only giving you an insulting eight opponents at launch, while the origional Crusader gave you eleven at launch. and for this high price? its a rip off.Sorry Stronghold fans, this was not the redemtion from Stronghold 3 that you were looking for. At least it functions, though.			"

												I was very disapointed with this game. Don't believe any hype or marketing statements. I'm a huge fan of Stronghold Crusader but not the Stronghold series. This sequel changed EVERYTHING that made the original so good. The style of the game is like the original stronghold and feels slow when trying to place buildings. I don't know what to call it; gameplay, interface, style, layout or actually all of them, but it changed too much. The graphics are actually worse. This game was a waste of money. Certain concepts with the siege equipent were good. The game had a process of which you had to watch take place and had control of (and could manipulate during warfare or running an efficient economy) which are not there anymore. I can't stand to play it very long because it looks awful.  "

												I don't write many reviews but I feel like I need to write a review about this game. Like a majority of people I have mixed feelings about this game. It's like the earlier style of stronghold games. It is very unlike the first stronghold crusader. I didn't mind the change at first. But after playing for a while I noticed that the selecting and placing of buildings felt very awkward and sluggish. If you have played you probably know what I mean. Some of the siege units that are supposed to keep my troops ""safe"" get killed so fast by so few enemies. Before you blame the sluggishness of the building placement on my computer it definitely isn't my computer. I have a very good gaming computer so don't be blaming it on that. I want to like this game but I just can't. I would recommend buying the first stronghold crusader. It is a much better game. "

												Firefly really pulled themselfes together here. Crusader 2 is very well done.The graphics are a little issue between low and high, if your rig can't handle this game on high, everything is exetmely low res, and it can heavily impact how the game feels. If you can run high, everything is pristine and beautiful. There seems to be no middle ground.So far I have encounted very few bugs, tho it seems the community has ran into quite a few problem's. Most I have not meet myself. The worst that plaged me would be a few crashes, and troops getting stuck on walls. The gameplays is very bang on to Crusader quick paced, tho some games on large maps can drag on for a little while so prepare for an hour or two fight. But all in all, it is a great game, I haven't enjoyed stronghold so much since Crusader 1. I would give this a game a 8\10. "

												I was 9 when the original Stronghold Crusader was released by Firefly Studios, and that game took me a lot, so play constantly with friends and relatives. When the second game was announced about a year ago, I was incredibly impressed by the news and the possibility that a new game could be created on the basis of the first. And so it was: Stronghold Crusader 2 is the son of that passion and the fun that were the basis of the first game, and it evolves both graphically and in terms of gameplay, but keeping firmly the values and emotions that have been the strength of the first game. So after 13 years I still find myself playing these two beautiful games, which I strongly recommend to all lovers of history and strategy.			"

												I loved the original string of Firefly games. They worked hard to try and match the feels from those early editions. The game is a rapid mix of base building, economic management and attacking counters. The strategy in this is quite good with a lot of work done to balance things out. This release does lack much of the charm the original stronghold games had. The art style used to be focused on detail, cities feeling alive within its inhabitants. What's left is an ugly shell of a game trying to replicate the strengths of its predecessor. Still worth a go for its online play and there's enough content in here if you're into AI skirmishes.			"

The controls of units and how the combat system plays out is one of the worst things I have used and the fact unit stacking is still an issue I would rather just play Stronghold 2.

												I'm sorry I don't know why anyone dosent like this game! I have boughten alll of the Stronghold game yet, and this one is by FAR one of their best. This may just be me speaking because of how salty I was about Stronghold three, but we needed something like this! Now all they have to do is remake Stronghold Legends...-P.S. I'm sorry for the bad english, it's not my first language.			"

												I am really trying to like this games, but it is making it soooo hard for me to. Loved the original and missed playing it with my partner. So, we forked out the $s on 2 copies so we could play together. Has been a total disaster so far. Problems I'm facing: * Game is totally unbalanced, so between super hard and completely impossible, even when you make the setting easy and in your favour. * Lots of glitches. Eg. Enemy soldier glitched and was stuck on one of my walls. I couldn't kill him,  repair the wall  or build anything near it. Basically killed that match for me and my partner. * Game is super laggy. * Difficult to select and place items. Sometimes have to click on something multiple times for it to be selected. Very jumpy when placing items. Will end up putting items not where you indicated they should be, so can't make optimal use of space. I will continue to give it a go, as at times it shows promise, and we spent our hard-earned $s on it!!			"

												Feel genuinely ripped off. I cannot understand how 10yrs later the graphics can look worse. I would rather have had an extension pack for the original. £There is absolutely nothing to redeem this game. At least♥♥♥♥♥♥Turpin wore a mask.			"

												A very quality Game with Great Graphics and down to earth gameplay. I really enjoyed the Military options and diversification of units. There are also drawbacks, such as they took out some of the features. I have played all of the Stronghold Series and I have to say this is my favorite simply because I can enjoy the gameplay with my friends and not have to worry about any over powered tactics.			"

CASTLE BUILDINGFor a series whose focus is creating the most impenetrable defence, there isn't much customization going on, wallsYou have two wall types: single wall piece, big wall with crenulations on each side, stairs.

In crusader, units could move from tower to tower. That is, if you put a wall with some stairs on one side and connect it to a tower, then connect this tower to another, you could order your units to go from the stairs unto the last tower.

												I really enjoyed the stronghold series. I like playing this one just because i like trying to beat the game and all the missions but for some reason i am not enjoying this one more than the first stronghold crusader. You are missing features the old one had but it does add new features such as physics and new troops. BUt what really gets me is the selling your items is a rip off and the enemy AI always starts with siege equipment. Makes the game kinda unfair but if you can see right past those errors you will enjoy this game.  In my opinion the first one is WAY BETTER!! ProSteam workshopgraphics are nicenew mercenary troops, like healer, flame pot thrower, slavedriveNew physics can take small villagesOnline multiplayer through steamConsAi UnbalancedDLC too overpriced for what shouldve been inn gameMissing things from the first one: No laddermen, seige towers, moats, and engineers!

												Happy i got it in the humble bundle. Not worth anything like £29,99 maybe £6.99 on a good day. Stronghold Crusader 2 does not live up to the original games. Multiplayer games often crash or desync. Base building is rather thoughtless. Does not seem like firefly studio made much effort or cared about making this a good game, rather I suspect it was more of a cash grab which is sad because it could have been so much more.			"

												The graphic are very dated. I'm amazed since this game came out this year. The graphics are not even as good as Age of   Empire 3 and it came out in 2005. You can't queue your guys to move or produce or fight. Even small groups of men move without any ease or grace. Troops movement is almost like they are gliding rather than walking. This game just isn't worth the price they are charging. Don't buy this game....just keep playing Age of Empires 3.			"

												I played this game for some hours now, and at first i thought about giving the game a positive review. Positive aspects are the for Stronghold well-known building of a castle, and there are now some additional trading options that are really helpful to automate the economy. The main reasons why i give a negative review are: At first, you are welcomed with a ten second long, bad rendered intro sequence. It seems unfinished and is wretched. Then, the developers come up with another effrontery: ""Type your Email to receive bonus-flags!"". When i saw that you even get an achievement for signing in with your Email, the game was done for me. Besides, the game is laggy, the graphic is not on an acceptable standart and the old principle is adopted identically, even the music is the same. Conclusion: You do not play Stronghold for the graphics, so just buy and play the first one. It is not a bad game, but the mentioned impudences of the developers really detain me to spend money on this (i played it at a Free-Weekend).			"

												very reminiscent of the the first stronghold Crusader. same voive acting, same units, same general concept. exsept they added some twisits and turns to make it very refreshing. the graphics have had a slight update and the animations have gotten cleaner and some new units are in play. its still IS the first game at its core but i just find i enjoy this one more then the first for whatever reason.those new to the series will find this quite enjoyable, the economy aspect is there and functions well but is not so strong as to devote all your time to it. the military and fighting is just as important as it and it finds a really, really nice balance between the two. its a really good game. 8/10 for pure enjoyment it losses a point for no large scale changes like new voices or a stronger ""campaign"" thing. and another for a lack of a wow facter. that being said. its pure fun and i keep coming back to it, and im sure you will too			"

												Put simply, it's fun, though pretty heavily flawed. I would'nt recommend gettting it at full price, though if it goes on sale for 50% off or more, then I think it's worth checking out.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, and in some ways it is a fun game, but overall it suffers from so many terrible design flaws I can't recommend it.  The skirmish missions are the most frustrating aspect of the game.  Horrible friendly AI, impossibly difficult scenarios, etc...  The story mode is way too short and the story itself is completely forgetable.  Horrible sound effects and music.  Some aspects of the economy are pointless.  Many units are worthless.  All in all the game is just very poorly designed and antiquated compared to other modern RTS games.  Don't waste your money.			"

CASTLE BUILDINGFor a series whose focus is creating the most impenetrable defence, there isn't much customization going on, wallsYou have two wall types: single wall piece, big wall with crenulations on each side, stairs. Simple? Yes, customizable? Not really. 1 had small walls, pleaceable crenulations, a moat. flammable pitch.towersTowers are sort of there, but where in crusader, the most expensive one cost only 80 stone, in 2 it reaches 220. In crusader, units could move from tower to tower. That is, if you put a wall with some stairs on one side and connect it to a tower, then connect this tower to another, you could order your units to go from the stairs unto the last tower. In 2, each tower has to be connected to a wall leading to stairs to be reachable. Not gamebreaking but can really ♥♥♥♥ with the castle design and is a waste of resources.Defensive tools2 removes the need for engineers garrisoning tower-mounted ballistas/catapults and just has you put them on a wall section.The wooden pseudo-tower on a wall section is a terrible idea, although I've got to welcome removing engineers.Many ways to decorate your castle are missing and the new brazier sucks.verdict1 winsCASTLE WRECKINGWhere 1 suffered from too little units, 2 has a lot of them, mostly unnecessary.Unit diversityIt's really unfair to compare the two, stronghold vanilla had only 7 units, crusaders' remedy was cloning those 7 except wiht oriental haplogroups.  In this regard, c2 gets to field out all it can.European units are simplified, for example the maceman now doesn't require leather armor, Really costy ones there too.EngineersIngegneri vil razza dannata!One thing I'm glad is the removal of engineers, having to amass a lot of those guys and send them one by one to build 5 coin mantlets is a chore I'm glad to go without. Having a siege camp pump out all I need is a welcome addition in this regard.RecruitmentPart of the old stronghold formula is the 24 unit recruitment system. For those not in the know, you can only summon 24 unit types before reinforcements run out and you have to wait another random period of time to get 24 villagers willing to fight.A flaw of the original, it could have easily been done without, instead it carried over, probably for balance reasoning. actual fightingDon't expect micromanagement or piercing formatiosn for cavalry. It doesn't go further than stronghold 2's ""3d models flailing their hands = attacking"" style.Taking a castle down is not satisfying after you've breeched the walls, you can argue that it's a fault of the AI, but when it's sold in DLC's as a feature, it's stil relevant.verdictC2 wins, at worst it tried.ECONOMYOther than being an RTS, stronghold prides itself in its economic mode, the ability to create a fledging medieval economy gathering resources that are used to make the citizens happier, the happiness used to levy more taxes and taxes used to pay for a proper army to kill the enemy's king and become the supreme ruler of the land.it's ok...I guess?C2's economy is just a copy and paste of C1's with some ""balancing"". foodMany complain about the Mill costing 200 wood now, but they forget how one mill could make enough flour to power 20 bakeries, it's not really a contest.Although with c2 there's no reason to get on bread production, since the primary modes of food production can provide an easy flow right away until the end.ResourcesYou can sell stuff at the stockpile now, which is great, and the market is an autoselling service, which is something that c1 lacked, especially in the latter stages.c1 had a priest blessing the populace, and besides the simple +3 happiness you get from cathedral + church combo. Good luck getting anywhere if your population is growing. And with a working economy, that's a given.c2 tries to remedy this by adding ""candle production"": you make candles that are used in the religious ceremonies that raise religiosity. Sketchy, but it works better this time around. And you can increase candle consumption to get a higher popularity, which is reasonable.""flow""Takes a while to get an economy up and running, even if you have a lot of farmland, iron, stone and wood laying around, you're still going to get busted for a while at the beginning. With those same conditions in 1, you could get to the top fast.  fear factor You could make the population lazier, happier and the army stronger by adding ""good things"" like mayflower poles and dancing bears, or make it get sad with hangman posts and chopping blocks, with the upside of better work being done.A mix between a ""morality system"" and a way to decorate your castle: it's a lot more fun with chopping blocks than with dreary stone walls!One problem it had is that you had to put a lot of those if you wanted to get the +5 or -5 but it could have been fixed someway.How does it fare in c2? they removed it.VerdictSame-ish economy with some imrpovements here and there, the removal of the fear factor system is just heretical though. 1 wins.STYLEObviously we're comparing a 3d game and an isometric one, the 3d has got to get on top, right? Well....unitsThey look weird, like superheroes more than actual medieval characters. Their fighting is blocky, and I'm not tired of repeating how silly it looks. It would have worked in 2008, it doesn't work in 2016, a system that doesn't age well.voice actingSoldiers talk like they're from a generic RTS, not exactly a fault but when you compare it with the original it fails hard. Select a maceman and you get a gruff mocking ""what do you want?"", instanlty understand that these are no-nonsense brawlers. Select archers, ""Archers, ready!"", tense but aggressive, don't get them too close to the enemy.Forgivable, forgivable...What is unforgivable though, is that c1 characterized every single unit in the game, selecting any wokrer would update you on their current actions, give you a portrait and they'd tell you what they think of your tax plan, the food, or strike a monty python joke.It gave the otherwise serious stronghold series a soul, for a while they stopped being symbols on a screen and got a character of their own.Remove that, and it becomes a generic castle simulator, with no soul or energy.Get that part, firefly.ArchitectureBuildings look all too blocky and all too similar, only by zooming in can you ""get"" that this is a place where you grow food and this is the one where you smelt iron.In 1, an apple orchard looked like an apple orchard, an inn reminded of an inn. The number of churches went from 3 types (chapel, church, cathedral) to 1 grey looking one, regardless of the transition to 3d (which might be necessary today), it lost the middle eastern look crusader let it borrow, it looks like something out of a south gernan forest town rather than a middle eastern crusader state. So many buildings ended up this way, it's almost sad.castle itselfAll the towers look the same, all the walls look the same. There's not much to say here, but if you can, look at crusader 1 and compare The Scorpion's build style with The Abbot's, You'll realise that you could express yourself in a lot of ways in the original.verdictCrusader 1 wins, no argument, it wins on a landslide. Original, charming, context-related, it had it all and the sequel just apes that with its faux comic book style.VERDICTCertainly a lot better than the abysmal 3 or the mediocre 2, but doesn't top crusader or vanilla stronghold.If you get the chance, get crusader 1, better experience, more atmosheric, cheaper, fuller gameplay.

												played stronghold crusader for hours as a kid; it was great. This ain't that. the AI are on crack and just start attacking you forever so you have to figure out a really niche strategy to beat them. the gameplay makes it not worth anywhere near 50-80 bucks imo (i aint pay that much i got it for like 5). don't waste your money, but hey if you see it on a hella good sale why not ♥♥♥♥ around for an hour or two. the graphics are awesome though, so I'll give it that much.It's fun to play when you're bored and don't feel like playing anything else. a lot of people say you should play with friends but the AI should be a viable option. Not everyone has friends that want to buy/play the game. A lot of assumptions are made when making a game that you need friends to play it in order to have fun.so basically...Would recommend if it's on a good sale, otherwise no.5/10 game not worth 50 bucks			"

												You will like this game if you liked the first crusader. it takes some getting used to with some changes to the rate at which food is produced and how much stone it takes to build things but once you get the hang of it, its pretty fun. It does still have some minor bugs. Commanding troops to move on walls or towers, they don't always go to the spot you want them. if you want that extra tiny bit of range by moving archers to the front of the tower, this bug can be annoying. however, once you find a sweet spot while clicking around, you can get them to where you want them.I would recommend this to any long time rts players, but would be hesitant to recommend it to new players. I have played the stronghold series since i was 7 years old (now 19) and i find this game challenging. If you are willing to take the time to learn, buy it.			"

												Very nice nice intense and rewarding feeling when victorious and a great sequel and brings back childhood memories of the first game. Complaints: enemy attacks seem like they are of lesser scale but more frequent (AI), which is annoying, no time to relax and its not a oh♥♥♥♥♥♥factor when you see them coming, its more of a ""didnt u just attack 1.5 minutes ago?"" and your attacks will constantly be runing into them. The price of 50$ is too much 25 is more like it, but around this time this far after release? 20. deforestization is a issue and i think trees should grow back on all maps. Seems very grindy after a while in a game if you are matched with your oppenet. Peasant cap should be 50 people at the campfire. overall a great game with great economy play, very fun to play with your friends. I would recommend this game very much, Still a big improvement from previous games in my opinion, Not as much grinding for population happiness as it took in previous games which is nice.			"

												I find it enjoyable, I've played every type of rts- strategy type of game. Having said this, the game over all is nice. There are a few bugs and what not but i just love the fact that i can build walls and have men guard em an watch em fire. And epic battles. Now that being said the game struggles late game with fps. My computer being able to run any game at full graphics and perfect internet speed the game fails at that. But other then that its truly a fun ejoyable time. Deserves more credit then it gets. And to all of you complaining about the price. You do realise how much money it takes to make a game.

Pros:+ Gameplay+ HAVOC Engine+ Graphics+ SoundCons:- UI might be confussingI really think the game is great and i think more people would buy it if it had a choice of replacing the UI with one that is similiar to the classic UI from Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader.I recommend that you buy this game!

												Unfortunately,  It is far beyond my expectations, it's like rebranding of the old Crusader with a few new elements and 3D graphics(not better than the original).. Almost Same units, same mechanics, same story..And the worst side of the game is the graphics.. If you compare it to other games like Total War series, the texture of the game is really bad.. It looks like a 2005 game not 2014 :D.. You cannot compare this to StarcraftII, TW:Attilla or COH2... According to me the original crusader even look better tihs.... You have 3D game engine but very bad looking texture, only thing looks good is the walls.. :D and Why dont you implement some new elements like factions to play?.. Everything is the same and game looks not better than original.. I prefer to play Crusader HD for multiplayer instead of this.. Shame on you.. Like SH Kingdoms.. 5 year old mmog.. not a single improvement!! I am an idiot for spending my money to that.. More; -The game is buggy.. when you have more than 50 units they act like idiots :D- So many illogical actions by both ai and own units..-ai is dumb and acts unrealistic..-Overall game looks unrealistic.. this is an era game it should evolve in a way to become more realistic.. You have 10 years to make a better game.. but waste itThe real worth of the game is $5  I dont give more than that unless they improve it :D Dont waste your money			"

												Bought this in the Steam sale for £5, instead of the advertised £30 and must admit I've enjoyed the game so far. Not entirely sure its worth the full £30, maybe £20 at a push, but its a welcome return to the Stronghold Crusader series. A bit of nostalgia, the game runs well on Windows 10 and runs fast on my computer at high settings level. Troops react well to enemy incursion, meaning if you station your army well on the walls and ensure a good covering the army will repel most attacks without needing further command. If you enjoyed the original Stronghold games you'll enjoy this!			"

												--As a sequal--The first crusaders was better in most aspects. Several of its features are missing from this game. Including happiness buildings which offered a nice way to decor castles. Building sizes are reduced which makes it easier to build. However, max number of buildings and limitation on build areas negates this change. AIs seem to be stupider and don't interact as much. When they do its almost meaning less, including responding very late after things happen.Tutorials are too segmented. Eg collect wood & food, then collect stone & iron, then build weapons. The missions take longer to load then complete. Most should have been combined into a single eco mission. That then showed the player threw each party. Instead of having a single task that is very easy to complete.--As a game--Compared to most games these days its laking. Its a bit slow paced for having fast paced combat. Several features are not fully implemented. Some features are almost worthless to use. Random events seem to effect players more than AIs.AIs tend to cheap a good bit. Including spawning units were units didn't exist. Putting out fires that would normal burn down player's bases. As well getting resources out of no where.  GUIs seem to freeze up, multiplayer seems to stall out and crash.			"

												A great game when you finally get the hang of it but it crashes way too often to be playable. I left it and went back to it a few months later and started to enjoy it again until it crashed and then crashed again and again... There is also no ""Restart Level"" button so you have to go back to the main screen to set it all up from scratch again, until of course it crashes! Especially if it crashes - I will switch to ""Recommend"" only when they have fixed the bugs.I will say that there are some awesome added features, like automatic buying and selling from the market so you can focus on other things - If your game remains stable it should be great when you get the hang of it but from my own experience and by seeing the reviews it looks inherantly unstableWhat's the point in adding new DLC to a bug ridden game, that's my question.

												This game is quite nice ,i have all strongholds except for Stronghold3 which i saw was garbage. Now let me say this:for  the positive -new maps-new troops and ai-there are now lion dens kinda like in Stronghold Legends werewolf shelters -new popularity system, it 's somwhere in the middle but is okNow for the negative things that i found-no moats ,siege towers ,and FEAR FACTOR or pouplarity buildings in Stronghold 2-weird voice acting for the old enemies :Rat and Wolf but we 'l see what the next update will bring with the Pig and maybe snake .(they are coming saw it on facebook)-it 's a little hard sometimes to get a perfect wiew  and now you gotta rotate by using the middle mouse button (i haven 't found the keys for this thing yet for rotating )Overral i know i typed allot of negativity from the things that should have been added or done better . Final score:8.5/10 "

												I honestly have no idea why this game gets such a bad review from so many people.  Sure, it's not as great as the original, but what sequeal to any game is as good?  The bottom line is that this game is still sound, and most of the bugs in the game have been patched at least to my general view.  Sure, some of the mechanics and things could be better, but hey, all games have their flaws.  One thing I did want to bring to attention is that this game is still kind of buggy.  Things don't seem to line up super well and the actual units themselves can get kind of glitchy.  Other than that though, the game still provides me with lots of fun.  I bought this game on sale for 10$, and can say that it is worth at least that much.  But 50$? No thanks.  Get the game on sale.  I would wait for another sale like this weekends, or maybe up to half off at the most.  But don't pay full price.  This is nowhere near as good as something like The Witcher 3, which was worth every penny.Hope this review is at least somewhat helpful.  It's still a great game and addition to the series, and they did redeem themselves quite a bit after the disaster that was stronghold 3.  So I personally would ignore all the negative reviews, as most of them complain about problems that existed in the original games, but of course they didn't have a way to comment for those ones.  Any solid member of the Stronhold Series would still enjoy this game, especially for 10 bucks.			"

												First most importantly, the game is glitchy I geta Can't find the way to the stockpile??  error when the worker clearly has no problem getting to the stockpile and when he used to be able to get to the stockpile and I've deleted all buildings since that point. Also in moving troops I find the assassin often gets stuck if you click on a far away point.Also the tutorial is inadequate and the learning campaign really could explain their hints better (so that people know what keys to press)   also the campaign and skirmish trials are insufficient in drawing the player into the story and don't really talk about the history at all.Also combat is awkward lacking waypoints and queuing or mayber they have them, but the tutorial just didn't cover that.Also the in game guide doesn't seem to explain what units are good against what.Also annoying a lack of laddermen the only way to breach a wall is to knock it down????at $10 a maybe			"

												--As a sequal--The first crusaders was better in most aspects. Several of its features are missing from this game. Including happiness buildings which offered a nice way to decor castles. Building sizes are reduced which makes it easier to build. However, max number of buildings and limitation on build areas negates this change. AIs seem to be stupider and don't interact as much. When they do its almost meaning less, including responding very late after things happen.Tutorials are too segmented. Eg collect wood & food, then collect stone & iron, then build weapons. The missions take longer to load then complete. Most should have been combined into a single eco mission. That then showed the player threw each party. Instead of having a single task that is very easy to complete.--As a game--Compared to most games these days its laking. Its a bit slow paced for having fast paced combat. Several features are not fully implemented. Some features are almost worthless to use. Random events seem to effect players more than AIs.AIs tend to cheap a good bit. Including spawning units were units didn't exist. Putting out fires that would normal burn down player's bases. As well getting resources out of no where.  GUIs seem to freeze up, multiplayer seems to stall out and crash.			"

												Unfortunately,  It is far beyond my expectations, it's like rebranding of the old Crusader with a few new elements and 3D graphics(not better than the original).. Almost Same units, same mechanics, same story..And the worst side of the game is the graphics.. If you compare it to other games like Total War series, the texture of the game is really bad.. It looks like a 2005 game not 2014 :D.. You cannot compare this to StarcraftII, TW:Attilla or COH2... According to me the original crusader even look better tihs.... You have 3D game engine but very bad looking texture, only thing looks good is the walls.. :D and Why dont you implement some new elements like factions to play?.. Everything is the same and game looks not better than original.. I prefer to play Crusader HD for multiplayer instead of this.. Shame on you.. Like SH Kingdoms.. 5 year old mmog.. not a single improvement!! I am an idiot for spending my money to that.. More; -The game is buggy.. when you have more than 50 units they act like idiots :D- So many illogical actions by both ai and own units..-ai is dumb and acts unrealistic..-Overall game looks unrealistic.. this is an era game it should evolve in a way to become more realistic.. You have 10 years to make a better game.. but waste itThe real worth of the game is $5  I dont give more than that unless they improve it :D Dont waste your money			"

												Bought this in the Steam sale for £5, instead of the advertised £30 and must admit I've enjoyed the game so far. Not entirely sure its worth the full £30, maybe £20 at a push, but its a welcome return to the Stronghold Crusader series. A bit of nostalgia, the game runs well on Windows 10 and runs fast on my computer at high settings level. Troops react well to enemy incursion, meaning if you station your army well on the walls and ensure a good covering the army will repel most attacks without needing further command. If you enjoyed the original Stronghold games you'll enjoy this!			"

												Just no.Would be fun, the concept is still the same as in Crusader. But it just seems like a cheap copy. They literally copied everything from the old game, and it's like they forgot that they are now working in a 3d environment. If you watch the intro or welcome screen animation, or whatever is that, you will know what I'm talking about.AI is broken, haven't even finished my wall, the rest of the buildings were already on fire. They don't operate on money. At all. And if you'd say 'Ah whatevs' I'm playing MP anyway' you are screwed as well.You have like 30 online in the busiest hours, and the 70% of the lobbies are locked or password protected anyway. Also, 35€ is the original price? Even now? Ridiculous.			"

												As a follower of this series from the original Stronghold Crusader I am shocked and appalled at how bad this is. This is not a stronghold title it is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ Random black screens, hard crashes, and stuttering in multiplayer aside - the gameplay is just not there. Nothing flows like the older titles in this franchise. You do not have moments where you sit back and just watch what you built chug along. There is constantly some issue with the game holding you back from enjoying it. TL;DR Graphics are horrible, gameplay is a major disappointment if you are a fan of the series, performance for a game like this is very bad, would not recommend to friends.Computer specs - i5 2550k oc 3.7ghz, 24GB ram, EVGA FTW+ 970 @ 1920x1080Friend's specs (who had hard crashes and constant stuttering during multiplayer) - i7 4770k, 32gb ram, EVGA FTW+ 780 @ 1920x1080			"

												The Firefly team has been slowly going downhill, backwards. Even if I had not started with Stronghold 1, I would not reccomend this game. - Difficulty. The programmers confused cheating with difficulty. What this essentially means is the moment you have finally breached the castle walls, the AI will instantly spawn a very large amount of troops to flood you, then instantly repair the breach. - Economy. While you certainly have to tend to yours, the AI does not. Destroying farms, mines, quarries, food, does nothing to slow down or stop the AI. While it appears they are spending money, they are not and can always afford anything. - Rushes. The campaign is an exercise in defending against rushes. Remember the cheating thing? Combine that with a rush. Takes 30 seconds for a fully grown AI to be outside your castle with catapults, torches, and enough to kill your Lord, meanwhile your fletcher has not even gotten to his workshop yet. - Defensive ability. All you have to defend yourself are walls. That is it. No moats. Hoarding is killed by a couple arrows, and arrows tend to simply pass right through it. No real way to create a defence besides building more walls. Walls that have to constantly be tended to due the the sheer catapult rush the AI throws at you. No engineers to help either. And Walls are super expensive to build, which wouldnt be an issue if I did not require so much time to tend to them. It wants to be good, but falls flat. Play Stronghold 1, 2, and Crusader 1.			"

												Horrible compared to it's predacessor. If this is the future of stronghold games, count me out. The 3d element is interesting but it takes all the resources from the previous game and somehow makes it bad.  The UI is too confusing, opposite of the simplicity of Crusader 1. The voice acting was bad and the same music was used. I wouldn't really mind it but the whole game just seems to be Firefly Studios on it's last legs, struggling to find it's way in a modern gaming audience. Even though there are PLENTY of fans wishing for the classic stronghold style. My father for one picks up his games from walmart. Weird, but they carry a collection of classic games. To me, to put Stronghold Crusader 2 with the rest of the games, is a stain.			"

The problem I forsee with this sequal is exactly what the rest of the community is stating, minimal additions, slow units, and the sizes of buildings are just some of the problems involved with this game.I cannot just point out all the negatives, as their are plenty of positives involved with this sequal. The gameplay stays similar to the original, the AI has progressed, and the ambient audio truly immerses you in the crusader atmospehere.All in all its a good game, but not worth $50. If your into games such as this I recommend getting it on sale.			"

												Feels like a beta release.  I loved the games that this one was trying to be and I bought this one without doing any research.  The AI is reminiscent of Command and Conquer 1, the graphics are so so, the physics are nothing special, and its maps are generally terrible.  This game is in desperate need of its own map editor.  The map selection is unforgivably bad.  There’s not a lot of variety either and the campaign is extremely boring.  Save your money for something else.			"

												Not a bad remake of the original. Infact, its almost exactly like playing the old one, only with nice 3d graphics, no moats , and poorer voice-overs. Gameplay has been smoothed out a bit though, which is nice.And perhaps updates will bring more content.The game has however been unplayably laggy during late gameon a machine that's about halfway between min and max specs.Either overly performance hungry (in its current form) or dishonestly advertised.Nice game if youre new to stronghold crusader, otherwise a neat (and pricey) graphics update.

The game also have problems with freezes when playing it.

												The Firefly team has been slowly going downhill, backwards. Even if I had not started with Stronghold 1, I would not reccomend this game. - Difficulty. The programmers confused cheating with difficulty. What this essentially means is the moment you have finally breached the castle walls, the AI will instantly spawn a very large amount of troops to flood you, then instantly repair the breach. - Economy. While you certainly have to tend to yours, the AI does not. Destroying farms, mines, quarries, food, does nothing to slow down or stop the AI. While it appears they are spending money, they are not and can always afford anything. - Rushes. The campaign is an exercise in defending against rushes. Remember the cheating thing? Combine that with a rush. Takes 30 seconds for a fully grown AI to be outside your castle with catapults, torches, and enough to kill your Lord, meanwhile your fletcher has not even gotten to his workshop yet. - Defensive ability. All you have to defend yourself are walls. That is it. No moats. Hoarding is killed by a couple arrows, and arrows tend to simply pass right through it. No real way to create a defence besides building more walls. Walls that have to constantly be tended to due the the sheer catapult rush the AI throws at you. No engineers to help either. And Walls are super expensive to build, which wouldnt be an issue if I did not require so much time to tend to them. It wants to be good, but falls flat. Play Stronghold 1, 2, and Crusader 1.			"

												This is a game I wish I never bought.If you're looking for AOE 2 or RON or EE or anything similiar, this isn't it.I think of myself as experienced, having played all of the titles listed above and conquered them on the hardest diff, including missions. Then comes SC2. This game is just weird. Certain building area's, food goes so fast, peasants are just moody ♥♥♥♥s, and the AI just loves ninja's. There has to be ONLY one way to start your city out in this game. Like it micromanages the♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to RTS's like Starcraft 2 which are SLOWER paced then this game. If you can play this game on full speed and win, congrats, you know the trick.I have tried. Several times since I bought this POS for 60 dollars long ago and I just can't do it. I install it, get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by AI in Skirms, either ""campaign based"" or just random and get rolled over.I don't get it. I understand the different buildings and how they work, I understand the fundamentals of the game but the AI are just punishing. They either go super ninja after my king ( AKA when my♥♥♥♥♥♥ass army is out protecting my lumberjacks or farms ) OR go straight for my buildings ( AKA when my army is inside the castle trying to keep that dumbass king alive ).It's not complex. I just don't enjoy games that require you to have ONE set starting build in order to survive. The pressure gets put on right out of the gate and they have like tier 5 units coming in with a set of 4 and can wipe 30 of my basic♥♥♥♥♥♥units within the first 5 minutes.It's just brutal on normal. If you crank it down to Easy ( I THINK ) it becomes dull because they don't do anything. I honestly think the AI are a bunch of hardcore cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by how their base and amount of buildings vs mine within the first 3 minutes of the game looks.I wanted a game to bring me back to those good old RTS games. This wasn't it.			"

												Has very little in common with the stellar original. Half the fun was watching the peasants do their work in Stronghold Crusader 1, that's pretty much no longer entertaining now, because everything is tiny and the serfs dont deliver funny lines when you click on them. Graphically, this is unoptimized BS in terms of demanding GPU power because framerate is low for a game that has graphics very similar in quality to Age of Empires III (and that game was released in 2006). They reused some musical cues and icons from the original Stronghold because apparently they are still the best. Finally, the artwork looks cheap like some guy from Deviantart was comissioned for 50 bucks to do the art and backgrounds for this retail game. Compare this to Stronghold Crusader 1 and you'll realize how ahead of its time the game was back then....this series is dead.			"

												Don't listen to the reviews saying even die-hard fans should stay away, it's one of the best 3D Stronghold games in the series. A mostly decent castle rts with a few holes, some losses, but  many new features (including achievements).  I don't understand why some reviewers tore it to shreds, have they really played all of the Stronghold games?  It's definitely not complete trash and better than most of the lesser ""3D"" Strongholds for sure.Gameplay: Overall, the game objective remains the same - build your castle and economy, make troops, conquer the enemy through a series of skermish trails.  Like Crusader I, the sequel also focuses more on wartime than peace-time - so you will find more war and defense buildings and less economy peacetime buildings. Too much disappointment, the Fear Factor system has been removed...seriously, what the hell? Production is stuck at slow as hell now.  Economic management has been improved with the lovely ""automatic trades""  at the market and finer tuned popularity management with supply adjustments all made in a single window.  You can also see your daily production & consumption levels of popularity supporting goods to be sure the production meets the need. Troops vary from many familiar to several new troops as well.  New troops include some most-powerful ""leader"" troops that will boost the defense and attack for certain troops around them - Sergent for Knights, Slave Master for Slaves. A few favorites from Crusader I were unfortunately replaced with new troops too .  Keeping them all and adding on would have been better...I miss the underrated rock throwers.Difficulty: Difficultly has been taken up a notch as Enemy AI loves to rush your castle early.  Even the weaker known AI such as The Rat will provide a greater challenge.  Some players say the enemy AI cheats more too and spawns many troops regardless of how bad their popularity and economy are doing.  Mastering stategic defense early is utmost importance, troops (towers & crossbowmen) must be made before much of the economy.  Popularity responds significantly faster to your economy now with negative and positive ratings immediately affecting your peasants - i.e. the moment your popularity drops, workers start leaving in seconds!!  Also castles are more expensive to build with stone walls costing 7 stone each and stone curtains being 3 stone...stone stocks too low sir!!  Performance:  The game runs fine until your castle starts filling up with tons of buildings (Bakers, Brewers, Hovels), peasants, and troops.  Then even systems with a Radeon R9 3GB+ will have frame rates of around 25ish.  This isn't a bad console port and they really should optimize the code further.  It's not horrible  and I still enjoy the game plenty regardless, but it is funny that my system also runs Fallout 4 around 45-60fps on max graphics... Many of the major glitches and flaws noted by early reviewers are now patched up and gone, however I do still rarely see the ""crusified troops"" glitch where they walk in a frozen T position for a bit or also troops getting stuck on the stairs. Also the audio for catapult rocks hitting stone structures and walls is overloaded and WAY TOO LOUD.Visual:  The graphics are similar to Stronghold 3 and perhaps even better. The animations are about the same too.  The enemy AI FMVs have been completely redone with entirely new and goofier looking characters for classic familiar foes and many new adversaries.  The interface really varies from a crappy low res title screen of an assassin (come on, looks like crap) to a nicely done very zen feeling skirmish trail amongst the stars.  Some recycled troop graphics from Stronghold 3 for sure.Audio:  A mix of half recycled, half new when it comes to effects and music - perhaps more new.  This is typical for Stronghold games.  Music really varies, but I feel it is not randomized enough and many tracks are rarely heard while a few are played too often.  Classic familiar AI features new voice acting that is a complete joke compared to the much more intimidating classic voice acting.  The Pig now says things like, ""No No No, that's ma land!"" compared to ""I WILL CRUSH YOU!!! I WILL KIWWLLL YOU!!!."" The Rat is also more dull and bore with phrases like, ""My father didn't like ya, I don't like ya either."" Blah.  The newer non-familiar enemy voiceacting (mostly arabic tyrants) does seem to be higher quality and more charismatic charm though.  Lionheart seems decent enough too actually.Conclusion: A worthy castle sim gameplay for many new and veteran fans alike but nothing perfect or AAA.  Die-hard fans shall enjoy the new features plenty to make up for the loss of some favored features.  It's not the best RTS and there are flaws, but it's still pretty fun and easily to get lost in for hours.  Firefly always releases these too early in development, but I luckily began to play after much of the final development.  I'd say grab it on sale, and definitely wait for the DLC to go on sale.  The main game is tough and should offer plenty while waiting on the DLC.			"

												Played a few games and so far I am not sure how to feel about this game. It seems it sacrificed too much for nice UI and the lack of need to build stockpiles all over your castle like in crusader. Some buildings are simply too expensive like houses and especially mill. But what I dislike the most and wanted fixed since the time of first stronghold is the very limited space on which you can build your castle. In crusader 2 it is even smaller than in crusader and you cant really get creative in building one. You will have most of your buildings for food or wood exposed outside of the castle walls which makes it very hard to protect them. I guess it gives some sort of reality into the game but this is one thing where I dont think it is needed.Also the lack of restart game option is a bummer for me. Miss that a lot too. On the other hand the AI of enemies is good and the kings are unique which is nice + a lot of missions to kill some time.Definitely not worth the full price but for 3,5 Euros in current sale it is not bad. I would give it 7/10.			"

												First Stronghold game I've played... it's good - not as great as some say it is.Coming from AOE (1,2,3) and Starcraft - I was expecting something more in depth than RTS. Coming from Sim City and Skylines I was expecting more management. ""Castle"" building is more like wall/tower building.... only inside a magical boundary on the map...meh. Once you have a basic wall up - stone is irrelevant. Economy/gathering is interesting, but Like most other games - max workers and build every type of food/low taxes FTW.Building happens instantly and with no workers, same with troop building. If you have the gold...spam 100 units in 10 seconds.I like the idea of making weapons/armor for your troops - but thats about the only thing it does better than AOE.No stat listing, no upgrading weapon dmg/armor def. No technology tree.This is basically ""regicide"" game mode in AOE. Kill the king...I mean ""Lord"".This just makes me want to play AOE again.Buy it if it is on sale like I did.  "

Con - Needs more buildings and units (content). I feel like it could be a little more complex and generally more realistic in it's gameplay. I also believe it needs some provision for modding besides map-making. In general, I don't believe it's worth 50 dollars. Maybe 30 max.			"

												I bought it when it came out, but only just started playing it.  Honestly, if there are bugs, i haven't experienced them yet.  The AI cheating is slightly annoying but really only adds on the difficulty, which I see as a good thing.  I enjoy the multiplayer even though I get my butt whooped.  I don't see the lack of AAA graphics as a bad thing, It's a self published indie game, what are we to expect.  Overall the gameplay is difficult as I find myself losing half the time, but I enjoy the challenge of having to come up with new ways to win.  Is the game perfect? No,  Is it winning any awards any time soon? No.  Is it fun and do I look forward to completing the campaign and playing multiplayer?  Absolutely!			"

												I think that this game is similar in style enough to Stronghold Crusader so that if you enjoyed that old game then you will enjoy this. There are a lot of things that were improved like how the stockpile + granary works and how siege equipment is built, though actually the siege equipment change is arguably worse because you can create catapults where your own troops wouldn't be able to access. Driving a load of burning hay carts into their buildings and setting everything on fire is probably the funest part of the game, just like using slaves or balistas in the original, you can use those here too. There are a few bugs but nothing serious. The troop limit seems really low as it's 1000 for the whole map so if you're fighting 3 AI you can only create 250 units. Really there should be an option to increase that limit when creating a game even if it does cause some performance problems the troop limit can feel very limiting at times.			"

												This one feels more like a good ol' crusader stronghold. Something feels missing in third part of stronghold, but second one is allright. And with all the DLC's, oh boy, you are for a treat. I do recommend it. It's pretty hard and fast-paced. The main difference between ""Crusader"" and regular stronghold lies not only in arabic thematic and a different faction, but also, in fact that you and your opponent are located on the same map, struggling for the same resourses. So, plan your castle well and do not hesitate or you'll be crashed by the waves of enemy troops. So, yeah... Do recommend. Good game to play COOP or VS your friends.			"

												A wonderful game, you sit back play awhile and 5 hours feels like 1. Suprisingly difficult(which I like) and is lots of fun so it makes you want to keep trying after countless fails. I must say I got this with the humble bundle for less than a $1 with Rust etc. and when I tried this game the other day I was not expecting such an amazing game. Its very similar to other games like starcraft, warcraft 2 and many more, But I like the mid-evil feel of the game.			"

												A good game? Yes. A good Crusader sequel? Not entirely. Let me be clear by saying I don't hate the game and its actually quite fun but my main issue is it feels half done. There aren't too many bugs and the game runs smoothly on either of the systems I've run it on. (A desktop with two year old parts and an average laptop that's around four years old. When I said the game feels half done I mean to say that the game feels flavourless and at times even dull. The art, animation and design are fairly basic and simplistic; one of my biggest disappointments is the lack of interesting voice acting from the computer opponents to the humble peasants that populate my castle all the voice acting is bland or in the case of the latter. totally absent. The music is half recycled from the original and half stereotypical pseudo middle-eastern. With only 8 AI opponents there isn't a large number of challenges and it was disappointing to not see the likes of the Pig or the Snake. The appearance of familiar opponents like the Wolf and the Rat was welcome but I'm confused why they recorded new voices for those two characters when many of the units (European Archers for example) use the exact same voice recordings from the first Crusader title. All in all Stronghold Crusader 2 is a solid game and quite fun to play but in my own opinion it doesn't live up to either the hype or the legacy of the original Stronghold Crusader.P.S. I personally would buy Stronghold Crusader HD for cheap and wait for this game to come down in price. It's not worth the $50 price tag but will be more than worth while to snag on a Steam sale.			"

												If I have control of my entire army, and I tell them to kill a guy, and the archers shoot the guy, my entire army will stop fighting like he was the last guy they had... when really they are just ignoring my army to knock down my buildings... and my army doesnt seem to understand that when I say kill guy A, that order also includes kill guys B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K , L etc. but they dont. You need to add a feature that when I click attack it means attack the group, not just a single individual. Also I would like seige stance to be added.This siege stance would make my units automatically start knocking down structures if not engaged... Come on guys, this game is so close to being awesome, but some♥♥♥♥♥♥is really frustrating. I actually quit out of game to write this becaue I lost half my town to a group of peasants numbering less than my archers alone... my castle tower was slightly out of range of the village and i sent spearmen to deal with the incursion, but the one guy I clicked on turned to fight my guys as they approached and was shot by an archer off the wall. I watched in disbelief as my soldiers stopped running and stood and watched the town get sacked. Also I enjoyed how I positioned spearmen just inside my gate, thinking they can run out and fight at the walls... except they dont go back where they started after they move to fight, so the whole lot ended up standing outside the walls and being an easy pick off for their archers.... getting the drift here?

												I don't have the newest computer  (it handles Civ 2 fine) but this game crashes. A lot. Maybe you have the kind of focus that you can stay in the game from beginning to end; I get... distracted. I do like that when I tab out the game pauses (though the long stretches waiting for resources could be better tempered by checking Ello) but I like that I can't just forget and suddenly I'm dead!  On the down side, I tab out too often and it slows more and more and then just dies. Which is unfortunate because that's usually right around the time that I have FINALLY built up what I need...  The game is fun, I like the personality of the 'assistant', and some of the other dialogue is adorably cheeky. I find it rather challenging without being too frustrating, so if I could GET to the point of 'win or lose' before the game dies, I really enjoy it!			"

												I played this game some hours and first I was very shocked about the limit for the troops and the buildings. After some time  I recognized that it isnt that hard to get around this limits. Of course it is a sometimes very hard to play in the desert. Actually it isnt a bad game.BUT maybe at the first time it is fun to play in singleplayer but you get bored very fast. And the multiplayer is laggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥after the peace time, so you are not able to play with your friend. Also there are still many bugs instead fixing them firefly is producing new DLCs. Thats not bad. BUT THEY MUST BE KIDDING, IF THEY WANT ME AGAIN TO SPEND FOR A GAME, WHICH I HAVE PAID ALREADY 35€ FOR.All in all you can say it is a good game for at the top 10€ but not for 35€!!Firefly WAS great one time, today they are careless with their work and unfair with their fans...I hope I helped you in your decision :)			"

												Well, it's really hard to decide. It's obviously not that good than the first one, and it really doesn't worth 35€, but it can cause you fun times. But I think, the price is too much for this kind of content while you can have the old one in HD with more fun, better balance and less glitches.			"

												This is long as ♥♥♥♥ man... TL;DR at the bottomFor a little context, I have played the other games, but really fell in love with the first Crusader game so I thought I would give this a shot. I had been in an half hour long game with the AI on easy(Which was 1/4 of my playtime) and I was finally getting the better of him which felt great. I set up siege camps and had a pretty nice army but looking at his castle... I knew we could get through the walls but we would fail inside.   So I decided I would pick of his men with Trebuchets and kill all of his villagers so he wouldn't be able to produce food or troops.  It worked partially, I picked off one of his walls and about 15 men, and kind of continued doing this for about 15 min. During this he just kept sending more and more troops, not his defending force, new troops that he just kept making. Despite his total lack of food and income, he could quadruple his force. I mean a little militia would make since but an entire army? Please. While on the other hand if I lost a single lumber camp my Kingdom would be brought to a halt. I lost the game an hour in...    Now, losing a game I'm fine with. Losing a game on easy I'm fine with. Losing a game on easy after an hour of gameplay I can handle. BUT WHEN I LOSE THE GAME ON EASY AFTER AN HOUR OF GAMEPLAY DUE TO MISSING CORE MECHANICS OF A SIEGE, THAT WHEN I GET A LITTLE UPSET. The game is described as a 'Simulation Castle builder"". Well ♥♥♥♥ that description if the enemy has a constant refill on troops. They don't actually need the recourses. If you have all the stone in the game, their stone walls are just as good as yours, and if you destroy them, they will be back in 2 min.     The game encourages abusing glitches, and because of the OP AI, YOU HAVE TO. Not to mention the AI of your troops. You know how they say ""Aberham Lincon would be considered autistic to our standers"". Well Guess what, your entire army all have 12 extra chromosomes and are blind and deaf. On top of random charges and literally refusing orders, you would think that they just don't have any coherent form of understanding at all. But then the enemy AI are doing back flips over my walls and getting a 1 hit headshot on every single on of my brain dead men.  In the end, the game is broken to hell. Its OP AI, and actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ troops make it virtually unplayable.  Also the lack of impact of what you do to them but the massive impact that they do to you makes it not fun. So there you have, unplayable, and not fun, If you can, refund.   P'S ♥♥♥♥ THIS DLC MAN! YOU WANT ME TO PLAY A SLIGHTLY DIFF RENT TEXTURE OF THIS CLUSTER ♥♥♥♥, AND PAY FOR IT? DID THE GUY WHo CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA ALSO CREATE THE TROOP AI?   TL;DR  2/10- Unplayable and Not Fun  "

												Its a pretty good game, I would definently recommend this for people who like warcraft 2 and games of that sort. To be honest though, if you have played war craft 2, you will know it is quite challenging sometimes, this game, brings that ""challenge"" to a whole new level. Also a definite recommend if you LOVE medieval stuff, the editor for this is also AMAZING! I spend a lot of my time on the editor making maps. Multiplayer and making custom skirmishes could be a bit better! A solid 4.7 for me! (Note: Only buy it when its really on sale, otherwise the HUGE normal price is zero percent worth it.)			"

												Low population limit, which is kinda of necessary due to the game running awful. Graphically it's a little bit better looking than Stronghold 2, but it runs quite a bit worse. If you look at the pictures on the steam page they've got to be photoshopped or something. Castle building system is clunky and limited. I think most of the issues with this game could be fixed or resolved if they offered some sort of modding support. Stronghold could be such an amazing game. I don't know what's wrong with Firefly and year after year of disappointment I don't even care anymore. I don't think I'll purchase another game that has Firefly Studios attached to it. I'm just done.			"

Was kind of weird i had to take down a ""magnificent lion"" in order to raise my popularity so i armed villigers with ""sticks"" and kill it. What a heroic act. I started to get bored so i quit tutorial and like i used to, created a custom skirmish. I was suprised how badly cooperated with me, but nevermind, i am here to kill some sultans.After entering the game and built granary with stockpile, i couldnt do anything with my troops/villigers or with allies, but quit the game. So i did aswell as uninstalling this.			"

												Some bugs getting it loaded and playing, but a few alt F4's and restarts is started working ok.  I enjoyed the gameplay although it was slow at times waiting for resources.  I played some co-op with a friend and went head to head once.  I agree 'Crusader 2 recaptures the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation.'  it is pretty much the same game with better graphics, and some new stuff added in.  (good maps)  worked well with steam.  maybe 3 out of 5 stars for me.  worth the 10 bucks, but probably not much more.			"

												I loved strong hold up to strong hold 2. They nailed it with that one, build your own maps see inside the towers all kinds of cool stuff. Then we get strong hold 3 and this crap shoot game that runs of its engine. The only reason I got this one is because they brought skirmish back. But there is no map maker and the maps they provided are the worst maps ever made. Almost no one plays this game online so you need skirmish mode, unless you want to do the terrible story mode they♥♥♥♥♥♥out. Save your money or be disapointed with firefly trying to relive its original games in this sad beaten dead horse of a title.			"

												Seems like a buggy mess (e.g. skirmish with AI allies crashes the game in some situations), only one or two swordsmen will move at all when you order a group to attack, rangers inexplicably will walk all the way around the enemy's walls to kill an enemy archer in melee instead of using their swords, the in-game manual has ""page not found"" errors.As far as features go, it's hardly an improvement over SH 3 (e.g. still no moats which the original Stronghold Crusader) - basically, this is SH3 with a desert paintjob or SH Crusader in 3D but half the features cut.Skirmish maps seem extremely small, but given the limited number of buildings, limited number of defences (e.g. just three towers) and much smaller buildings (e.g. the church is now the size of two houses, instead of 20) it might work out. Still, you're not gonna be able to build any ""castle"" worthy of that title.Edit to add: Commanding units is extremely cumbersome, and precisely placing them on walls is nearly impossible since the icon turns from ""move"" to the stairs/""man walls"" icon. Stronghold 2 had a perfectly working system (you click on a spot on top of a tower, and your units will move to that spot instead of some nearby spot on the walls) and it's completely beyond me why they had to go reinvent the square wheel here.

												First, it's important to stress that I have very little experience with prior games in the series.  I received a press code out of the blue from the developer and decided to check it out.  After about an hour of messing with the tutorial and first few campaign missions, I began to get a handle on what I was doing.  I then played around in the sandbox mode for a while in order to get a full range of the buildings available without having to worry about being attacked.  I really enjoyed how easy it was to connect walls and get the archers to make use of braziers (to shoot fire arrows).  Forming a productive economy also proved to be equally as easy.It's a bit on the pricey side, I feel, but it offers quite a bit including but not limited to multiplayer, campaign missions, co-op, different AI lords/behaviors, and more.  I did experience a bug to where the victory/stats screen would display rectangles instead of numbers/text...very unfortunate considering this is a $50 game.  Other than that, everything seemed to work fine and hassle-free.  You can check out my experiences (and the aforementioned bug) via the below videos:

												At first glance the game looks amazing but in this release state it is not that. Here is some pro and cons for a shorter version:Pros:Stronghold series name (no really thats a pro)good troop variety (both for arabic and crusader units)military production buildings expanded (no longer buildings that produce 2 of something everything has it's own producer)mildly good graphics (not great for 2014 but eh I didn't buy it because of looks)Economy is fun to build (but nothing better than the others)HEALING UNITS! FINALLY!Cons:AI does not need a economy (the Wolf the main enemy in the game doesn't even bother with even trying to look like he uses one)your troops are still brain dead (Idk how many times I lost loads of troops because I had to mouse over my castle fix something and my men had let archers and crossbows kill them without even trying to run or fight)Maps are too small (8 player games feel like you could toss a rock at the others, they fix this by making a cap of units 1000, so 5 players get 200, 2 players get 500, etc.)Unit capped at 1000 (This is 2014 for God's sake raise it, but I know why they can't because:)Poor optimization (or memory leaks unsure) I have a PC with 16GB Ram, Nvidia 650 Ti 2GB, Intel i5 3.2GHz quad core, this shouldn't be happening to me:)Game lags badly when over 500 units (and when I say badly I mean my FPS was at 1-5 the whole time, I literally quit because it took 20 minutes for my units to exit the damn castle)Features stripped from the original (the Good Evil system is gone, want engineers? NOPE! How about a moat? Go play SC1 this SC2 we don't need moats, oh and how about siege towers? Hehehe this is 2014 we don't need them)Walls are made of plastic (I mean seriously I shoot maybe 3-4 shots at a 4 thick wall and it's gone, I can take out a strong castle fairly easily by just using 1 cat 50-100 horse archers and maybe 7 templars that is all I have ever had to use)The closing part:I want to love this game I really do, but it is not fun. I played 10 hours and have no desire to play any more than that , the AI does not have to build a economy and units just appear out of thin air (I literally destroyed the Wolfs merc center and the units just pop up where the merc center was throughout the game)This game is not a honorable addition to the SH series, and I wish they would not have called this Crusader because that was one of the only AAA series not undone by idiots who think they can make a better game. If Firefly reads this then here is to them:Your game as it stands right now is TERRIBLE, you failed at remaking a wonderful game and you are losing fans for it BUT. But, this game has potential why? Because it is Crusader, bring back the engineers, beef up the walls, bring back moats, and for GODS sake give me back my siege towers. I want to believe that you guys didn't lose all your good talent and that this was a oversight somehow, I want to believe someone took SH3 and mixed it somehow with this game and your fixing it now and removing the bad things that that devil of a man put in here. Conclusion:Stronghold Crusader 1 was and IS the best Firefly video game to date, do not buy this until they fix the sloppy work they did here.EDIT: So I recently looked through the news as I saw them talking about the future of this game, paid DLC has never hurt so much in my life. This game is truly not worth your money, Firefly a studio known for siding with the players has now gone the route of EA, SEGA, CA, and so many others, I am sorry but this game is a BIG PASS do not do NOT buy this game, they stripped features and are going to have us pay them for them (remember CA and the blood packs? Sparta? ♥♥♥♥ING BLOOD PACKS???) please just go buy a indie game, there are literally hundreds with better enjoyment then this.			"

												Meh.    It has potential, but feels like a dumbed down version of the original Stronghold Crusader.   Examples:  You can't manually open/close gates.  There are no engineers/diggers/ladders.   There are also some annoying bugs such as workers randomly stop doing their voice overs (it gets really quiet in your castle after a while, because no one talks).  Overall it is a decent game, if you have never played Stronghold or Stronghold Crusader.   I would personally recommend trying Stronghold Crusader HD if you have a chance.			"

												First, I want to get across how much I loved the old stronghold games, I even have two cases of stronghold 2 here and one of the legends game and I can't say how much fun I had on them.Stronghold crusders 2 was advertized in such a way to show a rich story [Or at least I, myself found that after the great fights] However that little video you find in the trailer cannot be found anywhere inside the actual game.I don't believe i even saw a castle that resembles something in the trailer inside the game.The campaign was remarkably short and could be completed within one or two days if you're experienced at all [Which most of us are] so the campaign is really not worth even looking at.The multiplayer aspect seemed quite nice 'Hey, you get to build a castle with another person? Great!' If only you could not duplicate resources whilst doing so. Woopdie do.Do you guys remember the stronghold 2 multiplayer? All the small fighting guilds that shot up to battle eachother whilst having fun? That does not exist here, It's more like the time around a year after the release of the game, one or two hosts actually waiting to play someone.I'll spell it out for you however: [Remember this is an educated estimate] Only around fifty people own the game.Now, I'm sure a large amount of people actually bought this, But the multiplayer is so empty that either they got chased off by the campaign and demanded a refund or they took one look at the multiplayer and said 'I'm not waiting ten to twenty minuites just to play a game'The characters in the game, You know the rat and the other guys?It just seems too easy.The animations of the characters are also quite flawed, a little like they used a really old animation software. [It can easily be improved]The voices and sounds seemed as if they were copied over from a previous game, it would have been nice to have thoughs get changed up.Did you know messing around with archers get thier old voice, and then suddenly if you are lucky the voice suddenly changes? Quite interesting, I actually found out myself about ten minuites ago.I'm surprised you actually read this. I didn't put too much time into it as it didn't seem a worthwhile cause.All I can say is don't buy it.It's a waste of money unless you like playing verses computers and the odd player.			"

												A terribly buggy product.So sad to see such a great RTS series get brought down by such a bad product.BUGS:First of all, everytime I exit the game I have to CTRL+ALT+DEL to the task  manager and force the game to shut down.After my first mission all the game ending stats and charts where bugged out (Couldn't see any text).GRAPHICS:Graphically the game has this very ugly shimmer across the entire game interfaceeven when all settings are maxed. It looks like a cross between when a game has vsync off and really bad aliasing.INTERFACE:When it does work it feels...slow. Clicking on things feel unresponsive and it's hard to tell what type of pheasant you are selecting unless you zoom in everytime you want to click on a type.GAME MECHANICS:The economy feels like all you are doing is balancing the plus/minus controls to keep your pheasants happy enough to get the next goal. For example, I have to get 100 apples:After building as many apple farms I could (You can only place them on spcific areas), I still had to limit rations to get any stockpile going. As soon as I tried to give them normal rations the stockpile would fall below the daily input of apples.So if I am growing 23 apples a day but my pheasants are eating 26, then through simple math you can see the problem.But, when I lower the food rations my pheasants get angry and produce even less...The only way to ""win"" that scenerio is to bribe the phesants with negative taxes to balance out the less rations.That just feels to gimmicky and not anything a real kingdom would do.Can you imagine the tax man PAYING everyone instead of collecting?FINAL THOUGHTS:I never got to any combat scenerios because I frankly got tiredof the bugs and game crashes.My advice is to get the older Crusader titles and leave this heap to the garbage bin where it belongs.

												It's not a bad game, but it's certainly not as good as the original Crusader. The graphics are horribly optimized, the controls aren't fluent at all (turning the camera around with mouse wheel feels terrible, the x-asis isn't inversed and isn't inverted, also you use left click to select troops then right click to move them/attack stuff, feels so wrong in Stronghold), and it feels extremely slow paced without any way of increasing game speed. It takes ages to get food/wood/stone/iron/weapons ect. in, and everything costs way too many resources to build. Taxes come in slowly and there's no good things/bad things that I found. It isn't very balanced, either. It's extremely easy to attack and very hard to defend. Catapults (not even trebuchets) out range the highest archer tower and ballistae do very little damage. Walls crumble (and kill all your units on them) in 1-2 catapult shots that are built and start shooting within a few seconds. There's no way to repair towers or gatehouses. Archers on towers/walls are nearly useless. So you're better off building little defense and focusing on keeping your opponents on offense all game. Lords are extremely tanky and can be healed with a new healer unit, which makes the game more about bursting him down than getting passed his defenses which is no where near as fun as the original. Knights (Called Templar in this game) come in un-mounted and you have to mount them manually which is really buggy. Combat between troops isn't visceral and satisfying like it was in the original. Voice acting is atrocious, probably the worst I've heard in 10+ years. I am happy about no moats though as units weren't programmed very well to dig it out so it was a pain to fight against in the original Crusader.A lot of these things can be fixed in patches but I wonder if Firefly will see them as issues at all.﻿ If you're a fan of the original Stronghold and Crusader, definitely give it a shot, you'll probably like the changes more than I do. If you're just looking for a solid RTS, wait for some patches or a sale first.			"

												Leaves a lot to be desiredThe game seems to be missing basic features of any RTS game. Diplomacy is nonexistent, your enemies are either your friend or foe, with very little interaction other than death threats and begging for your resources. The learning curve is pretty is medium, but the game does rely on a sink or swim mentality, help balloons would be nice to help you build the proper traps and units. Very limited construction. Your keep is not upgradable, it’s a simple tower that you can build up with walls and towers, but the keep itself never adjusts in power or in aesthetic. The building options are very limiting as well with now upgrades to work for, and very little reason for expansion beyond your walls. Overall, the game will hold your interest for a couple of hours before getting old quickly. I would wait for a sale before purchasing, not worth the full price.  "

												As a returning fan of the series, I was thrilled to see this game being made back when it was first announced.However, currently the game feels.. unfinished. Some of the mechanics are glitched, some units can glitch out, and the overall feeling of the game just gives me the feeling of incomplete.THAT BEING SAIDThis game is probably one of my newest favorites to the series. The gameplay is great, it has updated features (It finally tells you how many troops you can have) and it's graphics are nice to look at.The only other problem I have besides the glitches is the fact that there is no real story. It is hard to connect with a character I don't know, which was my problem with the original Stronghold Crusader.Final Verdict 7.5/10. Would recommended. You can throw Camel heads at people. Come on, it doesn't get better than that.			"

												Its a mess, to sell this as Stronghold Crusader. The first Stronghold Crusader was and still is the BEST Stronghold game. I thought, it could be as funny, like the first Game, where i´ve spent over 1000 hours of playing in my whole life. But Stronghold Crusader 2 isn't Stronghold Crusader! Its just another facking 3D♥♥♥♥♥♥Stronghold. I loved the old Storage System and i loved the relativ slow gameplay. Watching my people running around was while working was the greatest thing ever. The Combat was balanced, building a Castle was fun and because of the Camera options easy, the Enemy Characters, with their own tactics, were awesome. I loved the way they speak, they act, ... BUT then Stronghold Crusader 2 came. THIS GAME IS NOT A STRONGHOLD CRUSADER! It´s just another 3D♥♥♥♥♥♥game, like Stronghold 2 / 3 was. ""BUT IMTAM! YOU HAVE THE MERCENARY FROM THE FIRST GAME!"". Yeah. You got the Mercenary and the music, from Stronghold Crusader 1. And the price of the game ISNT fair! This game used the Sounds from Stronghold 2 / 3! And the ""HUD"" is like the ""HUD"" in Stronghold 2 / 3. Stronghold Crusader 2 abuses the ""Stronghold"" name. Its just another 3D♥♥♥♥♥♥game. A wannabe Stronghold Crusader! DONT! Buy this game. You´ll cry, because you have wasted your Money. What happend with FireFly Studios? Why do they create♥♥♥♥♥♥like that?			"

												Sadly I cannot recommend Stronghold Crusader 2 unless you are a die hard Stronghold fan, and even then you might be better served by just playing one of the older games.  The game seems to be designed in a bubble where the last 10 years of RTS design simply do not exist translating into some unintuitive controls, a UI which buries the most useful information while pushing the useless stuff up to the top, no unit collision, and easily manipulatable AI.  The game also gave the impression of probably needing another QA pass at launch.

												So sad, This franchise has gone to ****, I bought this game on sale for C$18.69 and I will not even recommend someone to buy this game at that low of a price, The game looks horrible for one even on the highest settings, The wall building mechanic is horrible as well, Do you want to build a wall by a edge? HA have fun with that as your wall gets built into the ground to some points not even being able to delete it! Spearmen throw their spears which is alright I guess but eliminates the point of them, Should be called daggermen because that is what they fight with! Other then that the game uses the exact audio files from Stronghold 2 and dares to put this game at a whopping price of C$54.99, If anyone thinks about getting this game I would strongly advise against it, Get Stronghold 2 or even the older ones and use Gameranger for it, Oh yes another thing I cannot believe is the balls these devs have for releasing AI DLC with ""special"" shields, It is so sad to see this franchise go down hill like this.Overall I would rate it at a 3/10 and would only buy it either in a bundle for $10 or by itself for $7 or less and that is just to play with friends.

												I was sadly disappointed with this game. If you are looking for something that may surpass the older versions of this game you will be saddly mistaken. For one the number of features in this game alone compared to the first and second are so limited. Only 3 tower types? Really? Even defense abilitys are limited. Though the influnce of arabian troops are a nice feature they dont really cover the pit of fail. Addtionally, many small things that i loved about this game are not here. Such as clicking on the voices of the indvidual peasent, or seeing them go to the inn to get drunk. The many other features that we had in Stronghold 2. It makes me fear that FIrefly is going to become EA and start to relese DLC for every small thing that they had. Overall for how long i waited for this game i was sourly dissapointed. DO NOT BUY!!!

												There is no way I could recommend this game to anyone. When this game popped up in the store I got excited. Years and years ago I was an avid Stronghold fan. I had the warchest which came with 1, 2, and Crusader. Didnt pick up Legends till years later and liked it, but not nearly as much as the juggernaut that was Stronghold Crusader. After the abysmal dissapointment that was 3, I was ready to give up on the series. Then I saw this...I was first struck by the asking price. 50 dollars is a lot to ask for a game like this, but if it means what is (supposed to be anyways) a more modern and updated version of Crusader, then the asking price is worth it. Only that is not what I bought. What I bought was another farce.The reasons it sucks:1 - Lacking in depth - where did the happy/sad castle adornements go? why cant i build monks at the church? why take out units for that matter? why are there so many weapons shops when we used to be able to dictate what weapons the shops made? no leather armor for that matter?2 - combat is ridiculous - no engineers guild? what is the deal with the seige towers? anyone else notice how freaking fast all of the troops run? enemies are way too persistent in their attacks as well.. why the hell cant i build a moat anymore? and just how exactly do i even use the horses in my stable?! 3 seige weapons are just slightly bigger versions of the catapult..3 - maps - maps lack any creativity whatsoever. none of them seemed very fun to me. 4 - characters are no longer fun - I remember the good ol days when the skirmish leaders were entertaining and had distinct personalities. now theres not as many to choose from and they seem like perverted versions of their former selves. troops as well...no more ""WE ARE THE MACEMEN"" or ""HEEEERE COMES BESSIE""5 - bad AI - I cant tell you how annoying it is when I'm building up my castle and all of the sudden my teammate builds a seige camp in the middle of my town. (For that matter, why do we even need seige camps!? they should never have changed the engineers guild mechanic)All in all it seems like all the devs tried to do was improve graphics and make the game more fast paced, which is something it DID NOT need. The original Stronghold Crusader rules and moves at a perfect pace. Perfect. Like i said before, you are purchasing a farce, not a game here.			"

												I'm sorry, fellow Stronghold fans, but they have dropped the ball yet again. This game is nothing more than an over-simplified Stronghold Crusader with better graphics and UI layout. If you are new to the series, I strongly reccomend you check out the original Stronghold Crusader or better yet, Stronghold 2. If you are a long time fan like myself, please don't make the mistake I made and spend $50 on this game. Reconsider if you see it down to $15, otherwise we go back to waiting for another Stronghold 2.			"

												There are two different players that are giving this game negative reviews, on one side we have the haters, ultra regressives, and ultra progressives. The haters probably got burnt by Stronghold 3 so they bought this game just to hate on it, they are the minority. The ultra regressives wanted a sequal that was EXACTLY the same as the first Crusader, you'll see them complaining on the forums in force about how the 'feel' just isn't the same or the nerve of Firefly to omit or chage x unit, x building, or x mechanic. These are the majority and by far the largest asshats. The final gripers are ultra progressive, they think a sequal needs to be completely reimagined. 'throw out that tried and true♥♥♥♥♥♥ we want everythign to be new' it's asinine thinking like this that puts indie studios out of bussiness. You want me to name what's changed? Changes are minimal because it's a frikking sequal beaches!!The other type of players giving this game negative reviews has far more credibility, they have experienced bugs or performance issues that drastically impact playability. However Firefly has been clear that they'll continue to patch the game and the steam workshop will be available soon to share your maps.			"

												The game is very similar the the original Crusader game.  You build an economy, build walls, defend walls, attack other castles.  The AI for the enemies is predictable and easily countered.  If you're an experienced RTS player, there is not much challenge here for you.  The only real risk is right in the beginning before you get your walls in place.  After that, cakewalk.  I was very disappointed in the initial release.  It seemed incomplete.  I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when they pretty quickly released 2 DLC's for $6 each.  I prepurchased the game, and I pretty much regret that now.  I would have never paid full price.  Maybe if the game and all DLC goes on sale for 75% or more, it'd be worth it.  For the price they are asking now, and the additional cost for DLC, I have to regretfully recommend that you don't purchase this game.  I loved the original, and spent hours playing.  I actually completed all of the original campaign in my 11.3 hrs on record.  I'll probably have to spend another 5 hours or so to complete the DLC.  Disappointing...			"

												As a long-time Stronghold fan I stood by the side of Firefly Studios. Even after failure and failure of trying to match something they created before, I still had hope. But all my hope, love and respect for Firefly Studios is all gone after this game. They gave old and new fans hope that they could create the best Stronghold game in the frachise but failed horribly.

												Fan of the series? Buy it. Fan of RTS games? Buy it.Welcome M’lord to a review of Stronghold Crusader 2.After waiting 12 long years since the first Crusader game, Firefly Studios have released the much anticipated sequel; Stronghold Crusader 2. Whilst the later instalments of the franchise have not lived up to the critical acclaim of the earlier games, fans of the series remained somewhat optimistic in the build up to release. Personally I found myself feeling a mixture of excitement and anxiety, hoping that Firefly would rekindle the ashes of Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader and avoid giving us another flop (…cough cough looking at you, Stronghold 3)Stronghold Crusader 2The action starts straight away with a cinematic showcasing the iconic Templar Swordsman pitted against a Whirling Dervish, one of the newly introduced mercenary troops. A great little addition to build some atmosphere before getting to the main menu.Jumping into single player, gamers are given a variety of options including the Skirmish Trails campaign, Custom Skirmish and Sandbox. These options include plenty of tutorials for newcomers and players who need to dust off their swords and bows before jumping in to the main campaign. Tutorial missions teach the basics of building your castle and surviving out in the desert whilst the Learning Campaigns gives players the opportunity to implement all the tools they have learned. After you’ve had your fill of practice, the main Skirmish Trails await. Acting as the main campaign, this set of Trials pits you against multiple enemies in a variety of scenarios, requiring different approaches for each enemy and terrain that you encounter. The Trials are split into a six missions trees, helping break up the relatively time consuming campaign into more manageable chunks.My initial impressions of the tutorials missions were that they are infuriatingly restricted in terms of available buildings, troops and ways to complete the obnoxious goals such as destroying every single piece of rubble or painfully waiting for a set number of resources to be collected. My feelings about the Learning Campaigns are slightly more positive, at least they have an element of challenge and a variety of strategies to achieve the mission objectives. In hindsight I do appreciate that these missions are heavily tailored for newer players and provide an environment to learn all the basics and ante up the degree of difficulty until they reach the same playing field as more veteran fans of the series. Yet the sheer amount of training missions is what seems unnecessary, especially given that players will need to endure hours of patronising gameplay to unlock all available achievements.The Skirmish Trials do a valiant effort at injecting some fun and excitement into the game, offering a wide variety of challenges by mixing up your enemies, allies, map size and access to resources. The learning curve is steep right off the bat, with quick decisions and a fast clicking finger being vital. There’s a fine balance to be struck between getting your economy up and running whilst also prepping your defences for the incoming attacks that happen extremely soon due to the rush-happy nature of AI opponents.Stronghold Crusader 2After sinking 20 hours of gameplay into the campaign I can safely say that there is an element of repetition between the missions. Is it because of the rinse and repeat approach of spamming overpowered archers until you have enough gold and troops to blitz the enemy? Is it because resources are so scarce, forcing you to twiddle your thumbs and wait? Is it because peasants spawn painfully slow and hovels are woefully overpriced? Probably a mix of all 3, plus countless other aggravating features. Talking of annoying features, let’s quickly address the voice acting and narrations. Irritating opponents such as “The Rat” have been a staple of the franchise since the initial Stronghold. Well, if the Developer’s aim was to annoy players then they sure succeeded. The voice acting seems poor quality throughout and the repetition of phrases seems more apparent than it should be for a reputable game produced in 2014. Fortunately the soundtrack provides some saving grace, providing an enjoyable ambience whilst you go about your medieval business.There are some redeeming features to the game. The inclusion of unlimited stockpiles, granaries and armouries are welcomed additions. As are the improvements to team AI who are surprisingly competent and respond to your trade requests unlike in the first Crusader game. The easy-to-manage popularity metre is also a nice touch, allowing players to balance positive and negative popularity contributors to find the sweet spot between taxation and resources. The graphics, whilst not extraordinary, remain nostalgically reminiscent of the first Crusader game and the improvements of seeing towers shudder and walls crumble under your siege assault is certainly rewarding.If you fancy a change from the pre-set missions there are a variety of choices to wet your castle crushing appetite. Creating your own scenarios allows players to edit maps, starting resources and computer controlled Lords. Moreover, if you crave even more customisation feel free to create your own maps in the Sandbox or download some user-created maps from the community. This contributes to the replayablility that the game offers, giving an almost infinite combination of enemies, maps and ways to conquer your opposition. There is also the option of jumping in to Multiplayer for a real challenge. There does seem to be a relative lack of lobbies though, so my recommendation would be to grab some buddies to bulk out the numbers. If, when it comes to your friends, you’re more of a lover than a fighter, there’s the chance to play co-operatively and take control of the same castle. This was one of the new features promoted during the build-up to the game, but in reality it’s quite gimmicky and leaves me with the disgruntled opinion that it’s simply more fun to control separate keeps and team up as normal.Stronghold Crusader 2Overall Stronghold Crusader 2 just doesn’t do enough to win me over. It’s a noticeably better game than recent instalments in the Stronghold series, but if Firefly hopes to rekindle the success of the earlier games in the franchise they still have a way to go. The lack of innovations and major improvements over the original game is underwhelming to say the least, there is also a feeling amongst the community that the focus is much more combat focused rather than actually building up your castle and infrastructure, a sign of the times in modern gaming. I frequently found myself not even bothering with a castle and opting instead for a few strategically placed towers filled with archers. Ultimately the game is a satisfactory addition to the RTS genre, but the slow paced growth and underwhelming improvements over the original game leaves me reluctant to recommend it to anyone other than hardcore fans of the series and genre.

												TLDR: This game isn't bad.... but for the price it just isn't worth it.The game play is fun, and the supply chains are fun, but the central focus of the game is on combat. The combat controls and AI are pretty horrible,  There isn't even an attack-move command. Your huge siege force needs to be seriously babied for them to be even remotely successful, which makes many of the potentially more fun units useless. I can't even seem to figure out how to get my flaming hay launcher to actually shoot at invading troops. Also no range indicators on siege engines mean a lot of guesswork especially when there are height differences in terrain.The game also just doesn't seem very polished. It won't even change the sound over when I plug in my headphones, I have to completely exit the game and renter for it to work. And unlike the 10-year old first game, you can't customize your castle's staircases, and it doesn't draw entraces to towers on your walls. Your units literally port up to the top of towers. You also have less options for putting things on the walls of your castles like trebuchets. Instead, ballistas and such are defensive wooden towers on their own, but don't even connect with your stone walls. Also gone are all non-stone castles, save wooden barricades that get burnt down pretty much instantly.If you can get it on a large sale, I'd say pick it up, but this Isn't a sequel to stronghold crusader 2, it's a reskin of a 10 year old game, with nothing new and no improvements to AI. Not worth the price. For a grade-A game price, I expected a grade-A game, but feels less polished than many $10 indie games I play.			"

Even Red Alert 3 have better graphics and mechanics than SC2.As a SC1 fan, I'm very disappointed.			"

												I love both the stronghold and the stronghold crusader series, but i have to say I played it for about 30 min and it felt like its was a worse version of the original stronghold crusader game, but with better graphics. I want my money back*UPDATE*(after I had writen this review, I had actually forgotten that I had bought it, then returned it. But the review was already written so here it is)So a while ago I saw that this game was coming out and I was more than excited- i had played both the stronghold and the stronghold crusader series and loved them both (but liked stronghold a bit more). Needless to say, I was ready to pay the unreasonable price of 50 bucks until I saw the negative reviews. At first, I was confused because alot of the people leaving negative reviews acted as though this was  STRONGHOLD and not Stronghold CRUSADER. I quickly realized that more than HALF the reviews were people expecting stronghold and were let down when they had bought it and realized it was actually part of the crusader franchise, not the stronghold one.SO, if you're still reading this and plan to look at other reviews, keep in mind that most of these were expecting a different game entirely, and judged this one a bit unfairly. (For example, one of them complained about the lack of oases.... this is stronghold CRUSADER , which is set in the dessert. It wouldnt make sense for it to have fields of grass like in Stronghold 2Now without further ado, here comes the review:Pros:* Visually pleasing in combat and building modes* Challenging enemies with different attack patterns*Money slowly regenerates (unlike Stronghold Crusader 1)* More detail in hovel distance from the keep*Screenshots taken in-game look amazingCons:* Scrolling controls a little gimmicky* Huge price* Very little difference from Stronghold Crusader 1I was happy with the way the developers tried to update an old favourite graphically, yet still make it recongnizable to old fans. However, I think I speak for alot of people when I say that gameplay is more important to me than graphics, and after I played for a bit, I couldn't really tell how the developers changed the game. Honestly, it seemed exactly the same. It was a huge letdown to know that although the game looks great and had so much hype, the developers threw back a carbon copy of Stronghold Crusader 1, added a glossy cover and charged $50 a pop. This being said, I was one of the lucky ones because I played it during the $10 sale and play-for-free days. While having the reduced price and full demo of the game SHOULD make me want to buy it, it doesnt. I already have Stronghold Crusader HD, why would I want to buy the exact same game again? I would probably only consider it if it had an even lower price. I don't like wasting money.In conclusion, If you loved the Stronghold Crusader series, but you dont have the money to (or dont want to) get this game, check out Stronghold 2 or even Stronghold Crusader Extreme HD, or Stronghold Crusader HD. I feel so sorry for all those fans who wasted 50 bucks on this.			"

Save often as your game will crash frequently and don't bother saving multiplayer as the save will often omit entire players castles.			"

												There's quite a few negative reviews for this, now I haven't played much of this, however I think I can say (as a fan of the original crusader)... (Like pretty effin big fan).... that it doesn't seem too bad, will have to try the multiplayer soon, as I have been playing the tutorial to get the hang of the new game and it's menu.			"

												Don't believe the negative reviews. This game is great fun! The graphics on all the earlier Strongholds are horrible in my opinion. I don't see how people can go there after playing this version. The economy is a bit tricky to get the hang of so you may want to read some tip guides like I did to get a feel for it. The combat tactics (and economic strategies) seem vast. The computer AI's could be better as I can now beat them pretty consistently now in skirmish mode, but that took a while. I've moved on to multiplayer now, which has been fun (when I can find someone to play). Like some of the others, I don't understand the mixed reviews. I'm guessing it must be from old school Stronghold diehards who don't want to learn anything new. The battles I've setup and played on Crusader 2 have been simply glorious to watch.			"

There's a lot of bugs and poor coding.- 50% chance of your troops ain't move where you click, they just wanna chill out (happens when the path is too narrow)- 50% your emeries have negative amount of troops on the board (reputation point turns to 0)- 25% chance of your enemies ain't shoot you, they wanna chill out too- 20% chance of moon walking- 5% chance of your mouse cursor dissappears after saving the game			"

												An interesting take on the medival RTS genre, but it does a quite few things wrong. I realize this is a ""remake"" of an older game, but the control scheme needed to be remade to be a bit less dated and clunky feeling. There's no attack move vs normal move, there's no queing up actions, and your soliders just do weird♥♥♥♥♥♥all the time and don't always listen to you. The ""formation"" thing is totally broken as it will slow your units down by a good 25% because they simply don't move if they're out of position. Your units sort of engage whoever they want to engage and they will engage enemies even if you tell them to flee. There are no hotkeys btw; you must use the UI to do every action.The economy component is convoluted and hard to manage. Most of the time you're just totally guessing as to how much food your producing and how much gold you're making. Boosting ""happiess"" is a shot in the dark a lot of the times as well. I like that there's so much going on with the economy, don't get me wrong, I just don't like that you have little feedback as to the output of each building and the current demand.Throw on top of that a set of campagin missions that get so difficult you'll be spending hours just to beat a single mission. I haven't even finished the ""learning campaign"" yet, I can only imagine how hard the ""skirmish trails"" (actual campaign?) gets.I was bored and thought this would be a fun waste of time and it just turned out to be a pain more than anything.

My army does not follow my instructions and I find them running the opposite direction if not watched continously, some just stand there and get killed in midst of a battle.I cannot buld while enemies are near - yet my enemies have no such restrictions, I attack their economy buldings with no effect on their population, my walls crumble when a few enemy pick at it yet my guys enmasse do little to the enemy castle,the list goes on and on.I would not recommend this game at all..

												Big fan of the first Stronghold Crusader. It was the BEST. The game in unique, and the concept and ideas behind it is great.So, I bought the new one and I enjoy playing it. BUT, is seems that the developer doesn't have the technical abilities needed to produce a game that is playable without frequent crashes and major bugs. Due to this, I had to repeat many missions again because the game all of a sudden stops working. It's not a problem for me, because I enjoy playing the game. But what made me write this comment today is because I finished the Campaigns and half of the Skirmish trails then everything in the game got deleted and started from point zero, as if I just downloaded it.It's really frustrating and sad to see such a great game being ruined by such issues, I really hope the developer put more effort into improving the games technical flaws. And sorry for my bad english..			"

												I have played the first Stronghold Crusader, and must say that I can't see so much changes in the 2nd part. the game is boring, as always that 4 enemy You have to defeat just changing the misson map. there is som bugs as well, for example when I created some knights and wanted to assign horses to them, some horse stuck and I cant make a calvary knight anymore, as the horse in the line is cant find the solder, so need to demolish the stable, and build a new one.. over 8h of play I'm not interested anymore as all the missions seems to be the same, just varying the gold, and the enemies (from that 4-5 available ones). if You a fanatic SC player then go ahead and give a try, otherwise just buy the much cheaper SC HD version, it gives You almost the same joy...

There are no hotkeys btw; you must use the UI to do every action.The economy component is convoluted and hard to manage. Most of the time you're just totally guessing as to how much food your producing and how much gold you're making. Boosting ""happiess"" is a shot in the dark a lot of the times as well. I like that there's so much going on with the economy, don't get me wrong, I just don't like that you have little feedback as to the output of each building and the current demand.Throw on top of that a set of campagin missions that get so difficult you'll be spending hours just to beat a single mission. I haven't even finished the ""learning campaign"" yet, I can only imagine how hard the ""skirmish trails"" (actual campaign?) gets.I was bored and thought this would be a fun waste of time and it just turned out to be a pain more than anything.

												Don't buy if: You believe the scope of the battles and maps shown in the pictures looks cool (completely misleading)If you expect anything like AOE 2If you love 4x, strategy or RTS gamesIf you don't like to waste moneyCan't believe this game is still $50... I bought this at launch and was very dissapointed.  It's a boring game, with slow moving units (some just painful to watch), and really small maps with little flexibility.  Theres much better games to spend money on.			"

												I have played countless hours on Crusader (the original, not even the remastered). I can't say the same for this one. 8 lords immidiately shocked me, 6 BEING FROM NUMBER ONE!!! It's an utter disgrace. Everything else in the game feels.... Just awkward and not right.... I understand change but they made number 2 just horrible, the campaign, the maps (80% of maps are from number 1.)  And the DLC.. $26 Dollars for it all, that's $76 dollars for the whole bundle when you could buy the remastered number one for what? $10? (And get waaay more things.)I was probably one of the biggest fans of Stronghold Crusader, but i just feel let down, majorly.I give this game a 2/10			"

												So unbeliveably bad that it causes me to avoid this company in the future.Their graphical department delivered horrible quality, as the game looks far worse than the free game 0A.D. and by far too bad to be released after 2010.The gameplay is questionable and also low quality in many regards. I just cant list all of what i could see there as it would basically come down to just telling that everything in this game is just ranging from garbage to low quality at best.Its not even worth to be played for free, certainly not the pricetag.Think about any issue or negative aspect you saw in games ever and you will find it here, from bad popping up textures, to no textures at all, bad visual design, UI, sound design, awful animations and main menu. Its uninspired and crappy.I played one skirmish and tutorial when it had a free weekend, i uninstalled it directly after this one skirmish and couldnt be bothered to waste my time anymore on it.After a year i got this game in a bundle, installed it to try it out again and maybe see improvements, again after only 10 minutes playing a mission i uninstalled it.To give you an idea of the scale of my opinion here:I started at an age of 5 with Strategy games like Settlers 2, Warcraft 2, C&C 1-3 and Knights and Merchants. I played quite every RTS, Build-up, build-up Strategy and City Builder Game you could pick and some you might not even ever heard of and games with names ive already forgotten. During the last years i literally bought and played every strategy game being released, as this genre doesnt get as much attention anymore and games are rarely released. Especially the city builder and RTS genre, lesser so the Turn Based Strategy or RTT genre, as there are more games to pick from.But even with literally taking every game i could get my hands on in this genre, i would never touch this one here again.There are bad strategy games, mediocre even, but every one of those that couldnt get me hooked or had major flaws, none of them was so disappointing than SH Crusader 2.

												I must say that I was waiting for this game a long time and bought it without hesitating....I shouldn't have done that.Stronghold Crusader I is a game i played many dozens of hours, single- and multiplayer. Building a castle and prepare to defend it against hordes of enemies was always thrilling. The economy system was decent and the overall look had a lovely style. With such experiences of the first part, I simply couldn't wait for the next part, expecting new content, 3D graphics and more depth in strategy and tactics. Now i played Stronghold Crusader the Second for some hours, tried multiplayer and singleplayer. All I can say is that it has way too many flaws to give it a positive review. It's simply because of the economic system. The only profitable food source is bread, wood can be bought so cheaply on the market that woodcutter lose their sense, candle maker produce candles without any resources... I simply can't understand how they can design such a system.The military part on the other hand is actually pretty good! The selection of the units allows great tactics for invading and defending. Archers on towers are darn difficult to kill, but there are ways to overwhelm them. Fire is still a big thing on this game, thankfully! You can still harass enemies in different ways without big attacks and every unit has weaknesses and strengths. I can't get mad at losing when I got dominated with great maneuvers.But even if the wargame of Stronghold Crusader 2 is nice, it still feels like there's a big hole in the game. I am never satisfied when I am done building a castle because it pretty much looks the same every time: A weapon factory running on bread. Before you think about buying this game, you should take a closer look and ask yourself if you can be happy with what the game has to offer.			"

												Glitchy, lousy interface, unstable (stops working a lot), nothing new here really.  Some keyboard functions are locked out while playing.  Commands will change while playing via keyboard (I think).  Map orientation is sloppy, not well engineered and really annoying.    The game becomes boring quickly.  Next time hire at least one person with half an imagination that just doesn't use previous game broken mechanics to strap together a ""game"" on a limited budget.			"

												This is actully really good game - I wish they had more stronhold 2 style options like toture and heads and decerations for your castle sending people to jail so forth. that was always really kol in stronhold series.I also wish the map sizes where bigger.to me the XL size is prefect for a two player or maybe three player game.----------------------------------------so I am making addon to this - the map editor is horriable - just horrible to work with.for example lets say you have 8 players for total of 20 estates that can be taken over you have to manualy put into map a script for each Fing player for each fing estate exampleif player 1 catpures estate 2 from player 2  then estate 2 switches to player 1 if player 2 captures estate 2 then from player 1 estate 2 switchers to player 2you have to do this for all  8 players for them to take it form each other and have it manualy switch to each player.its pretty horriable no basic game mechnanics of any type are automaticly built into maps.all maps even skrmish maps are heavily scripted and you have to take the time to do it all.so unless you want to program 1k some lines into each and every map for every thing the players you add, AI - what happen when player takes an estate or beats ap layer unless u want to program 1k of scripts into game, you pretty much will have a worth less map.and this is reason why in workshop there really is not many maps.

												It is quite similar to the original Stronghold and, if you're into castle building RTS games, you will like this one. However, this game is only good value below $20; otherwise, you're paying too much for what you get.Some say the developers are still adding content to this game. I hope this is true since the game can really stand out with a little bit more polish and balance tweaks.			"

												you play the first one?? then you should try this game+ PROS- pros more character like sultana and shah and other- very detail landscape- the campaign itself its good- awesome new units- CONS- The units its self its so ♥♥♥♥ing slow compare to SC1 , Swordsman in SC its faster than in SC2- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character animation,especially shah,does he high?SC1 it self they got smooth animation character- bug- no peasents reaction. when you click on peasent in SC1 they gonna react or say good morning sir or morning you lordship. or when they compliment at me when i increase they ratio food. now in SC2 Peasent. they just soulless peasent with no reaction at all- Map rotation its making me dizzy- for the new player in this game be careful,in SC 1 Campaign there some background story and history explained in there and also they got some tips and guide how to pass lvl , now in campaign theres no explain at all, you jump right in and start the game.Firefly next time you created SC3 Make sure you got SC1 Magic on you.all your hardcore fans dont ♥♥♥♥ing care about graphic,we only care abaout playstyle AND FAST PACED COMBAT,  (ps sorry for my bad english)			"

I also was not able to play the game because I am but a poor student. However, I got to try this weekend, and I can honestly say that I love it. Its Stronghold Crusader meets Stronghold 2.

												This game is absolutely not worth $50Wait until it goes on sale. This is a $15-$20 game. I played for 5 hours straight and experienced everything the game had to offer. The maps are small, the graphics are a decade old, the gameplay is very dumbed down and overly simple. There aren't that many buildings to build which means a really simple basic economy. The campaign is so damn boring, I usually find myself just sitting there waiting for it to just finish. CASTLE BUILDING is awful. Your walls cannot completely approach water, it just ends and then people walk around it. Your walls are easily destroyed. I played a sandbox game and had it completely beaten with hundreds of population and I didn't feel challenged once. I wanted my small settlement to turn into a large castle town, but instead I just got a haphazard mess of random buildings with no real purpose. There would need to be major changes, radical changes in future updates to make this game worth it. If I could get a refund, I would.			"

The game is badly optimized...After the premiere I was able to play on Maximum details.  Now 3 or 4 updates later I am not able to play at all...When there are more then 200 units near my castle the game is painfully slow. I DO NOT recommend it. Better to play the original one.			"

												Do not buy this game. It would seem very exciting to be able to build your own castle. Were this kind of concept married with gameplay on par with, for example, the real time component of Medieval Total War II (a game nearly a decade old), the game would be a joy and a gem. However, the mechanics of combat in this game are so unplayably bad that to simply say it ruins the game would be a gross understatement.			"

												Disappointing pile of garbage. I was a die hard fan of stronghold since the first game. Stronghold 2 was a big change but I learned to like it, then 3 came out and I knew this series was done. I decided to give Crusader 2 the benefit of the doubt but sadly I should have stuck with my gut instinct because it's just beyond sad of what a watered down version it has become since its predecessors. The economy is a joke, building castles takes ages and even then you have 3 towers to chose from, one slightly bigger than the other, same design. 1 single Gatehouse model, (unless you count the curtain one). Your badass Knights from S2, you know, the ones where 4 could kill a single lord? Yeah they can hardly take on 10 rangers. Your armies get wiped out where as the enemies is OP as f***. AI will build farms on your grasslands, right outside your castle walls and let your archers pick off their peasants. Then charge in with a spam horde of slaves and burn down your farms, as well as theirs.Just don't, seriously just don't. This game is a sad joke that I wouldn't even buy for my 10 year old nephew.

												Good solid game overall first time I started playing this series and I am enjoying it a lot. The Cons are the game play can get stagnant after a while and the tutorials difficulty changes dramatically and ruins that part of it. The second main con is the AIs are really stupid and follow the same paths and attack the same areas.But I think the money they ask is a reasonable amount to ask for the content included in the game. This is has a very different feel to most RTS games and is a nice change I hope more RTS use this method in the future.Defiantly fun haven’t tried multiplayer but looking forward to playing with friends.

												中文版在下面To be honest I am a bit disappointing with this game, as this is the game that used to bring me hours and hours of fun in my childhood memory.Sure I used to be a big fan, and I will undoubtly pay you the money I owe you (I have to play pirate version of the game when I was a child). So I am not expecting a big improvement or anything, as least please just be as good as the one I used to play. But it is not, countless game feature that has been removed, even art works and CGs are not as good as its predecessor(But thanks god you keep the music as it was).I will say this game is unfinished, the ONLY reason that is comforting me is I can use Steam to play with my friends instead of playing with myself as ten years ago, Yay.BTW, if you are adding those features you used to have in DLCs! I WILL NEVER TOUCH ANY GAME FROM YOUR COMPANY!========================================================================总的来说我对这款游戏很失望，可能是因为前作对我影响太深吧。小时候没有网络，没有钱，我就玩着盗版的单机，一玩可以连续玩好久好久。不过说实话我也对游戏行业的续作有些了解，知道成功的续作并不多。但是这款游戏不仅没有新的东西，许多经典的兵种啊特色啊CG什么的都被删除了- -，失望之余更多的是费解，我实在是不知道为什么。总之吧，我买这款游戏的原因差不多就是有因为玩盗版前作的内疚感，算是还帐了~还有就是这次可以跟朋友玩玩多人模式。。虽然游戏是阉割过的，但是也挺不错最后说一句，如果开放商打算把那些特色作为DLC加进去的话，我是绝！对！不！会！买！帐！的！			"

												Ive been a fan of previous Stronghold games but to be completely honest im not feeling it this go around. It honestly feels unbalanced and even easier to destroy castles while many units feel useless like defensive siege towers. IMO it is better looking then previous games but does not offer a game changing experience to the title. This feels more like a update then a new game. No Siege Towers / Ladders??? Really... You can insta build a siege camp just outside of enemy territory and insta build as many weapons as you can afford and demolish an enemy castle in less then 10s this supports amazing game play... Multiplayer is riddled with hackers making that whole experiece worthless.The game has some very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ new ideas and terrible ideas from previous games.UPDATE: I have 14 hours in this game and out of 9 friends who own the game the one who has the second most time in the game has 1.5 hours. Save your money unless you are a diehard fan of the Stronghold Games.Age of Empires: Better city builder strategy game.Total War: Better castle bashing.			"

												I loved Stronghold Crusader back in the days, so I was a little hyped when I saw the game in the store. Reviews were good, what could go wrong, right?Lets start with what's good. There isnt too much changed from the original. More or less the same units, same buildings, same game mechanics, also the music is fitting (well, its the same as in SHC). So, how can this be a bad game?Graphics. Everything looks washed, tiny and small. Units look the same. Original SHC looked much better in my opinion. You cant differ. AI was bad in SHC, it hasnt improved much. Enemies just ran at your castle walls without any tactic at all (and they seem to use the same routes more or less everytime they attack). I cant figure out how to rotate buildings. Is there any hotkey? Are there any hotkeys at all? I dont know, the game doesnt tell me and there is now way to configure anything. There is not much new content. You even got nearly the same enemies you had in SHC1. There are bugs. Like catapults standing right in front of you shooting at your walls but somehow you cant destroy them with archers because they overlap with that enemy construction camp. This isnt a finished game at all. I would ignore all this tiny annoying things if the graphics were decent but hell, those washed textures look like 20 years old.			"

If you like RTS and just want to kill things then get it. If you liked the simulation part of the old games that meant that you had to do more then just throw lots of troops at your enemy then dont bother.			"

												I'm a big, big Stronghold fan. Been all the way through everything ever made with this brand name (although managed to be scared away from Stronghold 3 by the 1-star rating on Amazon, and some of the most scathing reviews I think I have ever seen on a game).  By now, started to experience withdrawal symptoms because I changed PC and most of my SH games wouldn't work on Win 8 except for Legends. Saw Crusader II being advertised and was relieved...thank you, thank you, thank you...did some homework, watched some youtube playthroughs, and everything looked grand, but...The game won't even run on my PC except in the lowest graphic setting, and then the buildings and everything looks awful.  Secondly, is it my imagination or are there only a total of about 12 buildings that can be built? Seems so very few now. If you are going to re-release a game, wouldn't a bit more content for the quite ridiculous price not be the order of the day? I saw that there are add-ons purchasable for it, but come on...I've already paid £22.99 and I've got to pay more for add-ons? Feel pretty stupid because I feel I have totally wasted my money. The hours logged as play time were me just sitting there and going: 'I hope this gets better."" instead of actually enjoying it.Such a pity. Stronghold is LEGENDARY. This is just carp. Very expensive carp.			"

												Ok guys, I update my review. After I play this game, I can tell you something about this game.First, this game is better than old version, stronghold crusader, why???Because in fact, in my opinion, it has a good features, such as a group army, new type of chuch,and when you order your siege weapon and your knight to a place, In old stronghold your knight will run slow as the siege, but in this game, there is nothing like that. Anyway in this game, the ox is running to a place witch need power to pick the stone or iron to stockpile. Oh, about stockpile, you can place your stockpile anywere, and you need an ox to take your iron to stockpile, whan next... hm... oh yes, one thing you need to sure... When you play single player mission, or VS Computer [AI] , don't think it just same gameplay, with previous stronghold, all things is advanced, even an healer is avaliable* in this game, Many troops to comand-Anyway guys, thanks for reading and make sure to leave A LIKE to this review,Created by : KevPowered by : Stronghold crusader and Stronghold crusader 2 [FIREFLY]			"

												I have played the original crusader for years, and when I heard this was coming out, I was REALLY excited, despite having another year or so to wait. However, I waited it out and bought the game. Originally, it was slow. When I viewed a castle it lagged. I discovered this was a problem with my RAM - 3GB. I tried it on my laptop - 4GB RAM - and it proved to be much better. It is a great improvement on the original crusader, if a little memory-draining. The multilayer is a great advantage, if a little buggy.Some good units have dissapeared, but thankfully, were replace with units of equal awesomeness. Engineers have been removed. Another good point is that the view is much more controllable.I would recommend, despite it being similar to the original. I wish they would add more AIs though - there's only eight.			"

												Thus far, I've only forced myself to play this game, while the original I couldn't do anything but help give hundreds upon hundreds of hours into the game. At first it's simple structure seemed likeable to me, only to realize the maps are horribly designed for Stronghold Crusader 2. You have to build your mines completely exposed, with no way to build fortifications anywhere near them to defend it, leaving you constantly buying iron, stone, and even sometimes FOOD. Yes, that's right even the oasis seems to be terribly misplaced. On some maps these disadvantages are fine, because it could prove a challenge that veteran players are looking for. However for the masses, I cannot see how this was a good move.While it may not bother some, however it should be noted that the characters from the previous series who make a come back in this one are no where NEAR alike that of the original Stronghold, or Stronghold Crusader. You can't tell me that they can't afford better voices and animations for SHK2, everyone I've seen who liked the series purchased it immediately. Stronghold Crusader is better in many, many aspects in not only animations, but also the looks of said characters even noting the pixelation. Their voices also fit the part well, and the actors did an exceedingly wonderful job at sounding convincing. However for SHK2, their lines are corny, their voices sound unconvincing, (as if he wasn't talking about the same subject that he was) and overall their cut-seen is horribly tacky. It gives you a big, ""So and so time.."" and transparents to a scene with two warriors, they clash blades and.. that's all. Yep, that build up for nothing.But let's get out of the pit of despair for a bit. They have some new units, to which are likeable. Such as the Ranger, who is capable of both range, and meleee combat, though not an expert at either.  They updated the graphics... for the most part. (again not on character models, ie when the rat portrait comes up when he's mad/attacking you) They have a simplier, clever system. Although I think overall for me this is good, this can be debated on highly. I just now thank the game that I don't have to focus on rebuilding economy/walls constantly when I'm being barraged with enemies.If you're certain about purchasing this game, just keep in mind I was too. Overall I regret it as it stands, but if they fix the animations, voices, script for lines, and maps, then we'll start talking. In comparison to Stronghold Crusader, this game has very few gameplay hours, unless maybe you're a PvP-focused person? Not too sure how well PvP works in this game, but considering the maps.. I imagine not too fun since your economy being smashed is nothing you can really control. Unless you love fighting field battles. "

												After the disastrous Stronghold 3, Firefly rescued themselves and deliver a good castle sim/ RTS again.SHC 2 is a very good stronghold game, for me it is somehow a remake of the first crusader, with some elements changed, to the better or to the worse depend on how you see it. The overall vibe of the game is really cool and feels so much like the first game. Overall the game is very enjoyable, and offers a lot of game modes. This game is good restart point for firefly studios and from here they can build the game up and add more features. The game still needs some patching and improvement however.If you are a stronghold series fan get it now with no hesitation, if you are new then you can wait for patch or two or get it when it is cheaper, because to be honest the price is kind of high for what the game is currently delivering.

												This game is terrible...Yes the graphics are nice..the building models are cool etc. But the AI is TERRRIBLE...you will notice that i have not completed even 4 hours of playing this game. This is bc it is so damn unfair...I could not even complete the tutorial missions because i kept dying bc the AI cheats like crazy/ or the mission design is terrible. I have played RTS games for years and this is by far one of the most frustrating games i have ever played in my entire life. The tutorial missions suck because they don't always explain why you should do something. Additionally some of the mechanics in this game are stupid...i build a huge catapault behind my castle walls...8 archers approach my wall and kill the catapault by shooting THROUGH the wall somehow and destroy a huge defensive structure that takes a lot of resources to build. In the territorial mission i got stuck on, within minutes of starting you are faced with constant attacks. They tell you to use your horse archers to harrass the attackers as they can fire and move. So i did...repeatedly. Ya that works to a point (bc sometimes they stop randomly and die, and after enough time while your trying to fend off the repeated attacks with your archers, you need to also raise your defenses and then build an army capable of destroying the enemy castle. Even with a literal army of those archers, and some frontline infantry and catapaults...the enemy base is structured in such a way that to get your catapaaults near the walls to destroy them (so your melee guys can get in there) the catapualts must enter archer range..and subsequently get destroyed as your trying to manage them, defending against the constant attacks, while trying ot push your own attack. I lost this mission repeatedly, even after i attacked the AI's economy in the first few minutes of the game (destroying his farms and all other buildings/workers outside his walls). I like a challenge..but when less than an hour into a games F$%&#@@ tutorial and i am constantly having to reload and reload..its just ridiculous. Oh..and did i mention that the AI on YOUR side is just stupid? You have oil pots laced around the map..your flame archers are the only ones who can set it off..but you have to micro manage EACH one and get them to fire at the oil patches you placed earlier..individually..while being attacked from multiple sides....this unit is the only one you are given in the mission to start the fires...yet you must tell them to start a fire individually (the fact they are near a place to start a fire and enemies just walked over it is not good enough...). Which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have people attacking you from 3 sides at once. just writing this review is making me relive the annoying and frustrating experience that was trying to ""play"" this broken, unfair, unfun, rip off, totallly poor excuse for a game. A game is supposed to be fun...minutes into a game when your yelling at the $$%$ screen because you keep dying in the tutorial...its not any fun period. This is not a game...its like internet trolls got together and created something they called a ""game"" to just @$#$% with people who wanted to have fun. Avoid...this..game...at...all...costs. you will regret it if you dont heed my advice. i plan on never giving this developer my money ever again...total garbage! Dont even buy it on sale..i paid full price for this garbage and after less than 4 hours of play..its been deleted.			"

												To think I preordered this game for 50 bucks, and for some reason I thought it would turn out good.I was wrong. I could use that 50 bucks back too. Heres why:-FAR less units than the original-Absolute nightmarish AI with infinite resources. Expect them to already have a castle and an army headed your way in 5-7 minutes.-I got bored of the campaign. Rather quickly too.-Laggy for some reason-Watered down gameplay. Once upon a time, Stronghold was known for being a castle-sim RTS. And boy, were the older games SO MUCH FUN. Now? Its a watery, poor RTS. Really Firefly? What happened? All you had to do was make a sequel to the original crusader. Does anyone remember having cool things like executing criminals and inspiring fear to your own people? How about the old Honor system? Castle feasts to gain honor? ITS ALL GONE HERE. Its a bit VERY sad that the original Crusader had about 42.7 times more content. I think you were better off doing a 3D remake. Not this.-Instead of fixing the game, Firefly makes some DLC's. I understand you are a small company, but you already milked those that bought this 50 bucks each. At this point, you don't NEED more money. -I don't know if this still happens, but even with 3 other people in a multiplayer game, it will either crash or disconnect. Fun.-It takes FOREVER to get resources. I do not recall it taking THIS long in Stronghold 2 + Stronghold Legends.-Again, Firefly could've had something going on here. but I couldn't tell you what happened. But the game just feels empty and not really finished.-Am I done yet? No.-There were interesting choices, like using the Havok engine for destruction. It DOES feel good when you tear down an enemy wall or tower. BUT the wall or tower will just re-appear momentarily.-Strategy? What? You think this was Strategy? I've played this game long enough to tell you that even if you DID get an army of units, you'll notice there is NO thinking involved when you attack. This is because there are 2 main types of units, and a few Special Mercenary units that attack in different ways. The Mercenaries were an interesting touch, to be honest, but if you see a large force of Arabian Knights heading your way, you'll notice your archers basically tickle them to death from a distance with arrows. Literally the only way to counter the tougher units like Knights is with Knights. The only thing to be concluded about strategy here is that Archers are used for taking out unarmored units and enemy peasants, and the tougher Melee units are only good for countering units of the same type. Fun. On top of that, the AI still has infinite resources and can spam such said Knights and such said Archers before you can blink.-Even worse is that back then, it felt pretty cool to be able to siege and starve out a faction's castle or spread diseases by launching sick cows. You can launch diseased animals in SC2, but its just an area of effect that deals some damage over a little bit. As for starving them out? Nope.-False advertisement. I will quote something from the description that makes me laugh every time: ""Crusader 2 recaptures the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation"". What fast-paced gameplay? You mean being rushed by the AI before you can recruit one guy is fast-paced? Authentic Castle Simulation? What are you simulating exactly? Nothing. The only thing to look at in a castle are the citizens moving about, gathering resources, etc. Thats it. No feasts, no jousts, no guards chasing criminals, no criminals rotting in a jail, no criminals being tortured, no criminals period. No falconers, dung patrol guys, no jester wandering around, no women tending to the households and going about, Nothing but people walking around. Sigh. Just a boring, plain castle with next to having absolute zero life in it.You know, if Firefly would have created a sequel by following in the footsteps of the original and grabbing a few things from the previous Strongholds, it would've been worthy of the 50 dollar price tag. I can't even fathom this game being sold for any more than 10 dollars. I would rather see the old 2D crusader ported into 3D, with the same units and stuff. That would've been much more worth it. But I just CANNOT understand HOW these guys messed up. They have the IP of a game that could quite possibly DESTROY the other RTS games out there. They could've gone more in-depth and perhaps added bigger maps, a territory system that you see in games like Rise of Nations, more units, actual strategic thinking, Hell, even some decent optimisation and a really high unit cap would've turned the tables. It seems like the graphic quality of this game surpasses the actual gameplay too.If you read this enormous wall of text I typed out, I thank you for reading this rant. If you are thinking of buying this game, GO BUY THE STRONGHOLD COLLECTION. It costs less and just ONE of the Strongholds it comes with has LOADS more content than this... abomination. It pains me to write this because this was once a respected series, and now its come to this.			"

												I am writing this review to help keep other crusaders like myself from making a huge mistake of buying this game. It is just awful, a complete let down. First off you're going to need a pretty beefy computer to run this, it isn't like the old crusader with simple graphics, it's all this new fancy ultra 3D graphics that will require much more then your basic video card. Second of all the whole game mechanics have  been demolished. If you played the original crusader you'll remember how you could press certain buttons to change the view to make it easier to build? Ya those are all gone. You can't lower the buildings down to see what the heck someone is doing behind your building. Also on that matter all buildings are faced forward, you cant change the direction their facing. I could go on for half an hour about everything wrong with this game but I'm just going to finish it short and simple:DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEDO NOT BUY THIS GAMEIT IS AWFUL YOU WILL REGRET IT AND IT WILL RUIN STRONGHOLD CRUSADER FOR YOU			"

												Very rough around the edges, some of the worst illustrations I've ever seen in a game, and poor UI graphic design can't stop the main event being massive fun. Stronghold is back!Once you get past the horrible front-end, you'll find an addictive and highly engaging RTS in the style of AOE3, with a highly developed castle building element. The economy echos the Anno games too, but in a much more streamlined form.In-game graphics are good, with nice character designs, and some good animations. Castles look well planted, and the environment is fairly interesting.Voice acting is as excellent as ever, but it sounds like clips from the older games have been re-used, including much of the fantastic music (possible the best I've heard in any game).The game has currently dropped a lot of the whimsical characterisation of the peasants, and certain popular features, such as the castle enhancements and punishments, have been left out, but crucially, Crusader 2 plays better than the original Stronghold. City management is easy and rewarding, castle designing is incredibly simple and flexible, and the siege element is the best in any RTS yet.There's much more to come, according to the developers, and i believe them. Stronghold Crusader 2 is the game that should have been made years ago. It captures the Stronghold atmosphere perfectly and actually improves on the original's core game play.			"

												This will be a very brief review. In my opinion the game is worth buying. I wouldn't rank this as a top RTS, but I enjoyed playing it. When I purchase a game, I shoot to average $1-2/hr. of play time. Since the base game is $50 and my hours at the writing of this review is over 37, I would consider this game a winner. If you were a major fan of the old Stronghold games, you may dislike this game. It is a striped down and simplified version with some moderate graphics. It does have some very disappointing AI and gives the impression that the designers spent very little time thinking of balance or performance. It is an enjoyable game, but after about 30 hours you will likely begin to lose interest. I eagerly await future updates and expansions to improve the selection available and gameplay. "

Posted: September 28, 2014
												I have been playing stronghold titles since 2003, starting with Crusader and playing everything since. This series is the best Castle Sim RTS out there. With Crusader 1 being dear to my heart, and with the last title in the series, Stronghold 3 being a colossal failure, I, like many longtime Stronghold fans, was trepidatious as to how this title would pan out. Upon seeing mostly positive reviews I scooped it up and haven't regretted it since. I have seen negative reviews complaining about some of the elements of the original being taken out. So what, you want the exact same game again? Sure things were omitted, but things were also added too. The siege equipment is much more varied and detailed, and the castle defenses offers fun alternatives, as just a small example of new material.WHAT I LIKE:Economy and Food Balance & ease of interface with this aspect - this element is enough to make it challenging but does not require constant micromanagement while out pillaging and rampaging.New Troop options - offers additional new units through both the barracks and mercenary post that are worth trying. Slave Driver, anyone? A couple Whirling Dervishes?New and Entertaining Siege Equipment - ever wanted to watch a rotting camel carcass splatter on your enemies' castle and minions? Now is your chance!New AI Characters, plus the classicsSkirmish mode!!! Hours of fun. Hours. Devs plan to add more content as they goMY CRITICISMS:AI is better than facing a mouth breathing 10 year old, but could be better still. Its really not bad, and I haven't faced everyone yet, but like the other titles most of the AI have a routine and once you figure it out that opponent is less challenging. But the skirmish maps balance that by creating difficult combinations of circumstances and oppenents. I just finished a skirmish map facing one competent opponent and one incompetent, and they had twice the starting resources as me. It was very challenging at first to get an economy, food production, and defense as they ransacked me and I had to start several times before I found an early approach that worked. But once I did get established, it was just a matter of time until I felt comfortable with the size of the army and siege equipment to finish them off. I realize how difficult it would be to design an AI like this, but some adaptations expressed by the AI late game would make that part more challenging.  Graphics aren't blow-you-away fantastic. I've seen this complaint in other reviews and I won't deny I have more graphically astute games in my collection. But I have always chosen gameplay and an engaging challenge over graphical perfection and for me this title does just fine with the graphics it has. Could they be better? Yes. Do they need to be? No way.More content, although from posts I have seen it sounds like the devs will be actively adding to the game in the future. CONCLUSIONFor me, the pros have far outweighed the cons and I have no regrets with the money & time I have put into this title. I can't wait for a couple friends to get it so we can get medieval on each other's castles.Happy Sieging!			"

												I have really enjoyed the game so far but it does have its limitations.Future Updates Should allow :- The radius of seige camps from enemy players buildings and units to be increased. At the moment on the larger maps, i can pretty much ruin anybodies fun by placing a couple of seige camps and burning down all their buildings, if the distance away from buildings was increased, this could help, or even just a better marker on the map for the seige camps, because they are hard to see at the moment.-Although there is already heaps of units in the game, maybe bring back engineers, tunnelers and laddermen, these were always very useful when trying to get into a castle plus i love killing the laddermen :)- The castle building FPS drop, for some reason there is a massive FPS drop when you try to make walls and towers and this is very noticable further along in a mission, perhaps there is a way to fix this? -Campaign!!! - like the old crusader, there should be a campaign you can play on! those were always fun and maybe a story could be thrown in with cutscenes :) i think this would be fantastic! -Churches should still be able to create monks, because monks were the best when stacked against an army of knights!-fear factor could be brought back, but after playing a fair bit, i realise that it may be useful to newer players or players that may be limited to only a few resources depending on the map and type of game. However having it might be crucial. - a few more voiceovers for the AI, getting sick of the rat telling me how im a ""bumpkin"" every time he attacks.- perhaps a few more ai? i quite enjoyed the old crusader ai's however that isnt as important.What i enjoy most about the game:Well i have owned, stronghold deluxe edition, stronghold crusader, and stronghold crusader extreme.then i bought this,  and i dont understand why people are saying this isnt like the older ones, sure things need to be added, but what game these days is sold and not fully fixed? plus they need our help to fix it.ITS STRONGHOLD FOR GODS SAKE IS FU**ING AWESOME :DYeah so this is pretty much my review, maybe bring back moat digging, oh and before i forgetThe online servers still need to be fixed, once a few players start building the lag becomes unplayable.Thankyou "

You have to be some sort of starigie expert if you think you can beat hells teeth. All in all i belive that this game is fun and chalenging but too chanenging and not fun enough for $50.			"

												This game wasn't really what I expected, the first crusader was awesome but this is just a bit annoying to play really. They removed alot of features and it's awkward movement of the units but it's still an okay game.			"

												Doesn't feel like a $50 game at all. It feels incomplete and outdated and would be better priced at around $20. I don't suggest buying this if you aren't a hardcore fan of the series. I haven't played previous games of this series but I wouldn't be surprised if they were more or less the same with lesser graphics.			"

												Ignore the positive reviews for this game. I have no idea how the developers managed to create a game worse than Stronghold 3. It is simply beyond comprehension. If you're a fan of the first two Stronghold games - DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEIf you're a fan of strategy games - DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEI'm so mad at Firefly Studios right now, I can't even put it into words. Stronghold 1 and Crusader were two truly unique and beautiful strategy games. This however... is an unplayable mess. I'm not even going to call it a game. It's an abomination. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from it.			"

Posted: September 22, 2014
												Okay, now that I've played this game, single player, multiplayer, free build, and everything, I'm gonna write a full review. (And maybe to deter the haters of my last ""review"")---Set back in the 1100's after the Great Crusades, Stronghold Crusader is set in the Arabian middle eastern region for this installment of carnage, mayhem, and humor. There, nobody can hear you scream as a group of other Lords only wish to see your existance end short, and your head on their mantlepiece.Unlike the Stronghold series, Crusader is focused more on fast action combat over castle building and development, as your castle's only purpose is to sustain an economy strong enough to crank out troops faster than those around you, and to protect your Lord from the opposition.- The Campaign is a series of challenging scenarios in skirmish format, where you overcome challenging environments, terrain, and the enemy Lords who use them for their advantage to hamper your ability to obtain victory.- If you wish to have control of the fight, single player skirmish mode gives you a map roster, your opponents, your starting resources, and everything else.- If you aren't feeling combat-ready at the moment, the freebuild just gives you an empty board, unlimited building limits, and control over the random events and your prosperity.- Multiplayer is a no-holds barred slugfest, utilizing Steam Network for multiplayer, seamless and lagless gameplay ensures that every battle is enjoyed from start to finish.This game is supported by Firefly Studios for future bug squashing and feature additions through Steam downloads.---Here is my take on the game so far.The Good:- The graphics are great, smooth and well detailed. You can zoom right into the action and get the feel of the action.- Gameplay is seamless, and encourages fast paced action.- Game is well developed and for the most part, bugs are crushed.- Future updates to look forward to.The Bad:- Economic system feels too much like Stronghold Legends than Crusader.- Doesn't run well on lower end hardware (AMD A-10 APU)- Many elements in Crusader has been excluded in Crusader II- Not as many maps or AI players to choose from compared to Crusader IOverall Verdict:I was a bit disappointed in the map selection for the game. I was hoping that Firefly would remake and re-release old maps under the new engine. Also map size in many maps feels too crowded.I also didn't like the map limit, you're only allowed a certain amount of buildings and troops in a game, and it redestributes as opponents are killed off. The building limit seems unnecessary as in Crusader 1 you could fill your ""Estate"" to the brim with buildings and stuff.Many things aren't included in this that Crusader 1 players might know of, like engineers constructing equipment, moats, tunnelers, and various other quirks.This game uses the unbalanced economic system that Stronghold Legends and beyond is built off of, many things are way too expensive and depend on the market to obtain, especially wood. Woodcutters huts are too large and do not pull in enough wood to satisfy any need in a castle.On the flipside, farms are smaller and you can have more farms per grid square than Crusader 1.  There are a new grade of siege equipment you can use as well as a few new units in the infantry you can utilize.Castle wall construction is seamless and things connect nicely, even bringing back being able to use your barracks as an access to the wallsOverall, despite the things that are missing, and the uncopious limits that do get annoying, the game is worth buying and playing, especially if Firefly Studios releases more content as they did in the old Crusader 1 (Retail OEM had less maps and opponents too, but the special edition had more).

												I never played a stronghold game, but this game is fun!The thing i prefer about this game the most, is you dont have to micro manage your economy (you dont need to control your peasents and tell them to gather wood for example) you just build the required economy building, and the economy will take care of itself.  Leaving you free to micromanage your military as much as you want!thats how military strategy games should be designed!			"

												This is without a doubt the best Stronhold release to date. I have played Stronhold since number one came out on demo disc in my quarterly PC gamer when I was 12. Everything that made me smash my mouse and spit at the screen in Stronghold 3 has been addressed in Crusader 2. Good pace and balance, buildings a good size, easy placement, graphics options, scaled tutorial missions. Most importatnly, the ability to quench my insatiable thirst to buld castles, man the walls, and slaughter dirty desert peasants.My only hope is that the $50 I spent on Stronghold 3 have gone towards making this game as good as it is, and that the $50 I just spent on Crusader 2 go towards a celebration party for a job well done.Edit: Notable improvements: smaller lumberjacks (1 pop requirement), better housing system (max 8 pop with generous placement radius), better happiness scale (less insane micromanaging food-tax-population), square building placement (no more awkward slightly turned buldings ruining my OCD), faster and smoother ox tethers.

												NEED MORE ZOOM OUT!Played the old stronghold and liked it well enough.  Bought this one recently and for me it is a total fail.  The maximum zoom out is so close you can only see a couple buildings at a time.  I do not play games to be frustrated.  I have been googling around to look for a fix and everyone seems to be ""whelp...just the way it is"" not for me!I will not be playing this title untill or unless they fix this, it really is that annoying for me.  I did not buy the newer Company of Heroes after playing the demo for this very reason.TLDR if being unable to zoom out makes you frustrated and claustrophobic give this title a pass.			"

												Stronghold Crusaders 2 continues the popular castle building franchise with improved graphics, several new units, and a wall physics engine.  Unfortunately, that's the end of the list of improvements.  The game doesn't bring many new game mechanics to the table and, in fact, removes many building types and gameplay elements included in previous Stronghold titles.The new units and thier special abilities add a bit more variety to combat and the crumbling walls look very satisfying.  Other than that, this is a dumbed-down Stronghold title that needs the upcoming updates promised by the developers before I would say it is worth the $50 price tag.  That being said, I am enjoying the game and it lives up to the quality (if not the size and complexity) of previous titles in the series.As a fan of the Stronghold series I highly reccomend this game, but would suggest you hold off and enjoy Stronghold 2 or the original Crusaders while you wait for some improvements and/or a price drop.

												To allow those nay-sayers I just want to say.... you were wrong. The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. It is just as awesome as I remember Stronghold 2 was only this is better. Though there are admittedly some bugs and hilariouse voices and even some reused audio clips like the voices for artilliery. However I havent found any game breaking bugs and while I havent played for long, it hasnt crashed. The game is fun regaurdless of funny glitches like at one point were the Slave King's slaves phased through my wall and were thouroughly murdered by my soldiers but hey.... it was pretty funny. The gameplay is what any Stronghold player new and old has grown used to. And the introduction of mercenaries means that even if you are unable to aquire resources that you need for knights and the like, you are still able to control some pretty powerful units that can lead to victory. Now I havent discovered diplomacy which may or may not be in the game, probably because I skipped the optional tutorial and dove headfirst into a custom skirmish. To summerize: the game is fun and if you liked Stronghold 2 of Stronghold Crusader then you will like this. The game has some histerical glitches and audio bugs, but it isnt going to ruin any of the fun you'll have unless your, you know, and stick in the mud and you WANT to hate the game. The difficulty is good, it took me some time to win a match because I skipped the tutorial and hadnt played in a while. Each A.I. opponent has their own tactics as well as strengths and weaknesses which can be exploited. All of the A.I. opponents are given a nice little summery about them in the custom skirmish menu when selecting your opponents and you hover you move over them. The last point I'm going to make is.... TOLD YOU SO! BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												worst game ever. it is not depends on it need 49.99 to get the game or really long time to make the game. It depends on the game looks like uncomplete. The soliders are moving like walking on air, it really make me sick (even the crsader 1 is much better than this piece of *@#)  But the real reason make me quit is the soundtrack is basclly from the old one. I mean if you dont have time or money to make a game, please just go. let the classic keep its beauty. This one totally ruined everything about the game and company.			"

												A very good game, a few bugs could be fixed. It isn't as good as I hyped it to be but a very fun sequel to Crusader. The only complaint I have is how long it takes to get wood stone and food. It also takes way to much wood to build anything at the rate it is produced.			"

												Ok, making a more serious review. After testing the game after the release i have gotten a more inside of what you get in the game. For those that are unsure if they should buy or not, i would say yes you should. The game has a great mechanic which ensures realism, like when you fire a catapult stone on a wall you might knock of archers or other units killing them instantly. It is filled with fun things when creating a custom skirmish like adding random events that may give you bonuses or penalties, depending on your luck. The game is packed with action, strategy and economy. You have to watch everything from ale distribution to how many candles you make. As in previous stronghold games the key concept is always there, build a castle worthy of your people and destroy other lords and their castles. There are some things you might have seen in earlier Stronghold games that is missing in SC 2, like moats but again, you are in the deserts and where shall you get enough water to fill your moats? Some may have said the game is bugged, unstable or lagging. This is of course factors that you find in any game that have just been released, but if you have noticed, a patch was recently released which has removed a lot of the lag. Improved the stability and fixed other bugs that have been there, so you can expect a stable and good game. Now, what about graphics? Many sees graphics as an important part of a game and i can understand that, SC 2's graphics are quite good, i have not tested the highest levels of graphics due to lag but from what i have seen the graphics are quite decent. Of course they could be better but that would inflict on stability and general lag, remember that a strategy game's mechanic is a bit more advanced than a first person game, they have to take in mind of big a game can end up to be, the troop counts for an example, so unless you got a really good and expensive gaming rig you might not manage to run the game on perfect quality without experiencing lag. So, what else to tell about the game? Well, the game is a massive upgrade as a sequel to stronghold crusader 1, you got more units with fun abilities or gameplay, like ordering your archers to fire a volley on the enemy, sending macemen to run over an attacking force creating havoc or maybe send explosive burning wheelbarrow things towards the enemy. There are loads of units to explore and tactics to learn. Is there no cons? Well actually, there is some cons to the game in my opinion, like 3 units i used to love in stronghold crusader is gone. These units are the tunneler, ladderman and siege tower. I do not know why the siege tower or ladderman was removed as they were a core part of the medival strategy to attack castles but i guess the gamemakers have their reason. Other then that, you might think some of the animations of the units are stupid or weird but that is kinda up for the individual to decide. So my conclusion is: This game is worth the money, it is not as expensive as all the other games in it's genre. It is filled with all the fun you could want as a Stronghold fan or a general strategy/castle sim fan. It has interesting combinations of units and tactics making each game a new from the other, especially in the multi player. Fun AI's to battle. A nice setting and decent graphics. + a fantastic soundtrack. I will give the game a 7/10, but if you really want to know how the game is, try it out. See for yourself how the game is, read others reviews and make a decision, i know i don't regret buying it and i recommend it to everyone. I hope you will buy it and enjoy it as much as i am.			"

												I did play the original stronghold crusader long time ago. and i totally loved it. even tho i never played it much. but i just decided to get stronghold crusader 2 while it was on steam sale. because this game is never worth 30+ bucks. so i got it for about 20 bucks. which was fine. and i'm having lots of fun with it.it feels really good to play. and i don't see any problem with units as like the ladderman missing. since it's already easy enough to breach walls. that would make walls totally useless. especially in multiplayer.the only thing that bothers me is the lack of depth in the game. i was hoping for something like having trading routs because of the ship you can see in the preview pictures. or even land- trade rounts would have been cool. making peace with other AI's and trade goods. but i didn't really had many expectations on this game. and if you don't, you'll be happy with it.so if you're expecting alot from this game. i wouldn't get it. but if you think about getting it just for the fun of what the game is. (which is not that much) then you'll be fine.oh and the whirling dervish are totally overpowered. i hope they will fix that. they just whipe out everything you throw at them within 2 seconds. and i'm not even making things up. someone with no armor and spinning in circles like a retard could never take on a full blown knight. but whatever. kind  of ruines the MP, since everyone is running those guys.

												Missing features or bad decisions:- AI is too bad. They only attack in same way whole game.- No forced attack- No moat (Srsly Firefly? No moats?)- Can't pick which kind of lord (arab/european) you play in Sandbox mode or options- No 45 degree rotation for buildings, which was one of the VERY few good things in SH3- You can't determine which goods, and how many, your estates deliver- Bird's-eye view missing (Very important! Especially for building)- All the lists are missing, like the ones showing all your units, where your gold came from etc. etc.- Where is the map maker?- Can't close/open gates on your own- TOWERS DON'T GET DOORS WHEN WALLS ARE ATTACHED TO THEM!! (this really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, as I am a person who cares a lot about such details, which is why I really stressed this point when I made my suggestions list for SHC2 while it was still in development)- There is no restart button- Building limit and unit limit is WAY TOO LOW- When you play with 8 players the unit limit is WAY too low. What am I supposed to do with 140 units? Even after only 3 players were left, I could still just build 333 units, that's not enough to be fun!- Same as above goes for buildings too, the limit is way too low- Couldn't find a strong walls option when playing against NPCs- Walls are TOO WEAK!!! One guy on Metacritic said it feels like they're made of chalk, which is absolutely true. They are in fact so weak that they're pretty much useless, combine that with the missing moats and you can't have any decent defense- Horses die way too easily, which makes knights almost useless. I once sent a large group of knights into an enemy group of archers, and most of them lost their horses before arriving. They need to be a LOT stronger- the marker on the minimap that shows where you currently are is too hard to see, it's very thin and black, should be changed to red or something- When you click on a unit that was sent out to attack someone or something, you can't see what he's going to attack, the marker should come back- Peasants and workers don't talk anymore- I really miss that one feature from SH2 where you could zoom out farther, but couldn't build anything while you did it (the button was an eye in a red circle or something like that). It was nice to be able to see your whole castle in that mode- No torture buildings (or the opposite of them)- Not enough new soundtracks - I don't mind using a few good, old ones, but I've only heard like 1 or 2 new soundtracks as of nowFound in other threads:- No ladder men or siege towers- Only one kind of keepOther Bugs:• Siege camps• Walls aren't deleted properly• Unresponsive units (they don't listen sometimes)• Camera 'jumps' sometimes when moving around the map• Some video options glitch the graphics, lines in middle of screen and such• Ranger animations are messed up - they hold the bow sideways away from them leaving one hand empty...Suggestions:• Fix UI• Add usable gates• Engineers, add them• Remove siege camps• Soldiers walking from camp site to barracks• Replace defensive turrets with old ones• Stronger walls• Nerf range on fire throwers• Nerf arabian archers (their range is insane compared to regular archers)• Up the damage from fire• Voiced peasants• Bring back the videos for buildings (doesn't matter if you rip them directly from Crusader, they look great)• Longer peace time (60 minutes)• Less slashing animations for pikemen (it feels odd)• Remove negative popularity from random events• Remove ALL events when turned off (including winds)• Count build distance with player keeps instead of areas• If areas are kept, increase color opacity• Add numbers on players and their keeps when choosing a map• Target your own units with attack• Round towers• Improve menu UI...The font, oh the font...• Perhaps fix the Rat, he feels way too gentleman like, dumb him down• Fix AI so they can actually defend their castle and attack in a proper way• Increase building and unit size. Remove buildings already present on map to increase this?• More NPCs running around - chickens, drunks, peasants, kids to make the place feel more alive			"

												One of my first games was Stronghold Crusader, and it was perfect like no other strategy, after i bought Stronghold 2 which is an AMAZING game, with nice characters, nice campaign and nice graphics and the game was really perfect, so when SH3 came out I thought that it would be a nice runner-up after SC2, but when I saw THQ I didn't beleive it would be good, but i bought it, and I was right it was the worst game ever! Today I saw much videos about Stronghold Crusader 2, and it was preaty nice to see a good product, but when I started to play it its was SOOOO BAAAAD, i could see how archers on towers were dying more than those who were on bottom and saw the same icons and the same voices like in SC3 and even buildings didnt change from SC3. So the summary: Gameplay 2/10(So bad), New stuff 3/10(yes and its so amazing too see second series with less buildings than in first one), Music 8/10 (The SC1 music mostly), Economy 6/10 (its much more interesting that you cannot make too much gold, but it could be fun too, so its better as it was in SC1)PS.

												Nice game. However it gets quite frustrating to build up again and again everytime you start a new campaign.Most certainly not as nice as AOE2.. but still worth trying out for crusade era lovers.You definately need to send your archers near enemy towns as soon as you start game, so that you can slow them down otherwise they might get too strong for you!Plenty of fun.

												Firefly has finally done what was asked of them - they transitioned Stronghold Crusader into 3D. The game literally feels like they patched the original to be in 3D. In addition all the new features really do bring as well more to the same experience - you can have your traditional horse archer setup but you can also throw in the new units and abilities to let you truly take over the battlefield - Because unlike most sequels it has not made your traditional strategies obsolete.The graphics are in the same art style as the original game and flow quite well, I do not have a very strong system but it does run like butter on it - it may not be the most intense graphically, but it is very pleasing to the eye. As well the campaigns are varied and interesting - there are a series of tutorials as well as 'learning campaigns' that let you learn the ropes of the existing and new features.And then there is the trail - they have come back with a vengeance - you'll be spending a lot of time trying to get through them because of one reason. The AI. The features of the original return, skirmishes, AI in multiplayer and all that. I've played one match and I was soundly defeated - the AI knows how to utilise all the units and their strategies perfectly - but not so much that they appear to cheat.If you're a fan of the original, this is more of the same - but better. I would fully recommend it.			"

												This game has alot of problems... none of which the developer has any intention to fix. The localisation is broken in a way that all of the text in the menus look like SQL statements for the games database. also all of the voices are absent and all of the cinematics. there is also a lie on the storefront page, Cloud saves. There are no cloud saves so if you switch alot between games or game on multiple systems you're out of luck. These problems have been brought to the attention of the dev, but they were to bussy rolling in our cash and defecating on our faces with all of the anti consumer poop you can think of to take notice of any form of problems. well Firefly studios, thank you very much for this non usable piece of trash.

												This game is not what anyone would call a 'solid purchase'. It is by no means unplayable - the game itself is very playable. It just under-delivers on everything that it does manage to bring to the table, and I mean everything. Just starting with the basics, menu set-up and game customization: UI:The user interface is somewhat standard faire - bottom menu bar, mini map, pop-up tooltips. But even these are lacking. The minimap provides little detailed useful information and is a general blotchy mess - there are no 'pings' to deliver location information for any contextual information provided, the representation of units and buildings on it is pixellated like you wouldn't believe, and for the size of the screen that it covers is basically an eyesore in the corner of the screen. Not that this is any different from the rest of the UI - the main displays for buildings and unit types are incredibly bland, the artwork is horribly un-inspired, and the tooltips provide very little actual information as to what capabilities anything brings to you. You cannot re-bind bind keys. You do not get a running list of resources that are available to you; you must hover over either a building in the action bar to view buildable resources available, or hover over your food/ale/perishable resources in the top right bar (because this couldn't all be done on one bar?) to see what you have left. Even with your perishable items, the game does not calculate total usage/production over time - only immediate production with immediate usage, so you have a harder time trying to figure out the optimal number of any production buildings you'll need to use.Graphics:Anyone that doesn't believe that graphics don't provide for gameplay is fooling themselves. The graphics need to match the setting, and this is something that Stronghold Crusader 2i is also lacking in. Playing the game on its highest settings, you will legitimately feel like your machine was transported ten years in the past. There is no reason for any game being released to look as poorly as this one does, it even performs poorly - there is no unit collision in a $50 game released in 2014? Regardless of how hard either of these things are to implement, you're charging full price for a game that does not deliver full-price accomodations in anything, and the extremely, extremely dated graphical and physics engine showcase that like nothing else in this game. Sound:Aside from the lackluster voice acting, the actual scripts that the units and characters use in the game is chuckle-inducing at best and absolutely, ear-gratingly, cringeworthy at worst. This begins with the very first playthrough of the game - while the initial tutorial Scribe voiceover is not bad, every other aspect of what the game uses for units and sounds is. Wall crumbling? Sounds like build-a-blocks falling with a microphone placed next to them. Battle? *clang clang*. The music is absolutely stereotypical for both the time period and the game, which would not be bad, if the music weren't so low-quality, and if the music didn't randomly stop playing at times leaving your ears to drown in the abyss that are the original soundbytes of the few other things happening around you.Gameplay:The gameplay itself is one of the only saving graces of this game, and that being said, its a literal re-cycle of the last Stronghold Crusader. Even so, that gameplay has its merits, and when the sieges get going, there are some enjoyable moments. Besieging Castles, when the lackluster gameplay and units come together like they were originally intended, becomes fun, well-paced, and engaging. The problem is, that this does not happen often. The game itself is buggy, unit animations are terrible, and the control scheme is just as bad. All in all, this is an extremely disappointing outing for what was a very promising line of games, Stronghold 3 not included. 5.5/10. I would not recommend this game to anyone, not even with a sale, as there is just better out there to be had right now. While the gameplay remains a constant throughout the playable games in the series, the latest iteration is not a step in any direction but sideways for the franchise, and for the cost, you're better off going with a less buggy, more complete version of the original in HD.

												Well it was a tough decision to recommend or not to recommend this game I have admit that first. For casual stronghold fans it will certainly provide a level of satisfaction. So good things first. I didn't come across that many bugs. Some graphical and physical artifacts happens here and there but not everywhere and game was stuck once in between loading missions but again no serious bugs. It is not easy on you and you need to come up with a few long term and short term tactical plans to achieve anything. Still a bit idiot proof compared to stronghold 1. Less resource dependencies which is a good and a bad thing.  A few extra units and unit abilities spice things up. That being sad some units are missing as well. Economy and military balance is all right. User interface was not a buzz killer for me usability wise. Easy to adept. However it really takes a while to get used to extremely primitive graphics and artwork. I am not even sure if they really hired any full time artists at all to work on it. Graphics are 3d but looks so beginner level almost like a school project made it's way to the market. There are good things here are and there which seems like bought online from 3d model sites and placed in a worst composition by developers with other unrelated stuff. The desert theme everywhere is so boring after a while. Landscapes are low in detail and looks very plain. You don't have any other option than playing in the bare desert. No signs of a decent story or a flow. Indicators and reports are barely understandable. So I feel a bit ripped of cause this game definitely needs more than patches and updates. It needs a complete overhauling. And to be honest I wasn't really expecting that much. My expectation was to have stronghold 1 experience with modernized graphics but other than being not 3d stronghold 1 was a much better game on every aspect. "

												I had high expectations going into this game. I've only played it for a short amount of time, but I have to say it doesn't feel like its much of an improvement from even stronghold 2. Infact, I would say I enjoyed Stronghold 2 more than what I enjoy the Crusader installment. They have put back a lot of features which Stronghold 3 failed to include such as skrimish mode, which is a big plus. However, for me the desert setting which is in the crusader games, doesnt have the same feel as the original stronghold games and for that reason I found myself pulling the negatives from the game. The interface is a step backwards in my opinion and the fun part of building your castle is almost non-existent because you get attacked almost immediately from startup (this is remedied with a ""peace"" time which is available on skirmish mode). I fear this may be another stronghold game that is added to my library of steam games, mever to be played again.			"

												A horrible waste of money. It has all of the bad elements of the previous stronghold failures and very little of the things you liked about the original Crusader. There is much that is missing , but I guess the lack of a usable UI is the worst part that you need to know before spending your money. You only have one look down view, you cannot spin the map and you can only zoom out a little while still giving you only a small view of whats going on. Its like looking thru a tube down onto your castle.			"

												This game is broken to the point that it can't be fixed. I've played one game so far with a friend and I just couldn't enjoy it, even though I tried so hard. First this that I noticed before even starting the game I couldn't find a control list, so no rebindable keys.Some of the units move like they're robots especially the rangers.The soundeffects are dull to say the least, a landing trebucet stone gives to sone of someone dropping a little rock from 1 meter high.The game prommises to be a fast paced game just like the original, but wth the over the top building costs and slow gathering of goods the game quickly grinds to a halt.A lack of different camara option like the top-down build view is irritating to say the least (They could have added it but in that case I couldn't find it because there is no list of controls anywhere).The original had more content in some area's like the possibilty to build gardens and maypoles or torture machinery.But it does have more units in comparison to the original. It's also quite nice the see that some units have a special ability, yet they prommise every unit has a special abbility and this maybe true, but I couldn't find it with the archers and swordman.And then there is the biggest flaw, the graphics.I plaued the game on the highest settings and still was disapionted, the game just doesn't look good, it look allright but not like a game from 2014 should look like. The game I played was on a mountainy map, on which they tried to make some dust being moved by the wind, this was the biggest fault the could have made, it looks terrible the glitches though everything and looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ There is practically no ballencing in the game, They said they wanted to spend extra time on that, but certain units are just flat out OP.I was really hyped to the point where I actually pre-purchad the special eddition, biggest mistake in my live, this game isn't finnished and should have never been released in this state.Try avouding this game until it gets a has been updated to a resenable standart.P.S.Sorry for my enlish, it's not may first language			"

												This review is from someone who wanted Crusader 2 to be really similar to Crusader 1.Let's start at the beginning. The intro...The intro looks like it's from 2006 or 2005 or even older. The animations are choppy and you don't even get the purpose of it. At least I did not.You can give your email to get another 10 icons... yeah, I mean shield icons. Such an amateur way to get subscribers to their newsletters and stuff. (You can uncheck those though) But you still get into their system.In the mainmenu, the announcer starts with ""Welcome to Stronhold Crusader 2 my liege."". O K.The menu is just nothing like Stronghold Crusader 1's. It looks amateur, simple and hell, there are not much of skirmishes. The menu itself is just, I don't know, confusing? I don't know why they chose the drag and drop team arranging, but it sucks. When you select a map in the menu, there is a slight delay which is irritating. I guess it is because of loading the minimap of the map, but whatever.The voice acting is... well... you better check it out yourself. The peasants has no voice, nor image like we used to in Crusader 1. (Nor does the workers by the way)The fact that they changed Lionheart's character, makes me sad. He used to be my favorite character in the game, but now... they ruined him. They changed his voice too.Also, the announcer keeps telling you what is happening, if an enemy is attacking, you are going to be noticed. I also found hard to see what's going on on the battlefield as there are 3-4 players fighting, and you just can't distinguish the units' colors.The UI is horrible, nothing like Crusader 1's, you just search for things mid-game, but that is not a problem, because the game itself is so slow in pace, that you can go out and cook some meal while you are waiting for resources. Building your castle became horrible, you can no longer twist the stairs, nor you can get your men at the wall through the gatehouse. Which seems more realistic of course... but eh.Estates... yeah well. I captured an estate on one of the maps in custom skirmish, but no one gave a ♥♥♥♥ about it. From the estates, oxes(I guess) deliver resources to your main state, and yeah, guess what. They are slow.(I have rechecked and found that you can click on the minimap and it goes there, but only if you don't move your cursor, not even accidentally.) If you thought at least you can click on the minimap to move the camera there, you are going to have a bad time. You can only drag the camera with the minimap which is what the f. I was very surprised, so you got to scroll around.There are dashes indicating the end of the map, which you can't hide, or at least I did not find a way to do it so. Bugged the hell out of me.No collision detection! HURRAY! Although this can ease the gameplay, and makes the battles easier, it would be still nice in 2014.So the main reason I played only 30 mins after paying 35€ is that I can't stand the pace of the game, the stronghold 2 like graphics and the whole UI design it is just horrible. Don't judge by the videos they put on the store page. Check a real gameplay on youtube or something.Don't buy it until you are sure that you want this. Waste of money in my opinion. Thanks Firefly for ruining the Stronghold Crusader series.			"

												When I was 10~ I used to play the first stronghold crusader. I enjoyed playing sandbox, map editor, as well as some easy peesy skirmishing. It was a very peaceful game where you could decorate the castle and have a wonderful time. I had multiple copies to play with my family and friends.This game is absolutely a worthy successor to the first.The feel, music, and sounds are all there, but with an impressive addition of far better graphics, new units, and different enemies to face. But to compare to the old one, the resource grabbing system, map editor, sandbox, and 8 player multiplayer features are still there, as well as new defense features. Multiplayer is solid, with the ability to save your game and continue later.Some detriments that I sort of feel dissapointed about are the ranged units ranges, they seem rather long for the map sizes to be so small in comparison. Granted, the map sizes is about the same as the first crusader, it's a big map, but for small maps ranged units could literally snipe resource points from your own base.The game was just released a few days ago, and there have been no crashes or game breaking glitches I have run into.

												This is kind of fun but tbh not even worth $5 for me. Building is fun but combat is a complete mess. Can't tell where soldiers are, they clump together, very difficult to click/coordinate. Can tell the developers didn't really care to spend time fixing combat. So uninstall.			"

												The UI of the game is highly inconvenient. The game is not balanced at all! The level of the graphics is incredibly poor. This game does not worth the money. Comparing to any Blizzard product this one is a pathetic attempt to make a good strategy game. I am really surprised that the developer even dare to charge so much for this kind of low quality product!			"

												It is ok but not great.Here is what i dont like:1 Pathetic tiny maps, and i mean tiny, they are really really small with no options to expand your city and grow the map is just way to small, this kills the game for me.2 The graphics are somewhat facebookm not very good. It reminds me of settlers6 graphics but on a smaller scale and alot less detail and animations.3 Buildings, not alot there i am afraid, they could have pulled half of them to sell as dlc im not sure but you can build it all in minutes.

												This game is horrible. The ""economy"" is so simple it's pathetic: build something, then everything else is done automatically, you're done with it for the rest of the game.Combat is atrocious. Only thing you can do is right click: right click to move, right click to attack. Beyond a 5 minutes ""tutorial"", the game doesn't teach you how to play. There are no tooltips, no stats: how do I know (if I'm ignorant and/or new to medieval RTS) the difference between a pikeman and a swordsman ? I don't.Let's talk about the graphics now... Well, PC games had better graphics in 1998. And let's not talk about the UI. Or the intro cinematic. Remember Warcraft 2 intro cinematic ? You've got an idea of what I'm talking about. Oh and the maps... well, they look like a 10 years old kid made them in about 15 minutes each: most of them are squares within squares on a squared map. If you love symmetry, you'll love them. Nothing more to say, except it's pathetic.As if it wasn't enough, the game is also full of bugs. I only played a couple of hours and already found a few:- I once build a building on a place where cactii were growing. When you place the building, the cactii do not get razed, and they block the way, preventing my peasants to reach their working place.- Walls. This game is about building strongholds and castles right ? Better be careful then because if you make a mistake, good luck fixing it. About half the walls I placed couldn't be erased. You just can't target them...- Game was running somewhat smoothly (thank god, I got a beast computer) until I set some buildings on fire. It might be the cause, or it might be a coincidence, but the framerate dropped to about 2 fps from this point on. After about 5 minutes of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I gave up.tl;dr : this game is so bad it made my wallet bleed. Oh wait it's already bleeding from the 35€ r@pe... Don't buy it.			"

Posted: September 22, 2014
												Abstract: Do not buy this game. Stronghold Crusader is still better at a cheaper price.Being a big fan of the original Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader, I was very much looking forward to a sequel to one of my favorite games. I was hoping for a more streamined game from it's predecessors (Stronghold Legends, II, and III) that would bring back the well-paced and simple fun of the original (not that silly extreme game). I will admit I did worry some when I noticed one of the devs had a Stronghold II (or III) box in his office, but my hopes for this game were high. My heightened hopes were a result of incresingly better games by Firefly being produced since the abysmal hole of  a game that Stronghold Legends was, a game so bad it melted out of computer and through my floor into the basement. Sadly,  for Stronghold Crusader II the developers seemed to have decided that realism was much more important than convenience, and have made a pretty, slow, and clunky tactical game. I decided to make an 8-way on the 'Insanity' map (a practice I commonly did in the original), but got so bored of the game that by the time you see I've played I honestly wished that I was playing the other Crusader instead. The graphics are nice (at least compared to, say, Stronghold Crusader I), that is, until my intersected walls have turned into a honeycomb of chest-high fortifications. However, the camera is worse than it was in Stronghold III, as it has a slight lag to it and it is still obnoxious to look around objects. What was so bad about the option to flatten tall objects in the original that they don't want to include it in later games? Again, it seems convenience was cut out for more of the realistic history lesson. Because an ugly Englishman punching a Sultan in the face could have actually happened.Perhaps the most annoying issue that occurred was about my farming operation. Back in Stronghold Crusader, and even in Stronghold III, I could use two wheat farms to support a rather decent population (as long as they had proper support from the local bakers and mill-children). Here, I kept running out of food because my three farms were insufficient for my 16 peasants. Turns out, my mill had no access to the stockpile, despite being purposefully built right next to it. In case you ask, no, I was indeed smart enough to leave access to the entrance to the mill, but the game hadn't realized the fact!I don't recall ever asking myself when playing Stronghold I: ""Gee, I wish I could have to align ever building properly before it could be used instead of just plonking it down and getting on with my life."" I suppose it does allow for creative detail, but it seems so useless in comparison when I could focus less on perfecting my building alignments and more on insuring my strong economy and bashing some knights in. I understand that when making a 3-d game, it is necessary to make exact entrances to your buildings, but perhaps you give single buildings a little breathing room or four-way accessibility instead? Still, it is easier than it was in Stronghold II, so this is just nitpicking.The focus on realistic castle-building causes the pace of the game to slow to a creep, the intermittent lag makes enjoying your work obnoxious, and even it's new and improved designs fall flat and are prone to bugging out. Now, I think I'm going to go play some of the original instead. Thank you Firefly Studios, for finally destroying any hope I had left of you producing anything better than your original works.			"

After extending the development this long the game is still full of bugsIm a huge fan of the stronghold series but if there is a lesson to be had in all this it is to wait and see on firefly products.

												I had this awful realization as I got into Stronghold Crusader 2: I hated the desert.That's some seriously bad news for a game whose main feature is the fact that it's an RTS that plays out across entire deserts, on small ""Kingdom of Heavearn""-style maps where your stompy swordsmen, plodding archers, speedy horses, catapults, and even sling thrower units have scarcely vanished over one horizon before they come swarming over the other. ""How much,"" I asked, ""do I have to pay for a version with normal 2D maps?""But then you start zooming out, and begin to realize that while you're able to see more territory, the curvature of these tiny castles means that you can still only see a fraction of the playing surface before you have to spin the camera to another position over the desert. It's a fog-of-war you can never dispel; even when you have intel coverage of an entire desert, your situational awareness is severely reduced.Those big problems would be enough to make Stronghold Crusader 2 a flawed-but-fun experiment. What sinks it, tragically, is the lack of care and attention shown to the details and player aids. For starters, there’s little in-game help, and what's there is worse than nothing. I launched the tutorial to see what I was missing, and was treated to a low-res YouTube video that seemed more like a pitch for Stronghold Crusader 2 than a guide to playing it. Note to developers: Googling unofficial Stronghold Crusader 2 wikis to learn the basics of your game’s controls is not an appropriate substitute for a manual, and promo videos explaining the rudiments of RTS games are not substitutes for a tutorial.To Stronghold Crusader 2's credit, the ""picture-in-picture"" option makes it easier to juggle two things at once, and does a great job of giving multi-monitor advantages to single-monitor users. On the other hand, it's not as good as actual multi-monitor support, a feature that’s desperately needed but does not seem to be supported. In fact, I think my preferred setup for play would be one of those banks of security camera monitors - maybe then I could see all the angles I need to..Even more unforgivable is the lack of a save option, either in single-player skirmish or in multiplayer. (There’s no single-player campaign.) This is a big game and, like a lot of its predecessors, things can drag on for more than an hour as up to eight sides bash away at each other. Yet Stronghold Crusader 2 gives you no option to save your skirmish or multiplayer game to pick it up later. That's a shocking oversight, as is the fact that you must be online to play even a single-player skirmish.On the other hand, it's in keeping with a general ""half-baked"" quality that pervades Stronghold Crusader 2. There's no faction design, just different skins for the all-important Crusader units who lead identical armies of swordsmen and archers. Maybe faction design matters slightly less in this style of RTS, where mass production and weight of numbers carries the day over individual unit tactics, but the lack of variety is still disappointing.Even the good ideas end up going to waste. Stronghold Crusader 2 has a promising ""Crusade Trail"" mode in which you lead your faction from keep to keep, headhunting other crusaders, unlocking new siege equipments, and conquering territory. Trouble is, it's paper-thin and once again badly executed.The ""strategic"" layer is no such thing. Your choice of where to go and who to fight is entirely meaningless. It is effectively solitaire. Second, you only have access to a fraction of the siege equipment tree. You have to expand your options by exploring the galaxy as your conquer it, and choosing which siege equipments to keep and which to permanently discard.That's a nifty idea, except that it's so restrictive as to be annoying after a little while. For instance, in one mission I ended up stuck on two deserts, but I was siege equipment-locked out of the sling thrower combat units I needed to clear the space above my AI adversary's final stronghold. My unarmed transports were swarmed by his sling thrower interceptors every time, and I could never establish a foothold. So I had no choice but to build a barrage of 14 trebuchet cow launchers and just spam the desert until, by blind luck, I nailed his Crusader. It was a 100-minute match, and 40 minutes of that was just waiting for archers to finish. I guess I could have built giant siege engines to smash one siege tower into another, but only on certain maps that have mineable quarries – and that would’ve taken even longer. Besides, I don't think I had that siege equipment, either.Sadly, that was one of the better solo games in Crusade Trail. The AI doesn't seem to know what to make of the limited build options, and rarely put up a fight. Too often, I'd find the enemy Crusader just running around the wilderness, waiting to get mugged. In a skirmish, the AI held its own, but the Crusade Trail adversary seemed to have trouble building a factory. It's just no fun playing such an opponent, so what could have been a gentle, easy way to learn to play turns into a slog from one arabian keep to another.But the biggest problem with Stronghold Crusader 2 is that it's nowhere near as good as the games its consciously aping. Stronghold Crusader, made all the way back in 2002, is still better than this game. Either of the Extreme Crusader games (and especially Extreme Crusader: Forged Alliance) leaves Stronghold Crusader 2 in the dust, and they're a whole lot cheaper. There is simply no reason to play this game when those others are still better in every respect.In all, It's okay.8.5/10			"

A much needed decent 'Stronghold' gameTo start off, I am a fan of the series. I played 'Stronghold' and 'Stronghold: Crusader' (and a bit of Stronghold 2) quite a few years ago and have rediscovered them again on Steam recently. While the two classics have been made compatible with newer hardware and are still fun to play (and are a no brainer if you find them on sale), you cant help but think they could do with a complete remake. I think this is the closest we will get for now...When I first saw this game, I practically ignored it. Having experienced 'Stronghold 2' and 'Stronghold Legends' in the past, I knew the series wasnt in the best place. I also read/watched reviews of 'Stronghold 3' when it came out and decided it wasnt worth getting. This game being in the Steam sale caught my interest, and I decided to research it a little. I then decided it looked alright and went ahead with the purchase. Having bought this and played several hours, I have already decided it was definatly worth it!The gameplay, unlike the other sequels, resembles the original two games, in my opinion. Although it may be basic in some areas, it is still enjoyable and i find is well balanced between the economy and combat aspects (you need to work efficiently on both to win). The graphics, while not too impressive by todays standards, look nice, and again, resemble the original 'Crusader' in some ways. The sound effects and voice acting can get a bit repetitive and annoying, but im sure these can be turned down/off in the options. Although the game comes with several Campaign trails, I only played a couple, and then went straight into custom games, so I can't comment on them. There are plenty of maps to choose from, depending on the amount of opponents. There also seem to be lots of community maps too (which is a strong point of the original 'Stronghold'). The AI can present a real challenge in certain games and situations, but also can be too easy at lower difficulties, but I guess you can tailor the game to how difficult you want it.Overall, I am enjoying this game from my first few hours, and it has restored a bit of confidence in the series for me. Hopefully, the amount of community maps will continue to grow, and I will continue to enjoy the game. Its not 100% perfect, but if you are a fan of the original two games, I would say this is at least worth looking in to.			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 (SHC2) is a classic base builder/RTS. The only difference between it and similar titles like Starcraft or Dawn of War is SHC2's emphasis on economic and defensive buildings, as well as unit production. In stead of simply mining for your bread, SHC2 has you grow the wheat with one building, turn the wheat into flour with another, and then has yet another building which turns your flour into bread. This is pretty much the most decisively different feature that sets SHC2 apart from other similar RTS titles. Other than that, the game is all about right-click attacking with your troops. Look up some game play on youtube. Literally, what you see is what you get. Pros:-Bread-Medieval themed Starcraft -Horse Archers-Interesting scenario-based missions-Balanced gameplayCons:-Breeeeaaaaaddddd-Prone to crashing-Too many Horse Archers-Small number of interesting scenario-based missions-Few building/unit options and no customizationRating: 8/10 Don't hesitate to get this game if you like similar RTS titles. I took one point off because the game loves to crash and set you back by two hours of game time, and I took the other point off because there are very few strategies or options when creating your economy and military - there are no unit or building upgrades, so your armies can get stale and uniform after a while. Otherwise, very fun title.			"

												I have been following Firefly Studios for the entire stronghold series and i have always been  a big fan of the original stronghold crusaders. While the game itself is pretty good, it much like all the games in the series that follow its predecessor lacks much of the soul of the game that leaves it underwhelming in comparison. While I still recommend this game, I would suggest maybe waiting for a good sale.			"

												After hearing painful reviews of Stronghold 3 I decided against purchasing it...I then saw this game on the Steam Homepage and got overly excited. As a kid I played many RTS games and there have not been very many that seem to grab my attention now. After playing the game it met every expectation I had. I wanted something more in-depth with castle building and walls. For the fact that you can actually place troops on top the your walls was amazing, as most of the games I had played just used walls as... well walls. The game also takes a fair amount of time to win each battle, there are times where you can rush in and destroy their base in a matter of seconds but I enjoy the difficulty in destroying others. If you are looking for an in-depth Castle Building RTS this is the game for you! The only downside like every other game is DLC that is 1) over priced 2) should of been included in the base game. I will still buy it because it expands my gaming experience with-in the game, but it would be nice to get some free DLC here and there.			"

												I waited for this game with great anticipation, buying it the day it was released. I have to admit, I am happy and disappointed with the game, happy in that there is a Stronghold Crusader 2 and disappointed that i was expecting so much more from the previous incarnation. Dont get me wrong, the devs have done some interesting things here, but all the fun of the original is not here for me. The basics of the game are similar, but the graphics seem to have taken a step backwards, along  with some of the flexibility of the original (making walls disappear so you could see behind them etc). At launch things were very stuttery and it took two patches to make it playable. Now, a few months into launch, it is fun, but it really feels like they havent taken a step forward from the old game.I am enjoying it, but only as much as Crusader  1 .... with a few more fustrations.I am recommending this game, but with caveats .... dont expect a jump forward from the old game and dont expect the graphics to match todays expectations.

												I waited for this game with great anticipation, buying it the day it was released. I have to admit, I am happy and disappointed with the game, happy in that there is a Stronghold Crusader 2 and disappointed that i was expecting so much more from the previous incarnation. Dont get me wrong, the devs have done some interesting things here, but all the fun of the original is not here for me. The basics of the game are similar, but the graphics seem to have taken a step backwards, along  with some of the flexibility of the original (making walls disappear so you could see behind them etc). At launch things were very stuttery and it took two patches to make it playable. Now, a few months into launch, it is fun, but it really feels like they havent taken a step forward from the old game.I am enjoying it, but only as much as Crusader  1 .... with a few more fustrations.I am recommending this game, but with caveats .... dont expect a jump forward from the old game and dont expect the graphics to match todays expectations.

												First off, played many more hours than posted. For some reason they weren't recorded. To the review...After loving stronghold crusader and stronghold crusader extreme I was extremely excited to pick this game up. However this game didn't completely meet expectations. If you are a past stronghold crusader player (as I am), this game feels more like an expansion than a completely new game. That being said, it was more maps with new enemies and a few new units so I'm quite happy I bought it.If you are a new player, I would recommend this game if it comes on sale, else just pick up a copy of stronghold crusader!

												Very awesome game in spite of what the haters say. Could use a bit more story line and I feel like the taunts from the old games were better but this game, when compared to the bad examples that were made after Crusader, brings back a good challenge for those who have the savvy to play strategy. I really cannot account for the haters unless they actually are players raging because they cannot understand how to play.			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 (SHC2) is a classic base builder/RTS. The only difference between it and similar titles like Starcraft or Dawn of War is SHC2's emphasis on economic and defensive buildings, as well as unit production. In stead of simply mining for your bread, SHC2 has you grow the wheat with one building, turn the wheat into flour with another, and then has yet another building which turns your flour into bread. This is pretty much the most decisively different feature that sets SHC2 apart from other similar RTS titles. Other than that, the game is all about right-click attacking with your troops. Look up some game play on youtube. Literally, what you see is what you get. Pros:-Bread-Medieval themed Starcraft -Horse Archers-Interesting scenario-based missions-Balanced gameplayCons:-Breeeeaaaaaddddd-Prone to crashing-Too many Horse Archers-Small number of interesting scenario-based missions-Few building/unit options and no customizationRating: 8/10 Don't hesitate to get this game if you like similar RTS titles. I took one point off because the game loves to crash and set you back by two hours of game time, and I took the other point off because there are very few strategies or options when creating your economy and military - there are no unit or building upgrades, so your armies can get stale and uniform after a while. Otherwise, very fun title.			"

												I have been following Firefly Studios for the entire stronghold series and i have always been  a big fan of the original stronghold crusaders. While the game itself is pretty good, it much like all the games in the series that follow its predecessor lacks much of the soul of the game that leaves it underwhelming in comparison. While I still recommend this game, I would suggest maybe waiting for a good sale.			"

												My first PC game was Stronghold Crusader back when I was in high school. I remembered how I used to sit in front of the PC the whole day just playing all the skirmish mission. Since then, I became a huge fan of the Stronghold series, I played everything from Stronghold 1, 2, 3, and even Stronghold Legends.When I heard about Stronghold Crusader 2 I was jumping for joy. I did not hesitate to buy it. There were plenty of improvements, in terms of graphics, animation (love the physics effects of building falling when it's hit by catapult), and new army as well. What even best about this game is that the developers keep releasing updates and DLC for it, they kept the game updated.In short, Stronghold Crusader 2 bought the childhood in me to come alive. Good job, Firefly Studios!			"

												First of all I love the stronghold series. Well, the first two games, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader. Ever since then it's been one terrible game after another. First of all this game can be fun. But it's lacking the depth that made the originals so fun. None of your decisions feel relevant; it doesn't matter what you produce only that you outproduce the enemy. From a technical standpoint this game would have been reasonable if it was released in 2005 but not as good as say, Age of Empires III. That's right. It requires a new gaming machine with graphics that look 10 years old. I wouldn't even recommend paying the sale price of $10 but maybe I would spend a buck on it. Then again I don't really want it screwing up my collection which is full of great games. Fun could be had but why bother when the originals still play great, look great, and are just plain classics. Get the original, you'll see what it was all about.			"

												Stronghold Crusader was an old classic - still played today and is available on Steam. Stronghold Crusader 2 was to be its return, ideally with the lessons of Stronghold 3's launch problems learned. So, how does it stack up?Well, it lacks some of the original depth. Compared to other Stronghold games, Crusader 2 is extremely focused on the military aspects of things. In a way, I would consider it like Legends: a game that was focused on the combat aspects of the series rather than the castle building. Given that, I would say that it did the job reasonably well.Whereas prior Stronghold games would ease you into the action, Stronghold Crusader 2 gets you in immediately. You have a dedicated tutorial and a tutorial campaign, but those are no more than the first two or three missions in the other games. After that, the campaigns themselves thrust you right into the thick of it, giving you most of the arsenal quickly. It has to: there's only a few single player campaign missions, and they're not the most complexly designed.The real meat of the game is the Skirmish mode and trail, which was also Crusader's main focus. Given this, it's sensible that they focused a lot of their efforts on it as that was what people played the most. And it's certainly fun - you'll be pulling your teeth out at points, but that's true for the old games as well. It gives a full gamut of challenge - from simple walkovers with guys like The Rat (as always) up to brutal fights of attrition with top grade AI like The Wolf (who, true to form, throws the latrine at you once the game is underway).Although there is a challenge, unfortunately much of it comes from just flinging stuff at you. The AI in stronghold was never smart - it finds paths it likes and keeps hammering those points until it breaks or they run out of steam and have to try again. So if you can figure out the AI's general pattern - something most players have done if they've followed the series so far - you can actually fairly easily pin it down and destroy it.So, your real challenge will likely come from multiplayer. I never touched it myself - I always liked Stronghold for the castle building and the like - but at least there you'll be up against the same tactics you use to send the AI home. That's not to say that singleplayer has no value - it will put you in challenging situations, but it will be more of the being located in a difficult position rather than clever troop movement by the AI.Presentation wise, the music is solid as ever with plenty of good work from Robert Euvino. The graphics are solid, though I find I usually had to lower them due to my laptop. The background art is also a nice touch; while it's not Richard or Saladin kneeling in prayer as a CGI cinematic as we had in Crusader, it conveys a different kind of mood - and that's fine, Crusader 2 is of a different tone than the original.If you're looking for a plot, there isn't one. The campaigns have a little story, but it's generic and the singleplayer campaigns are more ways of getting your feet in the sand than anything. The AI character personalities were sadly lacking the charisma of the original game. In some cases it they managed to recapture the original, such as with The Caliph. But other fells flat, such as The Rat or some of the new entrants like The Slave King . Most European units reuse the old VAs, but the new unit voice actors are definitely living up to the originals, with some just flat out gnawing on the scenery, such as the Sergeant-at-Arms. Which works, since that was part of what gave Stronghold its original charm: it was happy to gnaw on the scenery and chew it up to add some flavor, without quite going so far that it can't be taken seriously.But with the AI characters... for the most part it did not translate. Saladin, the Calpih, and the Shah (replacing SC's Sultan) came over quite well, and Richard did as well though he did lose some of the charisma. Others... didn't really work well. The Rat has the same VA as your grunt Men-at-Arms, and worse, in the Princess & The Pig DLC, the Pig got the same VA, which really did not work at all for him. And from Firefly it's surprising considering that by now they should know that people have a lot of nostalgia; I expected a bit more from bringing back The Pig of all people.Though, the AI characters do at least play to the original style. Richard spams lots of heavy armor and is an offensive character, Saladin's castles are still pains to get through, and the Pig was actually perfectly replicated with adjustments for different build requirements. They may have a similar end result, but each character brings something different to the party.Although non-worker peasants no longer walk around your castle, the buildings still have details like rugs or work tools. And no longer is everyone using the same art style that had led to odd situations like Saladin putting up churches with Christian symbols on them. Instead, the game has two different styles of building (primarily applied to your castle fortifications), one for the Europeans, and one for the Arabians, as well as a few reskins and renames (IE, the Arabic factions use Sheep Farms instead of Pig Farms) to fit them thematically.As to the new content in the game that lacks a counterpart in the original: Special Abilities also added a very nice touch and all the abilities were perfectly reasonable. They did not get in the way and were for the most part useful - Pikemen can actually be the traditional anti-cavalry charge unit now, Macemen as your shock troops live up to it more, and the new Whirling Dervish adds a nice counter to lots of cannon fodder units besides properly set up pitch ditches. The weather I found to be more annoying than anything, but as far as adding more of a challenge to the game they work great.Overall, I found that Stronghold Crusader 2 is a solid game if you like macro gameplay - general logistical and economic strength feeding into the tactical battles rather than micromanaging every unit. You will be winning or losing based on the health of your castle's economy, and your ability to replace, reinforce, and produce armies. An army marches on its stomach, after all. And being able to build up strong armies is definitely one aspect of the games they brought back in full force.However, while the battles are definitely of Stronghold flavor, a lot of the rest of the game is missing what made the original games so good. The little touches - children and their mothers loitering around the castle, peasants having an assortment of comments when you click on them based on goings on (they have none in this game), the ability to beautify or terrify the castle with good or bad things, etc. - those are missing. This does admittedly save on the higher graphics compared to the original system, but still, if you really want the full Stronghold experience, I'd recommend one of the older games. Crusader 2 does have Free Build, but without the above it really just feels like a fortified base camp rather than a living, breathing castle town.To end this review, my advice as a customer to Firefly going forward: Nostalgia means that Crusader 2 is up against a tall order - the immersion especially. Stronghold won a lot of its praise from immersing the player into the Middle Ages, and hit that right balance of humor and severity. Especially when bringing back old characters like The Pig, it's important to recapture it. It's not just the words spoken, but the delivery. Stronghold Crusader 2 had all the tools to live up, no, exceed its predecessors. But it failed on delivering the immersion in full like the original game could. I don't know if that makes sense or not, but while it's clear that the game is the result of a lot of hard work, sometimes it just doesn't pull in. But that's a customer's two cents; take it or leave it, it's an opinion in the air.			"

												I firmly believe that this game is decent.  It's better than the first game in certain ways... and worse than it in other ways.  Everything feels more polished, nice, and generally just more smooth, but there are things that are missing.  Kind of like the Civ games, I believe after a few DLC this game will be fine.  Right now it's just missing some stuff that I believe were vital to the original game, such as the fear factor system.  Just not enough content in the game to justify the price of it, but like I already said I believe that after a few DLC it should feel full again.  Now do I recommend it?  Yes and no.  Depends on how much money you can throw around, and how much you like these types of games.  If you're really into castle building, and strategy, then yes.  If not and you just want to try something out, get the first crusader.  That's all that there really is to say about it.			"

												7/10I have been a fan of the Stronghold series for a number of years now and have put countless hours into each game. Crusader 2, in my opinion, is a good step forward and remains true to the spirit of the epic games before it. There are differences between this and the original; however, to me it is just as enjoyable (now if only I had a pc that could run it on higher than low graphics).Some points of the game:-It can be difficult to grasp for someone who isn't already familiar with the series.-The new animations are great!-It is much more difficult to keep your peasants happy than in the previous crusader. This might make it more difficult, though it also adds a new, realistic element to siege warfare in the game since it allows you to ""starve"" your opponent, so to speak.-The newly added troop and building limit is disappointing to someone like me who enjoys building up a gigantic army and then wiping out the rest of the players who cannot resist my shear numbers. Although, if you play with a more active, offensive style, you are unlikely to reach it in an average game.-The price is way too high at the time of this review. I would say it's worth $30, but not $50 like it is priced now. Wait until it's on sale.			"

												I have been a fan of this series ever since playing the first Stronghold Crusader. It seems like Firefly Studios have released games in a hit and miss pattern. I enjoyed Stronghold 2 aside from the need for numerous patches required. Stronghold Legends was O.K. but not great. I was extremely excited to learn that a second Crusader game would be released as it was my original favorite. I purchased it new, and wasn't exactly sure how I felt about it at first. It mimics the original well, but almost too well. They added many units and buildings and the game feels much more complete than some of their previous releases. I still think the game is missing something, but with the amount of updates rolling out the door this could soon be the best game of the series.			"

												This is a very good game, both the graphics and the logic/physics of the actual game are very good. The graphics have taken on a cartoon style while still maintaining a realistic feel to it, it doesn't involve and blood and gore so is a great game for everyone with the only brutality being the burning of people when they stay in fire for too long, this is still only betrayed as a cartoon type person burning. The only bad this about this is the zoning, you aren't allowed to place certain building and an area that surrounds the keep. personally i think this zone is too small and instead of this you should have an area around the enemies keep and then keep the limitations on building near enemies (only allowed to build siege equipment as far as I'm aware). I would give this game 3.75 out of 5.			"

												Firefly really outdone themselves this time. With Stronghold Crusaders 2 you can really relive that nostalgic feeling with what the first one had to offer. The attention to detail with this game is phenomenal. The graphics are outstanding 10/10sound is amazing as well 9/10. all in all a great classic RTS remade and its amazing.			"

												8/10, although it is a fun game the optimalization could have been a lot better the more buildings and units in game the lower the fps goes. (in some cases 2-3fps) other than that it is a game that thrives on nostalgia for me, and if you're not familiar with the stronghold titles it's still a nice castlebuilder.			"

The best thing for me is the sandbox option which allows me to learn how to build stuff and play the game without being attacked constantly.			"

Then have 12 years to perfect it and eliminate any issues..... and then have a mid level semi fun Stronghold Crusader 2?! It makes no sense. I'm still going to recommend this game because there are some fun times but it's so hard to believe that the developers are actually professionals? Glitches, sub par graphics, terrible AI, and the mechanics overall are just bland. I would buy this game... if it were maybe $15 or $20... but that is it.... and it better include the darn expansions.			"

												Stronghold is one of the best strategy games that I have played. As owner of the whole collection I would have to say this one is the best. It takes the game dynamics of stronghold crusader, then adds the realism from stronghold three. Now stronghold games just a few years ago came out with stronghold 3 which was terrible!!!! But I think stronghold has redeemed itself. A must buy for previous fans and new comers too!Give more great games like this Firefly ;)			"

												I am a die-hard crusader fan, but this game still had a long way until I would consider it done. I would describe this game as half of the original stronghold, updated to today's standard of graphics. Still great, but probably whatever you expect a small design team can make, it's that.While I love what this came could be, it seemed like simplified the small stuff, which makes the game feel pretty empty and small. My only hope is that they keep adding more..In respect for the price-tag that this game has. I do like this game which is why i recommend it, but just pick it up with a couple friends when it hits a sale and I'm sure you'll have no regrets.			"

												Another great game from Firefly!  The crusader trail is back and really makes this game just like it did for the original Stronghold Crusader.  There are enough changes to the game that make it unique and new.  The changes to combat have changed the tactics quite a bit, this is mostly good but has a few drawbacks.  As someone who has followed firefly from the original Stronghold through the disappointment that was stronghold 2 & 3, I'm glad to see them moving in the right direction again.  The economy has been simplified from the original Stronghold Crusader which takes away from the castle management difficulty.  This allows the player to concentrate on defending and attacking once a strong economy has been built.The paid DLC is unfortunate but I can't blame Firefly because they are a victim of the times.Overall this game has been great and I look forward to finishing the crusader trail and then reluctantly buying the DLC and beating that.

I'm slowly working my way through the various game modes, but so far it has delivered. I enjoy the castle building, I enjoy the siege warfare and most of all I enjoy defense. The game has multiple updates that have added new content, some are free some are not, but all of them are high quality and worth it. If you enjoy strategy/sims in which you build up a base, defend it and take it to the enemy then Stronghold Crusader could be for you.			"

												Stronghold the castle building sim series is once again let down by its creators. Stronghold legends, stronghold 3 and now stronghold crusader 2 these have all been a let-down. What amazes me the most is that this is worse than stronghold 3, at least stronghold 3 looked pretty good this is supposed to be in the same engine but manages to look worse. What annoys me the most though is that I’ve spotted three spelling/grammatical errors in as many hours of play, one was even voice acted.After closing the multiplayer support for stronghold 2 I thought we’d be provided with a decent game by firefly studios, I was mistaken. I had heard bad reviews but thought people were just whingeing about a buggy launch like total war games. Still I was cautious, I bought the game on sale for $15.00, and now I regret it. Does firefly studios even try anymore? I guess they’re making much more money out of Stronghold Kingdoms than these games. To be fair I honestly believe Stronghold Kingdoms is a better game than Stronghold legends, stronghold 3 or stronghold crusader 2.			"

I admit that it is unnecessary but that's one of the things that make Stronghold Crusader unique to me. Overall, this game is worth it.

But having said that contray to what some people think, I like the idea of bringing out a game focusing on core aspects then bringing out all the other parts it leaves alot of room for feedback and updating.

Like many of the other reviewers have already stated, the graphics feel less polished then before and alot of game features have been removed or dumb down. In my opinion, it does not feel like the original developers created a squeal and a better game. It feels like the original game was given to a new development team and they were told to port the game into a 3D engine. It feels like they just rushed it out half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to turn a buck.			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is a RTS game developed by Firefly Studios and released on the 23 September 2014. Merits:-Good strategy game-New 3D Graphics Engine, good graphic, accurate animations and effects-Good tutorial (including ""tutorial campaign"")-Decent descriptions about soldiers, buildings ecc.-Very nice as a coop game-Realistic sieges (gradual destruction of defence's walls, fires, defence's walls usable by soldiers, for example)-Decent system of economy/popularityDefects:-You can't choose the difficulty level of the AI (!)-There aren't number-based descriptions about, for example, the health or the attack strength of soldiers, or even the resistance of buildings, but only simple text descriptions about everything.-There aren't random generated maps, but only made maps done by developers, and they aren't so much, in my opinion.-Some maps have stone and iron deposits only in determined points of the map, where you CAN'T build your mine because  that deposit ""it's not in your territory""-Low amount of campaigns-Not really an exciting game if played in singleplayer (but for this there is the multiplayer)-This games is missing some stuff about the old Stronghold Crusader Conclusions: Even if this game has a lot of defects, it can give you a nice gaming experience because it's a very studied game with tactical parts and other things that make this a really nice strategy game, especially if played in multiplayer with other players.Vote: 8/10			"

												The amount of bugs in this game is just insane. I'll place a list here of what I encountered so far and annoyed me so much I had to put it here:1. Sometimes I can't attack enemies (even with archers) and the enemy is just stuck but keeps shooting arrows at my soldiers damaging and killing them.2. Can't choose a difficulty setting in custom skirmishes.3. Enemies start to attack right from the start in such a manner you will have to survive the entire time instead of building up your economy.4. Peace mode was introduced to counter number 3, but I think it was added as a lazy solution to counter the aggressive AI instead of thinking of something new.5. HOW CAN I ROTATE THIS FREAKIN GATE!!! In the manual there is button to rotate, but it is to rotate the camera, there is no rotate button for gates or anything at all. There is no autofit, or at least it doesn't work for me.6. Archers of friendlies keep shooting at workers that were initially neutral but then became my workers, the allied archers keep shooting at them... forever.7. You can't enlarge your stockpile.8. A lot of units removed.9. But 8 doesn't matter to the AI since they (almost) only buy mercenaries.10. you can take over neutral castles, but you can't build anything there. So if there is an iron mine sitting there without ox then you can't place the ox to start transporting the stone (or iron).11. Kill a lion den immediately because the spawn rate of lions is ridiculous high. Even rabbits wouldn't be able to keep up.12. The difficulty is very hard, even on easy. The campaign is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get through.13. The focus on the militairy aspect is enormous, the economic part is just there as filling. That's how I feel it.14. But still the options for the militairy aspect are very limited. you have three stances and three formations, that's it, nothing more.15. Which brings me to next thing: you can't take archers and swordfighter together because they will just run mixed instead of archers in the back.16. Units just keep standing there while getting shot at, they don't attack, they don't retreat, they just stand there.17. You can rebuild your walls while the opponent is destroying it. The range from where the catapult shoots is further then the range where you can't build anything if there is an enemy nearby.18. AI castle catapults destroy there own walls.19. Soldiers getting stuck at gates and towers.20. Soldiers die as ragdolls which is very cool. Unless they sometimes collapse if they were just regular dolls.21. When you ask allies to attack an enemy they will sometimes neglect even though they are already attacking that very enemy or are about to.22. Allies start to ask for goods you possibly can't have from the start of the game.23. Special abilities activate when you click to attack an enemy. Even though you are still 10024458434km away.24. Soldier AI is just completely absent, the AI of archers is good though.And so much more. I really hoped to return to the nostalgic feeling of the original Stronghold Crusader but they failed completely thanks to the bugs and bad mechanisms.			"

Then, they did the hotkeys fix and change how you rotate the camera from ""q"" and ""e"" to something that worked way worse (i think it was mouse button 3 or alt) and i stopped playing it. then i found out that you can change the controls so i tried to change them and it was bugged or somthing. i literally tried everything to change the controls even re-installing. so then i stopped playing again. now i've come back to it because i saw another update was released ( i was hoping that they fixed that bug). Guess what i cant evern run it now(and i still cant change the controls). when i tried to play i was getting idk mabye 10 fps (estimate). so that is why i am un-recommending this game if they actually make it playable i will definitly play it and change this review.

												I bought the first Stronghold Crusader and the first Stronghold  later, (when I found them in the Walmart computer game isle in 2005. If I remember correctly, I paid $5.00 each (U.S.).Really loved it, so much that I purchased the HD version on Steam ( for more thn $5 bucks), even though I still have the original discs.I also tried Stronghold Crusader 3. Big mistake.No idea about the online one, but I heard it sucked. Worse than 3.It's been a long time since 2005. Maybe the developers (if they are the same), should retire like some of the politicians in our goverment. You get old, you get locked in to your ways, and try to put a new spin on old♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Not working here boys. It's 2014. Go buy Men of War (1 or 2).♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just go to Gootube and watch their vids. Notice how much you can pan the camera at an angle?As the saying goes: ""You've come along way baby!""; Just not far enough in this case!			"

												This is now my second review. After what I have experienced now I will definately recommend this game. I have made some great maps and on the map editor which you can find at: Libary / tools / stronghold crusader 2 map editorVery good game but there could be improvements. A few bugs need to be fixed and things like laddermen, tunnels etc. could be included. Also I would like it if there were seige equipment that allowed you to transport troops across water, as in the crusades alot of troops were beached by small boats.Would also like it so there is a setting to allow/disallow certain buildings and troops. (there is already this setting in  map editor but it would be nice if it were used in a lobby where the host could make it so certain buildings can/cannot be built etc.Other than that. A great game. Amazing work. I would say this is value for money.Money well spent for me.			"

												Okay, so this game looks like it improved at first glance.There are many features missing that I really enjoyed in the first game - for example;No bad / evil system - In the first one, you could torture your ""peasants"" to make them scared.No voice responses or quotes when you click on workers, letting you know what they want, etc.MoatsDecorative items (Flags and such)AI is cheating. The tutorial missions are way too difficult on normal difficulty. Teaching you how to play, or making you rip your hair off?I'm gonna give this a thumbs up, as I really hope they will add those features as free updates instead of paid DLC.			"

												First of all, even after playing the new Stronghold Crusader 2 just for an hour I have to say to ""old"" SC feeling is back. Nevertheless I agree also with some reviews stating a little buggy path-finding and the not totally up to date graphics. But as always there are pro and cons and this game is definitely a lot better than S3. So all in all I recommend it.The developers already send through a Hot Fix, so there is hope for the players who still have major issues - had none so far.... lucky me it seems :)I know this review is not as detailed as some others but it's just an opinion and I personally think that they are on the right track - but still the game might need some tweaks here and there.

												Finally a 3D Stronghold game that meets the experience I had with the first. It’s not over complicated like Stronghold 2 and castle building feels soo right. The destruction of walls from siege equipment is great and although the graphics aren’t anything special it’s perfect. If you like RTS and medieval destruction this game (once you learn how to play it) is amazing.			"

Having played Stronghold Crusader 2 now I have that feeling again, after only a few missions I know this game has captured the essence of the first Stronghold Crusader, and done it so well.TL;DR if you like Stronghold Crusader, buy this.

Ive played crusader back in 02 and its was great, and with the sequal its just as great and after a few dlc and updates im sure it will reach the success as the first crusader game did and firefly studios will redeem themselves after stronghold 3. I do hope they add a justice system, and more seige equipments as well as more unit types. It would also be nice if they would add more wall structures. ect. Overall its a great game thats a lot of fun... wish more of my friends had it. 9/10.			"

But the Devs have said updates are coming including some things that everyone wants added to the game. I cant wait for the updates but as is the game is so worth it. ANY ADDITIONS WILL BE ICING ON THE CAKE.Get this game honestly you will love it if you love this genre.			"

												When I first found out Crusader 2 was announced I was so hyped to have a sequel to one of the best games I have ever played and now we have it.I must say I am very impressed with this game, the gameplay is nice, the AI lords still have personality and the music is fantastic. The battles play out nicely as well.  I can see they were giving it all they got to make this one of the best since Crusader and revive the once great series (with 2,3 and legends I got them all in the sale so I can enjoy them for what they are :3). my only gripes with the game are; still getting used to some of the mouse controls being switched XD (not a huge problem though) and the peasants/workers don't speak :( (but I do love the sayings of the soldiers). I know there would be bugs (what game doesn't have them) and with the graphics people seem to forget it uses the same engine as 3.Overall a fantastic game 9.9/10, I'll give it a perfect score once them peasants start to talk again ;)			"

I can on the other hand recommend this to a previous Stronghold series follower simply because, as previously stated, it is a stronghold game and still has a very distant feel to it. "

												Overall good game and recommendable. This review is only concerning the single player aspect as I have yet to try multiplayer.Pros: Streamlined functioning making it easy to do anything and everything. Graphics are exceptionally good and make you get lost in the moment. Easy to get sucked into and feel apart of the game. Idea of having estates (feature from Stronghold 2) is back and works rather well. Easy to pickup on and get into if a first time player (disclosure: I have played and owned every Stronghold game) but lacks a definitive tutorial and Single major campaign.Cons: No real campaign, just a series of ""learning"" campaigns to go through that are rather short and feature time limits. The endearingness of the various peasants is gone, in previous versions the peasants would either have quirky comments in their activity status or would say random things when clicked but that is now gone. Essentially the personal interest is gone and the game is much more business oriented (get in and kill things, don't look for much else).No details for anything you scroll over to tell you more about the building, you more or less have to guess or read the index featured inside.

THE AI is total HorribleYou can leave a Space in your walls,and extend it into a long narrow Alley of Death with Oil and Spikes etc and the enemy will walk inside every time,not understanding the Trap.The Enemy also dont adapt to what you do.The AI is very bad.But for Multiplayer its nice.Steamchart shows that around 6000 People Play the Game at this Time (10/2014)			"

												My feelings about this game are very mixed. I started with the first stronghold a few years ago (maybe ten?) and loved the concept of building my own... stronghold! The economy part, the building and the fighting made a great balance in this game.Then in crusader we had just to fight in deserts... Understandable, but personal I prefer lush areas much more. Anyway - the gameplay evolved with merchenaries and this game feeled even more addictive. (I played over 100h in an non-steam-version.)Crusader 2 feels mixed to me, because of the lack of water ditches and tunnel diggers, the simplified gameplay for siegebuilders and just a few npcs before all of this overpriced ""a few missions more and 2 npcs"" DLCs.The good side is, that this game now runs very smooth on my system (lagged a lot at the beginning, even with an gtx 770), we have an multiplayer with building A.I back and some of the missions are really challenging.I would say - if you can get this game in sale, just try it. You will enjoy building nice castles, if you don't just rush, abuse the bad A.I (I just say single towers full of archers at key points) and use just a few units (horsearchers ftw!) instead of an interesting mix. :)			"

												Stronghold Crusader 2 is a pretty good game, but there is a few bugs. It also takes ages to build a army, because it dosent give too much gold, by selling stone and iron. But apart from that, you will almost only find positive things in Stronghold Crusader 2.I give it: 8/10			"

												The game is pretty good when it works, but even though it's a 2014 game there are fairly limited improvements over other installments, so there really is no reason to get this one.If it didn't crash on me now and again I'd recommend it. Though it is definitely not a $40 game, even at peak performance.			"

												First of all I love the stronghold series. Well, the first two games, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader. Ever since then it's been one terrible game after another. First of all this game can be fun. But it's lacking the depth that made the originals so fun. None of your decisions feel relevant; it doesn't matter what you produce only that you outproduce the enemy. From a technical standpoint this game would have been reasonable if it was released in 2005 but not as good as say, Age of Empires III. That's right. It requires a new gaming machine with graphics that look 10 years old. I wouldn't even recommend paying the sale price of $10 but maybe I would spend a buck on it. Then again I don't really want it screwing up my collection which is full of great games. Fun could be had but why bother when the originals still play great, look great, and are just plain classics. Get the original, you'll see what it was all about.			"

												i mean, its not bad.... its not really good tho  >.> i play stronghold Crusader one and i enjoyed in alot more. this game is just meh how can i put it.... its kinda like the 1st total war kinda. they did a good job making everything better GPU wise. but the units and fighting is like a dumbed down from the 1st one. sure units can't move into each other but its like watching runescape people fight from very far away....pointless. the castles so look nicer but seems as tho castle building was dumbed down as well. i mean i would not recommend this game to anyone that played the 1st stronghold cause im sure you will feel the same as me? however im sure some people will like it? still i would give it a 6/10 while the 1st stronghold was a 9/10 for me. everyone likes what they like i guess ^.^			"

												Got a badass rig, crashed in windowed mode on medium graphics with no v-sync. :[ i really want to play and like this game but it crashed 3 times in my first 7 minutes of play time, and it crashed during the tutorial.I was just doing the tutorial because I love the original 2 strongholds, who doesn't, but this isn't that game, and I can't play it, so just take that and do what you want with it. RTS is dead. Hopefully we can all learn to become obedient mind-numbed consumeristic slaves that are absent of value so we can't feel how bad it hurts to have great game series rammed into the ground in front of us, while we pay for it, and are unable to do anything other than pull the plug.Idk.

Same as games after Stronghold Crusader this one is just plain bad. No innovation, lazy copy+paste with downgrade. Game feels sloppy, not polished and simply bad. AI is terrible both as a teammate and as an opponent.

												I'm glad I got to try this game for free. Now don't get me wrong Firefly Studios is a great studio or at least it was back when they made the first crusade game. But as the game stands now it feels more like a Beta or even a Alpha build and not finished. Because the game has performces issues and has lots of noticable bugs. Would I surgest it if you don't mine playing something like a Alpha build of a game then go all for it. But if you are looking for a finished produce I would surgest to you stay away from this game and go to the orgial. Now for the pros and consPros-You can fully auto-mize your ecomony if you know what you're doing-Players can capture and fight over estates that will send back supplies to their owners-There are new units in the game compared to the old oneCons-Limited AI choices for custom skirmes (8 options)-lots of glitches-As far as I can tell you can't tell what supplies the estates to send you-The AI seems just a tab bit over powered that or I really suck (Hmm it's more likely I suck)-And from what I can tell again the deves don't seem like their going to be fixing these issues anytime soon			"

												As a fan of the series I found this game to be quite good.There surdenly is more action since you build larger armys and this make the castle defending and attacking more fun.In general I like it.However the graphics could need an update if the series are gona survive, including some new thinking such as trade with offmap countrys where we have to build ships and ports to cross waters ect.. In general larger maps would also be nice. In general the game need to evolve if it is going to survive.I think much of the bad reviews the game have is not nessesary reflect the game that well.. Personaly I think it is okay but yes price level i would say is to high for a game that look and plays very much like in previous titles.. as I said the game need to evolve.After trying the game for free, i have desided to buy it on sale -80%  :-)I have not bought it until now since i read all the bad comments and was kind of angry at how little new content there was in the previous titile that i mostly would call an update to a previous game.

Of course the new engine is a awesome new feature added to this series and I absolutley love it, but if I compare it to the other Stronghold game the manner of playing is completly different. I didn't played the game that much just because I cannot get used to the mechanics of the game. Hopefully when I play this game in the near feature my mind will be changed so I can read a more positive review of this game. If you have the money to buy this game, do it. You will not regret it.

												After hearing painful reviews of Stronghold 3 I decided against purchasing it...I then saw this game on the Steam Homepage and got overly excited. As a kid I played many RTS games and there have not been very many that seem to grab my attention now. After playing the game it met every expectation I had. I wanted something more in-depth with castle building and walls. For the fact that you can actually place troops on top the your walls was amazing, as most of the games I had played just used walls as... well walls. The game also takes a fair amount of time to win each battle, there are times where you can rush in and destroy their base in a matter of seconds but I enjoy the difficulty in destroying others. If you are looking for an in-depth Castle Building RTS this is the game for you! The only downside like every other game is DLC that is 1) over priced 2) should of been included in the base game. I will still buy it because it expands my gaming experience with-in the game, but it would be nice to get some free DLC here and there.			"

												Unfortunately it's not worth it.  I must say, there are definitely features in this game that were improvements on the original.  The slave driver and seargant-at-arms, for example add a very interesting dynamic, but what really kills it for me is the slowed down economy and the removal of ladderers, tunnelers, siege towers, engineers, and moats.  The strategy in SHC 1 was always about figuring out how you were going to get into the enemy's castle, but now that your choice is limited to ""tear it down with battering rams"" vs. ""tear it down with catapults""  its strategy seems to lie entirely in unit balance, which is exactly what happens in every other sub-par RTS.
