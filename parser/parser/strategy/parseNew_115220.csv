												Awesome game. Played this a lot years back decided to pick it up again. Random map is probably the most fun (skirmish mode).+ Nice graphics, nice sounds, great gameplay+ Learning curve, your first play will likely result in defeat, even on easy+ Loads of nations, 17 in total including 8 European nations+ Realistic fighting: reload/aiming times- Unbalanced nations, for example Sioux are able to create strong cavalry units in no time in fast, large amounts- Sound missing, FIX: press enter, type qwe hit enter again (will reveal whole map though) - Sometimes the game switches back to fast mode, even if it was set on slow mode, but can easily be changed in optionsRandom map tips: 1 Don't forget to put strong melee units in your buildings, or you might have your base taken over2 You can stop large fast enemy groups by forming a defensive line around your base, forcing the enemy to battle with you (instead of them going around your army to your base)3 Scroll down the top right menu in random map menu for more options such as peace time (really handy if you want to build up large armies/prepare defenses)4 The more you construct of the same buildings, the more expensive they will get. So build more storehouses, churches, town centers instead of fortresses to increase population cap			"

												Have you ever wanted to play a strategy game? If yes then this is perfect game for you. American Conquest series are one of the classic RTS games. I am huge fan of this series and I can recommend this game to anyone.Technical stuff: Well you can say that this is one old game. It is 2D, but do not be fooled. Graphics in this game are quite good and it is timeless. Due to its requirements it is quite easy load game and thanks to steam you can play it on newer systems with no glitches. There can be thousands of units on the battleground and you will not experience any lags. Engine is based on cossacks series with little improvements, and that engine I have to say is quite good. Sounds are nice too and will not affect you in anyway. When you first time run the game, you should adjust the game speed since on newer computers game will run on insane speed.Gameplay: It is classic RTS game but unique. There are different civilizations with their unique gameplay. Common ground is: every building which has units placed inside it will fire something (bullets, arrows, cannonballs). To produce soldiers you have to put some peasants into production building and turn them into soldiers. Workers can be captured if there are no units guarding them (you can't steal civilization like in cossacks), although some nations are exception (indian mostly). You can storm buildings (send your units into enemies building, and if you overpower garrisoned ones you overtake the building and it becomes yours. Mines can be captured same as workers. There is morale mechanics where soldiers can become frightened when too many die, from gunshots, cavalry, etc. Units have basic stats: slash/pierce attack, base armor, HP, morale. storm force. If they are armored they will have resistance to gunshot, arrow, scatter shot, pierce/slash attacks etc. There are various unit upgrades and economic upgrades. There is famine mechanics where workers and soldiers will die if there is no food. Food is farmed using Mills which automatically plant squares of wheat or corn. There are 2 gatherable resources: food and wood, while stone, gold, iron and coal are mined in mines. Buildings when dmg for example with fire arrows will start burning and if not repaired with workers will easily be destroyed. Also when shooting arrows or bullets into garrisoned building, the ones inside will die.You can categorize nations into 2 factions: European nations and Indians. Europeans start with peasants building a fort. Fort is like 1st tier barracks which produces 3 types of units: Heavy armor pikemen, harquebusier  (heavy armor rifleman), musketeer and 3 officers types: drummer, flagbearer and officer for making formations. Once you build 3 officers and enough single type soldiers (15,36,72,120,196) you can make formation which provides base armor and dmg (one flaw would be that while in formations soldiers get dumb and won't move as you command them, they will stop at certain points). Workers are built using houses T1 and T2, and main upgrades are placed in town center. There is church to build priests who act as healers only. Shipyard builds epic ships and gunboats as ferries as transports. After than using mines mine stone and gold and build fortress which is stronger barracks. It can train musketeers too. officers, and fusiliers from infantry. Fortress is also place where you upgrade it with stables to produce cavalry and artillery depot to produce single type cannons. Regarding firepower Fortress is impregnable and is hard point to capture/destroy with indian nations. Cannons are game finishers produces slow and expensive, move slow (kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ movement) but they pack quite a punch and can have range even half the map. True epitome of artillery. Indian vary much, from mayans, delawares, iroquois, sioux each with unique gameplay. Indians rely on quantity and arrows, build buildings much faster since most require only wood. Some indians do not use mines (sioux). Indian can also build formations using chief and shaman which are produced ridiculously slow. Some indians have fortresses (like aztec, maya, incas), while others use barracks to make soldiers. Indians soldiers are pikemen, archers and single type cavalry and each indian nations is quite unique but in raw firepower and armor none can reach european nations. Shipyard plays better role for indians since it can produce fishing ships and war canoes which are good siege artillery unit. So gameplay starts with nothing but few buildings, ends up with big town which produces massive armies whom you use to peel your enemy off (hit mines, hit mills, hit storehouses, basically pick off his economy). There is campaign, single players maps which are autogenerated, battle simulations. Maximum number of players on one map is 7. Map sizes go from small to epic (and epic is quite the distance). I have not played multiplayer since I find AI quite strong and challenging and when you finally overpower him it takes ages to finish him. And he can recover fast. All in all game is fun and relaxing and if you enjoy playing RTS games, you should buy this game. I will continue updating this review with more details as time goes. "

												After feeling the old times again, I thought i help the interested people with this review, a bit out.Alright let's begin with the basic informations about this game.American Conquest: Fight Back is the standalone add-on for the ""American Conquest"" the RTS succesor in year 2002. (Fight Back was published one year later [2003]). The Ukrain developer ""GSC Game World"" (Who also developed the famous Cossacks games) set a great step towards the massive fights in RTS games, we currently play. With a limit of around 16.000 Units on the map, a big step was made.To cut it short. American Conquest (in addition: ""Fight Back and Divided Nation"") has made it's place up to one of the greatest RTS games ever made so far.Moving on to the Pros and Cons section:Pros - 2D Graphics (But don't let yourself get shrekt by that, for a 2003 game, the graphics do look smooth and pretty) - No running problems on 2003 compared systems (Currently used: Windows 7 Home) - I only experienced 2 crashes so far after a long play time. - RTS game. - Tutorials are existent - A huge variety of campaigns (Europe site and Native American site) - A huge variety of civilizations (Europe site and Native American site) - The units for example the fusilier does never look the same, each civilization has it's unique units - The AI is challenging even on ""Easy"" Mode - Balanced play    (Europe units are mostly based on gunpowder but cost more and take longer to built, while the natives mostly rely on arrows and a minimum of gunpowder, but are cheaper and faster to built) - Morale and defenses are pretty well built in the game - Mechanic of people dying when there is no food left is within the game - Mechanic of archers not shooting arrows when there is no wood left is within the game - Same goes for units with the use of iron and coal for gunpowder (KEEP YOUR RESOURCES UP!) - The price of 4.99€ is worth every centNeutralThe neutral section here is a section where i simply can not tell whether it would be good for you people or not. - The music, does fit, but it can get annoying i guessCons - You need to be fast to built up your defenses (depends on the peacetime you set in the menu) - The AI how easy they might be, can always find a way around your guarding troops. So be careful and guard well. - I do experience lag at somepoint in the game if a number of units is produced, but this can be because my computer has to run multiple things in the background -  The game sure can be frustrating if you look more for the economic state of the game (Example: Research everything before you actually produce units/an army) and the AI smashes your efforts with one offensive strike - Sometimes (atleast if the enemy is the civilization: ""Pueblos"" (which i assume are the mexicans) it can happen that the enemy is not attacking at all, but patrolling their city. (To fix this you simply need to attack them)ConclusionI played this game around 2005 or so and i loved it. Since steam brought it back into the store, I do play it often.I can only say that every player who likes good old RTS gaming experience, should buy this game. I did not tryout the multiplayer matches, since i do feel like i'm not that good but that's an other story.Still though. Buy it if you feel like it, or feel like you should try out the RTS gaming.I do hope that i helped with this review, if anyone still feels unsure, feel free to contact me, I'll try to sort things out and answer your questions you might have, as good as possible.At last a pro tip: DO NEVER EVER MAKE ALL YOUR ENEMIES AND YOURSELF DELAWARES!GreetingsThe Körnäl			"

												This is one of my favorite RTS games to play. Forget the graphic and focus on gamplay. This game features soldiers on a MASSIVE scale. 1000 muskets can disappear in seconds to withering cannon fire, a hail of arrows, or the charge of calvary. The instant battles take quite awhile to get through but going mass calvary army seems the best way to me. Get this game. Its cheap and you might find that you'll get some fun out of it.			"

												This was the game between Cossacks I and II, with innovative gameplay mechanics unseen even today in RTS. The gameplay require skill and strategy, and thinking at every stage of the game. The new game engine allows massive armies and the potiental for endless replay value, this game is definitely worth the 5.99. Unfortunately the third expansion Divided nation is not avaliable yet, and I hope that it would be added soon to the bundle. It seems people dislike the game for it's consistency with history and realisim; in cossacks, you have 15 european nations, almost all the same units, and partake in endless skirmishes again and again. This game forces the player to think as most european units are slower and more realistic in terms of combat, unlike cossacks with it's machine gun musketeers. Lastly, the game only features 4 european nations, 8 in the expansion, and 12 first nations. The game is heavily focused on first nations, and so the unit variety comes from them, something dislike by player as it is more interesting to see line combat rather than to play as a native tribe. In the end, I suggest this game with all my heart, but it depends if you like playing as a native and european nations in a realistic, balanced, yet limited variety, or would you rather play purely gunpower european nations, engaging in total war in cossacks.

												I remember playing this game a long time ago, when I was a kid. I really enjoyed it back in those days and I still do now. When I was younger, I almost exclusively played random skirmish maps since I did not always fully understand the mission objectives in the campaigns. After some years I picked it up again and I decided to finally give the campaigns a try. After completing all the campaigns and some of the extra missions and battlefields, I feel the time has come to express my thouhts in a short review.Since I consider myself to be a rather 'casual' gamer, I kept the difficuly at 'normal' all the time, which I found to be already challenging enough in most occasions. But for those who believe that does not match their real time strategy skills, a 'hard', 'very hard' and even 'impossible' difficulty setting is also available. I didn't try those, since I value 'enjoyment' over 'frustration'. Anyway, it's there for those who are up to the challenge.The game features great campaigns, where you sometimes lead European colonists and sometimes take control of a native tribe. There are also extra single missions and battlefields included, and for those who want even more hours of gameplay there is of course a skirmish mode.It's not a recent game. Therefore the visuals might look old in the eyes of some of you, but they are certainly decent enough to fully enjoy the game.There are many interesting features in the game, like structures getting more expensive when building more of them or the fact that buildings can be set on fire by arrows or cannons which causes them to slowly burn down if they are not repaired. Combat units can in most cases only be created by training peasants, which are also needed to gather resources. The battles in the game can get quite big as the unit limit can grow up to 14 000 units on each side if I am not mistaken, so expect battles with hundreds or even thousands of units at the same time. I found the AI to be brutally efficient in terms of unit creation and structure building, so the possibility to give orders while the game is paused came in handy.This game really has many hours of (great) gameplay to offer, so I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the genre (and not spending a lot of €€) and doesn't care about the fact that the game is not a shiny new one.

												A classic game that I used to play for hours on my childhood. Nevertheless I will try to be as objective as possible.Pro`s:- New Factions- New Missions and campaigns- Huge variety of countries, tribes, units and building types.- Realistic economy (food is consumed constantly, coal and iron are needed for firing guns, gold is necessary for paying mercenaries, wood and stone for building and repairingwood and stone for buildings. Subsequently that means that:1. No food: Your soldiers and ppl will starve to death2. No coal and iron: European ships and units that use pistols and muskets can not fire!!!!3. No gold: certain unit types (mostly mercenaries) will rebell attack any faction4. No wood and stone: obviously you can`t build.  Cutting of the enemies supply of these materials can be a vital key to success.- several historical campaigns- 7 player skirmish or multiplayer matches (It is possible to get a population between 2000-3000 persons per faction: 14.000 units in one match!!!1)- Naval and land combat.- extensive training and tech trees per faction.- Buildings cannot be destroyed by simply hammering on it with a sword like in some other real time strategie gamesThey must be destroyed with cannons or fire-arrows- Innovative city combat: it is possible to put units in any building. they will shoot (bullets or arrows) out of these buildings. Sending units into enemy buildings will get them fighting inside to take over the building.- damaged/burning buildings will slowly lose HP.- Moral system: Units are susceptible to fear. Especially if they get attacked from the rear or the flanlk. They will start running back to the base.- Formations increase moral, power etc. - there are independent indian tribes which can be persuaded to join your side and deliver scouts and troops or trade with you.Con's:-City warfare: Innovative but does not work as good as it should. AI and other players use the del button to explode the buildings they are about to lose. Meaning that your soldiers inside die!!! Furthermore for every building you take the Ai builds another on the other side of the city. This can create an terrible drag and prolongs the fight unnecessary. On top of that in order to take over buildings the formations get dissolved automatically, causing the soldiers to flee quicker.- As the point above (City Warfare) is the final stage of every match, which can become very annoying, it dimishes the overall game experience. - Population cap: It's cool to be able to have so many units. However the result is that it is nearly impossible to have a good overview of what is going on. Fleeing and fighting units run between each other turning the battlefield into chaos.A further problem is that it makes it possible to run over the enemy using numbers alone (except in the city), strategy is hardly needed or, considering the numbers, impossible to execute.Conclusion: American Conquest is a game that is worth experiencing for Strategy gamers that like the more traditional RTS games like AoE and EmEa. Despite the Con's it is an innovative, fun game.			"

												When you try to change game speed, it crashes.When you try to change resolution, it crashes.When you try to change player color, it crashes.When you try to change player faction, it crashes.When you try to change anything that looks like changeable, it crashes.It was good game indeed, but now; it is just garbage.

												Good game but has many flaws/bugs;1. When your armies are moving through neutral animals, instead of killing them, they'll walk through the neutral animals and stand there as the neutral animals♥♥♥♥♥♥your soldiers till they are half dead until your soldiers do anything about it.2. You'll give your men orders to move across the map, they only move 1/16 of the way and stop, and you have to keep massing them orders and pay attention to them.3. AI rushes you constantly, even before you have stable defenses (the game doesn't give you enough time to set up like other RTS games do).If you want a good Cossacks game, stick to the original Cossacks: Back to War, it lets you build true defenses, less buggier and a little less micromanagement.

												This is essentially Age of Empires 2 with slightly better aesthetics, more of a military feel, and a mild historical angle. Other than that, it is not much different. I don't think I would go out of my way to purchase this game, because it feels like a knock-off. It isn't poorly done from what little I played, again I just think taking Age of Empires 2, tweaking a few things and calling it something else isn't the way to go. Save your money and time.			"
