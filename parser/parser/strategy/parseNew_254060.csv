												i got this from a giveaway and its really worth it. the major problem is that you can't play with big resolution, but it can be fix with this step ( I'm using windows 7 ):  Start->Run->regedit Go to : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Reality Pump\KnightShift\BaseGame\Graphics\Setup Edit the ""ShowAllRefreshRates"" by double click on it and set the value 1 (default is 0 and this is not working) "

												A nice litle hack 'n' slash with a great sense of humour. It's not going to win any major awards in THIS decade but it still offers a fun little break from more highbrow titles. It should be noted that there is a slight problem with higher resolutions. The game will not run in full HD. 67%			"

												This game is bad...but that special kind of bad that makes it fun to play with some friends while drinking or something. It has decent controls but hilariously bad dialogue. the characters all sound like Microsoft Sam and the there were times where every single word in an NPC's speach would end in the suffix ""eth."" If I had to explain the story of this game I would just say ""thiseth iseth theeth adventureseth ofeth microsoft Prince John, Heeth goeseth arroundeth andeth killseth stuffeth.""			"

												Truly one of my favourite games of all time. I would estimate that I have somewhere around 1000 hours into the Once Upon A Knight disc version, and I am not sure of the differences between KnightShift and Once Upon A Knight, other than that KnightShift is the European version. I would recommend this game if you can stand to not have the latest graphics, but do enjoy a sometimes humorous RPG. The campaigns are decent, but I could have spent days turning my enemies into cows in the skirmish mode. On top of that I do not remember any game-breaking bugs or issues of any kind from Once Upon A Knight, other than being addicted to it for quite some time. The game can appeal to different players, through the main story line campaigns, the rpg modes, skirmish battles, and the editor mode allowing you to make your own scenarios and maps, providing many, many hours of milk-spending entertainment! (Yup, ""milk-spending"", milk is one of the currencies, isn't that great?) While the graphics might not be up-to-date, which is what should be expected of an aging game, I feel that the gameplay greatly out-weighs that. I highly recommend this game!			"

												I fail to see how this game is broken, buggy or unplayable (according to other reviewers, they almost always had issues with this game). This game sure has aged a lot, but it still has the unique feel and setting that isn't present in any other game (even the Witcher, which is also heavily based on Slavic mythology).Of course, it is very dated. Graphics may be ugly (but seriously, what do you expect from a game made in 2003?) if you compare this game to other, more modern ones. This game doesn't support any other display modes but letterbox (4:3). But since I'm not that kind of a guy who pays attention to graphics, it doesn't really bother me. The game's interface and controls are very intuitive and easy to learn, so both hardcore and ""casual"" (no pun intended) players can, IMO, enjoy it, provided that dated graphics won't distract them. I know I enjoy this game, and I've been a gamer since I was born. That's 19 years of experience.It has RPG and RTS modes, but they aren't very advanced (that is not a flaw to me, though). It also has a built-in editor - the kind that is fairly easy to learn to use - which allows you to create and share custom content. The possibilities are endless. Even if you are too lazy to make your own stuff, you can still look for some fan-made content on the Internet.This game has its' flaws, of course. It is not perfect. There are more complex RPGs and RTSs out there. There are games with prettier graphics. But since I am the kind of a guy who likes games that are simple to learn and present you with something challenging (not the gameplay, but the setting and/or story), I actually like this game.Personal rating: 7/10.

												Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Game----------------------------------------KnightShift is a unique blend of RPG and top-down adventure.  It can be played as a strategy game, an RPG, or a hybrid mix.Seemingly very low-budget, KS still brings an interesting, if not intricate, gameplay to the gamer.  For those who can tolerate the lower-end graphics and quirkiness of the game (I find it cute how the prince takes a nap, for example, as odd as it is), KnightShift will bring a good round of exploratory gameplay in an indie package that I'd recommend for a fun few hours of Princedom.Overall Rating: 8/10Gameplay----------------------------------------Warning: There are a LOT of keys/key combinations to remember for this game.If you're undaunted, the next hurdle to overcome is a slightly awkward mouse control that seems to be reminiscent of Windows 98 mouse acceleration insanity.  Once familiarized with it, the mouse awkwardness stops detracting from the interface.I'm not sure if there were audio cues for some things, but I learned haphazardly that the giant withcraft looking areas are healing spas.  This was useful fighting my first few bears.  The lesson here is just to explore the areas, as context tooltips don't really exist to assist in understanding what is around you in the game.Although rough around the edges, the quirky gameplay and level-matched quests can catch you and lure you in for more from this game.  The random encounter fights contribute a little to exp farming and provide a balanced challenge as you build up your equipment set and character.Overall Accessibility----------------------------------------KnightShift has dialogue that is not subtitled, making the plot a little inconvenient to follow.  I don't blame the developers, who, as a small indie group, made the game because they wanted to, and did so as best they could.Because I was unable to properly test multiplayer, the overall rating is based on only the subtitles category.Rating: 7/10Subtitles/Text----------------------------------------KnightShift is an indie game on a unique platform.  That said, it's not subtitled or captioned.  Deaf/HoH players can still read the text of what was said after by hitting F2 a few times, which cycles through the 'mission log' and flavor text/mission text.At first I found it annoying, but I find the workaround tolerable and am happy they included it.Rating: 7/10Chatting/Communicating----------------------------------------While KS has multiplayer capability, I did not test.  Based on the keyboard options, I saw no key for chat.Rating: N/A			"

												I had played this game before I re-found it on steam, and I used to bloody love this game, I found it again on steam for only 97 cents and brought a few freinds along to buy it aswell, it has a great campaign, great RTS/RPG elements in the game, It has a great Multiplayer system ranging from RTS which you can have a full out war or team up with your friends or betray them, and it also has a RPG Mode where you and your friends will do set missions. Very Great game I'd rate it 10/10 and is one of the best RTS game's I have ever played. Online games can have around 7 players.			"

												""The task then was to drive out the evil lords from power and to allow peace and order to return.. ""Well.. so far, i was leading three cows to the south-east of the village ( Martha, Hilda and Getrude ), but they refuse to follow me. ( 11/10 )Anyway, it's a realy nice oldschool RPG game. Gameplay is simple.It has two game mods. (  multiplayer is also available )( My personal opinion at the end )RTS Mode.""In this mode the player is faced with three campains. Each of them plays in a different geographical area and always offers the player new challenges ( Rescuing the Princess or fighting the Dragon. Classic, but i love it ). During the campains the player develops his character and gains access to new weapoms, special armor and magic items. He also has the possibility of creating new charackers or building new structures. Priests, priestesses, sorcerers and knights appear... All characters gain experience and level-up, increasing their combat potential and magical abilities. RPG Mode.""At the beginning of the RPG mode the player selects his character from a list of totally 8 characters including Barbarian, Amazone Sorceress, Wizard, Knight, Priestess, Spearman, Archer and Skeleton. Each character can be modified the player has the possiblity to personalize his character by selecting the hair color, the clothes color ( Well, it doesnt have the best character customization, but come on, this game is old ) and by distributing points to basic or special abilities, individually at each character.Every character has basic skills - the magic characters: stamina, mana and magic power, the non magic characters: stamina and strength. During the game progress the character is able to learn new spells and new abilities and the player has the posibility to invest the points received for each level up into the desired skills of his character.With this option it is nearly impossible to generate two equal characters. ""My personal opinion ?This game is realy old. Made back in 2003, if i am not mistaken.Graphics aren't good. Audio too. But if you're looking for a low spec, or an oldschool RPG game, this is for you. I am not feeling like i waste my time playing this game. i enjoyed playing it. I recomment you to take a look on a walkthrough before buying it.It is also have some issues with fullscreen. Just don't run it fullscreen.			"

												This was once a great RTS/RPG hybrid but unfortunately it has aged badly - it's unstable on modern systems and you need to do some convoluted system changes (like disabling DEP for the exe) and dumping the game resolution just to get it to run.To put it simply, if you buy this, there's no guarantee it will even work for you, and if it does, it's unstable on modern systems.

												Love it. This game has a lot to it. There is an RPG mode, which is like a typical RPG... You go around and do quests and whatnot, and there are different ""games"" for you to pick from when you are in RPG mode. This allows you to play different stories and whatnot, as well as customize your character to have a TON of possible combos. There is also a Campaign mode, which is like the RPG one, but a bit more simplistic. Then, there is Skirmish, which is sort of like Civ, in the sense that you build a city and defend it. I personally prefer the Skirmish game mode, as it is very fun, and does not involve a lot of depth, which means you can play it at almost any time of the day.			"

												The game itself is teresting enough but being a title released in 2003 means it is lacking in much we've become accustomed to. For one, it seems to only work in 4:3 aspect ratio. The textures might have been ""good"" back in the day but are obviously dated now. The cutscene movies are also pretty dated. The spoken dialogue is remeniscent of old...  wait this is an old game...  so umm, the spoken dialogue represent what was about the 'norm' for 2003, though the script seems a bit hammy.All things considered, if you are the kind that doesn't mind the old-school feel of the game, you could come to enjoy it very much however I know a lot of people won't be able to get past that aspect of the game.I'd recommend this game only for people who like that old school feel.

												Ok I had this game for awhile from a local gaming magazine so I played it alot more than the time indicated on Steam. This was my first contact with the mixed RTS-RPG genre and for me at that young age it was just mind blowing.The variety of heroes is quite decent (the classic classes are here) but unfortunately the RTS side lacks variety. The AI is the most problematic thing since I truly belive it goes randomly from truly dumb-tastic too the GOD of slaughter and micro. Also great graphics and the game aged quite well. The sound design for me is just superbe...I could listen to that classic medieval soundtrack for days and it really gets you in the mood for some old fashioned sword fighting. If you get some friends to play multiplayer this game is truly a blast and I feel like it`s one of the most underrated classics of it`s time.			"

												Recommended? Yes, but... read on...Review v2.0I rewrote this, because I could not play the game until now. Before you buy, check the forum and see all those threads about launching problems. This game is picky, so be warned!I guess you need a lot of patience to play this game. Took me about two month to get it to even pass the config tool. After about a hundred tries just out of nowhere it miraculously started to run today. When I changed the resolution it just quit and refused to run, but this time I could set it back to 800x600x32 and it actually worked again. It does not look too good, seriously, but I don't dare to mess with the config again. Everything is on best setting just the resolution is not.I tried out the RPG mode, just chapter one. The controls are a bit weird, but I guess with a little practice I can manage. I created a priestess and made her walk around for some time. She was cute, called me darling every once in a while. :)At one point I got butchered by three skeletons. My fault, you shall not stumble through hostile territory without caution. A bit frustrating was the fact, that the autosave had done the last save in the middle of battle so everytime I loaded it was insta death because I could not click that heal button fast enough. Sure there were two earlier saves, but honestly, you load the current one over and over again and try and try. Just this time you're going to be fast enough... well, you won't, so you give it another try... just this one.... you know what I mean. ;)So, I can't say it is a bad game. That would not be fair. But I surely did play better ones. If you get it for a buck just give it a try, you can't do much wrong for such a price. If you are not sure watch others playing it on youtube, that's what I did. I will definately try it again, I want to play all the characters at least once. Just not today...			"

												Not sure if this is really a recommend from me. My reason for keeping a thumbs up though is because I picked it up on a Steam sale for $.99. Everything about this game is just basic. It plays well enough, even though it's pretty damn old by now. There was nothing, in my short playtime, that made me feel good or think, ""Wow that's cool."" After I stoped my first play session I never came back to it again. And that was a few years ago. But hey, it wasn't too expensive and it still runs on modern machines; so that's worth something right?			"

												This game is bad in almost every way a game can be bad. Stability issues, unusable options, key bindings that don't work, crashes, speed-ups and slow-downs, poorly written script, goofy voice acting, bad quests. The list goes on and on. For instance, I played for less than an hour and completed two escort quests, the worst kind of quest available anywhere. Loot is strewn across the game world at random instead of acquired logically. Enemies pose nearly no real threat at all, just click and watch the fight unfold. Very boring, very tedious, and does not run well on modern systems. Do not waste your time or money on this title. It might have been a decent game back in 2003, but it does not hold up today by any stretch of the imagination.			"

The game crashed 3 times within five minutes. When I finally got it working, It felt like I was very detached from the game. It has a point-and-click style for moving, and attacking. I plan on playing more to see if it picks up, but as an initial experience, it's not great. I'm glad I only spent a dollar.			"

It doesn't matter if I hit ""ok"" or ""test resolution"", it just does not work. I've tried everything to fix this, including checking the file integrity on steam. And no, it isn't my pc, because I'm pretty sure if I can run Skyrim on high settings smooth, I can run a game from 2003.			"

												Looks like a good game but won't load past config screen.  I read in forum you can change resolution to 4:3 and tweaks some settings but I'm sorry I'm not going through all that trouble to play one measley game when I have over 100 I've yet played.  Part of a bundle I bought so I didn't miss mutch.  Enjoying Bioshock series and Blades of Glory anyways.  Note:  This does not review the game because I have not played it.  If you have a older machine maybe on Windows XP and running 1024x768 you might not have any trouble loading it.  The game looks good but unable to play with my configuaration so I won't judge a game that I honestly haven't played but there should be a Windows 7 or update patch for this since this game has got some age on it.

Maybe this is meant to show that the hero/protagonist has to work his way up to become something important, but... meh. I couldn't bear to continue with it, and I've played some pretty dull games in my time. Wouldn't recommend.			"

												Dire.Horrible and difficul to configure and when it does run (in a small window) the graphics are from 1990.Terrible voice acting on character creation and that's about as far as I got.Avoid like the plauge unless you're looking for that 90's vibe and perhaps want to sing the song of your people while using the unfriendly configuration screen (which just seems to loop when it crashes).This PC can run all modern games on max resolution for me (1920 x 1080) yet apparently doesn't have enough grunt to run this full screen? Give me a break! Uninstalled. Thank goodness I only payed some 69p for this experience.			"

												Game supports only 4:3 resolutions, while config program tells that it should support 1920x1080. Even the test for HD works, but starting the game itself is a plain fail on HD.Back to 1600x1200 and if starts, only to see a couple of disdappointments. Graphics claim to be 32bit, but they're clearly 16bit. Animations suck like hell! And then your character (who looks aready very ugly) is babbling just a bit which is hardly to understand what (s)he is babbling. And while at voiceacting - that's also one of the letdowns. IMO they should have dropped it completely (also hard to understand what they're saying) and should just have used the balloon text (which you have to toggle in interface instead of sound where it normally resides).Thank God I only paid €0.60 for this piece of crap!

												I am not averse to smaller, simpler RPGs but Knightshift is just outdated and boring. It takes forever to get going (two intro movies) and it starts out too slowly. After half an hour i was level 2, had changed equipment twice and had beaten a handful of creatures. That should've taken ten minutes at most. It's pretty impressive looking for an indie game from 2003 but that's about all there is.			"

												Do you like Real Time Strategy? or are Role Playing Games your preference… Why not try both genres in one? … or even both separately? … In one game: KnightShift! In a mystical world beyond fantasy and imagination, where corruption and disaster go hand in hand, not all is as it seems. A dark adventure begins in the RPG part: divided into eight chapters of dungeons, rare treasures, very strange companions and gruesome opponents. Eight individually equipped characters are available to you in this action packed role-play. It is now down to you, the player to form your hero and help him to fame and victory. As soon as Gallus has been freed he can get on with job of bringing Prince John back to his father's kingdom. Strategy begins here: with the support of your loyal subjects the fight against the powers of evil begins.			"
