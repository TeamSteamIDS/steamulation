												At first I really wasnt sure if this was going to be a big waste of time and money but to my surpriseit can deliver a really entertaining time killer.THE GOOD 1: very realistic .. well at least to a civilian.2:  complex game mechaincs to those of us who dont like our games dumbed down.3: strong sense of acomplishment when missions are completed 4: good variety of operations consisting of single missions, campaign and training.5: A good challenge but far from impossible once youve learned your submarine skills. 6: Lots of replay value.7: non linear game play do it your own style quiet or loud just be aware of critical objectives you are rewarded or punished based off your operating decisions.THE BAD1: No real training or explaining on how to actually operate ANYTHING ON YOUR SUB!making life very difficult in the beginning. BTW I hope you learned how to use sonar and stealth tactics for a submarine in high school otherwise its very touch and go for the first 5 hours.2: A hard sell for full price 20 dollars based off its a 1997 game best to find it on sale.FINAL I give this game a  7.0  A great simulator , if you can take the time experiment and  read all the manuals and figuar out how a nuclear sub actually works you will find this game has a surprisingly high fun factor even for a 1997 game.

												This is a great submarine simulation game.  I felt right in the middle of the action, and there are definitely some tense moments, i.e. evading enemy torpedoes and stealthily sneaking up on an enemy submarine.  The game has a steep learning curve at first if you've never played anything like it before.  I recommend reading the captain's manual if you want some early pointers on how to learn the basics.  Some of the missions take multiple hours to complete, and I found it easy to lose myself in the game.  It's got simplistic graphics, as it is an older game.  On Windows 7 platforms, I've noticed that the game doesn't run as reliably as older versions of Windows, i.e. random crashing in the middle of missions for no reason.  That seems to be one of the only downfalls that I have come across.  Other than that, definitely a thumbs up.			"

												A classic in the genre. The missions may be canned - with no random variation aside from random box patrols and units reacting to you - but the sim gameplay itself is great. When it came out, it pretty much blew the competition out of the water. You know, just like the ships in the game itself.The graphics and presentation are still good and realistic for a 1997 game; although obviously dated it has a certain charm. Just wait until it's on sale so you actually get decent value, and yes, it does go on sale. Kudos to Valve and Sonalysts for having it on Steam in the first place, too.Gameplay consists of navigating your vessel, an improved Los-Angeles class submarine, and completing objectives such as sinking enemy ships and laying mines.To get a general idea of what it's like, this is a boat that sails under the water. Your primary means of figuring out where the Hell you are involves bouncing sound waves off everything - which is called sonar as it sounds cool - because you sure as schei√üe don't have any windows. You may feel that this isn't as easy as navigating in a regular boat (well, regular boat simulator anyway) and you'd be right.And that's just basic sailing. When you're facing enemy vessels, it can get pretty tense. Overall, when you learn enough to get the hang of it, 688(I) can make for a good challenge. You can also upgrade your sub and your crew between missions with earned points, and change your weapons loadout while in port.I have not played far enough into the campaign missions yet to really judge the plot or tone of the game. Suffice to say however, 688(I) Hunter-Killer is a hardcore military simulation. You don't play this just for the story. From what I've gathered so far, it's strait-laced enough that you'll probably feel like an actual Navy officer - any moral objections you may encounter will have to come from your own self. There is the option of ending your mission at any point, which if you haven't completed many objectives will get you chewed out. You cannot, however, talk back or go AWOL. Also of note is the scenario editor, as well as the number of custom scenarios available on fansites.The submarine controls themselves are sensibly laid out and pretty easy to use once you know how. Of course, this game made the Guinness Book of World Records 1999-2000 as 'Most Intellectually Challenging PC Game', and while I probably wouldn't call it the hardest game in existence anymore, I'd say the difficulty still holds up. It's certainly far from impossible and pretty fun to learn the ship's systems, but operating them under pressure is another thing. Having the assistants enabled helps.You unfortunately cannot access any proper tutorials in-game. There are tutorial missions available to play, short tutorial videos in the game directory accessible from the splash screen and a comprehensive PDF manual is included. You will need to read the manual - I recommend putting it on a tablet to consult while underway.All that said, 688(I) was released in 1997. It may not run that well on modern systems, even if it runs well on mine (Windows 10 64-bit). The naval combat packs it comes in are rather pricey, too; you should wait for a sale.The Steam version of 688(i) is the latest patched version, 1.08, initially a re-release of the game in 2006. Random fun fact: this game used to be published by EA.This game's music is of special mention. It's around 8 or so MIDI tracks, and it's the sort of techno-suspense stuff you might hear from a more subdued Tom Clancy film. You can download it here and get some of the songs from the game remixes in MP3 format from here[community.simtropolis.com]. They're very good and very appropriate.You can also watch the special promo/press kit/B roll video they release here[archive.org]. Pretty fascinating glimpse into development, plus some gameplay on a period computer that's laughably slow compared to today.			"

												This is more of an educational program than a video game.I know what you're going to say next: ""Educational? You mean I have to learn stuff? I don't want that. I just want to jump into an FPS and play deathmatch with my buds"".If that is your mindset then I'm afraid this game is not for you. What you have here is a highly detailed technical simulation of a modern-day fast attack submarine. When I say ""modern"" I mean 1997, but I don't think they've changed much since then. And don't let the original release date throw you off; this ""game"" is much more sophisticated than any games made today. And for 1997 it's a virtual milestone. The development company (Sonalysts) actually specializes in combat sims and they have worked closely with the U.S. Navy in producing training programs. They have developed other sub sims, which are also on Steam. The point being: they know their stuff!If you want something with more visual flair then I would highly suggest any WW2 sub sim, especially any of the Silent Hunter games. As a matter-of-fact they are a must for anyone wanting to break into this genre. They will provide a basic understanding of how submarines work, and you won't be banging yourself over the head for making small mistakes. They are incredibly fun, and easy to jump in and learn too. Those will actually make learning the Sonalysts sims that much easier to comprehend. I'm no expert, however, and I only write this review as a student trying to help other students learn. WW2 sub sims have taught me a lot on a subject that, until a few months ago, I knew absolutely nothing about. Now I'm reading books on the subject and technical manuals as well.Of course this is not something for everyone. It's very technical and there are no in-game tutorials to help you out. Even die-hard sub sim fans may be intimidated by the complicated interface. You won't find any hand-holding here, and you won't see much in the way of visual representation. When you're in a real submarine you are actually swimming blind, and this game captures that as accurately as it can. Luckily it comes with quite a lengthy manual so you better study that hard before playing. I'm still new to sub sims myself, but I'm moving at such a fast rate and I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I've downloaded the game's manual to an e-reader to study while I'm offline and it's very insightful.This game is for those players who want to take sub simulation to the next level. But does a learning curve mean that the game is not fun? Of course not, but the education is part of the reward.			"

												This is a game that comes from a time when one had to have skill to win. If you like 90s graphics for explosions, a necessity to read online forums to understand the game's mechanics, and an overall love for strategey at sea; this is the game to play. I've been playing it since 1999, and I don't see a reason to stop.			"

												If you like submarins, this is a nice game to learn all about them.The drawback is TIME. Everything goes so slowly and, you are so blind that the game can be really frustrating.Maybe a good simulation but, a game needs something else to be attractive to the player.Buy if you like submarins and the price is a bargain			"

												It lacks an in depth tutorial and there's not much to be found online regarding gameplay mechanics.  Once you get the hang of it, it gets fun.  Expect to spend 10 hours or so getting the hang of it, if not more.  This game is fairly bug-free.  It has a campaign which is 'ok'.  The campaign debriefings are intentionally cheesy, I think it sort of loses some realism there but it's also a bit funny, so it's a wash.  It could stand to use some extra features that were included with the sequel, Sub Command, but I wouldn't recommend that one due to the overwhelming bugs.			"

												I have been waiting to play this game for the last 10 years. I one time played this game when I was about 10. I didn't know how to play or what to do. Now finally I can play this game on my computer again. It is just as I remembered, a hard core submarine simulator. Very accurate to how to actually use sonar and ship manuvers. I have had my navy friends help me in this game learn how to use the sonar and launch torpedoes. This is a great game and a lot of fun. You just have to be patient and willing to learn to be good. Great game 9/10			"

												1: Spend a few hours reading the manual and doing tutorial missions.2: Spend half an hour staring at sonar while trying to figure out what you're looking at-3: Fire a torpedo and make evasive maneuvers.4: Wait 15 minutes.5: Realize you tried to sink a whale.8/10, very slow but also very satisfying in the end.

												I played Sub Command during my undergraduate years and was hooked to it. Played it all night long every Saturday at my dorm. I then bought Dangerous Waters which improved upon it. I never tried 688(I) Hunter/Killer although I heard it was an excellent game. That is until today. On my first try I fell in love with it. The gameplay feels better than both Sub Command and Dangerous Waters primarily due to the better interface design. They even put 3D layout of the submarine interior and a 3D view that's uniquely attached to one of the stations available to you. Somehow, this makes the gameplay shines a lot more than it does in Sub Command or Dangerous Waters.Truly a classic that's very much still enjoyable in the present day. If commanding a modern submarine piques your interest this is a must buy still even in 2016. They made games like no other back then. To think that a 1997 game still has a lot to offer even in 2016 is a testament to how well thought this game is.Yes, it is superior to Sub Command and Dangerous Waters in gameplay, except for the graphics and number of playable platforms. The mechanics of the games are identical just the addition of 3D interior layout, no matter how simple, and the simplicity of contact management make 688(I) Hunter/Killer that much more realistic and enjoyable. They don't even bother to give you the 'Turns per Knot' values of commercial ships as it should be since otherwise the U.S. Navy would have to record every single merchant, commercial, and civilian ship's engine. Maybe they do record the engine signature of the biggest commercial ships but I don't think they record every single  ship inclucding its TPK value. Smaller nations may also use smaller TPK database or even none at all. The 'Turns Per Knot' value is probably related to the design of propeller and the ship's tonnage as well as the ship's keel/hull design. So, the limited 'Turn Per Knot' data in the game made it even more realistic in my opinion.The only downside is there are not that many enemy ships and submarines for you to target.Gameplay description:My first game was enemy boomer (SSBN) hunting. Couple rebel controlled Delta IVs are in dsignated Op Area and I need to kill them. Intelligence suggests that they may be escorted by enemy SSNs and that it is best to leave the SSNs alone until I get the boomers to avoid alerting the rebels into launching their ICBMs. Early in game, I detected a Victor II SSN and I couldn't help but to plot the best solution I could do and launched two Mk. 48 ADCAP at it. The ADCAPS sank the SSN much to my joy.My second try was the campaign. I am ordered to approach Cuba's south coast to disembark a SEAL team. Intelligence suggests couple Koni FFGs or the likes patroling the area. There is also a Foxtrot missing from port. So, I approach Cuba's south coast under thermal layer. There was quite a traffic of commercial shipping above. Couple hours later, my sonar detected a strong contact above layer and it was the Foxtrot. I couldn't avoid it as we were just too close. The layer had concealed it from me and I had been to them. But not anymore. The order was weapon tight and to only fire when fired upon. So I reduced speed but the Foxtrot detected me and decided to turn around to tail me while pinging me. How embarrasing..........The SEAL team will be captured if I disembark them couple hours from now.			"

												This is a simulator sub marine game which is kind of outdated in graphic and gameplay. Its hard to just pick up and learn this type of gameplay right away but after time you might get a hang of it. Its a game were you pretty much find the enemy and try to kill them before they kill you. The graphics are old and kind of blocky. The music I had to turn off because it was kind of getting annoying. Its an alright game. If you get it in a pack then that's the best way to obtain a game like this.  "

												Amazing childhood memory. I know a guy who served on a 688i, he sadly hasn't had time to check this out yet. :(That being said, it's incredibly realistic, albeit a tad cartoony being that it's from the late 90s, early 2000s. There is no tutorial, no training mission per se, but there is a manual that will explain the first mission to you step by step. You'll need the manual to learn the game but it's really fun once you do.While I was learning, this game made me feel like Rex from Toy Story when Buzz first comes around:""Say, what's that button do?""10/10 will fail the first mission again			"

												This is an extremely old game based on a submarine simulator in a war scenario. You are essentially taking control of a submarine in midst of combat. It is definitely not a game for everybody. It is a realistic simulator of what a person in a submarine needs to do in order to survive and fight. It isn't your casual arcade game where you're controlling a submarine from the outside swimming around blowing up battleships. It definitely takes a while to get used to because there's a lot that needs to be learned when first playing. The tutorials do give you an insight of what does what but for something so complex it doesn't explain 'too well' in my opinion. I still have trouble playing the game and can't really enjoy it even after looking at tutorials. That being said, it's recommended for people who enjoy realistic simulators (that do not include jokes such as Grass Simulator or Goat Simulator). It is relentless and confusing as all hell but if you get the controls down I'm sure it isn't half bad.It isn't my cup of tea but it does pose as a pretty realistic simulator, although not graphically. As a game, I do not recommend it but as a simulator, it is pretty good at what it is. As for recommendations, I can't really put it on either side but every review is subjective and based on my experience, it wasn't as enjoyable as I really wanted it to be. But to be fair: It is good for people who enjoy realistic simulators (specifically submarines and war), but is not good to be seen as a casual game TL;DR: Refer to blue text.			"
