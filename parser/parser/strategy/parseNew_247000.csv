												TL;DR:  Ignore the meta-critic score; ignorant reviewers shouldn't be allowed to review games.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Talisman: Digital Edition is an amazing adaptation of the original boardgame. I could write several pages about why this game is enjoyable to play, but there are a million reviews that can give you that.  Instead, let me explain why all of the negative reveiwers are wrong:1 - Most of the negative reviewers can't read.  I don't know how to put this politely, but it seems that 9/10 of the negative reviews I see about this game come down to the fact that the reviewer didn't understand how a certain card or area worked.  For example, they'll say things like, ""I couldn't use my Psionic Blast card in the middle of combat????"""" ... when the card clearly states when you can use it.  I'm sorry, but if you can't even read, you shouldn't be reviewing games.2 - Many of the negative reviewers are 'hung up' on the game's randomness; in their minds, this means that the game does not ""require any skill"".  Several reviews talk about the random nature of the dice rolls and card draws--you even have YouTube personalities getting uptight over the randomness--and they all try to make the same, idiotic argument:  that the game isnt' as ""good"" as, say, Dota 2, or League of Legends (where skill is required).  Of course, what they are trying to say is that, in their estimation,  the game lacks strategic depth.  This is, of course, entirely false.  While the game may be easy to play (not requiring much skill), Talisman has layers upon layers of strategic depth, in that the entire game is built around choice-based risk management and knowledge of the game.  You see, these YouTubers who have NO FAMILIARITY WHATSOEVER with the game--and thus no strategic understanding of what they should be doing--and are just throwing dice and drawing cards, at random, and then simply pronouncing the game ""dumb"", ""dull"", or ""without merit""--they're all just talking out of their asses.  They're like chimpanzees poking at a keyboard, as they make one bad decision after another.  And because the game isn't, say, League of Legends, they simply pass it off as crap.  Meanwhile, they raise up games like Hearthstone, etc.,  even though they are equally abstract and are driven by a similar kind of randomness.  3 - Talisman is difficult for many reviewers to even classify, much less actually review well, and for a very specific reason.  On the surface, the game is ""abstract"", much in the same way that other boardgames, like Monopoly, are abstract.  The game board is an abstract ""construct"" that you move around by random dice rolls.  At the same time, you are playing a discreet character, in an almost RPG fashion, with spells, abilities, statistics, inventory, followers, etc.  These two aspects of the game, when combined, seem to confuse many reviewers who are simply incapable of appreciating the game as a whole.  They tend to focus on one of the game's aspects, while ignoring the other (or getting confused by it), and then lay all kinds of criticisms without looking at the whole game.  These are reviewers who simply cannot ""pair"" the RPG aspect with the abstract, boardgame aspect, so they simply trash the game without a second thought.  I'm sorry, but if you're too stupid to understand a game's overall design, you shouldn't be allowed to review it.Don't even get me started on the negative reviewers/monkeys who can't figure out the UI.  I mean ... really?  The game can be played on an iPad, but you can't figure out how to use the UI?  If nothing else, that tells you what kind of reviewer you're dealing with.4 - The base game has its flaws, but with DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a really great game.  Some reviewers complain about the game's standard ending--and, I would have to admit, the standard ending, in its own way, is rather lacking, and it can certainly take a while for the game to conclude.  There are options to make the game end faster, but of course the negative reviewers again fail to mention (or even see) this.  More than anything, though, it's worth noting that, the game's ample amount of DLC provides a metric ton of content, from 20+ new characters to play, additional game boards/regions, NPC's, hundreds of new cards, items, etc.--as well as dozens of new endings, both revealed and unrevealed.  And more are coming, as Nomad works to ""finish"" and/or round out the rest of the game, so that it matches the full boardgame (with all expansions) developed by Fantasy Flight Games.To judge Talisman WITHOUT the DLC--which EVERYONE knew was coming--is just a huge disservice to the game.  I understand that reviewers are tasked with reviewing the base game on its own merit, but really anyone who is familiar with the board game will tell you that to review the base game alone is just a waste of a review.  With DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a great, very enjoyable, game, and any reviwer who ""trashed"" the base game--knowing that it was basically ""unfinished"", in a sense--is just ignorant, in my opinion.  They could at least mention the fact that DLC changes the base game completely.  Of course, none of these negative reviewers ever come back to re-review the game, with all of the DLC.  Like every good tabloid ""writer"", they're simply happy to skewer an easy target, and just move on.  It's shameful, really.  Anyway ....If you are a boardgame fan and are thinking about getting Talisman, and are ""on the fence"" because of all of the negative reviews:  Don't worrry.  Don't listen to them.  Just get the game.  And get the DLC as well.  It's well worth it.  The negative reviews are largely written by people who can't read, who only played the base game, and are so used to playing FPS games, MOBA's, etc., that they don't even know what to make of Talisman.  Their reviews are crap.			"

												Good old Talisman.. a board game, which could go on over days and in my childhood rarely found a real winner, ´cause we mostly killed each other, before anyone could reach the crown over and over again ;)So you need some time and patience if you wanted to play a session and this is in some ways is also true for the pc game.For once the game is still under constand improvement/development, as new characters and add-ons are released on a steady base, so the devs are also constantly working on bugs as well as gameplay improvements.The conversion from boardgame to pc is actually quite good and at the current state (including the Reaper, Frostmarch, Dungeon expansions) there is enough diversity to do several games, without always having the same characters/events.While especially with the AI, there are still quite a few bugs (no wonder, due to the wide possibility of actions one can take) it is working well enough, as is the multiplayer part which offers quite some possibilities, which rules the host will allow (and hopefully will soon get a save game function, as these games can have quite some duration, just like the board game).The graphics are well done, the sound is ok.So in the end i´m looking forward to the things still to come and enjoy the one or other session of Talisman (but would strongly suggest to wait on a sale for the Season pass, which brings some much needed variety).

												This game is the proof that Artificial Intelligence will never thrive on the human mind. We are resilient, we are focused, we keep on playing the objective instead of mindlessly hoarding items for the rest of our days. But Talisman isn't meant to be played against the AI.It's an incredibly fun game if you have at least two friends to play with. Please buy this game so I can pretend I have friends. It has huge replay value, a wide variety of characters and game modes, and even more if you buy the DLC, which isn't necessary, but I've done it anyways, because who gives a damn, it's my money, bro, don't tell me what to do.It's a lot like Game of Thrones, not in the sense that you can have sex with your siblings, but more like you can furtively ruin the game for other players out of nowhere, like it's Wedding day. You can also do that thing Bran does, but instead of becoming a cool dire wolf, you become a frog. You can still beat the game as a frog. God, I love this game.			"

												Another Dice and Board game that bring me back many years....When I first moved from china to canada 20 years ago.. 4 Games catched my attension instantly.1. Dungeon and Dragons. 2. Vampire the Masquerade3.  Magic the Garthering4. Talisman...Those games didn't need you sit infront of a Console or Computer.. Just grab a bunch of friends and start playing. They can go on for hours and hours without tiring and great test of your interlect and luck.I learned a lot of english from those games and without them.. I would have much bigger trouble blend in to english speaking society in school and in community.Sadly years has past.. The only game I still play out of the 4 is Magic the garthering and I can only do it with a few friends whenever I go back to canada.Today my passion is in computer games. And I been collecting and playing more games then ever before...Imaging my surprise that I see Talisman for sell on steam! The day i brought this game.. is the same day that i brought season pass. This game plays exactly like how it was 20 years ago and suck up an insane amount of time each game...6 player.. 1 board.. May the Dice God Smile upon you!9/10 for perfect adeptation, wonderful music and even OP characters and cards!			"

Do you love:   *board games?   *fantasy settings?   *roleplaying Games?If you answered ""yes"" to more than one of the above, go ahead and buy this game while it's on sale. You'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. To everyone else, I must say...Talisman is a hard game to recommend. My partner and I enjoy playing and we laugh hard at the antics which play out over the board, but there are still way too many things not working as intended, too many bugs, too many instances where the user interface doesn't do what you may want it to do.They're charging a lot of money for content that isn't even created yet, and the stuff that is already there often does not work as advertised. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but as yet it still acts way too much like a beta version for Nomad to be charging full price.I can recommend this game only to hardcore fans of the genre like myself. For everyone else, I'd have to say... wait for them to finish the game and maybe get it on sale at a deep discount.			"

												I grew up playing Talisman the boardgame, so it is a real piece of family nostalgia. I'd heard about the digital edition quite a while ago, when it first entered the Steam greenlight process (originally as Prologue, the single player edition). I've followed the progress up to the point where it was released though Steam Early Access and then jumped at the chance to get it. I've had a real blast playing both the Digital Edition (just against AI opponents at the moment) and playing the Prologue (single player variant game). My wife also expressed interest in playing it again (either Board version or Digital edition) so we gave local multiplayer a try using Steam Big Picture on her laptop, hooked up to our TV, and passing a mouse between us. It was a lot of funIf you've ever played the boardgame, then I highly recommend the digital version. The game is faithful to the original in virtually every respect, with the addition of the Prologue single player edition which makes for a very enjoyable single player experience. There's no online multiplayer in the early access version yet, but it is coming in time for the full release of the game.If you've never played the boardgame, but are interested in fantasy themed adventure boardgames, then track down the Demo of Talisman Prologue (http://www.talisman-game.com/prologuedemo/) and give it a try.

												I have only played the Video game version, I never even heard of Talisman as a kid probably because we were all into Dungeons and Dragons original paper and dice game. I have played extensively on This Digital Deluxe version of Talisman now and can render the following Analysis:Keeping in mind that it IS still in Pre-release stage overall it is an enjoyable gaming experience one can play with the whole family (Up to 4 players). Pros: 1.) Simple to learn and play2.) Ease of use - the game is entirely mouse driven. One can play with the keyboard sitting on the desk, feet kicked up ... using only the mouse as you relax in your favorite chair.3.) In-game voice chat which can be muted by individual player4.) Fantasy based ... always a plus :)5.) Family Friendly - as long as you are not overly religious (Devils, demons, angels, undead etc are contained within) 6.) A Mandatory Random setting!!! The host can set the game to Classic mode where no perks (Runes) can be used and all class choices are random, this is an option missing from other games (DoTP needs this badly) Cons:1.) Glitches up terribly in Multi-player if someone leaves the game normally locking it up. (SP w/Bots works fine)2.) Game glitches if you alt/tab out to do something else3.) Re-playability isn't that good. It takes a couple of games to see all the spells and Adventure cards but once you have run through them once or twice, things tend to get repetative. They definitely need a wider range of spells and adventure cards.4.) Class balance isn't that good. Some classes are very noticeably more powerful than other classes and have abilities that give much greater advantages over other players (Prophetess and assassin come to mind)5.) Using AI's in Multi-player runs the risk of hanging the game up. Bots usually get hung up in the City at the alchemist and they go into an infinite loop and the game cannot progress from there but as of 1-7-2014 using all humans in MP games hasn't botched up unless someone rages quits .... which is common if the game is not going their way.Overall I would recommend this game as I expect all these problems to be worked out before its final release version.

												The short and sweet:  If you like Talisman, you'll very likely enjoy the Digital Edition.This game is exceptional when it comes to reviews - it's not actually a video game as such, but a digitalized board game.  So, you'll find that the majority of negative reviews are from people who don't like Talisman.  Well duh.  That's not to say all negative reviews are irrellevant.  You just can't trust the meta score for a title like this and people playing a game they already know they'll hate makes for some pretty biased reviews.  The Steam ratings and reviews are generally more reasonable, though you do still see this happening.So, are you new to Talisman?  New to board games in general?  No problem, simple way to see if you might enjoy it.  Youtube.  Go watch gameplay of the actual board game and/or the digital version.  If you find yourself wanting to take one of the seats and play - then this game is for you.  If it looks boring and you lose interest fast (as many people do with board games) then look elsewhere.  Lastly, I'm sure there are outliers.  People who like the board game but hate the digital version.  But, again - that should become obvious to you as you watch it played.I think Nomad has done an excellent job translating the game.  And as someone who has moved half-way across the world from their board game friends, it's a great way to keep in touch and get my fix.  Happy gaming!			"

												Digital edition of classic fantasy RPG board game, Talisman. If you know the board game and like it, think no more, you need this...what if you don't know Talisman? I still recommend it! Heed this, though: old school board games tend to have different sensibilities than modern digital games and it may be bit too random for your taste. If you can't stomach being on top of the world only for your game to be turned into ashes in your mouth because of no fault of your own or genius of your opponents, but rather pure chance of bad dice rolls... This may not be for you.That being said, people tend to look overly superficially and claim the game requires no skill. It's not true. Knowing what you're doing is half the battle. Yes the base rules are relatively straightforward, but there are many intricate synergies between your character and what's happening on the board, and seizing opportunities for such synergies is crucial to survival. More experienced or intelligent players *will* have enormous advantage over others.But yeah, the other half of the battle is pure random rolls and there's always a small chance your next card will be something like a basilisk that rolls a double and you just simply die there and then, on the spot, game over. Or if someone makes grim reaper pay you a visit and you roll 1, pay fate to reroll, and still roll 1... Amygdala deeply rustled and cortisol city, you can get enraged and it is not pretty.Anyway...It is quite a boon that there exist multiplayer scene for this game. Maybe not 24/7, but in reasonable European or American hours, it's not that hard to find a game. If you love the board game but have nobody to play with, digital version comes to the rescue and helps you to relive all those painful childhood memories ;) And all you need is base game; if any of the players who join your game have expansions, the host can turn them on, which is very nice. If your connection drops, AI plays for you until you rejoin but yes, you can rejoin, which is nice, too (though AI is only as smart as it has been programmed to be, if you know what I mean - live players can easily outsmart it but also make some stupid mistakes)The bad things? Very occasionally the game crashes unrecoverably for some reason (even if you rejoin it will crash again), but I guess it's no better than rolling a double on a basilisk or double 1s on grim reaper so I wouldn't worry too much about it and there's always hope it will be fixed. If you're a salty person, the game is generally not for you, as mentioned earlier.UI sometimes is not intuitive e.g. you can be quite puzzled when and how to cast a spell like Weaken or Freeze, or get confused and reroll a die when you actually wanted to pick one of the two outcomes in some situations.. only experience can help you here and hopefully fellow players if you ask nicelySee you on the Crown of Command, adventurer			"

												I've been playing Talisman since the original came out in the early 1980's. While my preference - out of comfortable familiarity - is the original, the modern streamlined version is just as good and certainly removes the hours of rules conflicts that inevitably arise.The computer version does this one better by enforcing a standardized ruleset, making games last (usually) less than an hour and a half. The computer's turns can be sped up, too, improving game speed even more. Purists will enjoy the classic rules while people who find the basic rules too hard can improve their characters through progressive upgrades. Numerous achievements also offer arbitrary if fun goals along the way.			"

												Genre - Games Workshop Boardgame conversionThe aim is simple be the first of four characters to get to the centre so you can slowly drain your opponents life, whilst trying to stop the other players doing the same. You can play against AI, local humans or online covering all bases. Items need to be found and kept hold of to get past certain points adding strategy. Battle is based on a strength or craft stat with a roll of the dice, winning battles can earn you stat increases. Character abilities are varied enough to tip situations to your advantage meaning you will want try different classes out. It is fun to go up against the AI and they offer a reasonable challenge without being perfect players! I have played two full games losing the first against three random(?) thieves but winning the second against a more varied group as the warrior (as always a recommended starter class!). You will gain runestones to give you a small advantage in later games (you can buy these but I would suggest earning them instead). I have now invested in the first expansion as the prices and playability seem fair even without a sale. Basically if you like Board Games with a Fantasy setting then get it!			"

												If you enjoy the boardgame this will appeal to you, but:I can not recommend to buy it.At the moment (Oct. 2014):- Gamebreaking bugs (Targeting of spells, followers who refuse to use their skill correctly, game Mechanics/activated abilities repeating endlessly instead of working only one time)- AI slow to move- UI that hinders more than it is helping- online quits destabilize the gameIf they fix this, it might become close to the real boardgame.But so far the developers seem more interested in producing DLC even while the main game is riddled with bugs.Read a little in the bugforum!Might give you a broader view of the game.

												Talisman: Digital Edition is an interesting game, utilizing a combination of gaming boards and cards, similar to hearthstone. It can be played as a single player with up to 3 opponents, or as a multiplayer game of up to 4 players. Having not played the actual boardgame I am unfamiliar with any differences in rules; However, as a digital board game, Talisman feels very much like a board game I would have grown up playing. I'm actually feeling nostalgic while I play it, perhaps I'll go break out my old magick deck and have a go later. Visually, Talisman: Digital Edition looks as one would expect a digital board game to look, but the detail is nice. I had fun playing this and for someone who enjoys board games, even digital ones I recommend trying this one out. I should point out you can play as one of many different classes, some of which you need to purchase to unlock, just fyi.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. I have only played the board game once before, but it is great to have a online version of the game.However, I have never been able to get through an entire online game without someone's client crashing, booting players from the game and having them replaced by AI with no way to return. This is extremely frustrating when you are 30+ minutes into a game, and you have to start over.For this, I do not recommend this game until this issue is fixed.In the meantime, the local mode does allow people to play in the same room, in a hot seat style.

												I feel compelled to write this review after reading a bunch of negative reviews on here. This game is fantastic! Simply put. 10/10 for a recreation of the board game. With many expansions, characters to choose, rules that can be turned on/off, and  many, many different endings/conditions for winning, Talisman is a new game each time you play. Some of the reviews are "" just roll a die and decide to go left or right..durrrr""... I wouldn't expect that traveller to ever reach the crown. There is heavy strategy that you can implement to put you atop the crown, or in the best position to do so. You can also not care about strategy at all and just have fun playing the game and the RnG of it all. However, if you are playing with seasoned players, be sure to try to make good decisions, calculate carefully, and take your opponents tendencies into consideration as well in order to succeed. Overall, this is a wonderful game of skill, luck, and fantasy all mixed into one. I hope you find this review helpful and I hope to see you in the quest for the Crown!			"

												One of the best boardgame-to-PC adaptations I've seen in years! I would happily recommend this to anyone, regardless of whether one was a fan of the original tabletop Talisman.Talisman: Digital Edition has HUGE replay value, owing to the random nature and variety of card draws, and the large assortment of character classes available. Each class allows (and often requires) you to approach the game in a different way. You can also customize various game rules before starting up a new game, which adds to the variety and replayability.The DLC is also strongly recommended. Each expansion adds a massive number of new enemies, events, items, classes, and additional rules. The DLC in this game is very definitely worth every penny! "

												To  buy or not to buy. If you have ever played Talisman the board game before you already know the answer. However if you havn't and you like fairly long games that have a progressive character turn base style, then you will like this game. I have played the board game for going on 20 years now and have all the boards and expansions from the version 2 line and love them. Many a roleplayer has played this game and in my opinion is one of the best and detailed board games out there.			"

												If you like Talisman, this is a great adaption of the board game!  The appeal of this game as a digital copy of the board game is twofold:  The computer manages all the fidely cards and components (plus no clean up or set up), and this digital edition is WAY cheaper than than the physical game.  Playing games with AI can be great too if you have no friends.If you have no idea what Talisman is but are intrested in this game, let me lay it out for you:  Talisman is a RPG in a box.  You pick one of a million characters with unique abilites and attributes and race against other characters to reach the 'crown of command', a game space that slowly kills all the other players.  If you kill everyone else, you win.  The thing about the crown is that its locked away in an inhosptable wasteland that your weak character will not be able to reach right away.  As a result, you gotta level up, fighting monsters, encountering events, and PVPing other players.  Awesome stuff.This game is not without its faults though.  This game is extremely RNG based.  Everything is based on dice rolls.  There is strategy in the game, sure, but alot of the time so many random things you can't control are happpening that you kind of have to just roll with it.  This is essentially the heart and soul of the game, so if this is unappealing to you, this game might not be for you.  Now personally, normally I hate games that are overly based on luck, but Talisman is great because it never pigeon holes you into situations.  Every turn you have a choice on which direction to go, where on the board(s) to travel, who to interact with, etc and these choices give you an illusion of freedom and often a way to blame yourself for your bad luck.  Went into a cave and got ♥♥♥♥ed by a dragon at level one?  Should have gone to town, your opponent would have got the dragon instead.  Now, this game does have a 'fate' system that lets you reroll dice, giving you some control over your luck, but it can be hard sometimes to know when is best to reroll and sometimes you can just reroll bad rolls again(dice rolls are seeded at the begining of the game, so reloading doesnt work).This game does a great job of always giving you something to do and work towards, and the various expansions give lots of variety and alternative scenarios.  If you get this game I highly recommend some of the expansions (get the season pass on sale to get all future expansions cheap), specifically the reaper and the corner boards. Before rounding out this review I just want to provide a shout out to the company that made this digital adaption, nomad games.  Originally I thought this company was just porting this game from the ios and wouldn't care for the quality of the game post release.  How wrong I was.  Not only do they participate on the forums frequently and respond to posters, but they have even developed and distributed free content based on customer critisism.  This is very rare these days and exremely praiseworthy.Objectively Talisman isn't the greatest game ever made, but I seriously love this game regardless.  It may be luck heavy but the experience of travelling around the board, collecting loot and getting stronger before racing to the end against other players is great.  Laugh at your friends as the dice ♥♥♥♥ them, then cry out in amazement as they get the luckiest card draws, but most of all enjoy the ride and the emerging narrative that the game provides.			"

												Pretty good implementation of the board game. If you are a fan of the original and crave some old school RNG-ridden and nostalgia-coloured Talisman action, this game will provide a satisfying experience, especially since you can play solo (with bots). AI is ok, although uneven - sometimes surprisingly competent, sometimes disappointingly dumb. Digital version is obviously only a shadow of the social tabletop experience, but certainly beats the cardboard version when it comes to game setup time. ;)About the only thing I do not like is the reactionary spellcasting system (casting spells as reaction to certain events), which is rather clunky - although I have no idea how it could be done better and not bog the game down.

												This game was a blast and provides a fun way to play the board game without the hassle of trying to get all the equipment together to setup, and then breaking it down again after the game.  Very entertaining versus the AIs, and even more so with devious, thinking individuals at the helm.  I enjoyed the heck out of the game.  I wouldnt be playing 24/7 but its a nice switchup for a bit of fun with some of my other friends that also enjoyed playing this game table top.Updated after purchasing all XPACs.Recently with the additions of all of the expansion packs, I have experienced NUMEROUS errors/glitches/and bugs playing the game. Considering that the game can run upwards of 4 to 5 hours for a group of 4 that are enjoying themselves, to have the game screw up (client/server crashes for one or all players, yes both have happened to me and my friends) and be unrecoverable is inexcusable seeing as you lose all your experience for the game. At times, spells do not function as stated, Objects do not work properly (as stated on the card), etc.  Sadly, I am changing my recommendation to NO until the developers address the issues.  I am hoping a developer will read this and address the bugs.Update the the newest xpac:Warhorse STILL does not function properly although I do enjoy the new content.  Again...until SIMPLE game mechanics are corrected, then I refuse a thumbs up.			"

												I absolutely love this game! I played the original board game for years whenever I could get enough people together to sit down and play, which wasn't often. The Digital Edition compares to the original very well. You can play whenever you have the time, and if friends aren't available, you can always play against the computer. The house rules allow you to add certain elements to the game those of us who have played the board game have been using for years. Although runestones were not a part of the original game, they are fun, and if for some reason you don't like using them, they are completely optional.This game is my favorate download from Steam.

												Just as amazing as the physical board game, if not better because there's no fighting over rules or diving into the manual of a rulebook. This gamei s a great way to play with friends new and old, perhaps your gaming group can't make it to the table as often as you'd like? Or you're just looking for something small and light hearted to play in a night, this is the game for you. The core game alone is replayable time and time again, but if that's not enough for you then Workshop games has announced they are going to be bringing all of the physical expansions into this digital edition, so you will never run out of new stuff to play with.

												The AI is woefully inadequate to the point of making the game totally irrelevant.  An AI player had 15 strength, 12 Craft and 3 talisma in its inventory and never attempted to even enter the central ring.  This was while I was at the crown of command.  Speaking of which, I spent more than 1.5 hours at the crown of command before finally dropping the final AI player.  This is the same AI troll with 15 strength, 12 craft, 13 followers and 15 items (after robbing the corpses of the other dead players), and all it did was go back and forth to healers.  I've played the original and we've always had trouble finishing a game in under 4 hours, and I've come to decide that it might not be us that is the problem.  Unless you are only going to play this against human opponents, give this one a miss.			"

												I have a really soft spot for Talisman, just like everyone who spent their childhood playing the older edition. The board game part still holds up, it's fun to play with your friends, taking stabs at each other while racing for the crown of command. Unfortunately that fun is hamstrung by poorly designed UI. Everything about it is clunky and irritating to the point where I can't be bothered to play this anymore. Here's a short rundown of the biggest offenders:* Looking around the map is awkward. You can't quickly zoom in on a location, see it's text or quickly browse the cards that are there. Of course you can do all of that, but it's not intuitive or snappy.* Timers are awkward on spells that have to be cast during certain phases. There's a mechanic where you mark a spell to fire when the trigger is available, but it can sometimes work differently than expected making you target the wrong player. Can be avoided by playing more carefully but it's easy to make a mistake.* Planning your turn while your oponnents are playing is nearly impossible. The camera will constantly snap back to the current player showing them move. You will also be presented with the reverses of cards every time they're making a decision effectively blocking your screen because why not. You can't basically do anything useful while it's not your turn. It plays like a online enabled hot seat game. This leads to a lot of downtime and makes the games drag on unnecessarily.* In-game handling of people dropping out of game for whatever reason is♥♥♥♥♥♥ The AI automatically takes over for anyone who loses connection so unless you react quickly enough and save they will lose their turn to AI doing some dumb stuff. Also there is no way for a player to rejoin without reloading the whole game. To top it all off the game handles reloading a saved multiplayer game automatically without you ever seing any menus (like say 'chose a saved game to load'). It usually works fine but can (and has) lead to losing your savegame. It makes me really sad to recommend meeting for the board game version or playing on tabletop simulator over this version. "

												Excellent game, a perfect port for it's tabletop version where you end up forgetting to move the Reaper! Nomad games is atm still stuggling to fix all the bugs, but as they stand they are somewhat tolerable. Cons: -Very frustrating game. Make plans for when your plans fail out of pure misfortune. Not to the faint of heart.-Spell system is clunky-Requires DLCs to be playable (The standard ""crown of command"" victory condition is UTTERLY HORRIBLE. Notice how many negative reviews complain about it, while not having played any DLC?)Pros:-Will teach you to grow a pair of balls and deal with your frustration. Stop being whiny and keep trying. Builds character.-Vengeance is sweet (Game actually has an achievement for when you take revenge). Just be mindful that your own plans of revenge may grow too time-consuming! Would you rather eliminate a player or win the game?-EXCELLENT DLCs. Really, they are worth every penny atm, as long as nomad doesn't screw up in a future update.-You can be a jester.All in all, a thumbs up!Edit: Grammar.			"

												This game isnt bad for a little casual game. Though I heavily recommend playing it with friends otherwise it could be boring with just AI. But dont get me wrong! It can still be fun alone, but more fun with friends.I like the network ability to play with friends, however you can also do local multiplayer which is nice (Same computer). My favorite is how nicely this works on my Windows 8.1 tablet. Works flawlessly with touch controls (I think the game was designed with touch in mind it works that well).If you're not a fan of what basically is a turn-based fantasy boardgame / cardgame, this game isnt for you. If you like that stuff, I recommend checking this out.			"

												First off I hate Games Workshop and their unscrupulous buisness practices over the past few years. However not knowing they aquired Talisman IP when I purchased it, I do not regret that purchase. They know how to make excellent functioning video games. Dawn of war was great, blood bowl as well, and now Talisman. A faithful conversion from Board game to Video Game, its better in many ways to the board game in that turns fly by without needing to restack the deck you all knocked over or losing cards to the floor. It streamlines everything that needed streamlining and was faithful to everything needing to be faithful. They did good.			"

												I've played the boardgame once before. I've played this version once or twice now. Here's the pros and cons for PC. Personally, I love and I'd recommend it. I actually made a game sort of like this when I was in school, before I knew this existed. Pros -> No lost pieces.> No questionable owner / source of rules if pieces or books are missing. Even comes with a ""house rules"" setting if demanded or the sake of extra fun or defense of some paradigm.> No potential mess, lack of space, or damaged cards and pieces.> Easy tracking of statistics and view.> Easy access to other players.Cons -> Cost: Now you and your friends need to each own a copy, both the game and the DLC. HOWEVER, there is a local multiplayer so this could be ignored if everyone treats it like a ""party game"".> No Freedom: If you wanted to make your own game mode or something of that nature, this isn't a table top simulator; this is actually the game so you would actually be playing the standard iteration.

												A terrific game plagued with negative reviews because of the shakey multiplayer connections. As a single player game, Talisman: Digital Edition is a wonderful and addictive experience. The combination of RPG + board game + card game sounds like a lot of convoluted chaos, but instead, you are presented with a *very* easy to learn masterpiece of a game. The art style of the cards is very professional, every interface is beautifully polished and simplistic so you don't get overwhelmed with information. When you first begin a game, you are presented with an assortment of helpful tutorial tips which explain basically all you need to know, while being able to grasp the rest yourself. There are so many characters to choose from, each with differing and very intriguing special abilities. As far as multiplayer goes, I haven't had any issues playing online with my fiance in the same room, but playing with someone in a different part of the world, that's when I began to have problems. If your main concern is playing online with real people, then perhaps you want to keep your money, unless it's local (hot seat type play) LAN type network. For singleplayer, I 100% recommend this game, it is beautiful with only minor glitches, and you will really wonder where the time went. I'm not normally someone who can sit and play the same game for more than 30 - 60 mins at a time, and I've already sunk over 8 hours into this game in the last three days. I certainly look forward to playing more!			"

												If you like the boardgame this is a very good implementation of the board game.  Do be sure to snag all of hte expansions if you have a chance; they're worth what they charge for them.  If you don't like the board game or don't like board games (or board games with a fair amount of luck in them) then you won't enjoy this game.  A few minor rule changes had to be made for this version, and there are a few cards that are different from the base expansions.  IMO the character packs aren't worth the money if you buy the expansions, since the new characters aren't well-balanced and the expansions have plenty of other charactrs to play.  The AI is weak, although it has improved since launch.  I win nearly all of the time against 3 AI players (you can have up to six players total), but collectively they usually give me a run for my money.  Of course, if you have someone to play this with, that's even better because setting up the board game and its expansions is a chore that the digital edition let's you ignore.  Some interesting house rules are included as options.  Overall, if I wasn't into Talisman: The Board Game I probably wouldn't buy this unless it's offered at a really steep discount.  If you're into the board game, then it's well worth the money, especially if you can catch it on sale.			"

												This game is fun to play, but in my oppinion - and for me personally - I bought the digital version to play when I'm alone. For playing with others, I got the board game, irl-edition.But the AI is messed up. In general tactics, they are great, but it seems the AI is entirely unaware of their ultimate goal in this game. The AI-players don't even try to win, they get around and buff up until they are invincible, but what then they do with their talisman is using the alchemy spell to turn it into one piece of gold. So that's why I do not recommend it. It's hard to enjoy a game of competition when there is none.			"

												I remember begging my older brothers to play Talisman with me back in the '80ies. They rarely did (jerks). If only I could have had AI players back then!A very well done video game version of a classic fantasy board game. In fact, I prefer this version over the actual board game for three reasons:1) No set up or take down (which was very time consuming with the board game).2) You don't need to beg people to play with you.3) You can save it, so you don't have to play for six hour straight (if you don't want to).The only bug I can see, (and maybe it is just me) is that it seems that if you fate a roll you have a 95% chance to get equal or less-than your previous die roll. I once got seven 1's in a row using fate to reroll. (I charged back up at the graveyard.) It didn't matter if it was for movement or combat.Other than that, it has a TON of DLC which makes for a huge amount of replay value. The expansions always follow the same expansion with the board game so if you are familiar with the rules there there is no learning curve.Online multiplayer is a little buggy sometimes if someone has a poor connection, but that is probably universal. And the Steam achievements are pretty hard/fun to accomplish!I have no idea why Metacritic has this game at 51/100, it deserved a much high rating.			"

												Wow. At first i was just browsing around steam for some board games because i've always wanted a digital board game, then saw talisman on sale and caught my attention. At first when i played it i noticed it was very simple and easy to get into, doesnt take much learning for you to get started. The basic principal is just to walk around the board and get stronger until youre powerful enough to get into the middle and win, and along the way you fight monsters and also other a.i/players, its not as complicated as it looks. I managed to get my best friend to buy the game and bamm just like that we were addicted to it and stayed up playing till 3-4am. Bare in mind that a single game from start to finish can take a whiiiiiiilllle. Our average game lasted about 3-4 hours, but u can always save and come back to it later.So far on my end(windows 8.1) i have not encountered any problems whatsoever. But my friend on his Mac kept having crashing issues, such as crashing when i would invite him to play, and also he would he ALWAYS crashes when the game is over, stopping him from getting any experience points.I highly recommend this game if you're slightly interested. Just buy the base game, and if youre wanting for more you can always buy an expansion pack here and there. But if your sure youre gonna like this after watching a few lets plays, then i recomend just getting Season pass, you'll save money in the long run as there are a few more expansion that have not been released yet.and btw, if you end up getting addicted like me, get the app on  your phone. so u can talisman while taking a sh*t!

												Incredibly glitchy.This game would be fun to play with friends if it worked on any concievable level. It crashes randomly for the whole group, and you cannot rejoin if you get dropped. If even one player drops, the game glitches for everyone and won't move forward. Commands will randomly not respond. Sometimes for minutes at a time. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It is, functionally, single player only.			"

												After a decent amount of playtime on this I can say that this is a fairly good adaption of an excellent board game.Talisman is an original luck based adventure game that is immensely fun to play with friends. Even though it is very luck based, there is skill involved. Mainly in the choices you make and the risks you take. But even with the amount of skill you may have in this game you can always still lose from a bad dice roll. While this might seem unfair, you should know that you cannot take this game seriously. It's meant to be fun and it really, really is.However, if you don't like dice in board games, this isn't for you.The amount of online players is slim but it's still possible to get a game as there are many long time players. That said, it's always best to pick a fourpack of this game and play with friends for the best experience.The two current expansions, The Reaper and Frostmarch are worth the extra £8, though I wouldn't pick up the character packs for £1.50 which only give you one bonus character unless they're on sale. [EDIT: Most of the large expansions, such as the Highland and the Dungeon are also completely worth the full price, though I'd still wait as this game goes on sale all the time.]			"

												This game is so... so long. It never ends folks. Imagine it like this. Imagine you are going to see the lord of the rings trilogy, extended edition, for the first time ever. You are so hyped. You pay real money for it. You sit through hours and hours and hours, and you are getting antsy and you need to get up but you really want to hang in there. So you come to the end, and frodo is walking into the volcano with the ring, only to find Toad there, who says ""Sorry Frodo, your princess is in another castle!"". This game is best played later at night, with friends, high, or drunk, so you can mystery science theatre it. Otherwise don't purchase.			"

												This game is SO ADDICTING! I have never played a table-top game (yes i know commence the eye-rolling or jaw dropping)....anyways this game is really fun to play with friends, it's still fun to play with just you and AI but honestly this game was made for 4 player co-op and not single player.This works exaclty like what you would see in a table top game. This game also features the ability to not only play as the various classes each one akind to their own set of playstyles  but also having your own set of rules and regulations for the game. Depending upon how well you set up your game a whole game can go on for hours without end.If you like table top games, having fun with friends, and having time pass by. Get. This. Game. Or at least wishlist it till the game pads out some of it's issues But i still recommend it! "

It can be pricey once everything adds up, so it'd be best to get the Season Pass or shop during sales.			"

												Great conversion of a great board game. Some of the characters are broken (I am looking at YOU, Dark Cultist!), and some optional mechnanics are a bit hard to follow, but it's faithful to the origninal. Gameplay is just the right mix of complex and fast, with a lot of variety available once you add in the expansions with their new ending cards, extra mechanics and map zones.The DLC is both completely optional, and very reasonably priced. If you are just now buying it looks intimidating to get them all, but if you wait for a sale they can be had for 50-75% off which makes it more bearable. It's worthwhile getting all of them, especially the expansions. While the individual characters might seem like something you will never play, playing against them as NPCs still adds replay value to the game as a whole.			"

												Talisman is a solid board game that's great for party night.  You can also play it against AI, though it's a bit awkward at times.  And perhaps the biggest plus for me, you can heavily customize your experience as well, choosing victory conditions, house rules, etc.With lots of characters and customizable rules to choose from, it's definitely worth a look, if you like these sorts of games.

												First let me say i wasnt aware of talisman till a few days ago and i have to be completely honest.This is a must buy. im loving ever minute, and yes i too read all the mixed reviews and in part i agree.but heres my way to decide if talismans for you.1. buy the multi player version first (at writing this review it was on sale £1.67).full price around £5.2. ( watch a few youtube vids on the game, & get a feel for the rules etc)3. if you feel that this is your sort of game, then purchase the prologue.id call  this the talisman tutorial , dont worry to much about counting moves, just enjoy the ride that is talismanThere are more than 50 quests, and the pros of this are you will get to really understand about how to build your chosen characters , get a taste of what possible rewards and pitfalls await you within the adventure card deck,which must be turned after every move and finally which squares of the board not to go to.This is why its a must buy for anyone thats new to talisman.(at time of review it was not on sale ) .so at this point weve spent less than the price of a costa coffee & muffin (£7)im old skool and this feels like your playing a adventure story novel, the dice will make or break you.but im enjoying every minute playing and as i select every adventure card or spell card you will be like a kid opening a present. for the price you get a lot of fun for your bucks.i give prologue  a beast slaying, spell casting  8/10(The best way to find your gaming legs , which will only add to you enjoying the multiplayer game even more.)DLC review.now i wouldnt advice you to dig deep and buy all the dlcs, unless  you know the game inside and out.but i would say to maybe look at (The Reaper or The Blood Moon first )these add a little extra fun to your game and  beginner must haves.will i end up getting all the dlc, 100% yes. The more you play Talisman ,the more you want to play, win, lose or draw its more fun that a sack full of kittens.(just a saying , animals should always be loved and looked after lol).At the time of this review i also purchased the ps4 version which came with all dlc apart from 1 or 2 that are on steam.(£23). this game is a amazing ride, and the Buy now button is your ticket.i give Talisman Digital Edition a sword swinging,strength building, giant  slaying 10/10.

												I just love Talisman played 2 ed when I was young, when FFG got the rights I was hooked again. Got all the expansions and I am a keen gamer and poster on FFG Talisman forum with all the other Talisman nutters. The DE is great for playing against other free minded gamers. My only gripe is the rules are a little different to the boardgame itself - like the Limited Resoures Rule. But with custom game options and a good lot of gaming friends the multi-player rocks. Got to hand it to Nomad to take the leap and create this fantastic boardgame into a digital format. Bring on the expansions I say and let the Talisman flow. But remember I bags the Leprechaun.			"

												Bought this on Android and was very happy to see a Steam version as well. For some dumb reason though the mobile version expansions are cheaper than the Steam versions... Cross platform play has not yet been finished and I am looking forward to the ability to combine the two player bases. Prices on Steam should also be lowered to match Mobile version as they both are the same core game along with all the same expansion packs. The only con to most people would be that this is a ""Build a game"" with all of their expansions, the base game is good but not that engrossing. One major redeaming fact is that if the host has the expansions then all players will be able to play the expansions that are enabled by the host.			"

I have spent several hours playing this hotseat style with friends. I think that everyone should have a chance to enjoy this game.However, I cannot with good conscience recommend it with the online multiplayer in its current state. I have played with several different groups of people and without exception experienced massive issues in every game. Slowdowns, random bugs such as cards not being played or abilities not triggering, people being dropped from the game, the game freezing entirely, and more.The bottom line: Should you buy this game?NO - Unless you're planning on playing exclusively off-line multiplayer or by yourself, in which case it's the best digital tabletop game you can acquire on Steam.

												Monopoly-labelled-RPG.You don't have to think in this game, you just roll some dice and roll some more dice. You fight monsters and gain stats along the way(Just like Monopoly, THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO BUY THE PROPERTY- a.k.a fight the monster). This was one of the worst boardgames I've played, as it is linear, without any tactical sense or strategy required, and being 95% luck based clearly does not help.This is coming from a huge boardgame fan - having played quite a huge number of them (Descent, Arkham Horror, War of the Ring, Cosmic Encounter- to name a few). My Gameplay Session - Played a warrior, not knowing the rules, rolls some dice. Rolls more dice, arrives at the center early because it seems to be the goal- doesn't have to spend a brainwave to think. Realized that I can't get to the middle without an item, attacked an AI and got the Talisman. Arrived middle, then a 30 minute snooze-fest of rolling dice while the enemies heal up and die so very very slowly. I'm not saying that a good game needs to have some degree of complexity. I've enjoyed simple games like Ticket to Ride or Cleopatra, that at least its not a boring snooze fest. There is no immersion, I don't feel like a warrior, its just a label and gimmick, at the end of the days, Classes are just player modification that does very little to differentiate you from one another- you don't have to be smart about it, you just need to have half a brain and huge amounts of luck to do well in this game.I don't understand why this game has the ""Strategy"" or the ""RPG"" tag with it. It should instead be replaced with the ""Casual"" Tag. This game reminds me with many of the App games and certainly does not belong in these categories.3/10 "

												I love big, complex board games. Until I don’t. I’ve played a lot of board games where I start out with a big group of friends and a lot of excitement to play. Four hours later, I wonder – will this game ever end? Talisman: Digital Edition is a very faithful port of the classic board game and allows you to play either online with friends or against AI opponents.I’ve played a lot of this since I bought it, partially because it doesn’t require that much attention. It’s turn-based so I can play while watching an episode of some tv show, or I can tab out to do other things. I really like when board games are digitized. Not having to keep track of a tabletop full of life tokens and counters and spells, or put them away at the end, is a big plus for me.If you like the Talisman boardgame, you’ll probably like this. It's well done and very faithful to the original.			"

												Firstly, this game stays true to the letter to its paper counterpart while adding several newly created characters into the mix. The game allows for several optional house-rules to modify the game, like you would do yourself, if you had the paper game.Secondly, the connoisseurs who dabbled in Talisman before will be pampered by the exquisite taste of this digital remake. The board game enthusiasts will surely find this cultic game to their liking before getting hooked for life.The nay-sayers who keep looking for patterns in dice rolls will build a tall strawman in front of them and get a migraine.And lastly, some will complain about the UI, some won't like the balance this game brings (or doesn't), some will go as far as to say the game is rigged against them, their loved ones and the Gods themselves when playing against AI who apparently cheats 5 times out of 4. But at the end of day you just laugh at those people and steal their Flail/Spellbook before casting a Misfortune on their Reaper roll.This game saves a great deal of physical space, many bags of gold and is still terrific.P.S. Wait for a 50% off sale and get the Season Pass. Money well spent.			"

												My journey in Talisman.Start game as Elf, and begin traveling. My Elf soon discovers that he has a nack for lifting, so he begins to Lift all across the land. He soon becomes the strongest Elf, to the point that Dragons immediately burn up and die by simply being in his presence. The Elf soon becomes known as Bicelf, master the bicep and all things body building. The Elf then notices that a stream of protein powder has appeared in a forest, along with a stream of life in a another forest. Enraptured by its beauty he rushes to the first stream with great passion ,and proceeds to travel back and fourth between the streams, mixing them into the ultimate protein shake, till there was not a drop left.However, while Bicelf the great was busy mixing his poretin shake, a Dwarf born of a noble lineage, decends into a pit of dispair in the tavern as he drinks his life away. Soon contracting every dicease, virus or cancer, from STD's to the common cold, as he performs many questionable acts within the tavern.However, as time passed he came across a ball, the ball of which whispers to him of darkness. This strange combination of ball and disease soon beings to manifest as a being of pure death, with anything the Dwarf touches dying soon after. However, the Dwarfs toxic powers cannot be contained with his small body, and begisn to leak out, poisoning the entire land, slowly draining the life from anything it touches, with nothing able to stop this cloud of death, and when I say nothing I mean nothing no healer, no magican not even a angel could heal him.Bicelf hearing of this taint on the land travels to meet it, and hope to end it. But the STD riddled Dwarf is a slippery one, eluding him at every turn, constantly keeping just out of reach. Unable to catch the Dwarf, the Dwarf proceeds to devour all who live, with the elf in hot pursuit. The Dwraf of whom chases after a strange ninja who, having lost all his honor has decended into killing innocent animals in the forest. Even becoming so desperate at one point, that he tried to turn his sword into gold. However, it failed him, leaving himself a sword that was one part sword and one part of what remained, but no one was interested in buying. My Elf in pursuit of the Dwarf of death, continues to turn dragons to dust under his gaze, and vanquishing all evil he finds. But, is still unable to catch the Dwarf despite his efforts. Seeing how much of the land is now currupted, and no other option Bicelf turns to the crown of power, deciding the only option is to wipe the world clean, cleansing the world of the Dwarfs curruption, who has now widely called, The Destoryer of Worlds.Bicelf begins his journey entering the inner region, melting the sentinal with a simple flex of his sweet pecks. Now, with his vast quantitys of mule's, a unicorn, the ring of power, the legendary crown of soloman, a battle axe, a mecernary who has follows Bicelf in the hopes of avenging his family, a alchemist (The same one who turned the ninjas sword to gold), some provisions, armour and most importantly the fabled talisman.Ready to go, Bicelf begins his journey into the wasteland. Back in the outer region, the Dwarfs power grows, gaining strength from the lives he consumes. He finally catches the ninja, devouring his strength and stealing everything the ninja had left. Taking a fancy to the ninjas armor. After a short journey my Elf reaches the doors to the great desert and begins his journey, in its harsh and unforgiving wastland. Soon after entering the wasteland, he runs into the Reaper, former lord of death (Second to the Dwarf). Death who, despite becoming second to the Dwarf still thinks himself the strongest. Hearing this, Bicelf is overcome with a masculine rage, declaring that nothing is stronger than he, and begins to beat the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of death. The battle lasts for a few minutes, before Bicelf gains the upper hand, body slamming death into the ground, and crushing him between his sweet solid biceps. Having beaten Death to death, and having done a exceedingly good job at it, our hero continues his journey to the crown. However, he is soon met along the journey a pack of wolves, which with a simple flex of his masculine and perfect gluteus maximus, he turns into smears by the shear shockwave of raw power his gluts create. Now, with the crown in sight, and with a end to his journey in sight, he stands before the crown taking a moment to savor this achivement, thinking about the moment he'll purge the destroyer of worlds, and finally free the world. But, for a second he wonders if this is the right thing, since after all this will kill everyone not just the Dwarf. But, if he doesn't do it, the Dwarf destroy the world anyway. After a moment, and a quick workout (He does his best thinking while he bulks), he realises he has to do this, grasping the crow and placing it atop his head, so beginning the purge of the Dwarf era. The Dwarf however, whose power has grown beyond comprehension at this point, begins to feel the purge take hold, draining his life force. So, without a moments hestitation, he rushes to enter the inner region. However, as he comes upon the sentinal, he is struck down as the crowns affects have begun to weaken him. The ninja having been begging for money on a dirt path nearby, and seeing this opportunity, runs out and uses a magic spell he learnt back in his old dojo, destroying all the items the Dwarf had.As the items begin to fade into the infinite void, the ninja began to hear a faint whisper, telling him of the power of the dark ball the Dwarf possessed. But, despite the ninja's situation, his mind, though devoid of all honor still retains its strength, and he is able to resist the orb as it is finally over come by the void, and banished to its deapths. The Dwarf unable to reconsitute himself, thanks to the loss of his orb of power, and the purge draining his life force, begins to slip into the void with the orb, pulling his corruption with it. The Elf still wearing the crown, finishes the purge, cleansing the world of all life, including the ninja who was able to die with a shred of honor. Bicelf however, now being to the sole being in existance, begins to perform a righteous workout, bulking up to a godly level, and from his sweat life was born anew. Bicelf, no longer able to live among the world of mortals, writes down the events that have transpired, so that the future generations of this world could read of their creation. However, Bicelf could not stay for long as his muscles were so perfect and well toned, that he can no longer reside with the likes of mortals, since all who gaze on his perfect body would be overwelhemed by their shear power. Ascending to the relm of the gods instead, where he could become the god of lifting, inspiring a new generations of body builders.Good game 10/10, would purge the world of life to stop a insideous STD riddled Dwarf again.Play with friends if you want a good time.

												After a handful of plays, I've decided not to recommend this game. While it's vaguely interesting, it's massively dominated by luck rather than strategy, and plays at a snail's pace once you know what's going on.The default Crown of Command victory mechanic harshly punishes any player trying to win, effectively removing them from the game and having them roll a die every turn to see if they get closer to winning. During this time, other players can interrupt the lead player or heal themselves, build up their strength, reset the lead player's advantage, and then walk in and win an hour later. Luckily there are houserules that deal with this (instantly winning or disabling healing when someone reaches the Crown).They try to keep it interesting with the runes, which you earn by playing a lot. All the runes do is give you a minor, but unfair, advantage. Additionally, custom classes and cards which were easy to incorporate in physical editions are sold in relatively expensive DLC packs, leaving the core game feeling sparse.It could be fun as a lighthearted game with friends every once in a while.

												Talisman is a fantastic card based board game with almost unlimited replayablity. You can chose either the standard ending or if you have any of the expansion packs you can select an alternate ending. You can even chose a pool of endings for the game to randomnly draw from if there is a particular ending you don't like, then you can exclude it. There is online multiplayer enabled but I don't tend to play in the public games so I can't really comment about that. The developers work tirelessly to correct any bugs and to improve the AI to provide more a challenge. The season pass that gives you access to all current expansions and characters also includes all future content so it's well worth the money. I love this game and cannot wait to see what further updates can offer.			"

												This is a review from a person who has collected and played the Talisman board game since its 2nd edition (Steam uses 4th ed).Talisman, the board game, is a game of funstration.  It is enjoyable enough to play, but you cannot take it too seriously.  It will delight you as many times as it will break you.  Talisman:  Digital Edition emulates this experience precisely.  I know some people have an issue with the RNG of this game, but when it comes to simulating the physical board game, I can say that it is spot on.  You will rarely roll the number you need to survive and you will often draw the worst possible card at any given time - just like the real board game!My advice to anyone playing this game is to play without the expectation of winning.  Play it as if it's a rogue-like, choose-your-own-adventure fantasy story represented by a board, some cards, and miniatures.  I guarantee that once you lighten your expectations, your playing experience will be much more enjoyable.  It is the very same mindset that my friends and I discovered when playing the physical board game.			"

												Despite the antics of that fiendish troll and the feuding of the foppish wizard and foolish druid I quickly ascended the ladder of chaos to become the undisputed superpower... for a time. Having played dice with Death, and won, I was quickly on my way to true dominance. The Crown, so near my grasp... was snatched away in an instant. The troll who had tried so long to surpass me, always failing, clearly made devilish deals with that prancing imbecile of a wizard. I was blindsided by a curse and I had to choose between the total loss of my considerable physical strength, or another roll of the dice. I rolled, and I was made a toad. For three long rounds. I could no longer carry my dazzling array of mystical arms and armor or my enchanted trinkets. My followers abandoned me, thinking likely I was simply a toad now and would remain that way. I was forced to enter the Werewolf Den, and there I was brutally beaten back to Death's Door. Then I was shoved back to the Crypts where, weak and confused, I was banished from the inner-realm back to that hell-hole of a city. Gathering myself, freed from the toady curse which had ailed me, I prepared to ascend the ladder of chaos and ambition once more. The damage however had been done; despite defeating the Sentinel in my weakened state and  battling my way back into the inner-realms, I was ultimately undone by the coniving treacheries of that damnable troll. He slew me there, having claimed all that I had lost. Only the ladder is real.TL;DR 10/10 - Would climb again.			"

												I've never played Talisman before and would probably never get a chance in my country, so digital versions do come in handy. I've played a few matches and although game is complex (great), rich and detailed (excellent) and full of amazing details and additional content (nice, nice, supernice), I've always had a feeling I am being cheated out of dice rolls. Even compared to Chainsaw Warrior, card game that really snuffs out the players 9 out of 10 times, this game always felt way too artificial under the colorful hood.Well now... I've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it today when I saw there's a Humble Bundle package with some additional content available for a low price. I was just about to buy and indulge in playing muted Talisman and listening to audiobook again when a buddy of mine made me read a shocking post by a developer himself. That post is available at Steam's community hub for Talisman: Digital Edition and it explains in detail the horrid decision of game devs that I really don't understand at all.The most important part is this one and no, it's not taken out of context:""At the start of a new game, a huge list of random numbers between 1 and 6 is generated. That list of numbers is used for the whole game, in the order that they are determined at this point.""I understand it this way - in the game based on factor of random dice rolls, you get a predetermined row of numbers which influence your moves. There are no true random dice rolls, no luck. Only a rigging generator.This decision truly crushes my enthusiasm to play this game any longer and to buy any new content. I am sorry, but I don't see any point of dice rolling when my game is (almost completely) predetermined. When I buy a game that relies on dice rolls, I want random dice rolls. There's no excuse for this sad state of affairs and although I never do this, I urge you all to vote this review up so people prove to the devs changes have to be made to make a great game - great.

												If I could tell you only one thing about Talisman, it's this: the first two hours or so were spent exploring the board, tussling with the other players, defeating monsters, stockpiling resources. The last two hours consisted of me rolling a die, hoping for a 50-50 chance result to come up a number of times. Every turn. Flip a coin. Next. It took me more than EIGHTY turns to finally grind everyone's HP down to zero. Max HP any one opponent held at any time? Seven. EIGHTY turns. I'd like a word with the playtester who signed off on that.This is a digital adaptation of a boardgame and as I understand it, it's quite a faithful one. I've never played the tabletop version, so I can't make any statements to that effect, but I'm happy to believe that it is. It certainly feels like a board game. Specifically, it feels like a board game from the eighties, and that's not much of an endorsement.Don't get me wrong, I want to like this game. I appreciate the idea of turning an RPG into a boardgame, but this is a very flawed attempt. The first part, where you're stocking up on resources (items, health, combat stats), the GOOD part, is still a tedious grind, due to the extreme randomness. Roll the die, move exactly that many squares, hope for a decent encounter, hope you'll pass that encounter, eventually advance a little bit, then hope the others don't gang up on you once you get ahead a little. Rinse, repeat.""But it's a dice game, of course there's randomness!"" Quite right. But that's not a get out of jail free card. Go have a look at Elder Sign to see dice randomness done right. The board is a significant component of the game experience, but in essence it's no more sophisticated than the board in Trivial Pursuit. The difference is that TP isn't about exploring the board, so it can get away with it. If you want to make the game about exploring the board, have a look at Legends of Andor and learn how to get a much more satifying experience in a lot less time.As someone who has played a lot of board (and card, and dice) games and a lot of role playing games, I can see the potential and the appeal of the concept, but I really can't recommend the actual product. I see reviews stating that it gets a lot better with this-or-that DLC, but my experiece with the base game doesn't make me want to spend more money on something that was thoroughly unenjoyable.Eighty bloody coin flips...

												So I wrote a review of this game yesterday and did not reccomend it. My ultimate gripe was how tedious the ending could be. Flash forward less than 24 hours and the developer showed me that there is a setting that greatly fixes that aspect and also there are some other neat functions to switch up the experience. This is FANTASTIC. If you are playing the game on your own there is no limit to how you change the experience but when playing a video game you can only really do what you are allowed to short of modding it yourself. Letting players switch up the play to what they like is so fantastic.Super fun game and I really reccomend it, just be sure you check out the house rules!!			"

												I like Cardboards and I like Fantasy Settings. This game seems like a pretty good choice.But it has its flaws. Much unnecessary clicking, many delays. Games turn out to be very slow.Some people like to click for rolling the dice, but personally if no choices are left other than roll the dice.Roll dice -> choose destination (necessary) -> Survey the field (take cards) -> Fight the monster -> roll the dice for fight the monster. If only one step in this chain is necessary why not skip the other to speed up the game. I have no other choice to fight this monster so why do I have to tell the game I want to fight it and after that actually fight it with rolling the dice?There are many Animations (e.g. dice rolling, moving, game effects, battle) and no way to skip them. Try to play a game with AI enemies and after half an hour you get frustrated. You don't want to see them roll the dice. You wait so long for your turn and most of what the AI actions will not even concern you.But what drives me off most is the game mechanic. Chances for positive Events are not very high, its hard for your character to accumulate progress. And when you finally found items, compagnions you can have bad luck and loose everything by turning into a frog when rolling a bad number in the city. Or an enemy just casts a spell on you to reset your strength to the starting value so you cannot fight most of the monsters anymore.Of course every game has to have some negativ value to emphasize the positiv values. Its ok to loose an item, healthpoint or to wait one turn. But taking away so much from a player will make you rage. You can be at the very top and in the next moment you loose everything.This game is far from balanced and although I really like the setting this game is so unforgiving for any awful roles.I would not recommend it, though the real life version would be possible playable because of its faster pace.This game annoyed me like no other.

												Talisman is a great fantasy-genre board game! There's nearly an infinite variety of things which can happen in it, and lots of replayability! My only complaint is that on re-rolls, when you use fate, it seems like 80% of the time you'll roll the exact same number (out of a 1 in 6 chance)! It just seems highly improbable! Otherwise it's totally worth spending a few bucks for the game to see if you enjoy it, knowing that there's a ton of DLC to enhance it later if you like it.			"

												You need to roll a 2 to win, you'll roll a 1You need a 3 to win, you'll roll a 2, you reroll then you'll get a 1 or a 2 again.Meanwhile the AI continues stomping.It's just me being a sore loser? Nope my flatmate experienced the same when he was casting the command spell. Every other AI player was magically finding heals & protection spells left, right & centre. Once the wizard made it to battle his pirate in the centre, the wizard was working magic on the shield. The pirate was way above the wizard, but the wizard kept rolling 5's & 6's on shield protection for several turns in a row making him invincible. Buying enough time for that pesky Ghoul to turn up at the foot of the stairs.The execution of the board game to digital is great but the Die in this game is worthy of an online Casino. It really isn't random.Please fix. I've never rolled so many 1's & 2's in my entire life.			"

												I am a huge fan of the real world version of this game, but it is often difficult to get a large group of people together that are wanting to play.  This digital version is a great replacement.  It not only makes it easier to get groups together via the online play options, but even when no one else wants to play, the single player version is fun and challenging.  I bought a Season Pass for both myself and my wife, We were a little concerned about the issue with the Shaman character, but after emailing Nomad, they provided a perfectly reasonable explanation of both the limitations that Steam places on how they could do what they were trying to do with the charity drive, and why they had to do things as they had.  After speaking with them, we will not only be continuing to support this product, but also buying the Shaman character as well.			"

												Good game but it has a few issues that it could resolve to become great.The first: Allow players to examine the board. It's annoying having to wait until your turn to be able to do this. It becomes worse when there are adventure cards on the tile and you can't see what they do to plan ahead. It makes turns slower, which is unfortunately a bad thing in a game that already takes hours to finish.The second: Allow saving of games in multiplayer mode. Not being able to continue a game from where you left off is a huge minus when compared to the Tabletop Simulator version, especially considering how long these games can last.The third: maybe lower the price of the expansions/season pass a bit. I know it's cheaper if you buy it from the official site, instead of on Steam, but most probably won't check there.The fourth: Reduce the overall clunkiness/unfriendliness of the UI. Having to click a portrait to reveal the silhouette with a ?, then right click that, followed by another click on the portait in this context menu just to read a player's character sheet is annoying. The unbought DLC being similarly displayed as the purchased DLC isn't a huge deal, but it could certainly benefit from being made clearer. The same applies to spell casting. Making it more obvious that a spell is queued, or that double clicking the spell casts it without confirming it, would all go to improving the UI.Still a good game though. Pretty cheap if you only go for one or two expansions and the base game. Around £5 for the base game and an expansion or two is amazing value.			"

												This game has a lot of flaws. The AI is poor but that is forgivable in a game this complex. The UI is clunky. The save game system is terrible. And the online play would benefit from having a separate chat window. But the game is functional and all of my issues with it have been design flaws rather than bugs. I recommend this game solely because the gameplay itself is so entertaining. This digital version has sold me on the physical version which is superior in all ways but one. The AI, despite it's flaws, is decent enough to offer an enjoyable pickup game of talisman whereas the physical board game would require a lot of setup and planning just to get everyone in one room. So if you want to play a bit of Talisman but don't have the ability to get a physical game going this digital version should be good enough.Note: The developer did a UI overhaul with the recent City expansion. The UI is still clunky but it is better than it was previously. I mention this here because I have hope that with future expansions they may further improve the UI.			"

												A great digital port of a board game of epic proportions.The gameplay is Talisman as you know it, just on a PC. You can play the game whenever you want with a decent AI that does make weird mistakes or unnecessary decisions at times, or you can play online with strangers or friends. The UI does take a bit of getting used to, but it's pretty intuitive. There are bugs, but the team accepts feedback through the discussions page and they're fairly diligent in working them out. I actually reccomend getting the season pass with this, by the way. It comes with all the expansions and DLC characters (except the charity Shaman).I have a lot of fun achievement hunting in this game too (I am a proud owner of the Immortal achievement), although admittedly some of the achievements are really specific and weird.

												Talisman is mostly luck based, there isn't really any deep strategy involved but there is a reason why it's still remembered as a classic after 30 years. It's just fun (at least for a while).Unfortunately, there are some issues with this ""digital version"". It's glitchy and you have to fight the user interface more often than not: managing to cast spells at the right time so that they'll do what they are supposed to requires trial and error. Also the AI mostly runs around randomly looking for ways to commit suicide.Overall I give it a very cautious recommendation. If like me you're nostalgic of this game and probably won't get the chance to play the actual board game again, then it's worth it if you can be forgiving of the many little annoyances. "

												Like I said in my review of Talisman - Prologue: ""the game is like Game of Life, only you kill ogres and get cast spells instead of knocking up your crazy girlfriend from college and have a loveless marriage."" It isn't the most deep and well designed board game, it's a bit too based on luck and while it's easy and can take more time to learn than most modern euro board games. That said, Talisman is a fun game to play with friends and socialize. This adaptation in particular is really good and faithful to the original, with a lot of controls to create and enforce house rules, and there are many expansions packs for you to pick and them to release. Bots play well but they don't play to win and so single player can be a bit frustrating, so get your friends together or make new ones online.			"

												OK so first with the positive. Let me explain why, the game itself is fun and good. It is more monopoly and chance related than your choices but it is fun to play with four people. It is the board game, so if you enjoyed the board game it you'll enjoy this. Only buy it on sale though, because... the board game is around $40 and you can just split that four ways with friends if you want.Now to the negative.My problem is the game needs to be fixed. The spell casting is wonky, two DIFFERENT people with me accidently casted Immobilize on themselves because there is no Confirmation in some instances. When you play you'll get it, it is quite difficult to explain. There is also no Cancel button to take back and attacks or spells you use. This to me, is part of the fun with the game to scare/intimidate your opponent. Also, sometimes people misclick!Alright so I'll try to explain the spell casting. I have a spell called Psychic blast and it adds my craft to my strength for the fight. Except you for some reason can't activate it during combat? Unless it was qued up before? When it's qued any thing that triggers a fight will cast it, and sometimes you don't remember that it was qued and it goes off on something you didn't want. This is the same issue with Coutner Spell which is extremely frustrating. I counter spelled myself ) :If this element is fixed the game will be much more enjoyable.			"

												I am a big fan of the boardgame ever since I was a kid. I wanted this video game for a long time.I like the game but it has flaws. Here are some of them-It is way more stable then when it was early accsess, but there are still plenty of glitches to around especsially with spells and new characters. -There are alot of characters that I recognize and there are alot of overpowered munchkin characters that brake the game. It is good that you have the option to only allow core characters, but I would like if there would be an option to disallow certain characters like the Martyr, Black Witch etc.-I would like a workshop, so people could make custom boards, cards, characters etc. Even tough there is alot of content released, I would enjoy for example a mod where you can replace the art with the original oldschol art.-Even tough the game is a skill based game, there is alot of luck involved. At times it feels like you are playing the odds at poker. I like it but some might not.At the end tough this is a solid boardgame adaptions, with some flaws, but its fun overall. If you are a fan of Fantasy themed board games like Hero Quest or Descent give this one a go.			"

												Despite quite enjoying playing this game with friends if you're against the AI or random people online this game is the most frustrating thing on the planet... To win the game your character must stand at the Crown of Command where you get a chance to roll a dice, if you get 4, 5 or 6 every other player losses 1 life. I've just been stuck in a game for hours upon hours while a character with 8 life and a runeblade (Lets him heal 1 life whenever he kills something) stumbled around the board killing hoards of wolves, bears, bandits and anything else that he came across. Inevitably healing him up higher than the ""game ending"" spell could ever damage him. Utterly ridiculous, boring and frustrating.			"

												This game is a good representation of board game, but unless you're playing locally with friends, it's just not worth it.  I have a perpetual game going with one other AI player.  I'm sitting at the crown of command, where you need to roll a 4,5, or 6 to deal 1 point of damage to all other players.  The goal is to finish off the other players either before they reach the crown or just to finish the game.  The problem is that even when you happen to roll high enough to deal damage, the AI runs around the outside of the board and finds ways to heal themselves.  The AI has no interest in progressing to the crown and unless the ""random"" number generator allows me to roll high enough times in a row, this game will NEVER end.			"

												I had this misfortune of playing a short game of this with my friends who got it on the Steam sale. I have played a lot of Talisman and it already isn't a game I'm very fond of. Almost the entire game is luck. What you roll to move, what cards you draw, whether you complete combat, it's all a coin flip. The main test of skill is knowing when you've acquired enough random loot to try the inner layers of the board. It's a very light game mechanically. It's rare that other players' turns have effects on you, so there's a lot of downtime. It's a social game.The port is kind of a mess. Not only is the interface generally clunky requiring what feel like unnecessary taps to get to the information you want, but it's ported from the mobile version and clearly optimized for a touch screen, not a computer. For example, all of the controls are on the left and right edges of the screen where your thumbs would be on a tablet. It's a clunky version of an okay, very random board game.			"

A Tough Talisman to SellAs AAA games come out left and right, there are times when a simple board game with friends can bring just as much enjoyment as any multi-million dollar project.  Talisman: Digital Edition brings to the plate the concept of sitting down with three friends and experiencing the thrill of telling a character’s story through each roll of the die.  Though Talisman does bring a lot to the plate in terms of accessibility and content, frustrating mechanics and game-breaking bugs riddle what could be an above-average title.Talisman pits a chosen character against three players, human or A.I., in a quest to retrieve the Crown of Command.  To do so, one must obtain the coveted Talisman to cross the Valley of Fire.  Getting to the Valley of Fire is no simple feat, as one has to train their characters to withstand the demons, monsters, spirits, and other characters out to end their journey.  Each character comes with five stats: Strength, Craft, Lives, Fate, and Gold.  Strength determines how much damage you can do against strength monsters.  Craft shows how much damage you can deal to craft-based monsters, as well as your stat to how many magic spells you can hold.  Lives are your total life counter, when you hit zero, you drop all your items and go back to base stats.  Fate is your re-roll counter, use a Fate counter to re-roll for a better number.  Gold allows you to buy certain items from vendors, as well as bargain with certain monsters.The goal in Talisman is to beef up a character, retrieve a Talisman through either completing a quest or through prayer, and reaching the Crown of Command.  Doing so is no easy or short task, with most games taking easily over an hour to complete, depending on dice rolls and which cards appear.  Though the allotted time spent on one game may put off players, getting three friends in the mix most certainly makes the time much more enjoyable.  The accomplishment of getting a character to ludicrous levels and auto-killing dragons makes the long journey well worth it, especially when a character can auto-kill a friend’s character; the fear one can put onto people is wicked fun.But where Talisman shines with its cooperative play, there are many design decisions that can frequently darken the experience, mainly how luck-based Talisman proves to be.  Almost every move one does in Talisman is based off the luck of the die: movement, combat, everything on the path to victory relies on something completely out of control.  Items and objects can help the strain of progressing through the map, but there are spots on the board where one unfortunate roll can wipe away almost an hour’s worth of progress.  It’s almost as if Talisman does not want the player to win, opting more to continue progressing characters to no discernable end, something a game should never do.The most disappointing factor in Talisman is its abundance of game-breaking bugs and issues that plague aspects of the game.  Through the 11 hours I played, at least once every two games would freeze or lock into a game-breaking screen.  Whether it was being stuck in an item screen, the “roll dice” button refusing to work, or being stuck perpetually casting a spell, it’s a hard pill to swallow letting a game go one to two hours only to have to exit the game with no accomplishment or satisfaction for the time spent.  Talisman also has one unbelievably laughable issue with its Warlock Quests; Warlock Quests are specific quests, like visiting an NPC on the board, or acquiring armor, that fulfilling the quest will grant you a Talisman and get you on the path to victory.  If a player happens to acquire a Talisman and not finish their Warlock Quest, the path to get to the final section of the board will be blocked off until the quest is complete, regardless of if the character already has the prize at hand.  What’s even more baffling is there’s no way to remove a Warlock Quest unless the character dies completely, this is almost game breaking when a Warlock Quest like “Slay a Dragon” is in possession, leaving one to hope that they can find one to two specific cards in a 100+ card deck amongst three other players.  Situations like this become more common than they should be, and it’s a really sad ordeal to see a game come to an abrupt end after one can get so enveloped into their game.Talisman has every right to be a popular, fun, and engaging game to experience with friends and players online.  Each character plays a different role and each game plays out different than the last.  It’s just a shame to see such a bright experience be crippled by frequent crashes, freezes, bugs, and some laughable design choices that do nothing but encumber the experience.  As much as I want to recommend Talisman, I just can’t in the state it’s in and with the decisions it’s made.			"

												There are constant problems.  Timing of spells is the biggest one offhand.  You often need to play a spell at the start of the affected character's turn but, at least when playing against the computer there is often no delay between after one character has moved (signifying the end of the start of it's turn) and the turn ending meaning.  The queue system is very clunky and it is very easy to cast a spell/use an item too early, too late, or even at the completely wrong time due to it being playable at the wrong place in combat.Also you cannot look at the board outside of your turn causing you to waste time doing it on your own turn if you missed something.  In singleplayer you can look at the board outside of your turn but it pauses the game.  There is no sort of event log or even way to view the discard piles (that I am aware of) so often things will flip by and you'll have no idea what transpired and no way to look.  As mentioned in the comments there is an event log and it seems to have some good options for filtering.In multiplayer there are often problems where one or more person will be disconnected and you get to rewatch the computer play the same turn(s) over.  This seems to happen more often later in the game and w/ the city expansion but that's just my experience from 2-3 games.  Frequent crashes and glitches can cause players to miss the end of game meaning they get no in game credit or achievements for anything they would have earned there for potentially several hours of effort.There was a recent patch addressing many outstanding issues with the game.  End of game crashes most notably were addressed and I haven't seen that happen in the few games I've played since.  I haven't seen any midgame crashes either, but I have not tried playing with the city expansion again.One upside is the Season Pass actually comes with all the dlc with the exception of one which contributes to charity.If most of these problems were addressed I would absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of the physical game.

In real life you had companionship and beer to offset the downside of the game mechanics. You don't have that with this one. I thought they might streamline it, but they kept the cumbersome system.

Very worthy version of the game, and well-supported.Perfect for getting the ""fix"" for a good deep board game. Currently (Dec 2013), there are still some bugs, but re-loading the game is quick and easy enough. Turn speeds with AI can be annoyingly long; animations cannot be sped up at all, etc. But, I cannot wait for further refinement and addition of the expansions. Good fun here.My only real complaint is around the core ruleset (rather than this presentation of it); I always felt Talisman had balance/refinement issues (i.e. too dependent on luck in general), but I suppose that's part of the charm. Some ""House Rules"" setting options would be amazing. Moreso would be opening this up to Steam Workshop... THAT would be truly incredible.			"

												I never played the original board game but I do play a lot of other GW games. Anyway I purchased this so that my wife and I could play on the local setting and I had already read a review from another player who games with his wife. One or two minor snags but I must admit we do have great fun playing this game and we are both totally hooked. We purchased it for a second laptop and now play online opposite each other on the dinning room table and must say we have never enjoyed a game so much.Very simplistic in its style and a lot of chance with dice rolls in the game, but with so many charactors to choose from this is great fun. My 13 y.o. has a laptop as well which unfortunately is being repaired at the moment but as soon as its back I am sure he will join so its great fun for all ages.Just a word of warning that games can go on to late in the evening, so if your looking for an easy to get into game that never plays the same way twice then this is a must have.

												As a longtime fan of the Talisman franchise, I will recommend the Digital Edition.  But not without qualification.  While an ably faithful translation of the boardgame experience, the AI is simply not challenging enough for veteran players of the game.  It's not that the AI will never win against a seasoned player.  It can.  But things have to go extremely right for the AI, and extremely wrong for the player, for this to happen.   Even with the wonky AI, I still find myself enjying the game.  And I believe most folks familiar with the game will, as well.If you've never played Talisman, the AI is actually a benefit, as it keeps the game from being too punishing to neophyte players.  It's not that Talisman is an overly complex game.  But there is a lot of information to absorb.  The starter set alone boasts over a dozen playable characters, all of whom have multiple special abilities and differing alignments; there are five attributes for each character; there are nearly one hundred event cards, spells, etc.  So you get the idea.  There's a bit to learn and the AI allows games to extend the learning curve.If reviews were given on a scoring basis as opposed to a simple recommend/not recommend, I would score Talisman: Digital Edition a solid 8.  In spite of the AI, the overall gameplay experience is fun for those who like board games or fantasy settings and there is a lot of replayability to be had. "

												I originally got this game because I watch D&D Stories- the youtube channel of TtheWriter- and he reviewed Talisman the physical board game. If you think of this as an adaptation that's easier to play with [due to no setup, no space needs, and you can give copies of the game to your friends] then this game... well, is amazing!There's a lot to take in, at first. Empty board spaces means random encounters, means fights with monsters or loot, or spaces that permanently will help or hinder whoever next lands there. You have many characters with special abilities to choose from-- or set everyone to random characters!The goal of course, is get a Talisman card while improving your character's stats through encounters and finding items. Best challenges like crossing a river, going through a portal, fighting demons, rolling dice with Death Itself... there is just so much inside this board game! Many paths to take, different ways to beat challenges.... You must survive the trials, and the other players- to make your way to the center crown... To hopefully kill the other players until you are the last man standing.That last part is essentially a 50/50 chance each turn, but there's an option to house rule it to make it finish easier-- such as making players unable to heal if someone is in the center, or just straight up make it a race to the finish.Did I mention that there's not a huge penalty with dying? Apart from other characters stealing your stuff- if you have a rough time you can totally respawn and bounce back--- unless of course, it's the endgame, and someone controls the Crown at the center of the board.In short, although there's no take-back option if you select the wrong spot to go to--- or Queue the wrong spell and say, accidentally alchemize your Talisman card as soon as you get it--- This game is phenomenal once you understand what's going on, what strategies you can use.... and definently playing more than the Warrior will lead you to realize there' a lot going on in this board game adaptation!You can quit single vs Ai games any time and return to them later. Doesn't work in multiplayer--- and the one big constraint is time. This game is amazing-- but you do need a free evening, my first match literally took 90 minutes. But TtheWriter mentioned the physical game did that too, so I was somewhat prepared--- most steam games I believe aren't this massive.I'm the sort of gamer who absolutely adores replay value. I've got 188 hours in The Binding of Isaac, and I can't even record a Let's Play of that. This though- Talisman can be recorded if you set Fraps to record the Aero desktop and then set'er in fullscreen.Anyway, this game is amazing if you have the patience to figure it out, and the background of a D&D enthusiast to appreciate the combat system and lengthy quest.

												Great start to a great classic game. I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.Other than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.One feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)			"

												Is it perfect? No. Is there a learning curve? Yes. Is it all ""RNG""? No. This game reminds me of a Rougelike, in that everything comes down to how you manage your resources, how you spend your turns, and, and what your opponents are doing.

It actually seems to do better with characters that are more multifaceted, as it doesn't get hung up just grinding out objects or spells or something.I'm not worried about public matchmaking... I'll either play solo or with friends. Worth getting the base game at least for $2.50 right now. I like the extra areas, so the City, Cliffs, and Dungeon are also to me worth it.

												I don't typically write reviews but I almost felt compelled to write one for Talisman after seeing the review Metascore gave it (a 51)...  I can tell you, as a longtime follower of the franchise, that this rendition of the game plays extremely well and is identical to the board game.  I love it!!  My main issue with the board game was that I couldn't always get together with friends to play.  Now I don't have to!  Whether it be single player or multiplayer in this game the experience is excellent!  I'll leave it at that.  Now for the pros and cons:Pros:1.  Graphics (As good as can be expected for a board game rendition).2.  Replayability3.  New updates and expansions showing the creators/publishers have faith and are loyal to the product4.  Just like the board game!!Cons:1.  ????If you like the board game, give this a shot.  I don't think you'll be dissappionted.  I wasn't!			"

												Finally, a digital version of this game!  Lots of fun, the additional playable characters and the expansions really add to the experience as well.  The UI is simple and intuitive, and I have yet to run into a card that is bugged.  The AI is a bit stupid, and will very rarely make a play for the crown.  There is no difficulty slider to make them better.However, if you buy this you should realize you are buying it baiscally for vs. AI play or hotseat play at home.  The online servers are absolutely rubbish.  95% of the time online games will crash at launch.  On the rare 5% occasion an online game actually starts, it will crash or lag out in the first couple turns (if not during character selection!) 95% of /those/ times.  Should you actually manage to get off the ground with an online game, odds are good that something unfortunate will happen to someone and that person will ragequit, which invariably crashes the game as well.I say, without exaggerating, that I have actually managed to complete 3 online games out of about 200 attempted.  It baffles me that the game can be so very good and the online technical bits can be so unbearably useless.Conclusion - If you are a longtime talisman fan, and you have real-life friends to play with, hook this up to your tele and get a wireless mouse to pass for a fun evening.  Or, if you don't mind playing against AIs slightly less intelligent than your average cocker spaniel, pick this up.  If, however, you are looking to use primarily or exclusively the online play function, SAVE YOUR MONEY, this is worthless to you.			"

												As a fan of the original board game (having played - and lost - many many games back in the 80's) this digital version is an excellent recreation of the board game.  Given prices of the original game and it's expansions are bordering on extortionate these days (and I would dearly love to own the proper games again) i'd almost go so far as to say that this version is preferable.

												I am really enjoying this digital version of the game. I am one of the few.. the proud.. the nerdy.. I purchased the season pass for this in order to get all of the expansions as they become available. While I certainly get a bit itchy to see the next one come up immediately, it is not because of undue slowness of release so much as my enthusiasm. That being said, do not expect to pick this thing up and have all content immediately, or even in the next couple of months. I feel that the quality of the experience definitely is worth the wait, but if you are an ""instant gratification only"" sort of gamer, then I would advise waiting a little bit. I say this because the value of the season pass is incredible. Since this is a bit of a financial leap, I downloaded the demo of the Prologue, liked what I saw, and went for it. A comparison of the cost between the tabletop version of the game + expansions will send you reeling, and to me was a great option as a way to eventually test the expansions out before investing in the physical boards, since I don't play often enough to justify buying all of them.Totally worth it, in my opinion!!!The Game:The game varies in small ways from the Prologue, as it has been updated and refined, and I consider these differences to be in the best interest of the game for playability and ease of use. Keep in mind that the prologue is designed as a single player experience, and the interface is adjusted accordingly. Unfortunately, I have not been online with the game and can therefore not comment on that.The House Rules and various play options are fantastic.The DLC: In between releases of expansions, features are updated and new characters are added to the mix. These have interesting abilities and seem balanced, though I am still playing through to try different play styles, since some characters are meant to flourish when played in a particular way.I was really pleased with the way that the Reaper expansion was handled. There are some great adventure cards and characters, but the Reaper himself is not my favorite game element. When the community spoke, the developers listened and added the ability to deactivate the Reaper while keeping the rest of the expansion in play.Frostmarch has just been released, so I look forward to checking that out as well.I expect that some members of the community may say that this content ""should"" be released faster, I really think that the quality is well worth the wait, and that the characters that are added in between expansions keep the worst of the suspense at bay.

That's really a great feature for those of us not in grade school anymore. Finding time to play a full game is rough. With all the automated features, it's hard to go back to the physical board game. I've had some problems with the AI though. Sometimes it will attack the player even if that player is already in last place. Could definitely use a bit more polish. But for a fraction of the board games cost, you get the full game here. Well done!			"

												I bought this game during my board gaming phase, and hoped I could capture some of the charm of playing a board game with friends.It stays perfectly faithful to the original, and in many ways that is a problem. The visuals are functional but do not give you a sense of satisfaction. The movement feels awkward and clunky and you can never seem to get a view of the board that you really want.Like the original game it ends up being a lot more luck and very little strategy. It falls into the same trap or you can eventually just almost start a game over completely from scratch just due to bad rolls or you will have 10 to 15 turns where nothing actually happens.This was a missed opportunity to update the game modernize it and make it more fun such as adding simple mechanics that could have sped up gameplay. Instead you are treated to a game does exactly the same as it was 40 years ago, and even then there was criticism that it simply dragged on too long. Possibly worth five dollars if it was on sale, but 15 is not worth the value of this game.			"

												This game is a great idea, but they have several rather serious issues, any one of which makes the game stupid.  As I said, the idea is great, so I'm saddened by the glaring flaws.First, and probably most importantly, this game is very nearly entirely luck.  Yes, you get to make 2 choices about where you land each turn.  2 choices.  If you use spells, you can decide who to cast them on.  But you don't get to decide what spells you have, or when you get them.  This game would be a bazillion times more fun if they added a speed stat that let you move any number of spaces less than or equal to your speed, instead of rolling the die.  One of my favorite cards is a follower that ""curses"" you by making you only move 1 space each turn.  It gives me a unique sense of control in the game that I consider a major advantage.Secondly, there are a lot of ways to (randomly and unexpectedly) lose that don't make any sense.  For example, if you ever, ever get turned into a toad, you've basically lost.  ""But you haven't lost, yet.""  Sure, sure, I can continue playing for the hour or so the game might continue in hopes of some shocking recovery... but honestly, why make a player randomly turn into a toad?  To my knowledge, there is no option to turn toads off.  Third, the game can last quite a while, and if you die early, the AI will slowly (even at max AI speed) complete each phase of each turn, dragging the game on far longer than any reasonably sane person would care to sit and watch the AI play.I have fun playing this game, don't get me wrong.  But most of the time, I'm having fun thinking about what the game COULD be, rather than what it really is.  It pains me to have to say this, but I cannot recommend the game.			"

												Recommeded with issues.I bought this game based on playing the boardgame version in 1983 with hardcore gamers.  What made  the game fun was playing with other people face to face so that Diplomacy-like dynamics gave the game another level.  Thus  It became a ""beer-and-pretzels"" game for kicking back at the end of a long day of serious gaming.  It helped to be heavily medicated.  It was fun and relatively mindless.That is missing in single-player and even multiplayer when not face to face.  However it would be a fun game for lightweight gamers and young gamers and I can recommend it for that. Three games in, single-player, I wish I had not bought the game.  I could have bought a number of games I would have enjoyed more with the $15.  If it had been available at GOG.com I would have bought it there with their 30 day guarantee and would be returning it tonight, the same day I bought it.   I would readily give it up for $10.  Now, after I try it online multiplayer,  it will likely go in a special folder for  mindless day games when I am sick and medicated and bored with HULU but unable to function in a game that requires too much thinking.That said, it was well done, attractive with a good interface and plays faster than the boardgame version.  Not for me but definitely a good game for some.  Hard core gamers will probably be disappointed.   The die rolls bring too much luck into the game and not much skill...but Monopoly (which I got bored with at 8 yrs old) has been wildly successful for almost a century.  This could be a good family gaming night entry.One final comment.  After an online multiplayer game starts, there appears to be no way to communicate with others in the game to, for example, agree to stop until ""tomorrow at 1pm"". So it will probably be necessary to use a voice chat and wear headphones.  Otherwise people will be unable to warn you that they are dropping out or lost their connection.  Sorry, Corpse.__________________After playing a bit longer.  Interface not as good as origionally thought.  It is easy to accidentally lose cards because of similar moves in different parts of the game.  It can be very ambiguous at times.Further, at Level 8 character, I am trapped in a loop that lookis like the AI will repeat forever while I am trapped in the center Casting Command Spell repeatedly and unable to leave.  Since the AI has a poltergeist it repeats it's move over and over...because each time it IS the best move for the AI.  After playing up 8 levels with my troll I have no way out without starting a new game and losing all progress.  Now I really do not want to waste my time playing TALISMAN unless they remove this bug.  There are places in the game that will just hang you up in a loop with no escape.  I remove my recommendation from when I first played TALIZMAN DIGITAL			"

I'm getting very discouraged as the game is fun to play, but after playing for an hour it's aggravating to have it crash and then not be able to have everyone reconnect.  Please fix the bugs and provide a more stable multi-player platform.  This has great potential, but at the moment I'm regretting the purchase and cannot honestly recommend it.			"

Sometimes the game breaks the rules in frustrating ways (spells targeting untargetable opponents, characters being unable to use abilities when they should be able to, cards that should only be used a limited number of times never disappearing from the board, etc.)  So far, every game I've played has had at least one bug that breached the rules.  They can be mildly amusing at best but game-breaking at worst.  The frequency of these bugs is the problem, as they wouldn't be much of an issue if it was just occasional.

												The Game works well enough, but casting spells when you want to is a complete and utter fail. Half the time when I 'queue' a spell it ends up casting on the wrong target because you can't stop it casting once it goes (which isn't at all how the real game plays, it is a pure limitation of the design of the game)I think I'll try and find a version on table top simulator instead, It won't be automatic, but at least I can actually do what I want to.

												I want to like this game, and I'm trying. I had the boardgame version of Talisman and several of its expansions years ago, and played it a lot. The biggest problem I've encountered with this version is the usability. Spell casting, for example, is kind of dreadful. Several times I have tried to cast spells--even after learning the system of queueing spells--and had them not cast; I have accidentally cast spells when I simply wanted to read the text to see what they do, wasting them; and I have tried casting spells at the times that are indicated in the text, only to find out, nope, that was not the right time to cast it.Important information text from the game is ill placed at the top of the screen in a box that is not prominent and doesn't stand out. There are an awful lot of confirmation clicks as well--too many in some cases. Also, sometimes the confirmation text is not the best. For example, when you're learning the game and you view your followers, the ""Dismiss"" option can leave you wondering, Wait, will that dismiss my follower? Dismiss is a term in gaming that, in my experience, has always been used to get rid of followers. A better term for getting rid of message windows is simply ""Close."" I hope there are improvements to the game design. I find myself more often frustrated than having fun when I play it currently.			"

												I love the Talisman boardgame but the digital edition is a pure stinker! The spell casting mechanic is truly busted. I understand the devs wanted to make sure the game was fast paced when spell casting and that it would not cause people to start guessing when someone wished to cast a spell but the whole mechanic is awful. Here's why:The only way to cast spells as a reaction is to queue them at which point they will automatically go off regardless if the spell is needed or not. For instance if you have a spell that would give you an edge before a combat roll and you've queued it up, it will automatically be cast at the next combat instance you're in which is a terrible mechanic. And as far as I know you can only queue 1 spell so any other spells you have are worthless if you would normally be able to cast them in a situation that would be helpful.My recommendation: Stay away from the digital version and buy the actual boardgame.

												I didn't really have any fun with this game. It mostly consists of a lot of random dice rolls, lots of redundant clicking, and obfuscated information.The overall gameplay feels like being on the cusp of winning a game of trivial pursuit, but you can't role the exact dice roll needed to land in the center of board. Or perhaps like a game of Chutes & Ladders where you never know whether you're going to go up or down.The physical board game is probably much more fun. This game is probably also more fun if you're playing with some friends.The game is a ""traditional American"" board game, where most of the gameplay is determined by random events, with very little choice left up to the player for how the game progresses. Random events can completely make or break the game for you.There is some player interaction in the way of being able to cast counter spells during another player's turn, but the UI and digital game mechanics here are a bit wonky. The overall UI in fact is a bit wonky, in that it takes 5 clicks to complete every action or view any piece of information.I think I picked this game up while on sale for 99 cents, and I'm glad I didn't pay any more for it. If you like the random dice role and random card drawing type of game, and are willing to tolerate the cumbersome UI, then you might want to give it a go, but I still don't recommend paying more than a couple dollars for it.

												If you desire a single- or local-player experience with a faithful and loyal recreation of one of the most treasured board games Games Workshop ever created, are interested in digital versions of board games for their ease of accessibility and how versatile they can be when playing with others/with yourself and some AI's, or even if you just want a good time-killer that you can come back to at any time when you wish to resume a game (a feature not currently available for the actual board game, I might add, without manual note-taking!) then I cannot recommend this enough.I expect a lot are asking ""Then why are you not recommending this game?"" It is a fair question: It is a very enjoyable board game, and a faithful recreation of the original source material. The gameplay is everything you would expect: Easy to pick up and play, harder to master, and the randomness of the card draws, the dice rolls and the shape of the board presence after about 50 turns in (and you will be playing more than this locally) means that no two games are ever the same in any playthrough, and victory is never certain: A risk-taking AI or one that gets better luck with their dice rolls could always be one step ahead of you, but there's always some way or another for the AI to be betrayed or lose their advantage, given the numerous random events that can transpire in the course of a game.Why can I not recommend this game? Most who've played the board game or those who know how board games work in general know that it's better to play with friends. Unless you're willing to pass a laptop around - or play hot potato with the seat where your desktop is hiding out - the ability to play with friends since the 25th or so has nosedived. A quick look at the bug reporting section of the forums gives all the confirmation you may need: The change to the back-end of their online component has a lot of issues following a shift from a Steam-dependent component. I don't know why this change wasn't tested out before releasing it to the public (assuming that development costs aren't an issue) but it doesn't change the current state of the online component right now: A broken, unstable mess.Having played several games online with the friends I also bought the game for, I got to experience some of these issues first-hand: Gameplay freezes after casting certain spells, the AI refuses to move in a timely manner in online games, starting up online games can sometimes be problematic to the point that you have to recreate the room (I always made mine private, but I would imagine this issue becomes worse for public rooms) and I've even experienced a crash in the 15-ish hours I've played this game online - or at least attempted to without any of these problems arising. Out of seven games, I only managed to have two completed: One was a two-player game, another a three-player that the other two players were forced to drop out of because they ended up having issues.So to reiterate: In it's current state, this game is not completable online, in some cases it might not even be playable online. If you just want to play with your friends around the party table on a laptop or want to kill some time by yourself playing against some AI's, then this is a faithful recreation of the board game that you will get plenty of hours of enjoyment from (and given how the other 15 hours have been single-player and without any issues at all, I have no doubt of this). If you are, however, looking to play with friends over an online connection or have any desire to use the online component at all, then I have to recommend that you hold off until the issue is resolved with it's online component, as it is not in any fit state to be worth your time or your money.

The object of the game is that you have to reach the middle of the board and kick other players out of this. Each character has their own set of Health/fighting power/Gold/Fate/craft and abilities. Some even could have an alignment to be Neutral/Evil and good. You have to fight enemies and get followers.There are cards to make things better or worse for you. You have to make your character powerful in order to defeat the bridge boss (unless you have found another way to enter inside the middle area).  Winning from an enemy character gives you the option to steal 1 item, take gold or let them lose one life point.MANY CHARACTERS,Killing enemies gives you their card and may be used to make yourself powerful if having enough of these cards.You are able to speed up turns from the AI in the ADVANCED OPTIONS menu.Game is sort of addictive.Music soundtrack is good.Calming game.There is a pause button.Other things.This game gives me the ""jumanji"" Feelings from the movie.The game at the bottom will glow yellow whenever it is your turn.Random AI like to choose the same characters in a game.Game feel sometimes rigged and could give you a nice disadvantage.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												I own this game and I still want to play it! Single player and round robin work fine as far as I know, both still having small bugs here and there but I bought this to play ONLINE and guess what? You can't get through a single match to the end (at least I haven't). It's just so terribly disappointing. I want to like this game but they snatch those hopes away from me. It's a freakin board game, it's not like we're asking you to code a real time fps and it's still unplayable. Avoid this game until they fix it...if they fix it			"

												maybe if you can play with your friends this simple game can be fun, but the ai rng rolls are the most rigged ive ever seen in any video game in 30+ years of gaming.  Not only does it roll favorably, but it can get the EXACT number on a dice it wants 4-5 times in a row while your rolls actually seem random.I also have a problem with how some of the abilities and spells.  Its just really confusing seemingly needlessly.			"

												Endgame is disapointing.  I was on the final space with one health but no one else was even on the 2nd area.  took way too many turns to win as I needed to continue to roll with 50% odds to deal 1 damage to everyone else... even though they can heal or counterspell me.  so about 20 turns later I win.  Fun until you think your going to win.			"

												+: Talisman is a recreation of the famous board game Talisman on PC with online multiplayer for up to 4 players. If you don't know what Talisman is I'll sum it up real quick: turn based brain dead easy to play fantasy RPG inspired board game that revolves around basically 99% luck. Skill does matter to a degree, but you can and will get completely destroyed by unlucky dice rolls again, and again, and again, and again. This is not a competitive skill based game and it is highly recommended you play it when you are drunk/high/give no ♥♥♥♥s otherwise your friends will get mad at you when all their dice rolls are going great and then you proceed to steal all their stuff and win while doing absolutely nothing other than steal all their stuff.+: The game is mostly stable after several updates and performs great although it'd be impressive if it didn't considering it's a simplistic game.+: The DLC works similar to PAYDAY 2 where if one person has it everyone in the same game as that person also has it except for the character classes.-: If you buy this game even though you hate luck based game you're gonna have a bad time.-: Games do take a long amount of time, upwards of 4+ hours at times. Especially with the expansions on.-: The expansion DLCs come out so slow. :(			"

												This game isnt enjoyable without the expansions so if you want to buy it buy at least 2 expansions with it. Vanilla just seems boring,. If you dont like rng then i dont recommender it. And the game has a little balance issues but if you are playing with friends than you can just play without the overpowered weapons/characters so its ok.			"

												EDIT: The online multiplayer is much better now. At least you can continue a game after getting disconnected.I can't recommend this game yet, unless you want to buy it for offline play. The online multiplayer is buggy. Connection issues and game crashes are common enough to avoid you from finishing a game. Even though a host can still resume the game after crashing, he or she can't invite friends to join again. The ""resume game"" feature is pretty much useless for online play. I doubt the fix will come soon since the devs seem to want to release DLCs first before fixing the game.			"

												10 plus stars on a scale of 1 - 10 ---- And I dont post reviews for many games just if they are a ripoff are a super hit.This game and Rogue Legacy are my two fav games now on steam and I have right at 100.This game is simply awesome - I wish more classic board games would come to Steam- Like D@D Board Games.Keeps you thinking, massive rules which I like, I wanna think when I play and Tailsman has that strategy game aspect perfected, also easy to find multiplayer so far. But keep in mind Tailsman is a long game so a multi[player game could take 2 hours but rules can be adjusted to speed game up -- I am having plenty of fun just playing AI and gaining experience to get runestones. Also AI games can be saved and started right back up if you don't wanna play through all at once.Get the season pass I would of in retrospect gives you access to all DLC and with new characters  and expansions and more planned for soon release I would of saved more. Also unlike a lot of Steam games I encounter the creators of this game actually update and expand.I hate new games you play once and developers take theri money and run with no concern for customers----Tailsman Does not do this--- my guess is because the physical board game Tailsman has a huge following like Axis and Allies and that they truly care.The only downside is I think the graphics could be a little crisper or HD like  I guess but I understand need to stay true to game.10 out of 10 for me. Thanks Talisman Digital Team and please keep up updates and expansions and you will get my thx and dollars.			"

The game can drag on quite a bit due to it's RNG... but it's the fun type of RNG, so that's totally okay!The goal of the game is simple. You must be the first one to reach the middle. In the vanila version, you have the crown of command there, which will do damage to each other character 50% of the times (based on a d6 roll). Characters normaly respawn/get rerolled when they die, but not when someone is in the middle. If one player is left on the board, they win.The game features quite a lot of characters to choose from. They all have their own set of stats, aswell as a set of special abilities of which some are shared, while others are unique. The most fun way to play, though, is that everyone starts with a random character and upon death they get a new, random character! During the game you will encounter many different kinds of events, monsters and items. The more expansions you have, the more random and sometimes deadly the game becomes.I would say, if you aren't sure about buying this one. First buy the vanila version only. Once you know if you'll like it, feel free to buy the rest of the DLC, they're all worth it. Though you do not need the Runestone Deck DLC, you can unlock these ingame as far as I know.Edit: The runestones basicly give you boosts to your character: you can start with more in a stat or you can more easily upgrade your character and so forth.

												(old review from last year):____________________________________________________________All the people that have voted downt his game for it being unstable need to update there stuff. The game is being ever improved and i think its unfair to have these lingering reviews about its early phase just laying around stinking up the place. I've only played the vanila game but i've enjoyed every hour of it...well every hour i wasn't a dam toad. Online games are only unstable when you get a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ that leaves cause hes not winning. The only time a person leaving was ""maybe"" justified was this fellow that was toaded 4 times within like 10 turns. He had the worse fate rolls I've ever seen lol. Other then that though MAKE FREINDS! I just started freinding people who stick threw games to the bitter end. I expect my list to grow as i add more hours to the ticker. IF you want a more Fact based review: Its a fantasy game that feels like a mix of magic the gathering and D&D. Granted its more ""shallow"" forms of the two but threw the Hybrid style of play it becomes deep. THIS GAME NEEDS CONTEND and it gets it threw the expansions.How do i know this? GUESS WHAT! if one person who owns all the expansions sets up a game then you don't need them to still play and enjoy the expansions. Granted its a little jaring to suddenly have new characters and endings but its also a very fun renewal to adventure. Also its a great way to see if you give a dam about the 5$ dlc or not. ________________________________________________________________________________UPDATE 4/3/15: So wow this game finaly has the content it needs(as DLC mind you). As of writing this its only 5$ and free to play for the weekend. This is a god dam gem right now for this price. I still hate all the DLC but if you add the expansions (not individual character dlc) it comes to a modest 25-30$. I still have yet to see a justification for a 60$ seasons pass unless you must have EVERY ounce of DLC for this game. All gripes aside. Get it for you and your freinds. Enjoy it. Turn into a taod or maybe slay a vile Cold hearted queen. Whatever you do, do not go in that dungeon early game...It will make or break you adventure.			"

Other then that though MAKE FREINDS! I just started freinding people who stick threw games to the bitter end. I expect my list to grow as i add more hours to the ticker. IF you want a more Fact based review: Its a fantasy game that feels like a mix of magic the gathering and D&D. Granted its more ""shallow"" forms of the two but threw the Hybrid style of play it becomes deep. THIS GAME NEEDS CONTEND and it gets it threw the expansions.How do i know this? GUESS WHAT! if one person who owns all the expansions sets up a game then you don't need them to still play and enjoy the expansions. Granted its a little jaring to suddenly have new characters and endings but its also a very fun renewal to adventure. Also its a great way to see if you give a dam about the 5$ dlc or not. ________________________________________________________________________________UPDATE 4/3/15: So wow this game finaly has the content it needs(as DLC mind you). As of writing this its only 5$ and free to play for the weekend. This is a god dam gem right now for this price. I still hate all the DLC but if you add the expansions (not individual character dlc) it comes to a modest 25-30$. I still have yet to see a justification for a 60$ seasons pass unless you must have EVERY ounce of DLC for this game. All gripes aside. Get it for you and your freinds. Enjoy it. Turn into a taod or maybe slay a vile Cold hearted queen. Whatever you do, do not go in that dungeon early game...It will make or break you adventure.			"

												A must have for any true board game fan. Its also great fun and probally without this game's idea's you could forget most of those great warhammer games, skyrim, baldurs gate and kiss them all goodbye.Update: 23 September 2014.Considering the games time of release, the frequent bugs, latency issues and eagerness to release downloadable content (individual character cards which are not actually offical board game game cards. Whilst not addressing bug issues first, has resulted in compounding errors/crashes due to adding cards from introduced cards from the expansions that have not been coded properly to new merge abilties for example with older ones.Update 2/12/2014Since the Dungeon Expansion...I recommend this game now on the basis the decks are a lot better, the new board and characters are amazing. A lot of bugs have been fixed (still a few kicking around). House rules implimented including the ""standard character"" rule for true fans who do not wish for the overpriced $2 dlc cards pay to win implimented. Another great feature is now you can add and remove players while in lobby instead of totally rehosting. Not only to mention that players who only have the base game can join any game and still use all the dlc so long as the host has provided them. This paves way for those who really like the game and encourages those not sure to buy the base first and not feel being ripped off so bad.I would recommend buying this, and make sure the dungeon is on!

												I love the physical boardgame and the digital edition is just as nice. It's a good solution if people can't come to your place to play and people don't fight over the rulebook or tell you ""you can't do that"". It's not completely finished and there are bugs here and there but it's still alot of fun and worth the money. The bots will sometimes do less smart things and it's possible for more than 1 player to play the same character but that can easily be overlooked.			"

The graphics are good (not brilliant but do the job), however the artwork on the cards is outstanding. The soundtrack is nothing out of the ordinary but good enough.  The sound effects are ie rolling die are nice and well done.  We have had no problems with crashes, we,ve been able to save and resume.  I recomend it! Its gentle fun, relaxing and highly entertaining with a friend/son!			"

												Not sure how anyone could be so bitter about this game. It's one of the best online board games you can play with your friends, you can save and play over multiple sittings and despite what a lot of vocal people say; there really aren't game breaking bugs.I never pictured myself even playing a board game, and I was hooked from the minute I picked it up. I'm used to playing highly competitive shooters and the like, so if I can enjoy it, almost anyone can. Also a big fan of DND/Battletech games so it's not as if it's so dumbed down you can't enjoy it, it's good fun to have with some friends without being overly complicated.			"

												First, let me say that I've only played this solo and know nothing about the multiplayer functionality.There seems to be something really wrong with the random number generator in this game. When making choices, you often have to consider the odds of an awful thing happening. Yet, even when the ONLY way something bad can happen is if I roll two 1's in a row, that's what WILL happen... and it doesn't happen infrequently. It happens over and over and over again. I've only EVER been able to get into the middle track once and no matter what character I play, the computer controlled players get nearly all good luck and I get nearly all bad luck. Frankly, it doesn't even feel like luck. It feels like the computer is actively controlling the dice rolls so it can hose me. For example, the dice rolls are always causing me to lose everything, yet I've never seen a computer controlled player lose their belongings. Immediately after losing everything, one of the computer controlled players WILL roll exactly what they need to land on that square and collect everything I lost.While the boardgame is recreated decently, with a colorful board and characters, the result is stagnant, lifeless, and uninspired. There is a lot that could have been done to graphically enhance the game for a computer via animated cards and board and combat, but the developers chose not to do anything but reproduce the board and the cards exactly as they would appear when playing around a table.  Why they didn't enhance the computer version with effects and animation is a mystery. It's like the developers had no imagination. Since it is so exacting the better choice is to buy the boardgame. The only thing the 'Digital Edition"" offers that is different from the original is the ability to play Talisman with people who aren't in the same room. The user interface is simply horrible. Every moment of every turn is stretched out into a laborious sequence of moving and clicking. The game control elements are spread out all over the screen, so you have to move the mouse from one end of the screen to the other whenever an option is presented, rather than keeping the interface elements near one another so they are easy to use.Others have reported a plethora of bugs. I can't say I've really encountered any, but then I've never actually played much beyond the beginning of any game. My 'luck' is SO bad that I can barely get started before I'm so far behind that catching up is impossible. It isn't much fun to continue playing when losing is a foregone conclusion, so I end up quitting to play something that is actually entertaining.			"

												Talisman is a classic fantasy-themed board game that's been around since before most people had computers.  It has something of a cult-like status among fans but tends to polarise opinion in board game circles, with the main critisism being that it's overly dependent on luck at the expense of strategy.  I like to refer to it as fantasy Monopoly, where instead of property you go around collecting objects and followers (and battle enemy monsters and players) until you're powerful enough to win the game.Despite its detractors, Talisman maintains a passionate, loyal and extremely devoted following.  Like Monopoly, its appeal lies in its simple, light-hearted and accessible nature.  It isn't too complicated, difficult or overly strategic.  That's not to say there aren't strategic elements however and new players wiil struggle when playing against seasoned pros.  But it's still a game you can wistfullly play while the hours pass by (and I do mean hours) without having to think too hard.Talisman benefits enormously from the digital transition, which has been implemented quite well.  The main critisism is that AI players are fairly weak and never pose much of a threat.  It used to be that the AI would often make incredibly stupid decisions, however this has improved somewhat.  If you prefer a challenge, there's a robust online community of players who provide far greater competition.  I was pleasently surprised by the friendliness in the Talisman community.It should be noted that the base game is a little bare and Talisman benefits when played with some, if not all the currently available expansions.  The season pass is a little pricey, but well worth it if you can get it on sale.  Given the number of characters and expansions I can't recommend buying them separetely, you really have to go all in and get the season pass if you want the extra content.In summary, if you appreciate light-hearted and fun games that anyone can pick up, or enjoy board games with great artwork on the board and cards then I can highly recommend Talisman.  I have over 200 hours logged so far as evidence that it's a fun and addictive distraction and great to take your mind off things.			"

If you like board games that never get old, and that never play the same way twice, this one's for you.			"

												This is the basic game (I believe).  I discovered there are lots of expansions and even additional characters you can buy to enhance your gameplay.  But let me just say, I was a fan of the board game and played it probably 25 years ago.  I was excited to see it brought to life online and buying it did NOT disappoint.  If you played the board game and loved it, you'll love this!  If you've never played the board game, give it a try.  It's a charming fantasy world set game with twists and turns unlike any game.  Just when you think you're dominating your opponents, you can draw a card that changes everything.  Likewise for your opponents as well.  :)			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. First of all it is an alright adaptation of the game and it's as much fun to play as the board game, but there are a few bad points about it. 1) you cant see the board. only a crooked perspective that is far away or a zoom on one single field so it is really annoyingly hard to check out the board and the cards on it. 2) there are a lot of bugs and the game crashes sometimes when you use magic 3) the controls are bad. Often players do stuff they dont want to do because of that. It could be so simple, but they chose to make it complicated. 4) there is no punishment for leaving a game (like 30 min ban or so) so players ALWAYS leave when they draw a bad card, role a 1 or think they lose or have a bad character and so on. You will hardly ever finish a game online without players leaving.			"

												A great adaptation of the physical board game, and then some.Additional house rules available, plenty of character variety, true-to-the-original game play, and adequate production values make it a great digital version of the physical game.I find overall its somewhat expensive, with extra characters costing 2 dollars each and mini-expansions 6.  The season pass is 60 bucks and is supposed to offer a savings so, that gives you an idea of the price of DLC.I LOATHE the spell system though, it needed to be done differently. More often than not any 'questionable' spells (ie ones that play during others turns or counterspells) often result in mistakes or missed opportunities.  I definitely consider this a con.Overprices and terrible spell system aside, any fan of the board game should be nothing short of pleased with the digital version.  Though, perhaps finding it on sale would be wise.I'd give it a 7/10.  Its true talisman. But its also games workshop, hence its over priced.			"

No dice to lose, no cards to shuffle, no minis to step on. So over all, worth it for me. However if you don't like boardgames you may want to give it a pass.			"

												What a fantastic surprise! I've never heard of our played Talisman tabletop, but this turned out to be a BLAST for my wife and I. I got it with a bundle and gave it a try, and got sucked in quite terribly. For those of you who are as unfamiliar with Talisman as I was, It's essentially a ye old RPG in tabletop format. You pick your class, which offers different advantages per which class you choose, roll dice, move about the board, and do as the spaces require.  You collect gold, items, spells, armor, weapons and other items along the way. The ONE gripe I have with this game is that the dice mechanics are not completely random. They're favored for the AI and against you. They will often roll exactly what they need, and you'll roll exactly what you didn't want. This gets aggravating. I don't understand why the dice couldn't have been completely random? Otherwise, the game is a blast, especially with others. "

												I have long played the boardgame, and I like it very much, so here is my take on the digital version.- Even with accelerated AI waiting for the bots to play is boring- There is no obvious mechanism to backpedal when you make a mistake and are, for example, about to cast a hostile spell on yourself- I thought I had won after I defeated the troll above the crown of commandment, but his loot on the ground (axe, etc) actually prevented me from accessing the crown. I could not move back in the Inner Region to drop some loot either, so I had to quit the game.The game is recent and these problems can be fixed later on, of course.			"

												Having never played the original board game, I actually just purchased this on a whim.  SOOOOOO glad I did.  My friends and I have a blast playing (I got a four pack) and I absolutely love the myriad of characters/classes.  Playing on random character choice is fun, though the AI has a thing for picking the Exorcist and excelling at it.  I once played a game where I eventually dispatched his Exorcist, forcing him to choose from 3 new classes, but he pratically gave up on his next choice (lasting a total of 3 turns) and the one after that!  His third set of classes included... yep, you guessed it: another Exorcist.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had snatched up all the Talismans, he might have won, garnering a large amount of strength, but after busting through and snatching a talisman from me, he lost his last two lives in the Vampire's lair.  Positioned strongly with a Marter with a massive amount of strength, I destroyed the Ice Queen and finally finished the game.The computer AI in this game is great, but it seems a little cheap sometimes.  I'd like the ability to tweek the AI (unless I'm missing a portion in the options where you can) and a more stable online multiplayer (I've only had it mess up once for me, but I hear others complaining) but this game was worth every penny, and then some.  I got the Season Pass; all the extra content is great.  I highly recommend this for board game entusiasts or anyone looking for a great game to play, online or against AI.  Don't miss out on getting the season pass, either.  There are a TON of extras included, and it's not even halfway finished with it's ""season"" (you get every DLC that comes past, present, and future).  With the Highlands coming out (a new region, making a total of two additional regions (dungeon and highlands) on top of the basic board, you won't want to miss out on the extra adventure and danger!  Also, any DLC the host presents in their game, you'll be able to access (this includes characters and extra regions/cards) in their game.  If you plan on hosting games with your friends, DLC is a must have!  Trust me, the game is worth your money, and it's gotten me interested in getting the physical version for pure collection reasons!EDITS: Grammer (I'm sure there's still some mistakes) and reviews on DLC info.

												It still needs some fixes, but honestly... why so negative reviews? The game is awesome and we are getting more and more content. I just can't wait till we get The Blood Moon :) Because of this game I'm buing more and more board expansions to play in real life with my friends. This isn't game for everyone (people rolling 1 will rage quit :D ) , but you should give it a try.			"

												10 plus stars on a scale of 1 - 10 ---- And I dont post reviews for many games just if they are a ripoff are a super hit.This game and Rogue Legacy are my two fav games now on steam and I have right at 100.This game is simply awesome - I wish more classic board games would come to Steam- Like D@D Board Games.Keeps you thinking, massive rules which I like, I wanna think when I play and Tailsman has that strategy game aspect perfected, also easy to find multiplayer so far. But keep in mind Tailsman is a long game so a multi[player game could take 2 hours but rules can be adjusted to speed game up -- I am having plenty of fun just playing AI and gaining experience to get runestones. Also AI games can be saved and started right back up if you don't wanna play through all at once.Get the season pass I would of in retrospect gives you access to all DLC and with new characters  and expansions and more planned for soon release I would of saved more. Also unlike a lot of Steam games I encounter the creators of this game actually update and expand.I hate new games you play once and developers take theri money and run with no concern for customers----Tailsman Does not do this--- my guess is because the physical board game Tailsman has a huge following like Axis and Allies and that they truly care.The only downside is I think the graphics could be a little crisper or HD like  I guess but I understand need to stay true to game.10 out of 10 for me. Thanks Talisman Digital Team and please keep up updates and expansions and you will get my thx and dollars.			"

												I find it hard to either recommend or not recommend this game, because:Pros:1. Brilliant conversion of a board game to digital form. Very polished.2. Fun to play, especially suits a mood where you want to chill out.3. Excellent if you have a group of friends to play with.  Not only is it always more fun to play with people you know, but it avoids the problem of players disconnecting (a group of friends will rarely abandon the game they start, whereas the opposite cannot be said).Cons:1. After the first 30 minutes approximately, I always get bored. Every single time. I just feel like quitting and going and doing something else. Exception is where my real-life friends are in the game.2. Rolling one die each turn for movement can be very annoying.  Often you are very eager to land on a particular square, and you need to go through a painful, painful, grind to roll the number you need. To be fair, you can choose to move in either direction, but still it is a slow and painful grind to arrive where you want to. Very frustrating.			"

												I'd never played the original Talisman, but the premise of it looks very very nice. It's a great game for getting your friends together for an old-school dice-rollin', card drawing good time, and there -is- some strategy involved or you're going to get quickly left in the dust. This still needs to be polished (the AI especially, is -real- dumb) and as of this writing the multiplayer is buggy as hell, dropping people and lagging out. However I'm willing to keep playing, I have faith in this game based on what I've seen and over time I'm sure the bugs will be squished and this will turn out to be a VERY enjoyable game with friends.

												One of the best board games thats been around for years! For anyone crying about dice or the AI cheating.....Its a dice game that involves luck and skill!......I have won some and lost some...yes its a long game but what did you expect? Its not a fast and win game but if you like chess,family night,fantasy,strategy or If you have ever played games like hero quest back in the day then this game is for you! I think they did a wonderful job rebuilding a gem that..... 1. it dont cost as much  2. you dont have to put up or tear down! 3. you have A.I so you can play by yourself. 4. you can take the game online to play with others. 5. you or anyone playing cant cheat even If you wanted to?  and 6.  ITS TALISMAN FOR GODS SAKE!!!.........don't hate participate!			"

It even supports 4 local players and some common house rules.Advantages of the digital version:-Cheaper: even without a Steam sale, you can buy the Gold Pack which is basically the same as buying the board game and EVERY expansion, for closer to the price of the board game and a single expansion.-Portability: It's easier to carry around a laptop than several boxes.-Easy to setup and cleanup-Solo play: if you can't get a game night going, you can play with up to three AI players.-Online play: Play with your friends online.  Or play with strangers.  Whatever floats your boat.-New characters that I don't recall being in the board gameDisadvantages of the Digital Edition-New characters are DLC-4 player only (my gaming group is 5)-Sometimes it's harder to see what's on the board or your inventory when it's not laid out in front of you.On the whole, if you're  a fan of the board game, I highly recommend the Digital Edition.

												I love boardgames. I really do. I've never played Talisman, though. And this might be one of the reasons I absolutely hated playing this game.  Being a rulesmonger, I usually read all rules before playing a game. Twice. Maybe even 3 times. And this might very well be the 2nd reason I hated playing this game.The game does an extremely poor job of telling you the rules and give you any sort of insight as to what might happen on the different tiles on the board. I was left with playing blind and ended up just walking away, since the computer controlled characters decided they all wanted to bash on me, so I kept loosing turn after turn, effectively turning the ""game"" into a slideshow.I trust the game will work out to be a lot more fun if you already know what it's all about, but I have no way to tell. My recommendation is therefor this: If you don't know the game, stay away from it. I just doesn't work as a stand-alone product.			"

												Well...the servers don't seem to work most of the time (rather chaotic in nature), it takes a hell of a long time to actually finish a game, and...well, while I didn't thumb it down for this reason, but playing against the computer just isn't fun. Even in encounters when there are plenty of players. It feels like their RNG is artificially weighted to just RUIN the human players. In several games, I've felt the overwhelming desire to ragequit simply because the game forces me into losing STUPID, nearly impossible to lose fights, even after spending points of Fate to reroll once. For the amount they're asking, not really worth it. I got it a Humble Bundle for like...15 cents. But yeah, not really that great of a board game title. Get Ticket to Ride instead.			"

												The UI for this game is very, very poor. The game itself is fine, but the overall experience is ruined by how clunky and devoid of necessary information the UI is.Also, towards the end of a game, the AI characters being slowly murdered will just run around the board restoring their own life whilst never actually doing anything to pose a threat to you, needlessly and boringly extending the game.Buy the physical version, if you like.

												I'm so confused on how this game has ""Mostly Positive"". This game doesn't even work MOST the time. I""ve tried to play this game with friends close to 10 times. In those 10 games maybe 2 of them made it to conclusion without kicking someone out. I am not exaggerating. And yes now they have made it to where you can rejoin, but apparently that only works sometimes. I want to love this game. I love the board game and it has done it justice in gameplay, but how are people putting 1000+ hours into a game they can't keep all their friends in for a full round? If the game gets fixed we would love to play it, but I'm tired of investing hours into a single game and then not even being able to finish.			"

												It's astonishing how boring and badly designed Talisman is. I've played the tabletop version of Talisman before and always thought it was an awful game. I love board games, have dozens of them, but Talisman... It takes the features of games like Monopoly and other trail games and try to entice you with a mildly interesting (though generic) fantasy setting, but the truth is it remains as boring, flawed and outdated as Monopoly itself. The game may drag for hours and hours without an ending in sight and everything is about randomness. There's no skill involved playing in Talisman, all you can do push your luck in a general direction and hope for the best. I understand why a game like this would be popular 20 or 30 years ago, but today we have plenty of better board (and digital) games to play. Maybe *huge* fans of Mario Party would enjoy playing digital Talisman, but I just can't recommend it to anyone else. You want to play ""digital board games"" on Steam? Grab ""Small World 2"", ""Ticket to Ride"" or anything else, but stay away from Talisman.			"

												A great game with great bugs. We play with friends through Steam, hit the break, then we try to continue after two days, and we either can't connect or have other issues, like after joining game, players can't control their heroes or get disconnected.And I waited patiently for like 5 months, thinking, ""hey, a lot of people bought this game to play online with friends, I am sure someone will fix this"". 5 months passed, the issue persists, devs just don't care. I don't care anymore, I only whish I had not bought DLCs and filled their pockets, as I got nothing in return. If someone was manufacturing cars that don't run properly, they'd be sued and had to recompensate. Looks like we, gamers are second-grade customers. That's sad.EDIT: December 2015, still random crashes, bugs, but they launch another add-on. Whitout fixingactual game. Money-grabbers.			"

												Talisman is originally a board game developed by Games Workshop.  They are a prominent maker of board game, card, and miniature style games.  The first edition of this title was released in 1983.  Talisman Digital Edition is actually based on the revised fourth edition rules which were released Dec. 17th, 2008.  This revised edition was released with 9 core expansion packs for the board game.  The maker of this game, Nomad Games, does plan on converting all of those expansion packs to the PC version of the game.30 Second Review+ 14 Unique playable models to choose from.  They took great care in the level of detail Nomad Games brought to each model, which is very important considering this is a Games Workshop product.+ Easy to understand interface.+ Excellent hints and tutorial pop ups.- An extreme amount of DLC is planned.  May be too much for some people.- Easy AI.Click this link to read more!http://everydaygamers.com/2014/03/10/review-talisman-digital-edition/#more-29260 "

												Talisman's first edition, with many of its expansions, ate up a lot of my time as a regular board game. This digital edition includes both classic rules and new edition rules, plus many more expansions are coming out. They're ironing out details of the main game now, the Reaper expansion is out, and many characters are available to play. This game can be played single player against one or several computer opponents, or it can be played online. I haven't tried the online play because I'm too chicken and get interrupted a lot, but it looks like a lot of time and effort is being put in by the developers to polish it up. The game itself is pretty, simple to control, and all the fun I remember, except for smack talk when dealing with AI opponents.			"

												Awesome! A faithful reproduction of a classic board game. The community is kind of small though, that would be the onlydownside, it can be hard to find a table. The AI is good enough to play a good match. Fate is unfortunatly not always on your side. But with a group of friends this is one of the best board games ever!If you don't own this digital or the IRL board game get it for your next game night and try and keep from buying all the expansions.

												I wanted to play something a bit more relaxing. Something where I could walk away from the computer and not get killed in two seconds like a first person shooter. I bought Talisman and it was alright. Then I got the Reaper expansion and I'm ABSOLUTELY HOOKED. I can't wait to get the expansions. I reccomend it for anyone looking for a break from first person shooters and the like.			"

												For those of us old enough to have played the original boardgame, Rejoice. This is an awesome port. For those of you who have never played this game: A casual board game this may appear to be but its design is deceptively complex both in layout and player interactions. Chess is to Speed Chess as D&D is to Talisman. Espececially so If you love giving grief to your fellow payers. This game will enable you to stress test friendships and ragequit thresholds repeatedly and with ease.			"

												I'm on the fence about recommending this, I like it, I think it's fun, but 9 times out of 13 I have no idea what the AI players are doing (they'll keep casting spells on the crappy merchant with no items despite two players being incredibly strong or they'll find a good follower and just leave it for some reason), and probably about half my online games had random desyncs or disconnects (likely a player's fault, but still, it's not like drop-in drop-out).It's a board game where you try to get stats and items to be the best and win the game.I like it.

												Adventure board game relying strongly on luck. Clunky UI makes playing a harsh experience. Others mentioned that this was a mobile port and it shows. Settings are limited and it will reset some of the options every time you restart the game. Some features, like speeding up or skipping animations are not available, which tends to drag games even longer than required.Has some technical issues. With nearly 10 hours gametime, there has been couple crashes. Also, one friend kept having connection issues for unknown reason. Luckily, the session can be restored but it still requires extra time. Cashing on too many DLCs and extra junk that could have been easily bundled in bigger packages. Luckily, only the server has to buy them so that others can play with additional content. Some of the characters are much stronger than others which brings balancing issues.Core game mechanic relies too heavily on dice, especially in the early game. As most of the actions are ruled by the dice, one can find hero facing only dragons, giants and ogres with their two point strength weakling. This results in frustration as the player cannot really do anything except pray for better luck. Situation becomes ever worse with the DLCs as they bring even more monsters which makes encounters even more random. Core game could use separate decks for outer and middle regions. This way outer region could give more certain, but slow, early progress and middle region faster but more risky way.Usually some of the players get lucky in the early game and snowball out of control. When hero gets enough resources, they start to win battles automatically which makes them even stronger. Single game can easily last two hours as the early winning players makes certain that they are unbeatable until finishing the game.Summary: technically shoddy and somewhat lacking playing experience. Can be fun with friends. Recommended only for Talisman fanatics. Others should avoid or enjoy the life as a toad.			"

												Talisman.  A staple board game of most RPG players.  This digital adaption is fun to play and seems to be as faithful to the board game as you can be.  However, my group of friends and I have never been able to complete a game.  30-60 minutes in some bug rears its head and forces us to exit.  Sometimes, you cannot roll the dice, end the turn, or activate an ability/card.  Other times, someone just falls out of the game and the AI pickes up the spot.  If the devs could solve this problem, I see a great game becoming better.			"

												The digital edition is pretty buggy and requires some serious patching. I recently played a game with my partner against 2 bots (a Minstrel & Druid) and we clearly dispatched one of the bots (Read: 0 life) . It was very disturbing to see the ""undead"" Minstrel ""respawn"" with full life on it's next turn and continue to roam the board to wreak havoc. We also noticed that the bots have an uncanny preference of keeping talismans in their stash (Read: 3 numbers) and ignoring the other better gears like the Solomon's crown, Belt of Strength, etc upon winning a player encounter. Please fix the AI of the bots to make this a better game.			"

												It's a nearly exact implementation of the board game with the expansions as DLC.If you don't like the idea of clicking on dice to roll them and waiting for animations and for AIs to take their turn (a little too realistic implementation of the original) then it's not for you, or me.If you wanted the board game in an electronic form, this is it.

												I've been playing the table top version of this game for about 24 years and it has always been one of my favorites.  The Digital Edition is an exceptional recreation of the board game.  Great graphics and sound.  The board and art on the cards is excellent.  The miniatures are painted beautifully.  The interface is nice and very easy to work with.  There is nothing I don't love about this game and now with multiplayer, you can play with those friends that no longer live close enough to start up a game with.  One reason I have always liked this game is that it is very approachable.  No complicated rules or in depth manuals etc.  Anyone can play this for the first time and enjoy every minute of it with little to no learning curve.  REAPER EXPANSION:  20+ years ago they had different expansions than today and I was originally disappointed that they were gone and new ones had been made.  My disappointment was for nothing.  The Reaper Expansion is an excellent addition to the original game that you can toggle on and off as you like.  It adds new characters, events, spells, etc. to the game not to mention the Grim Reaper that can make or break your day if you encounter him.  I played the expansion for the first time today and I didn't think it possible to make Talisman better but this expansion most definitely does.  Table top gamers are notoriously picky about their beloved games and don't want them butchered or poorly recreated.  I have been hopeful that this would be a faithful recreation of the board game and Nomad Games has not let me down.  Out of the massive amount of money I have spent on Steam, this stands out as one of my favorite and most fun games in my library.  Young or old, new to Talisman or an old pro I can not recommend this game high enough.  To me, this is an absolute must have for anyone's Steam library.Game Play: 10/10Sound: 9/10Mechanics and Interface: 8/10Art and Graphics: 10/10Overall Experience: 10/10			"

												I bought this game as a fan of both warhammer and GW products.Sadly, it really sucks. I know its a faithful recreation of a timeless board game, and it hits that spot on. As a huge board gamer myself though... the game is really imbalanced, the systems are poorly explained and convoluted, and its kind of stupid to have to get to the middle of the board which then kills everyone else (only on a roll of 4+) which turns the game SUPER boring at the end... I think I sat there for about 30 minutes hoping to roll a 4+ and kill everyone, while all the AI's kept healing and leveling up. I cannot recommend this game at all to anyone who values their time or avid board game enthusiasts. The game is unfair, boring, and a huge waste of time. No offense to the company who made this, they did a great job of recreating the board game how its played! But to me rolling dice and hoping I win does not make a game fun.Multiple users have commented on my review so I'll add a caveat: supposedly some of the xpacs fix the misgivings of the base game. But to me, I shouldn't have to buy xpacs to fix a game being unfun. If you play this, I would recommend making your mind up about it within the first 2 hours!			"

												Too many clicks needed without any point, but if you click when you should not the game become paused. This is extremly annoying. In single player, you have to wait really a lot for the AI while it checks if wants to cast a spell.  Soo many wasted seconds of my life...So far I'm still playing my first game, but it seems to be locked since 45 minutes: I'm standing in the center, casting the command spell every turn (reduces life for the opponents if I roll 4-5-6), while the only AI player left is hanging around and healing himself time to time by visiting the corresponding tiles. I think like 5-6 times I was already one life away from winning, but I'm tending exit and forget about this unpolished beauty.The positive side: nice idea, good graphics, fine music. If the testers might have warned the developers about the glitches this game could be a 8/10 (now it is 4/10).			"

Whilst playing online multiplayer, the destruction card causes the game to become unresponsive. PLEASE FIX*EDIT*Now during my second day of messing around on the game there seems to be an issue with stealing whilst on the crown of command. The game seemed to force me to steal everything from the enemy (which shouldn't be possible) and then forced me to drop everything except 2 items (which I shoudn't have to do) causing me to lose the game when in a commanding position just 2 minutes ago. My favourite game from my childhood has been so far ruined in digital form by bugs. MUST BE FIXED. Feel ripped off.**EDIT**SO MANY BUGS			"

There is a lot of different bugs also and so far all of them have made it impossible to continue playing.If this game gets a lot of updates and bugfixes it might be playable but at the moment I don't recommend that people even try. If you planning to buy it too play multiplayer with friends atleast wait until it has become fixed cause this is just a waste of money at the moment.			"

												I have been playing this game for about 6 months now, and I've finally had it with this game. This game is FULL of bugs. The game will routinely change the rules on you and outright cheat to help the AI and screw over players. That isn't even the part that bothers me though. The game has had a problem with crashing and lost connections since I started playing, but it is now to a point where I can't go more than 2 minutes without getting kicked from a game. Even if I rejoin the game each time, the program will eventually crash and I am forced to close the game. This is not just my experience - all of my friends experience the same thing, and a quick search online shows that many people are fed up with these same problems. Do not even waste your time buying this game, the devs don't care about fixing the MASSIVE issues that make this game wholly unplayable. For how long this game has been on the market, there is no excuse for this. The devs should be ashamed and either FIX THE PROBLEMS or get this game off the market.			"

												This is a very good way to test Talisman out and see if you like it before purchasing it as a board game. The physical game is more expensive, especially if you end up buying all the other characters and expansions, so I would definitely suggest buying everything on steam and testing it all out to see what you like and don't like. It is also makes the rules very clear opposed to the physical copy, which makes you guess at some rules because of wording. All in all, I would suggest getting this game if you are at all interested in buying the physcal version. You may even like this version more, as you can always join tables online if you want to play but your friends are unavailable. It is sometimes buggy and won't load characters the first time you start it up and friends join, but that problem goes away the second time you start the game. I own both the physcial and PC version of this game, and though I prefer the physcial board game, I do enjoy this thoroughly.			"

												After putting +100 hours in this game, i decided to write my first review, to hopefully raise awareness to this amazing tabletop. Talisman is great for fantasy lovers and offers lots of diferent heros with different abilities to play as, which is one of my favourite features in a game. All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential. Although there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times. Another thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise! Expansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!Pros: -Lots of fun with friends -Wide variety of heros -Playable on a toaster -Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn) -Unpredictable -Amazing when you have access to expansions -You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!Cons: -Very luck driven -Games are super long -Not as enjoyable if you dont have access to expansions -AI can be really dumb			"

												This game is the perfect example of emergent gameplay done right. In one game, that forest might be the home of a friendly fairy that grants wishes to the forces of light, while in another, it might be the lair of a terrifying dragon. Using multiple decks of cards with different effects and uses, you can craft the story of an evil leprachaun, who loses all his money and ends up in jail after a night of drunken revelry, or the tale of a lone bounty hunter with an enchanted flail, on the trail of a powerful sorcereress who stole his magic shield and destroyed the academy that trained his superhuman fighting skills, finally clashing at the highest peaks of the world. In another of my games, my Bard character managed to ensnare a fire breathing dragon with his music. In another, my alchemist discovered a bag that always had an extra gold piece inside whenever you ran out of money, with his abilities, I managed to turn this unlimited supply of gold into unlimited magical power. If you immerse yourself into the experience and roleplay it, stories build themselves right in front of your eyes. Every game is different, and with every expansion adding new locations, decks, characters and everything else, It can only get better.The AI isn't too bad either, I've seen characters doing crazy stuff like casting the offensive wind blast spell on themselves to fling across the map so that they're closer to where they need to be.If I could change one thing, it'd be the introduction of a way to turn off the victory conditions of the game, sometimes you want these random storied worlds of yours to live on longer.

The game drags on and on and on with no foreseen end to it, and the fact that almost everything is a huge gamble that can ruin your day with just a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rolls does not help it. The fact that it is so random ruins the potential for strategy, and it dragging so long makes the randomness frustrating. Not to mention, the UI is very unpolished and the expansions are very expensive.Buy it during a very high sale, and only if you can cope with very long games in which your worst enemy won't be the other players, but the Random Number God.

												I didn't have any experience with the board game before playing this, but I think they did a decent job explaining it. Don't get me wrong, it was lots that they didn't explain, but simply playing it and reading the tips they show is enough for you to get started and learn the rest on the way. The game itself had good variety with lots of different cards, enemies, playable characters etc. to make it fun even in the long run. Good graphics, decent background music and so many different even/object/spell cards that even if you have a good solid plan for then run, your opponent ""the monk"" still beats the crap out of your warrior and steals your great orb card, ruining the run for you. But it's a...good kind of rage :)7.3/10			"

												Most buggy game I have ever played. And I have DOSBox.Top 5 bugs and interface fails:1) The spell ""Twist of Fate"" which should let you choose the outcome of a reroll fails to do anything because the game is ambiguous about when it should be cast.2)  If you have the bag that lets you carry 4 items, you have to reuse it every time you want to add/remove an item!3) No sound indicating it's your turn. You have to stare at the screen for 5 hours because the game's too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to let you know it's your turn to act.4) The game throws you out of screens that you're looking at, making it a manic rush to click on your counterspell when an opponent tries to turn you into a toad.5) When a player leaves (ragequits over the terrible interface), the game rewinds about 2 actions. You can choose to follow the previous path (and get the exact same outcome, suggesting that draws and rolls are predetermined), or a new path, in case the old one didn't end up being very lucrative....

												The game premise is pretty good and I think I would enjoy the actual board game, but as it stands the digital version of the game is somewhat poorly made. I've had numerous glitches occur, and some aspects of the interface are rather annoying. My biggest complaint so far is having played a game as a Ninja the victory condition made it impossible to win. I was required to obtain 2 followers and then discard them in order to complete a Warlock Quest. Ninjas can not have followers. Therefore  I couldn't win. I got a cursed item that made me lose all of my quests, which I used to get rid of that quest and go take a different Warlock quest, to which the game made me take the same quest again, with no roll or anything even though the spot said to roll for it. I did have some irratations with the interface, but those could be avoided once a player becomes familiar with the game. The games been out long enough that really big glitches like this should probably have been patched out. Theres also very squirly things with the NPC players where they will often drag on their turns for a while picking up every single item on a square, and then put every item back down because they lack inventory space, even though they won't take any of the actual items. I could go on, but I got the game for a steal so I can't complain too much. Thinking im going to go buy the board game now though. I rather like the actual game.			"

I played a full round against the ai a round with players and a mixed round.Pros:Great IdeaLooks cool.I love board games.It has some really interesting abilities and cards.Cons:The AI is HORRIBLE!  Turns take far to long even at speed 10.Horrible Networking, I couldn't see games and had to have my friends invite me. We played for a while and then one of us couldn't do anything and it just sat there, so we reloaded and now only I could see the network games and had to invite everyone else. Also the method of resuming an online game is... an afterthought.Buggy, we ran into many crashes , cards would not cast at the end of your turn like they said even though they were qued, amoung many other incorrect spell castings.Dissapointing end game, just standing on the crown rolling 1 die every round with no option of leaving or backtracking, not sure who thought that up but it was bad. Players could just sit there and pelt you with spells build up there stats  and then kill you.Total dissapointment.The Music was uninspired.The price, $79.99 for the complete version, I won't ever play this again even if its free.

												This is a nice digital rendition of the original boardgame. It is however somewhat limited in how you play cards, and there should really be an option when you cue a card to be played where you get a question if you want to play it or not when a situation triggers where the card can be played. Currently you have to time certain cards very precisely and you'll end up targeting yourself with bad spells and throw away other cards simply because the game is programmed so that if you cue a card you mindlessly play it on whatever is a legal target. Ruins a lot of the fun unfortunately. If they patch this the game will be close to perfect in it's resemblance of the original boardgame.			"

												This game is a giant waste of time. It could have been great but with brain dead AI and the game actively cheating to make you lose to make up for the unimaginably stupid AI it boils down to an extremely boring slog. I even reached the center only for the game to drag on for another two hours as the AI was too dumb to reach the center and fight me while I rolled less than 4 several times in a row interspaced by one or two times rolling high enough to do damage only for the enemy to miraculously roll the exact number to land on a healing spot over and over and over again. The only reason I won is because they managed to damage themselves to the point where I could kill them with 1 lucky roll. I should be paid for having to suffer through that crap. My recommendation stay away setting the money that could be spent on this game on fire would be a more worthwhile investment and this game.			"

I waited for a sale to bring it down to about $5.The only issue I take with the game is the AI's reticence to go towards the center of the map, even when they've become very powerful and could easily beat the game (you have to reach the center of the map to win, if you didn't know).  Otherwise, the AI is generally fairly competent.The game is interesting and pretty replayable.  It doesn't offer too much RPing, but it does offer some strategy (even if most of it takes the form of managing various risks).  It makes for a great way to kill some time, and is very easy to pick up and get into.			"

I don't know if you can still buy them, but back then you could get, like, a dozen expansions that came with additional game boards like a dungeon and one that allowed you to travel through space. My brother and I liked playing the expansions more than the vanilla game because every expansion added these wicked overpowered new characters and objects and instead of the usual gameplay strat of ""just travel around the outer region for a half an hour to level up before going towards the middle"" it became ""bum rush the space lanes to get the laser rifle and the anti-grav belt and spend the next fifteen minutes griefing the other players until they get mad and give up"".Dad says: If you like this kind of nerd♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's a pretty good buy at $5, but bear in mind that the vanilla game will get old after a couple of hours once you're familliar with all the cards and/or you don't have actual people to play with on mumble. You'll be wanting to get some of the expansions if you enjoy it and those will cost like $5 each, but they should mix up the game enough that you'll find lots of added enjoyment.

												In the end, Talisman: Digital Edition is a faithful recreation of the classic board game, from what I've heard.  If you’ve played Talisman on a board or are a fan of tabletop RPGs, odds are you’ll have a blast playing with people from all over the world (or the AI) and I easily recommend purchasing it.  If you aren’t a fan of tabletop or haven’t played it, be aware that Talisman: Digital Edition is not like your typical videogame.  It’s more akin to a board game, and therefore is a sort of niche title.  I’d recommend at least trying it through Steam’s Family Share if possible, or watch extended gameplay trailers to get an idea of what to expect.  I've never played the original board game, so I can't really compare the two.  But for the most part, I found this to be a really enjoyable game.  Even more so as I am an avid boardgamer as well, so now I'll have to find a copy of the physical version later on.As an added bonus, what makes this version of the game stand out against its real-life counterpart is the player progression scheme.  After you beat the game (or even lose it), you earn experience points based on your performance and are rewarded with Runestones and Steam Achievements.  There are fifty achievements on Steam and you can equip your next hero with up to three Runestones which can affect everything from starting lives to not missing a turn when your hero drinks too much in the tavern!

												This game is surprisingly fun. Played with a friend or two could be the longest most fun game you have ever played. Alternatively it could be the shortest game ever.. For instance. My friend and I were playing with the reaper and expansions. Five minutes into the game, I managed to get the reaper on top of him and he rolls a 1. Then re-rolls to beat the reaper. Then on my turn I roll into a basalisk and get frozen to death. He wins.			"

												Played the actual tabletop with friends before. It's definetly more fun with friends in person, but if life dictates otherwise, and you want to play a casual game online with friends, pick this up. Perhaps one of the best non-DND tabletops I've played. The digital copy is well done, and you don't have to worry about anyone bumping the table, and throwing off the positions of the cards.8/10, grab it if your a fan of tabletops, a must-grab during a sale.

												I am a board game enthusiast.  I can say with high level of certainty this is the WORST balanced board game I have ever played.  The game design is terrible and mind boggling.  I honestly wonder if they had any playtesting before release.  In addition to the terrible balance issues, the online versions UI is abysmal.  Trying to full screen either gives me a black screen half the time or freezes up.  Casting spells that require any type of timing is almost impossible.  There is no undue button and many commands do not have confirm request.  Do not play this game if you value your time in any way.			"

You will return to this game every time despite the infuriating misfortunes that you will no doubt encounter throughout your endeavours. The game ofcourse suffers some minor bugs, the most common ones I've encountered relating to connectivity issues when playing with a friend of mine however, if you overlook these issues you will no doubt see just how much of a good find this game is.My first game as a pirate resulted in multiple kidnappings and hilarity ensued. 10/10 would kidnap again.

												I got a copy of the boardgame back in the 80s and I loved it.  Now this is a true representation of the game complete with identical adventure cards (etc) - although Fate's a new one on me.  I also picked up the Dungeon expansion to make my nostalgia complete.  So why the bad review?  It's clunky mess with the interface not being all that intuitive.  Forever clicking the mouse button to speed up some animation only to pause the game.  It just doesn't gel which is a real shame. If you're a fan of the boardgame and can sit through a clunky UI then it's a non-brainer; if you've never played the boardgame don't go near this unless you know you're going to be online with friends.

												First off, let me say that the actual gameplay is pretty fun, especially when playing with friends online. The game can get very cut-throat and you will enjoy lots of laughs at the expese of other player's misfortune. The expansions make the game even more enjoyable and there are different game rules available that can make the game more exciting. If I was recommending this on the gameplay alone, I would definitely give it a great review.That being said, this game is TERRIBLE when it comes to programming. It is full of game-stopping glitches that should have been weeded out during development. Nothing is more frustrating than to be two hours into a highly competitive and exciting game, only to have it RUINED by a glitch that will not allow the game to contine. The matchmaking is shotty at best, and the lack of a save feature to save and resume multiple games outside of the single automatic game save really gets on your nerves. This game is not worth buying unless GW fixes the bugs that are killing this game.			"

												Fun with friends. It feels kinda sluggish on PC though, the controls are sometimes confusing. Especially when you need to cast counter spells or simple do something quick. The UI and the game behavious makes it really quite difficult.But it's good old Talisman, be prepared for 10 hour long sessions with lots of praying to RNGod...There's a lot of DLC, consider getting some (Dungeon, Highlands are nice) - they add a lot to the game, as the core game can get boring fast. THe system makes it so that only one person in the lobby needs to own the DLC for it to be active, so if you got a group of friends you can each buy some so split the cost.OR chip in and get the season pass and voila.

												This game isn't for everyone: I'll be the first to admit that! BUT, for those of us who have the patience to sit through a L-O-N-G game, and/or people who remember the actual board game this is based on, this game is FANTASTIC! The Digital Edition is an excellent translation of the board game, although I kinda wish it had been based on the First Edition version of the original: Just think how fun it would be to be able to run through this game as a Space Marine, or the Chainsaw Warrior, or a Dark Eldar!All in all, Talisman: Digital Edition is a worthy successor to the original tabletop boardgame, and buying the Season Pass, while a bit on the pricy side, is MORE than worth it! When they say that you'll get ALL the DLC, they mean it! And there's a LOT more coming!PS: To the reviewer who was hesitant when they learned that Games Workshop held the license for Talisman, I should probably tell you something: Talisman was ALWAYS A Games Workshop game! They were the company who originally developed and released the tabletop version of this game. They've always owned it, just like Warhammer and Blood Bowl!			"

												I'm a longtime fan of this game, as I've had the actual boardgame itself for years. This digital version gives me a great way to play with buddies who I'm not physically around anymore, which is great. I played through one game already and it seems to work fine. There does seem to be one bug with the thief, though: when at the crown of command with another character, he still had the opportunity to steal, despite his character card saying he needed to LAND on the character's space in order to steal from them. Not sure if that was an interpretation thing, an error, or some kind of bug in the code, but thought it was worth mentioning. overall, though, just like the boardgame. Definitely a recommendation for anyone who has friends long distances away that they like playing talisman with, as well as anyone who just loves boardgame type games period.			"

Posted: December 30, 2014
												Upon first impression, I -like- Talisman.  It feels unique and like a 1980s fantasy story/movie as a Roguelike board game.  My Steam recommendation comes with a big HOWEVER:  Ahem.  However, there are two main sets of deterrents from this digitized Talisman game, mechanical and technical.Note that this was my first time EVER playing Talisman in any form!Mechanics-wise, the digital version seems to be an accurate port of the tabletop game. This means, for good and for ill, whatever the tabletop game is, the digital game is too. I enjoyed the ability for each person to have a personal adventure on the same game board while competing for resources and, ultimately, victory. I liked how it was, effectively, a board game version of Dokapon Kingdom (Wii), similar to the card game Munchkin for its randomness and occasional hilarity, and that it was a board game Rogue-lite. Also, props for having a cadre of possible followers, and spells that were rare and powerful!What did I dislike about the mechanics? There is simply TOO MUCH ROLLING! Want to move somewhere? You must roll and get the exact number you need to proceed! Rolling at locations (board spaces), such as to determine whether at a bar you gain or lose money while gambling, or if you start a bar fight, is more sensical and generally should be kept. Rolling was much less of an issue early game and for me as a newbie since I didn't know what I was doing and was not a stickler on trying to win my first game - at least at this phase. I understood ""Be an Assassin, go around killing stuff, level up, and try to win,"" and I wound up close to winning.A simple fix would be to allow movement of any number of spaces no more than the rolled number. Did you roll a 3? You can move 1, 2, or 3 spaces instead of just 3.A second major issue is the need to farm.  Yes, you need to farm in a tabletop game originally released in the 1980s - before the release of video games like Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior that made farming in RPGs popular.  Why?  Because you simply -need- higher stats, more money, and more treasure to survive random encounters and other players in this game!  As a warning to Talisman newbies:  You may reach the center area of the board (and achieving this feels quite random), but you NEED a Talisman to complete the game (found at the top left of the inner rectangle) AND enough Strength or Craft to get through the Mines or Crypt respectively.  This means boosting these stats via fights (randomly generated) or finding the right items to boost your stats (randomly placed).Perhaps it was because we used the Grim Reaper expansion, but the victory condition of, ""All other players must be dead for you to win, even if you're at the Crown of Command,"" made the game take -entirely- too long! Since even dying once is effectively enough to eliminate one person forever, saying, ""Death is permanent,"" would have been enough to expedite the game tremendously! (Currently, a dead player character respawns on at the start of his next turn at his starting space with no gear, no level up bonuses, no followers, and possibly no spells. If this happens at the late game, this dead PC may as well be out of the game.)  My workaround?  A player at the Crown of Command needs to remain in this space for 3 consecutive turns.  If another player reaches the Crown of Command, this timer resets.  This way, the game does not take 60+ minutes to declare a victor with someone already at the Crown of Command, but allows people to get close and perhaps win.We had some technical problems, too. The game, in general, worked. However, one of our players was repeatedly removed from the game due to connection problems, and we had to restart Talisman about 4 times within 20 minutes to get the game running with all of us again. (To do so, the host should go to Online Game >> Private Game while the others should go to Online Game >> Resume Game once the game is up. This will resume a game from the last auto-saved spot.)In addition, the UI is confusing to new players. In the tabletop version of this game, playing a spell card is as easy as declaring you're playing it, then playing it. In the digital version, each player needs to queue spells to go off at the right time. (I accidentally cast Sleep on myself because I assumed it would go off on the next person's turn.) I also felt unsure of what things did until I did them - like gaining followers or fighting things or trying to use the Portal. Sometimes, this was no big deal (like fighting), but sometimes (like using the Portal), I wish I would have known and understood the important bits before I went through with my actions.Is Talisman worth playing?  That depends.  I liked it because I also liked Munchkin and Dokapon Kingdom and feel they capture the essence of this game better.  Munchkin bypasses the board entirely and go straight for the random danger/delight/treasure in a similar fashion to Talisman, with less die rolling. (As an aside, there is a Munchkin Quest board game which I've not played.)  Dokapon Kingdom's interface is generally better than Talisman's, but it suffers from ""too long to play this game casually in a group setting"" syndrome.  Dokapon can be enjoyed in short bursts among friends, but is not at all meant to be completed in a single sitting.  (According to GameFAQs, Dokapon Kingdom's full game length, from start to finish, is around 60 hours!)  Talisman seemingly -is- meant to be completed in a single session, but around 4 hours for a digital version of a board game made me want to add the aforementioned house rules just to change that to 30-60 minutes.  If you can deal with the tremendous randomness, and have supportive friends who enjoy playing Talisman with you, Talisman is a worthwhile game.Talisman, in its current form, is somewhere between a tabletop board game and a tabletop RPG.  It's more complicated than Monopoly, but less complicated than D&D 3.5.  A full game of Talimsan (an estimated 3.5 to 5.5 hours) is around the estimated session time of a tabletop RPG, like D&D.Talisman is something to experience once or on occasion, but it requires a dedicated group to enjoy it perpetually.IN SUMMARY:+Competitive fantasy RPG-lite and Rogue-lite adventuring.+Fun to play, unique in its design, and created and maintained as a passion project.+Assassin, Ghoul, and Dark Cultist classes are likely to get you a win.+Less setup and hassle than many tabletop RPG campaigns.-Way too long.-Way too random.-Way too confusing without someone first telling you a lot of the game (how to win, what classes to play, what stats do, the good and bad options).

												A good port of the Games Workshop classic, Talisman: Digital Edition is an adapted board game that is pretty simple and fun to play. It is definately best to play with friends, preferably with a total of 3 or more players, as this makes for far more interesting dynamics than the fairly linear two-player game. Although it may not be the most tactically deep board game of all time, this does not detract from the experience; it merely makes it accessible. There are also some definite strategies involved. Whilst I don't play this a lot, it is refreshing and very fun to play once in while with some friends, and marvellously captures the feel of a questing adventurer striving to out-competent his/her rivals.

												Talisman is a game of adventure, excitement, and challenge; a game where you the player are the ones who build the cross the AI nails you to. Dying from a gut seeping wound might be more enjoyable. If you reach the crown before the AI, you better expect to choke hard and roll absolutely abysmal. If you think the AI is doing something stupid? It's because the AI has decided to give you this illusion before three turns later it's suddenly twice as strong wielding magic faster than a video game player can blame a computer for his failings. This game is not your friend. This game hates you. This game lives off of your suffering. Any achievement is to lull you into a false sense of security. All hail your new dark gods, the AI.10/10 Would forsake my first born child to actually roll what I need when I need it.P.S. SHODAN is more merciful than this game.			"

												I haven't played the original Talisman. This game takes hours to complete. The online games take even longer. Those three  reasons are what stopped me from trying this out earlier but I did try it out and I was NOT disappointed. Despite the length, most people who you play with online are super friendly and super fun to play with, which basically ends up making the length an advantage (more time = more fun). And the game itself is amazing! It's like playing a full scale MMORPG (an RPG if you don't like online play xD)! It's a game, a board game, that truly does require a huge amount of strategy. It's not just ""roll you dice, move on, get to the end first"", it's about thinking of where to go, what to do, how to get what you want and so on. And it's not very straightforward either, it's quite complex and utterly wonderful in all aspects. To sweeten the pot, it even has several modes and expansions to make sure you never get bored of playing! A 5/5 game if I ever played one.EDIT: I must admit that after a while, the game does get quite boring and repetitive. If you can find a group of players and form a group (relatively speaking) to play, then sure, it'll give you hours of enjoyment without fail! Besides, considering how long a game takes, you'll probably end up playing it once or twice a week, in which case it'll provide you with years of fun! One thing I have noticed, however, is that the community has died down quite a bit. Ever since the ""free weekend"" ended, the number of games in the lobby is three in the maximum and that's in the European server (which, ironically, is the busiest). Once again, if you've got a group of friends to play with every once in a while, I'd recommend this game without a single moment of hesistation!			"

												Do not pay full purchase for this game.I havn't played Talisman before, so take that in mind.The interface is slow and clumsy. It takes 3 seconds for anything you click to work. Looking at an inventory can be a challenge in itself.You can't look at the spaces outside of your turns, and when you do, it takes ages again. You can't just scroll over it, you have to right-click it, wait, right-click it again, wait and then right-click a card you might want to check on it.The timing of spell cards and everything is thrown out the window, because the clicking responses are very, very slow.And that isn't getting to the bugs.Out for the 4 games I have played so far, each single one has been wrecked because of the terrible interface and bugs.Game one, I choose an apprentice wizard. Get to one life, and look at one of my spells waiting for my turn.Turn comes up, the spell casts itself. And I die to a miscast.Game two, I get a courtesan. I go to flirt with an orc, and take his useful follower, giving me a massive lead. Instead, after looking at his inventory, as I back out, it decided to take me backing out of his inventory as a challenge to combat. Instead of taking something, I then enter physical combat, whith my 2 against his 5 bonus. I lose. He then takes my magical bag of holding, a bag that says on the card 'This card can not be taken in combat', which contained every single bit of my loot.I'm just happy I got this with Humble Bundle, but I won't get my 5 hours back.That said, I now want to play the physical board game. Since that is more social, faster (yes, this game is faster to play physically) and has no bugs.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It is definitely best played with a group of friends which you can converse with. To be entirely honest, it is not that great if you play against the AI. The AI has this ability to screw themselves in ways that are entirely possible to avoid with a little bit of thought. For instance, the AI will use an axe to get across the river only to cross back to the outer area the next turn.I would highly recommend this to people which enjoy tabletop games which contain both an element of strategy and an element of luck. There is a lot in this game which requires luck, but once you have played a few games, you can get a feel of what the better spaces and strategies are. Playing with random characters also forces you to get used to new ways of playing the game, making each game much different from the last.Keep in mind, a single string of bad luck can pretty much end your run in the game or force you to play catch up for the remainder of the game if everyone else is doing well.

												I like board games. Talisman is a decent board game. And while this game models the board game fairly well, there is one critical issue and several other annoyances.The critical issue is that the dice roll is not randomised. To demonstrate, perform a turn to see how the die rolls, exit, reload, and then re-do your turn to see the dice roll the exact same way. I've performed different actions and even seen the AI players get the dice rolls I would have got. It's ridiculous. The whole point of rolling a dice is to be random. Not random = not a dice roll.The annoyances are as previously alerted to in prior reviews, mostly to do with poor AI, but I could have lived with that had the dice rolls actually been pseudo-random, you know, ceiling(math.rand()*6) or something.

												I'm actually old enough to own the original board game, which, I absolutely love! I spent many, many hours as a kid beating... I mean, ""questing"" with my friends. We'd all be sitting on the carpet in the living room, game pieces scattered thither, huddled around the game board as if we were spying into one our dads' Playboy magazines trying not to get caught. Tensions ran high as we traversed the outer ring of the board (or Outer Earth as we called it) in search of glorious adventure and immense wealth. Eventually, one friend would amusingly decide to try to kill off another; starting a great fued betwixt families, and a furious battle would ensue. With every roll of the dice, the once trusting and playful comrades, would try to land on each others spaces to chip off yet another foe's life. All in the hopes of being the last warrior standing... until of coarse... the final blow was struck... the fallen combatant, silent in his shame, with head hung low, would sit and let the anger of defeat fester like a boil. As the heckling and laughter of his friends grew louder, ringing in his ears, becoming too much to bear, the conquered warrior would growl in rage! Leaping up from the game and running away like the wind. Totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ He'd jump upon his iron steed, and peddle off into the night, cursing us. Claiming he would never play with us... ever... again.But... we knew he'd be back. Now that I'm a grown-up (or at least supposed to be), this digital version still lets me enjoy beating... I mean ""questing"" with my friends, even though we're scattered across the globe. It's awesome. And. it's a perfect game for hanging out with the guys online, having a few beers, and sharing a few laughs.It's a great port of the board game. It's challenging, and the DLC is great. Totally worth the money!			"

												I am a board game enthusiast.  I can say with high level of certainty this is the WORST balanced board game I have ever played.  The game design is terrible and mind boggling.  I honestly wonder if they had any playtesting before release.  In addition to the terrible balance issues, the online versions UI is abysmal.  Trying to full screen either gives me a black screen half the time or freezes up.  Casting spells that require any type of timing is almost impossible.  There is no undue button and many commands do not have confirm request.  Do not play this game if you value your time in any way.			"

Posted: December 30, 2014
												Upon first impression, I -like- Talisman.  It feels unique and like a 1980s fantasy story/movie as a Roguelike board game.  My Steam recommendation comes with a big HOWEVER:  Ahem.  However, there are two main sets of deterrents from this digitized Talisman game, mechanical and technical.Note that this was my first time EVER playing Talisman in any form!Mechanics-wise, the digital version seems to be an accurate port of the tabletop game. This means, for good and for ill, whatever the tabletop game is, the digital game is too. I enjoyed the ability for each person to have a personal adventure on the same game board while competing for resources and, ultimately, victory. I liked how it was, effectively, a board game version of Dokapon Kingdom (Wii), similar to the card game Munchkin for its randomness and occasional hilarity, and that it was a board game Rogue-lite. Also, props for having a cadre of possible followers, and spells that were rare and powerful!What did I dislike about the mechanics? There is simply TOO MUCH ROLLING! Want to move somewhere? You must roll and get the exact number you need to proceed! Rolling at locations (board spaces), such as to determine whether at a bar you gain or lose money while gambling, or if you start a bar fight, is more sensical and generally should be kept. Rolling was much less of an issue early game and for me as a newbie since I didn't know what I was doing and was not a stickler on trying to win my first game - at least at this phase. I understood ""Be an Assassin, go around killing stuff, level up, and try to win,"" and I wound up close to winning.A simple fix would be to allow movement of any number of spaces no more than the rolled number. Did you roll a 3? You can move 1, 2, or 3 spaces instead of just 3.A second major issue is the need to farm.  Yes, you need to farm in a tabletop game originally released in the 1980s - before the release of video games like Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior that made farming in RPGs popular.  Why?  Because you simply -need- higher stats, more money, and more treasure to survive random encounters and other players in this game!  As a warning to Talisman newbies:  You may reach the center area of the board (and achieving this feels quite random), but you NEED a Talisman to complete the game (found at the top left of the inner rectangle) AND enough Strength or Craft to get through the Mines or Crypt respectively.  This means boosting these stats via fights (randomly generated) or finding the right items to boost your stats (randomly placed).Perhaps it was because we used the Grim Reaper expansion, but the victory condition of, ""All other players must be dead for you to win, even if you're at the Crown of Command,"" made the game take -entirely- too long! Since even dying once is effectively enough to eliminate one person forever, saying, ""Death is permanent,"" would have been enough to expedite the game tremendously! (Currently, a dead player character respawns on at the start of his next turn at his starting space with no gear, no level up bonuses, no followers, and possibly no spells. If this happens at the late game, this dead PC may as well be out of the game.)  My workaround?  A player at the Crown of Command needs to remain in this space for 3 consecutive turns.  If another player reaches the Crown of Command, this timer resets.  This way, the game does not take 60+ minutes to declare a victor with someone already at the Crown of Command, but allows people to get close and perhaps win.We had some technical problems, too. The game, in general, worked. However, one of our players was repeatedly removed from the game due to connection problems, and we had to restart Talisman about 4 times within 20 minutes to get the game running with all of us again. (To do so, the host should go to Online Game >> Private Game while the others should go to Online Game >> Resume Game once the game is up. This will resume a game from the last auto-saved spot.)In addition, the UI is confusing to new players. In the tabletop version of this game, playing a spell card is as easy as declaring you're playing it, then playing it. In the digital version, each player needs to queue spells to go off at the right time. (I accidentally cast Sleep on myself because I assumed it would go off on the next person's turn.) I also felt unsure of what things did until I did them - like gaining followers or fighting things or trying to use the Portal. Sometimes, this was no big deal (like fighting), but sometimes (like using the Portal), I wish I would have known and understood the important bits before I went through with my actions.Is Talisman worth playing?  That depends.  I liked it because I also liked Munchkin and Dokapon Kingdom and feel they capture the essence of this game better.  Munchkin bypasses the board entirely and go straight for the random danger/delight/treasure in a similar fashion to Talisman, with less die rolling. (As an aside, there is a Munchkin Quest board game which I've not played.)  Dokapon Kingdom's interface is generally better than Talisman's, but it suffers from ""too long to play this game casually in a group setting"" syndrome.  Dokapon can be enjoyed in short bursts among friends, but is not at all meant to be completed in a single sitting.  (According to GameFAQs, Dokapon Kingdom's full game length, from start to finish, is around 60 hours!)  Talisman seemingly -is- meant to be completed in a single session, but around 4 hours for a digital version of a board game made me want to add the aforementioned house rules just to change that to 30-60 minutes.  If you can deal with the tremendous randomness, and have supportive friends who enjoy playing Talisman with you, Talisman is a worthwhile game.Talisman, in its current form, is somewhere between a tabletop board game and a tabletop RPG.  It's more complicated than Monopoly, but less complicated than D&D 3.5.  A full game of Talimsan (an estimated 3.5 to 5.5 hours) is around the estimated session time of a tabletop RPG, like D&D.Talisman is something to experience once or on occasion, but it requires a dedicated group to enjoy it perpetually.IN SUMMARY:+Competitive fantasy RPG-lite and Rogue-lite adventuring.+Fun to play, unique in its design, and created and maintained as a passion project.+Assassin, Ghoul, and Dark Cultist classes are likely to get you a win.+Less setup and hassle than many tabletop RPG campaigns.-Way too long.-Way too random.-Way too confusing without someone first telling you a lot of the game (how to win, what classes to play, what stats do, the good and bad options).

												Do you love boardgames? Do you own boardgames? Do you play them with your friends (hopefully!)? Than this game CAN definatly be for you. But it also depends on how much nostalgia you feel for Talisman. Us boardgamers in general probably wont like this game, it takes a lot of time (can take up to 3 hours), your actions are ALMOST completley random thanks to dicerolling. And you also lose the feeling of moving components around on a board which is a huge part of the enjoyment for this game. If you're a not a boardgamer I would recomend that you stay away from this game. It probably wont meet up with any (if any) of your expectations. This game can be fun with a few friends but you will probably end up only playing a single game of it before moving on to some other game or you know... any other REAL boardgame. Talisman in general is sadly not a great boardgame nomatter how much nostalgia you feel for it. It's basicly a more nerdy version of Monopoly which is the worst... boardgame... ever. Instead of getting this get the game for your pads so that you can play it on long trips on a buss, train, car (unless you're driving) and plane. But make sure you have some people to play with even then./ Nurgleprobe "

Turns getting stuck, getting kicked out with odd error messages,  multiple disconnections.  Each time you can get back in, but the AI will have taken a turn or two for you.  Happened to everyone playing.  Basically, imagine playinga  board game where you might be told you have to go outside and come back in before taking a turn at random, and when you do the board might not be the same as when you left it.The board game is excellent, stick with that and skip this.

												The interface is counterintutive and possibly buggy. You can cast a spell and then be left wondering why the moves you're trying to make are invalid. There's no feedback. For example, I just spent about an hour playing through a game and then cast a spell that let me to eliminate any face up encounter card. I clicked on literally every single card on the board. Nothing happened. I have no idea what the game wanted from me, but I was left with no way to progress and no way to cancel the action. I just had to quit. All that time was wasted.The game itself, well, it's Talisman. Classic Ameritrash with absolutely no strategy. For the most part, things just happen.ETA: Played more to be fair and encountered AI entering infinite loops. I stand by my review.			"

												This game is the pure representation of board roleplaying. For some people, gameplay may seem too slow. Well, if you are not aiming to watch your opponent's moves, this is not your game. The depth during the match grows linearly with time, and luck is as well an important factor that usually decides.Overall it is hard to survive against encounters themselves, and there is some fun behind it, still needed to be polished. There are many bugs and translation errors, but since they are aiming to release more content, let's hope for the fixes.			"

												If you enjoy the board game, chances are you'll enjoy this. It's essentially just the board game in video game form, which I personally view as a positive. Now, if you can't get a group of friends together to play, you have the option to play against AI or other players online.  Much like the board game, expansions are purchased separately, so keep that in mind.  But the game does come with options for some popular house rules.  My only complaints are that the interface is a little hard to navigate at first and the game only supports up to 4 players instead of 6, but they aren't huge problems that really hamper the game.  In short, I'd recommend to any Talisman fans out there!			"

												Pros:- faithfull to the originalCons:- faithfull to the originalYou see where this is going. If you liked the original Talisman, you will like this one. It has a few bugs, but the issues it had at release have mostly been handled with and the game is much more stable. If you have not played the original Talisman, let me tell you a few things about it:1) It is competitive2) It is very random. Lots of dice rolls and most often the player who has the lucky rolls and draws the best cards wins. A solid strategy is in no way a guarantee of sucess - it helps but not that much. 3) It is not fair and the characters are not in any way balancedIf you want a fantasy themed strategy game with balanced chances for eac player, look elsewhere. If you seek an unpredictable, fantasy-themed beer&pretzel game, this is it. Given the random nature and colorfull themes in the game, imho this will be a good game to play with your kids or with a younger sibling. Or just with friends if you want to chill out and not be too serious about it.			"

												Pros:- it sticks to the original board game (figures and cards)- requires some tactical thinking- nice soundtrack- each game is different!- characters from the additions (AND additions themselves!)- many achievements to accomplishCons:- a bit too much randomness- bugs and crashes (thankfully they still improve this)- not so smart bots- the music becomes repetitive after some timeI'm a big fan of the original board game and I'm not dissapointed. Of course nothing beats the atmosphere of sitting with friends around the table and rolling dice by your own hands but, from the other hand, you can compete with other Talisman lovers from the whole world!9/10			"

												This is a nice digital rendition of the original boardgame. It is however somewhat limited in how you play cards, and there should really be an option when you cue a card to be played where you get a question if you want to play it or not when a situation triggers where the card can be played. Currently you have to time certain cards very precisely and you'll end up targeting yourself with bad spells and throw away other cards simply because the game is programmed so that if you cue a card you mindlessly play it on whatever is a legal target. Ruins a lot of the fun unfortunately. If they patch this the game will be close to perfect in it's resemblance of the original boardgame.			"

												This game is a giant waste of time. It could have been great but with brain dead AI and the game actively cheating to make you lose to make up for the unimaginably stupid AI it boils down to an extremely boring slog. I even reached the center only for the game to drag on for another two hours as the AI was too dumb to reach the center and fight me while I rolled less than 4 several times in a row interspaced by one or two times rolling high enough to do damage only for the enemy to miraculously roll the exact number to land on a healing spot over and over and over again. The only reason I won is because they managed to damage themselves to the point where I could kill them with 1 lucky roll. I should be paid for having to suffer through that crap. My recommendation stay away setting the money that could be spent on this game on fire would be a more worthwhile investment and this game.			"

												Having played this game a few times now, I've so far encountered: an idiotic AI that doesn't attempt to reach the crown of command, required to win the game, despite having near-max stats.  An AI that will move a single space every turn due to a poltergeist, healing each turn and therefore causing a stalemate, causing me to lose out on XP and achievement progress.  And most recently, an AI that on the brink of a loss decides to constantly check his inventory on an infinite loop, disallowing me my final turn like the worst of poor losers.  Having experienced all this with just 4.7 hours on record shows what a terrible game this is, in terms of AI, bugs, and problems with the game system in general.May still try the online mode as friends have bought the game, but if playing against the AI just give up now.  Either you won't be allowed to win, or it will be a hollow victory.			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition은 1~6인용 보드게임 Talisman 4판을 Nomad Games Limited에서 PC 및 휴대기기용으로 제작한 1~4인용 게임입니다. 일전에 이에 앞서 유료데모로 내놓는 만행을 벌였던 Talisman: Prologue에 대해서 리뷰( http://etude87.tistory.com/97 )한 적이 있는데 그것의 완성판으로 2014년 2월 26일에 출시되었습니다.PC 이식 및 네트워크 멀티플레이를 지원한다는 장점이 있으나 멍청한 A.I와 기본 구조적 한계 그리고 각종 멀티플레이를 저어하게 만드는 요소들로 인해 Talisman: Digital Edition은 싹수부터 노랗다는 것을 다시 한번 증명했습니다. 타인에게 썩 추천하고 싶지 않습니다만 비교적 저렴한 가격과 휴대용 기기용으로도 많이 나왔으니 친구들과 모여서 보드게임 하고 싶을 때 실물 대신 사용하는 정도로는 쓸모가 있을 것입니다. 더 자세한 내용은 블로그 포스트( http://etude87.tistory.com/179 )를 참고.ps. 최근 시즌패스 내용물 관련해서 차후 추가될 모든 컨텐츠 제공이란 문구를 수정하고 열번째 캐릭터팩을 시즌패스 적용외 물품으로 내놓으면서 커뮤니티 허브에서도 말이 많아진 상태입니다.

												Incredibly fun and infuriating at the same time.  Requires more than 1 play through for you to really appreciate the game, and while the game is heavily luck dependant, there is strategy in managing your resources and coming up with plans to try and succeed from almost all points of the game.  You could be 2 turns from being the winner and then fnd yourself turned toad if youve wasted all your resources getting to where you are.  Two good bonuses to the already good game are that1) The bots are very well made and provide an excellent alternative for when you dont have friends to play with or cant find an open game online2) With the exception of the specific character DLC, as long as the host of a game owns a content DLC, players without the DLC can still join and play with the content (they still wont be able to use the DLC characters however)			"

												My hours in the digital version are small, but don't let that waver your opinion of my opinion of this unforgiving mistress of a game.I went out and bought the physical edition, and have accumulated several expansions because of how much I absolutely adore the abuse this game deals out (aka: I've dropped over $200 on this series alone).The gamestyle is a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of Dungeons&Dragons, and Munchkin.  You each have your own character with their own special attributes and abilities... and often try to screw each other over as much as possible to try and reach the Crown of Command.Expansion packs will add different endings to the game.  One being a Black Hole type card, where if you reveal it, you disappear into the void and the game ends for you.  She's a ♥♥♥♥♥, and I love her.Other endings can reward players depending on if you have the most gold by the end, a certain amount of trophies, etc.  Other endings are revealed at the beginning of the game; one expansion has a setting where all of the characters are by default good, and you're working towards a similiar cause.Expansions also bring different playstyles to the game.  Grim Reaper has already been introduced, who you can send after other players if you happen to roll a 1.""Blood Moon"" will introduce a werewolf, who moves when a 6 is rolled, and is a mirror of old Grimmy.City, Highlands, Dungeon, and Wildlands are all corner expansions which adds to the map itself.The digital version isn't without error.  There are occasional cards, that when played, will crash the game.  This is usually per them being a target card being played when there was nothing to target.  I wish there was a verify system before setting something into play.The Gold Pack is definitely worth it if you're looking into playing the game for a long time, as it includes every expansion available - and they will be released as they're finished by Nomad.  This also includes side character DLC!The way it works (since I couldn't find an answer to this when I bought the game), is that the person with the gold bundle should be hosting.  That way all of the people who join will have access to the content.  BUT, they will not be able to select any of the DLC characters.  They can, however, select random, and have a chance of drawing one (or three depending on house rules).An average game lasts anywhere from 2-5 hours from our experience.			"

												This is a nice digital rendition of the original boardgame. It is however somewhat limited in how you play cards, and there should really be an option when you cue a card to be played where you get a question if you want to play it or not when a situation triggers where the card can be played. Currently you have to time certain cards very precisely and you'll end up targeting yourself with bad spells and throw away other cards simply because the game is programmed so that if you cue a card you mindlessly play it on whatever is a legal target. Ruins a lot of the fun unfortunately. If they patch this the game will be close to perfect in it's resemblance of the original boardgame.			"

												If you ever wondered what D&D would be like as a board game, look no further! Many others have tried, this is the only one that succeeds! I played this game in its original incarnation back in the early 80's and fell in love with it. I was so happy to see it get resurrected. And the expansions just add that much more! This digital version is a fantastic way to be able to play when you don't have your group around to break out the board game. 100% faithful to the original. If you're a board game enthusiast, don't pass this up!			"

												I haven't played much but i can tell it's an interesting game. This game however lacks a decent UI sometimes. One time i wanted to play a card but then realized i couldn't play it on myself. The action though wouldn't allow me to reteurn it after seeing that i couldn't use it on the intended target and i was then forced to play it on a oppenent saving them. This may sound like a little thing but it gets annoying to loose a game you've spent about a hour on over a bad ui mechanic.			"

												Its my first time in such a game! I like it a lot,it reminds me my past times play dungeon and dragons, but with someone who knows the rules very very good. I was very sad to see that a lot of characters are lock and a lot of decks. Ofcourse this means that the developers didn't left the game and they want more money like all of us. Its a very dificult at first , and a long game with friends. Play with AI is tricky and sort if you dont be carefullLast but not least the grafics are fair 7/10the gameplay isn't so good you need practice 5/10  the sound is very good,simply but very good  9/10you can play with 4 person 10/10 and some times the game is stuck , you need simply quit and countinue. 5/10thanks for reading this			"

												Review for owners of the physical version of Talisman:This is an awesome digital version of the game, and plays in a fraction of the time since all the rules and book-keeping are done for you.  Spell casting is a little quirky but if you read the tutorial closely and play a few times it's not a problem.Review for people who have never heard of this game:Talisman is a fantasy, D&D-esque themed game.  You are racing/battling your opponents to get to the center of the board to trigger the end game (which could be several different scenarios depending on what expansions you have).Be warned, however. You are playing against the game as much as you are your opponents.  While this game does not lack meaningful decision making, there is a heafty dose of RNG as well.    "

												After other players managed to convince me the constant crashes are due to a recent expansion and the Devs are usually on top of it with fixes, I realised that it was the hand of fate that made me start this game in the middle of utter chaos.Thus, on the basis of the game alone, I give it my thumbs up(changed from negative).Yes, the game itself, when not crashing, is fun. Well, for people with stamina and patience and time for a bit of commitment it is fun,for people that like the intimacy of boardgames it is fun, I do not recommend it for impatient kids that can't sit still for 15 minutes, because fun will not be had.Is it worth the money the expansion sets cost? That is something everyone needs to decide for themselves, in comparison I'd say it's not too steep (although I'm tight enough to have weighed these words before typing them).All in all, (and I'm liking it more every time I play a game without crashing), I give the game a careful 6.7 out of 10.Please take my playing time into account, which isn't very long, check the reviews of those who have been playing it for longer, or you know, take the plunge!Greetings fellow travellores and connaisseurs of Trollplaying games (TPG's) "

												Despite it's bugs and somewhat sluggish play, it's still Talisman- you can't just beat that. There are always people playing it (at least in Europe), the community is nice, even if there is a problem the devs help- not many games out there you can say something like that about. Yes, the expansions are pretty expensive, and the game itself is 4.5 ed (which is a shame, since the series became so stripped and partitioned compared to the 1st edition), but it hasn't lost it's magic in any way.10/10 would become a toad again.

Multiplayer is also buggy with frequent drops. Other bugs: At times players are unable to target or deselect target, incorrect sums with dice rolls and modifiers, some card/game mechanics just not working as they should 100 percent of the time. I am loving this game and wish there were not so many game breaking bugs. If these issues were fixed I would recommend this game.			"

And this isnt first and last game breaking bug sometimes game forces you to do something because it jams every other option.-Sometimes gameplay is super slow,like when you cast spells it takes far too longIf they fix the bugs ill give this port 9/10 (9 cause it could look more pretty) and recommend it but until then 4/10 cause of the bugs in this game.

On another, a card effect (reduces movement to 1) got stuck on me despite the AI having and then discarding the actual card. Ended up quitting that game too. The game also loses fullscreen mode on each Alt-Tab.As is, I might still grab the main game on sale. No DLC though - I wouldn't want to support game devs who prioritise DLCs over fixing major bugs.

												Ok, first of all there is no decent tutorial and the link to the rules leads you to an  extensive site full of text. First play I stayed completely lost in the game for several turns, the cards were showing up too fast and I had no idea of what was going on.After understanding a little of what was going on I tryed to play with random AI characters. I lost 3 encounters in a row on the first 3 tutns and died, while the AI got several followers and Items. Just a bad experience, ok I rage quit and restart.Second go: Oponent first turns rolls to other side of the river, flips 3 cards gets 7 gold. My first turn Dragon. Another bad experience, ok...Third try I realized I could set AI speed, I realized I could pause the game and check on the cards, but I still dont know where the buffs and debuffs are coming from, I loose battle even though I win battles, a guy fights me with 2 strenght and suddenly he has 8 strenght. I lost 3 turns in a row, frogged, one of my oponents has talisman, belt of strenght, solomons crown and a unicorn, I died once, got lost in cave and lost all my gold gambling.Long story short, I played the game times, never drew an equipment,the only follower i had was a hag and I died several times, while having no tooltips hints or decent tutorial, it took me an hour to realize my re-rolls were consuming fate counters and I couldn't understanding why it was not working anymore. I rage quit all of the games I started.Some my say it was just a bad luck or the game is hard, I see it as a very very bad experience that was worsen by the fact that the game leaves you in the dark.I still don't know what trophies are for, ehat happens when you fight a player, what's the point of capturing a wolf as follower and what or where is the chasm.[UPDATE]Just found out the dice rolls are rigged, no matter how many times I load the game on the same save spot, the dice results for ALL the rolls are the same, even the fate re-rolls are the sam. This was the most frustrating discovery so far. I don't know if there is a reason for that, or they just couldn't design an easy and simple dice roll algorithm.			"

												Cannot recommend at this time due to numerous bugs. Quite frustrating to play almost 1.5 hours into a game and have it crash due to a card error. Multiplayer is also buggy with frequent drops. Other bugs: At times players are unable to target or deselect target, incorrect sums with dice rolls and modifiers, some card/game mechanics just not working as they should 100 percent of the time. I am loving this game and wish there were not so many game breaking bugs. If these issues were fixed I would recommend this game.			"

												Talisman the board game in digital version.Theres no point reviewing the talisman itself,its a dice board game.you toss the die,move and stuff happens.However reviewing the digital content of this board game.Pros:-You dont need friends to play and you dont need to play all the characters alone if you wanna play-AI seems allright-Easy to change rules-If you like talisman the board game you like thisCons-Bugs bugs and bugs. i played more than hour in 4 player game online,so far we were all at outer and one player casted spell. it crashed the game completely. there was noway going back anymore. that shouldnt happen,if that happens you simply dont release the game. there is no price on good game and that lost hour. after you get over that the game was lost you simply think,should i start new game what if it crashes again after hours of playing? these things should not happen in game like this,never. And this isnt first and last game breaking bug sometimes game forces you to do something because it jams every other option.-Sometimes gameplay is super slow,like when you cast spells it takes far too longIf they fix the bugs ill give this port 9/10 (9 cause it could look more pretty) and recommend it but until then 4/10 cause of the bugs in this game.

												Incredibly fun and infuriating at the same time.  Requires more than 1 play through for you to really appreciate the game, and while the game is heavily luck dependant, there is strategy in managing your resources and coming up with plans to try and succeed from almost all points of the game.  You could be 2 turns from being the winner and then fnd yourself turned toad if youve wasted all your resources getting to where you are.  Two good bonuses to the already good game are that1) The bots are very well made and provide an excellent alternative for when you dont have friends to play with or cant find an open game online2) With the exception of the specific character DLC, as long as the host of a game owns a content DLC, players without the DLC can still join and play with the content (they still wont be able to use the DLC characters however)			"

												My hours in the digital version are small, but don't let that waver your opinion of my opinion of this unforgiving mistress of a game.I went out and bought the physical edition, and have accumulated several expansions because of how much I absolutely adore the abuse this game deals out (aka: I've dropped over $200 on this series alone).The gamestyle is a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of Dungeons&Dragons, and Munchkin.  You each have your own character with their own special attributes and abilities... and often try to screw each other over as much as possible to try and reach the Crown of Command.Expansion packs will add different endings to the game.  One being a Black Hole type card, where if you reveal it, you disappear into the void and the game ends for you.  She's a ♥♥♥♥♥, and I love her.Other endings can reward players depending on if you have the most gold by the end, a certain amount of trophies, etc.  Other endings are revealed at the beginning of the game; one expansion has a setting where all of the characters are by default good, and you're working towards a similiar cause.Expansions also bring different playstyles to the game.  Grim Reaper has already been introduced, who you can send after other players if you happen to roll a 1.""Blood Moon"" will introduce a werewolf, who moves when a 6 is rolled, and is a mirror of old Grimmy.City, Highlands, Dungeon, and Wildlands are all corner expansions which adds to the map itself.The digital version isn't without error.  There are occasional cards, that when played, will crash the game.  This is usually per them being a target card being played when there was nothing to target.  I wish there was a verify system before setting something into play.The Gold Pack is definitely worth it if you're looking into playing the game for a long time, as it includes every expansion available - and they will be released as they're finished by Nomad.  This also includes side character DLC!The way it works (since I couldn't find an answer to this when I bought the game), is that the person with the gold bundle should be hosting.  That way all of the people who join will have access to the content.  BUT, they will not be able to select any of the DLC characters.  They can, however, select random, and have a chance of drawing one (or three depending on house rules).An average game lasts anywhere from 2-5 hours from our experience.			"

												This is a very good way to test Talisman out and see if you like it before purchasing it as a board game. The physical game is more expensive, especially if you end up buying all the other characters and expansions, so I would definitely suggest buying everything on steam and testing it all out to see what you like and don't like. It is also makes the rules very clear opposed to the physical copy, which makes you guess at some rules because of wording. All in all, I would suggest getting this game if you are at all interested in buying the physcal version. You may even like this version more, as you can always join tables online if you want to play but your friends are unavailable. It is sometimes buggy and won't load characters the first time you start it up and friends join, but that problem goes away the second time you start the game. I own both the physcial and PC version of this game, and though I prefer the physcial board game, I do enjoy this thoroughly.			"

												After putting +100 hours in this game, i decided to write my first review, to hopefully raise awareness to this amazing tabletop. Talisman is great for fantasy lovers and offers lots of diferent heros with different abilities to play as, which is one of my favourite features in a game. All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential. Although there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times. Another thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise! Expansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!Pros: -Lots of fun with friends -Wide variety of heros -Playable on a toaster -Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn) -Unpredictable -Amazing when you have access to expansions -You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!Cons: -Very luck driven -Games are super long -Not as enjoyable if you dont have access to expansions -AI can be really dumb			"

												This game is the perfect example of emergent gameplay done right. In one game, that forest might be the home of a friendly fairy that grants wishes to the forces of light, while in another, it might be the lair of a terrifying dragon. Using multiple decks of cards with different effects and uses, you can craft the story of an evil leprachaun, who loses all his money and ends up in jail after a night of drunken revelry, or the tale of a lone bounty hunter with an enchanted flail, on the trail of a powerful sorcereress who stole his magic shield and destroyed the academy that trained his superhuman fighting skills, finally clashing at the highest peaks of the world. In another of my games, my Bard character managed to ensnare a fire breathing dragon with his music. In another, my alchemist discovered a bag that always had an extra gold piece inside whenever you ran out of money, with his abilities, I managed to turn this unlimited supply of gold into unlimited magical power. If you immerse yourself into the experience and roleplay it, stories build themselves right in front of your eyes. Every game is different, and with every expansion adding new locations, decks, characters and everything else, It can only get better.The AI isn't too bad either, I've seen characters doing crazy stuff like casting the offensive wind blast spell on themselves to fling across the map so that they're closer to where they need to be.If I could change one thing, it'd be the introduction of a way to turn off the victory conditions of the game, sometimes you want these random storied worlds of yours to live on longer.

												7/10 - Lovers of fantasy board games, buy. Others pass...Pros- Lots of Characters- Lots of Cards, Spells, & Events- Easy to play while multi-tasking (TV, other games, ect.)- Online multiplayer content.Cons- Too much DLC- I swear dice are rigged vs AI- Graphics could be better.- Repetative music.- Many mechanics to learn & employ.So, I'm not big on board games. I got this in a Humble Bundle & decided to try it out. For a board game, it's pretty entertaining. That's why I gave it a 7/10 & a thumbs up. If it weren't a board game, I'd give it a 4/10. The game flow is pretty boring & the DLC is somewhat frustrating.It's great that they want to keep the game up-to-date, & I don't expect them to work for free. However there's a bit of a pay-to-win feel, when you're looking at some of the newer content. It's not just new event cards, or ""Alternative Ending Cards"". It's new characters with OP abilities, or OP ""Runes"" (upgrades to base stats).I also wish there was more flash & awe while playing the game. I mean, you pick up a ""blizzard"" card; you expect to see the board covered in a wash of hail! You have tons of spells, but nothing beyond the card's artwork to help you imagine the effect! The game falls a bit flat when it comes to graphic possibilites.The same goes for the music. It's not bad, but it rarely changes. It's so monotonous. With so many events & the dynamic of ""who's winning"", alignments, what board section your in, ect. you'd think there'd me more variety.I complained about the game's loaded dice vs AI. I rolled a ""1"" 5 times in a row on the same square. This happened twice in one game, then once again in the following game. While it's not impossible to do, it's highly improbable. If the dice aren't loaded, maybe I should play the lottery...There's some strategy, but for the most part the strategy is overriden by the RNG of the dice rolls. Personally, I'd be more entertained with a game of Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. You have a greater feeling of control, knowing what's in your hand & in your deck. In Talisman: Digital Edition, nothing is guarenteed. You can have 8 godly items one moment; nothing the next. There's nothing you can do about it, & it just makes you feel like the game is a big waste of time.Lastly, there are a lot of quirks with regard to when & how you do things. I had a ""Siphon Strength"" card that I tried using for 10 turns. Suddenly it worked on an opponent that I never selected nor was he near me; just a random event. You need to learn which items are consumed on use, and which arn't. Or maybe you got turned into a toad. Is it worth it for you to land on that spot that gives you +1 Strength? Apparently not.If you like board games, then perhaps you'd be willing to learn all the quirks of this game. Personally, I'd rather play something more intuitve & gratifying. I may play this on occation if I'm stuck watching TV with the kids, but there are many other games that can fill the time with a better sense of achievement.			"

												Trying this on the free play weekend. 9 hours, 3 playthroughs against 3 AI opponents.The good:- addictive gameplay - would play with friends- content? (DLC, yeah...)The bad:- late game phases can get slow, even on max AI speed- BUGS. I had to kill the game on 2 different occassions, one of them being a crash to desktop. On another, a card effect (reduces movement to 1) got stuck on me despite the AI having and then discarding the actual card. Ended up quitting that game too. The game also loses fullscreen mode on each Alt-Tab.As is, I might still grab the main game on sale. No DLC though - I wouldn't want to support game devs who prioritise DLCs over fixing major bugs.

												A surprisingly charming and enjoyable throwback ruined by one completely fatal flaw: Matches can take well over an hour, even two hours with four players taking time to actually enjoy the game at a reasonable pace, and there is no meaningful pause or save feature in multiplayer. There is a hard coded timer you cannot disable, where if you are AFK for 5 minutes, the CPU instantly takes your turn for you, often making rather poor choices. Matches lose their luster when you realize you're locked into an endurance match and if you get up to do anything more involved than grabbing a drink, you'd better pray you're quick about it.It's a terrible shame, because it really is an enjoyable game that aside. But once you start playing, God help you if you want to take a break. This egregious oversight sort of destroys everything for what's supposed to be a computerized version of a BOARD GAME.			"

												Ok, first of all there is no decent tutorial and the link to the rules leads you to an  extensive site full of text. First play I stayed completely lost in the game for several turns, the cards were showing up too fast and I had no idea of what was going on.After understanding a little of what was going on I tryed to play with random AI characters. I lost 3 encounters in a row on the first 3 tutns and died, while the AI got several followers and Items. Just a bad experience, ok I rage quit and restart.Second go: Oponent first turns rolls to other side of the river, flips 3 cards gets 7 gold. My first turn Dragon. Another bad experience, ok...Third try I realized I could set AI speed, I realized I could pause the game and check on the cards, but I still dont know where the buffs and debuffs are coming from, I loose battle even though I win battles, a guy fights me with 2 strenght and suddenly he has 8 strenght. I lost 3 turns in a row, frogged, one of my oponents has talisman, belt of strenght, solomons crown and a unicorn, I died once, got lost in cave and lost all my gold gambling.Long story short, I played the game times, never drew an equipment,the only follower i had was a hag and I died several times, while having no tooltips hints or decent tutorial, it took me an hour to realize my re-rolls were consuming fate counters and I couldn't understanding why it was not working anymore. I rage quit all of the games I started.Some my say it was just a bad luck or the game is hard, I see it as a very very bad experience that was worsen by the fact that the game leaves you in the dark.I still don't know what trophies are for, ehat happens when you fight a player, what's the point of capturing a wolf as follower and what or where is the chasm.[UPDATE]Just found out the dice rolls are rigged, no matter how many times I load the game on the same save spot, the dice results for ALL the rolls are the same, even the fate re-rolls are the sam. This was the most frustrating discovery so far. I don't know if there is a reason for that, or they just couldn't design an easy and simple dice roll algorithm.			"

												One of the best board games of a long past era, Talisman evokes the core of 1980s RNG heavy dice rolling board games. For those of us who lived in that time, before Germany came along and showed the world how great board games can be, this is a well realized throwback nostalgia title. That's not to say Talisman is a great board game. It's really not. It's exceptionally RNG heavy and can be frustrating at times. But, it's also pretty fun. Particularly when playing with a group of friends over Skype, Mumble, etc. The game itself is very easy to learn. Roll a die. Move. Do what's on the board. Try to improve your character enough to get to the center, defeat the challenge, and win the game.The software implementation of Talisman by Nomad is pretty good. The animations and sounds are good, the graphics are pretty, and it plays the way you would expect. We've only run into a few bugs, one game-breaking, over a bunch of sessions. One of the really nice things Nomad did was allow the host's version of Talisman to be played. I have the full season pack, and a bunch of my friends have the core game only. I host, and we can play with all of the expansions.There are 3 expansions out so far. The best one at the moment is The Dungeon, which adds a large board segment to one of the corners. I'm very much looking forward to when all of the expansions are out and you can play a big mega game.Game time can run a bit long. While this is faster than the tabletop version, budget about one hour per player per game. I recommend, but this definitely isn't for everyone. I sunk about 100 hours into Talisman Prologue (which was their single-player ""Beta"" version of this and about a dozen hours so far for the full release. This is a fun one to pull out once in a while with friends, like any good board game.			"

												About 2 years ago (mid-2013), Talisman Prologue introduced me to Talisman on Android, and i thoroughly enjoyed it. When Talisman came out, i did not hesitate to get it and have not stopped playing it since. i only got Steam Talisman working in a Windows VM today, so Steam still rates me as a Noobite, but i've got well over 200 Talisman sessions behind me on Android. It is a near-perfect rendition of the board game (which i have also bought since becoming a fan). Many consider it to be too random, but the fact is that it holds a lot of strategy (part of which is dealing with the randomness). Talisman is _easily_ my most-played Android game, and now that Steam works on my desktop machine (via a Windows VM), it will certainly become my most-played non-Android/non-Linux game as well.If any notable degree of randomness just makes you angry, don't try Talisman, but if you're looking for a lighthearted beer-and-pretzels style fantasy romp, Talisman might just fit the bill in epic form.Tip for new players: PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LEARN THE GAME IN SOLO MODE BEFORE PLAYING ONLINE!!!! Few things are more frustrating in online play than having to wait for new players to read every single card and every single square every single turn. So please, for the love of your fellow players, play it solo _AT LEAST 50 TIMES_ before playing online. Learn 90%+ of the cards and board spaces by heart. Your fellow players will appreciate it and will stop dropping out of games which you cause to drag on for 2 hours longer than necessary because you didn't do your homework before playing. Please. Thank you.			"

												Short review: Yeah... No. Don't get this.Long review: I tried playing it on a free weekend with friends, and it became so ♥♥♥♥ing tedious we wanted to kill ourselves. The game drags on and on and on with no foreseen end to it, and the fact that almost everything is a huge gamble that can ruin your day with just a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rolls does not help it. The fact that it is so random ruins the potential for strategy, and it dragging so long makes the randomness frustrating. Not to mention, the UI is very unpolished and the expansions are very expensive.Buy it during a very high sale, and only if you can cope with very long games in which your worst enemy won't be the other players, but the Random Number God.

												I didn't have any experience with the board game before playing this, but I think they did a decent job explaining it. Don't get me wrong, it was lots that they didn't explain, but simply playing it and reading the tips they show is enough for you to get started and learn the rest on the way. The game itself had good variety with lots of different cards, enemies, playable characters etc. to make it fun even in the long run. Good graphics, decent background music and so many different even/object/spell cards that even if you have a good solid plan for then run, your opponent ""the monk"" still beats the crap out of your warrior and steals your great orb card, ruining the run for you.

												DO NOT BUY.I just lost my first game of this because the spell Healing didn't have any effect on me when it should've right at the end of the game. I also noticed other spells not actually having their effect trigger occasionally when they should. The spell Random was particularly bad for this, with AI opponents it was used on not even rolling for the effect sometimes (seems to be a problem particularly when someone is on the Crown of Command).The interface in this game needs work (sometimes you don't know what spell you're currently casting, or what type of card it wants you to select from where).It's generally pretty fun, but I simply can't play it while it doesn't abide by its own rules.

												Talisman as a board game is basically the definition of an Ameritrash game.  It's the game of life with a fantasy theme: roll dice, and see what happens.  There is very little strategy, the vast majority of choices are a coin flip or else a no brainer.  It can be fun with friends in person or over voice because you can mess with other players, but it is garbage as a solo game or against strangers online.  This computer version is curiously unresponsive to mouse clicks and there is a weird delay whenever you try to get more context information on a space or character.  Animations take a moment to come up and can't be skipped, everything feels heavy.  It seems like every time you do anything there is a tiny confirmation button to hit, even in situations where you have no choices and you see the same information on the next screen.    The interface doesn't take any advantage of being on a computer. For example the basic choice in the game choosing between moving between two spaces after rolling a dice.  It plays it just like the board game, ""helping"" by highlighting the squares you can move to.  You can right click (with the previously mentioned delay) to see what those spaces actually are.  Why doesn't the game keep the board in the background and bring up popups with information about your move choices?  I can't think of many people who wouldn't be happier sticking to the board game if they're a fan, or if not playing a different game entirely.			"

												I made the mistake of playing this, being a board game aficionado of sorts. I like to think I ""play"" a ""decent amount"" of ""board games"".I chose poorly here. Talisman is as follows: Roll dice. Go to space. Draw card. See what happens.That's it. There is no planning, no strategy, no thought. Roll dice. Highest wins. I rolled more dice in 2 hours last night than I remember rolling at a lot of longer sessions of Dungeons and Dragons, and yet no a single one of the dice I rolled during the game of Talisman really meant anything. The content is repetitive and the game is a chore to play, as several points are designed to arbtrarily lengthen the game simply based on a die roll, teleporting you back to previous portions of the map, or lowering your stats (forcing you to grind more adventure card sto 'level up' again), or simply kill you outright (the vampire rolls a 6. Lose 6 life. You died. Back to start.)And then, oh god, once you get to the end, you have a 50% chance of doing one damage per turn. I have never so fervently hoped for the dice to roll high so that I could die and the game could end, but the sweet, soothing release of death did not come. At the end, I watched a Wizard AI waltz up and slay the Fighter AI player who had gotten there mile sbefore him, nad had be simply rolled a 4, a 5, or a 6 at any point during the 9 turns he was on the Crown of Command, would have won the game. But he did not, and so Wizards win over martial classes once again. Thanks Wizards.In its defense: This seems to be a well done translation of the board game. The automation works well and outside a few quibbles like trying to figure out how to queue spells, the game worked well and both players realized how to do everything (aside from trade in trophieS: I looked at  aSteam guide for that) within a few rounds. But unfortunately, in this case, it's not really a plus: We figured it out so quickly, because there's just not that much to DO. So as a technical translation of a boardgame, it's very good. I am sure avid fans of Tlaisman will garner a greta amount of fun from the game, though I'm not sure I'd want to be there with them.You might as well roll a 1d6 before the game starts, and highest winner places themselves on the cente rof the board and wins, because that's about what Talisman boils down to. ""More content"" unfortunately would not fix what is an un-fun game to the core. At least Risk mitigates its dice rolling with the ability to actually choose and think over whta you do before you fling plastic cubes about.			"

That gives you the ""season pass"" (all current and future DLC + 5 licenses to give away as gifts).I thought it would be a great holiday present for my brother and 2 nephews.First off, it seems that only the purchaser (me) gets all the expansions. Everyone else gets the base game. This was not even close to clear in the listing on Steam.Secondly, the game is wildly unstable. It crashes nearly every time I launch it. Once you've crashed in a multiplayer game, Resume Game options simply don't work.I am on a MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM, so I have more than enough horsepower for this game.This is not even close to production quality. I love the board game, but this is a big disappointment. As far as I can tell, there is no way on Steam to submit a support request, so I can't even tell if the people I've gifted to have what they are supposed to have. Terrible, terrible support.I can't in good conscience recommend this game.			"

It is extremely tedious, as the board game experience doesn't translate well to the greater capabilities of computers - you spend most of your time waiting for other people to have their turns.

But when playing against AIs waiting isn't fun. It's annoying and tiresome.And the AI in this game thinks SLOWLY. VERY VERY SLOWLY. Even on maximum speed.And the graphics. Oh the graphics. It's good. Really. But SLOW. SO SO SLOW. The well intended animation of everything from rolling a die to the turn shifting to the next player makes the turns unbearably long.

Without it the pace of the game is so slow I'm compeled to give it a 3/10 - Nice try.			"

The games length and nature can cause random grueling sections (I once spent 30 turns fighting a player on the end game tile, where he kept hitting my armor and my attack was too low to kill him), It could be possible that with all the DLC the game would have enough content to be fun, however i'm not willing to put in $60 bucks for a truck load of DLC that may or may not create a satisfying experience, not to mention that $75 for a digital board game feels, and is a fairly crazy asking price.

												I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game. Whilst I have many fond memories of Talisman from my childhood, this is a terrible implementation of a game that has long past exceeded its best-by date.Talisman itself is sadly lacking in the current era of boardgames, with little to no strategy or choice left to the player. It is dictated far more by the random roll of the die, than any particular desire of the player. Even Monopoly provides more strategy, and choice of action. This is a faithful implementation of the original, for what little that is worth.The main issue is the interface, which is an abomination. Trying to play with friends rapidly becomes an excercise in extreme frustration, wherein you battle the shoddy controls - instead of battling your friends. Laggy, unresponsive and unintuitive are the nicest words I have to say about it. I wish I could refund it, and I feel terrible for gifting it to several of my friends who now all have a much poorer opinion of me.If you have any fondness for Talisman, any decent memories of the game - leave them as that, memories. Playing this game will leave only a bitter taste in your mouth of ashes and defeat. Nomad Games has my money - please dont give them yours.			"

												You'll have already read what the game is: a faithful recreation of a board-game classic with high fidelity to the original, a somewhat sketchy interface, a few bugs, and the same glacial pacing as if you were playing around a table, minus the board setup.AI is one of the keys to transition between in-person and computer-based play. The programmers haven't solved that problem well at all. Computer opponents don't have much strategy besides accumulating stats and items. They perform like mediocre bots in the single-player training missions of an online FPS. A human player would wipe the table with them every time, except the AI appears to get a boost via favorable die rolls and card draws, likely to disguise its lack of real strategy. The first few games this doesn't matter much, but after dozens of games it sucks the enjoyment out of it.If you have 3 friends willing to play the game with you, I'd buy this game in a heartbeat. If you're going to fill in with computer players--and especially if you just want to play single-player--this is probably a pass. For that reason--plus constant problems connecting with servers resulting in interrupted games--I have to give this game a no vote even though I generally like it. It's not a horrible purchase, just know what you're getting into.			"

Івенти, дайси, рок-н-ролл!Майже кожен з нас у дитинстві бавився в настольні ігри: монополія, ""сходи"" тощо. Кидай собі кубик, совай фішки і гати бізнес/опонентів. Тема більш серйозних настолок в пост радянському просторі розкрита слабо. По-перше, це дуже специфічна забава: деякі настольні ігри (особливо за редакцією правил D&D) настільки складні, що для розуміння найбанальніших аспектів потрібно витратити чимало часу на ознайомлення з правилами. По-друге, коло фанів та гравців хоч і розширюється, проте недостатньо швидко: знайти компанію для гри в реалі доволі тяжко. Проте розробники Talisman - комп'ютерного аналогу одноіменної фентезійної настольної гри від Games Workshop взяли курс на широкі маси.Та незручна мить, коли параметр ""Удача"" прокачаний на 1Суть гри на перший погляд виглядає доволі тривіально: ось тобі карта, ось тобі персонаж. Мета: ""всіх гепну і буду царювати"". Тут варто зробити уточнення, що сценаріїв є достобіса, але всі вони доступні лише в додатковому контенті... Проте відривати кревно зароблені гроші не обов'язково: стандартна карта доволі реіграбельна - велика кількість унікальних персонажів, що доступні зі старту, дозволить розбавити ігровий процес. Рухаємось ми по карті кидаючи ігрові кості (""дайси""). Якщо результат нам не дуже підходить, використавши один бал долі можна перекинути дайс. Також ця особливість стосується і певних локацій на карті (відьма, чаклун, цвинтар тощо). Особливо недитячий накал пристрастей і бурління емоцій викликають моменти, коли, в надії перекинути на що-небудь, окрім того що було, гравець отримує те саме значення на дайсі. 99% ragequit'ів і пригорілих штанів припадають на ситуації, коли вдруге випадає єдина нейприйнятна подія з шести можливих.Пересунувшись на певне поле, ми тягнемо карту з колоди подій. Події можуть бути різними: від дракона до того самого Талісману, який дозволить нам пройти до фінального рівня карти і, подолавши усі перешкоди, почати робити масовий абзац менш везучим опонентам.В процесі екстермінатусу ворогів нам допомогатимуть шмотки, супутники і навіть нейтрали (заваливши певну кількість істот можна прокачати магічну або фізичну силу персонажу). Проте, хоча багато чого і залежить від удачі і випадковості, не варто сліпо на неї покладатись, адже карти з закляттями і купа різного спорядження існує не просто так. Мудрі рішення - запорука перемоги. Для тих, хто любить очима Графомани можуть йти лісом, дивитись тут немає на що. Все гарно промальовано, але не більше. 2D інтерфейс доволі зрозумілий: якщо на карті стоять хрести, то це кладовище, якщо стоїть храм... Ну, ви зрозуміли.Ложка дьогтю в банці медуПохила навчання доволі крута. Перші 2-3 гри ви будете вигрібати механіку і задавати питання ""Що я? Хто я? Чому я?!"". Другий біль - відсутність локалізації: якщо ваша англійська складається лише із ""My name is Vova"" - бути біді. Тексту багато, читати його треба, інакше вашому протеже настане каюк.  Інший мінус - наявність у онлайн іграх тролів або людей, які через тільки Богу відомі причини стають AFK: чекання по півтори хвилини на хід гравця (яких може бути до 4х) вибішує жвавіше, аніж виступи наших депутатів. Трохи покращує ситуацію автозаміна хронічних слоупоків ботами і можливість продовжити гру пізніше.- Зараз буде шістка!- Ага, кидай вже.- Нуууууууууу....! [censored]!!!!!!Гарний тайтл, якщо є компанія друзів (зі знанням англійської) з якими можна забацати конфу в скайпі і розібратись, хто найвезучіший покидьок на селі. Трошки осторонь стоїть гра з незнайомими гравцями по Інтернету. Отже якщо ви запросто зриваєте джекпоти в казино або хочете долучитись до серйозних ""настолок"" і ваш інгліш включає не тільки сакральне ""F*ck you!"" - ласкаво просимо			"

												I tried, I really tried. I love the board game, I thought for sure this would be a great addition to my Steam library. But I've tried to play a dozen online games with friends, and every single one had to be abandoned when the game glitched. Either it would just lock up and refuse to go to the next turn, or someone would suddenly be dropped from the game and when they tried to rejoin the game would freeze up in some in-between-turns state. I tried, Talisman, but now you're getting uninstalled.What a sad waste of potential.			"

												DnD the board game. Really fun board game that is entirely based on dice rolls, no skill involved what-so-ever. Cannot recommend this game without the dlc, the additions to the board and extra characters are a must have, the base game will not keep you entertained for more than a few hours but with all the trimmings its endless fun. I cannot recommend this game sadly because it crashes very frequently and has no saving or drop-in/drop-out feature for multiplayer which means you can play for HOURS AND HOURS and then all progress is lost.

												I own the boardgame in its original form for at least 20 years now and I absolutely love it.When this software version of the game was announced I was really intrigued about how well it would turn out.Here is my advice vor players of the original boardgame:AVOID AND DONT BUY THIS F*CKING BAD CONVERSION OF A ONCE GREAT GAME AS YOU WOULD ALSO NATURALLY AVOID THE GAMES WORKSHOP VERSION OF THE GAME !!!And here is why:- Not all characters are included, you will have to buy them seperately like in the games workshop version- Fullscreen doesn't work properly on all setups. You will have to minimize the steam window else the game will always turn to windowed mode at startup- the boardgames original graphics on the board itself are way (and I mean WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY) more detailed than the blurry♥♥♥♥♥♥they serve you in this conversion here (though I have to admit I don't own the games the Games Workshop version of the boardgame, so it may be they are poorly done and do suck nowadays too.)- Some rules can be changed (what is good) but why can't i for eg say let's have ""N"" numbers of randomly chosen characters to select from in the beginning?- The descriptions on the single fields on the board don't include the inscriptions (and they wouldn't have been able to be read either if impelemented in the same blurry way like the background graphics), you have to click on them first to see it, and it must be your turn to be able to do so. WHY THE HECK? Include a tooltip you d*mb*ss programmers ... how old are you?- ...You know what? I don't have the time and / or the mood to write more about this as it turns out to be more and more to be a list of easyliy implementable ideas others get paid for. So if you wanna know how to do this game ""pixelperfect"" to it's true original form than contact me if you are one of the devs.One more thing:You wanna know the moment I rage quited the game?Here it is all about it:I played an elv. I found a wizards staff and got myself a spell. I wanted to use the spell the next round because I disliked the one I got and wanted to get a new one (by using the staff again). The spell was the one that blocks another player or enemy for one turn. As I should select one character to cast the spell on I selected a figure of another player on the board. This didn't work. Then I thought, ok click on the charakters Icon and I clicked on myself to test if it works and you know what? It did work. It showed my card AND another button where I could choose to do cast the spell. BUT NO ""GO BACK"" BUTTON?WTF?!?!?!?As I said, contact me if you want to overdo this game to a GOOD game that is worth the big name it's released under, but don't expect to get more infos or ideas for free ... Or is it free to get all the characters THAT FOR ALL TIME WHERE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BOARDGAME in this software version?...And now everyone please hate me for this review and vote me down ...*lol*@ngel			"

												There is a lot to be said about the charm of nostelgia... but not enough to deflect the idea that time can be cruel and that some things, like Talisman, do not age well.This game is quite a nice digital version of a boardgame from long ago, but as such it does not have the benefits granted from all the game development that would come after it.That is not meant to be a cruel jab, if anything is is an apology for why I can't find much positive to say.All you really need to know is that this game is an excercise in being given a very small set (usually 2) of options each turn based on the roll of a die. those options are then resolved throught the roll of another die... and then that loop is repeated for about an hour or more with plenty of long pauses taken at random intervals.Your input into this game is so small, and the luck so great that it is hard to truely feel that this game needs you to be present, or that any sucess or failure is yours to claim.The translation from cardboard to digital is well done and smooth in most places, but does have a few flaws, (there is no option to hide all of the A.I.'s desicion making if you are playing with bots, and it can only be sped up so much in the options... meaning that your already drawn out experiance is now stretched further and thinner.)It can be applauded for being such a faithful replication of a board game, but as to wether that excersice is, itself, worthwhile, my feelings lead towards: No.If you are an old board gamer who maybe missed out on this little bit of gaming history and wanted to experiance it, this is a good way to do so, but if you are anyone else, there are better digital board games, much better non-digital board games, and infinitely better digital adventure simulators.Try any of them before this.

												I would love to give this game a recommendation to purchase as it should be a fantastic game.  However, if you are thinking of buying this game, do not waste your money until the game bugs are all fixed.  The fun in this game should be the online gameplay. I've started well over ten games now and have not been able to finish one - every game has crashed! The game always crashes, and this really should have been sorted out before releasing the game.  Quite frankly, steam should refund all purchases as the game is completely unplayable and unfit for purpose (if it were any other product it would be breaching trading laws).  How the company can contine to sell expansion packs is beyond me - the original game needs massive improvement first.  You will waste your money if you purchase this as it will lead to no end of frustration in the online mode and  will be no enjoyment at all.			"

												A little bit too complex for its own good.   A game took me a good two hours with myself and three AI's, and you couldn't speed the AI turns up enough for my liking.  The second game was broken by an elf who spent the entire game teleporting between two forests, increasing their stats endlessley.  I would like to try the board game though.I played two more games to completion with 2 AI's, and the game is just way too random.  The frog mechanic can move a character from first to last place instantly, and sometimes there's nothing you can do to prevent it.  Getting the rolls you need to win is incredibly difficult, and once someone gets to the Crown of Power they almost always win.			"

												This game is full of bugs. The worst one even doesn't let you start the multiplayer match in 4 out of 5 tries, when the option ""Character selection"" (out of 3 Chars) is enabled, which usually is enabed for fair play. When this happens, the first player doesn't get a hero to choose from and so the room needs to be rehosted. More than that, the game crashes randomly or you just disconnect from the server, with sometimes beeing unable to rejoin the game. I've made a 4 player match where one player left the game at the beginning. Not a big deal, it happens often and the KI took over and the remaining three players continued to play for three hours. Then the player who left returned, which caused a crash to the other three players, while one was already at the crown and the game would have ended 10 minutes later. Great, three hours played for noting than frustration. The commentary of the returning player: ""Oh, I made it back right in time"". D o u c h e b a g -.-Singleplayer works fine, KI is ok, but since you normally want to play against other humans and not against the KI, this game sucks more often than it makes fun.			"

												Unless you're a huge fan of the original board game you might want to give this a pass.On the surface it's fine. There's a board. There are cards, characters and a die. Great. Unfortunately once you actually start to play you realize pretty quickly that you're dealing with a tablet port that's had oodles of time put into it on the dlc-front, but not so much on  the optimizing-for-pc front. There's the base game, then several expansions, then I don't even know how many characters for a buck or three apiece, and there ain't a thing wrong with any of that assuming the game plays well and stable on the average pc.That's where things begin to break down. There's a very long-standing and unresolved bug affecting a lot of people wherein if you afk from the game for anything more than about 60 seconds or so you'll return to a frozen screen, which you can only ""fix"" by force-closing the game in Task Manager and restarting. There's thread after thread after report after report on the Discussions page, and each says the same thing: ""File a bug report and email it to us w/a log"" and that's about it. There's been no solution to date, one year on, but boy oh boy have there been dlc galore in that time.The game interface itself is, to be charitable, minimal. There's very little in the way of options in the settings menu, in the main game UI you'll be left to pretty much figure things out on your own since there's no tutorial of any kind, and no game manual that I've ever been able to find that outlines basic rules, etc. I played the game for months before realizing that I could click on the bar at the top of the screen that shows the current turn, and that that would show me details about turn events like card text, who rolled what, and so on.In the same vein there are very, very few input options. You may use your mouse, and... that's almost it. Again, I played for months before discovering that clicking the spacebar = selecting whatever option is at the top right on your screen, be it ""encounter space"" or ""move here"" or whatever. There are no keys that do anything else whatsoever that I've seen. Again this is something that's been requested for a year on the forums, the ability to map some keys to common actions, and from what I can see the response has been the same every time: ""Because it would take a lot of time to code for different OS's, the game is kept basically in a tablet state to make it simpler on us devs"". Again, that constraint hasn't stopped them pumping out character and expansion dlc. That's the gist of it, anyway, so ask yourself if you want to pay 15 bucks for a tablet game on your pc.Game bugs: no shortage of 'em. Spell queueing is hit and miss, at best. Sometimes they work as you expect, other times they don't fire off at all or they do but not where you intended. There are cards that don't work at all in certain situations and cards that work in unexpected ways in others. Multiplayer games freeze and/or disconnect a random person, in addition to the aforementioned single player freeze. There is little to no hovertext, which in a game where you're forced to play with your mouse almost exclusively leads to a LOT of clicking. If you want to remind yourself what stipulations exist on a certain game square, for instance, you must click that square. This is fine unless you accidentally double-click, which is easy enough to do, at which point your character *moves* to that square whether you're finished reading its text or not. The same goes for many cards like spells or potions. Be careful clicking on them if you're simply trying to read them. One extra click and poof! there goes that spell you totally didn't intend to cast yet.I could go on but there's not much point. It *is* a game, and it *is* playable, but it isn't all that enjoyable to me to the point I'd recommend it to anyone, and the reason I go so far as to give it a thumbs down is simple: after months of waiting, pleading, begging the devs to show a little love to the pc community (whose money they seem to love enough, alright) their response was to post a new thread announcing an upcoming new Talisman game they're working on. Presumably we were all meant to shout ""Yay! Take my money!"", but to me it felt like someone who'd just mugged me asking if I'd like to buy my wallet back.Again, if you're a hardcore fan of the original, this will probably fulfill your digital desire to play, but it ain't gonna be a bug-free or hassle-free experience. If you're new to the gamel I'd recommend giving it a pass, unless the devs decide to pay it the attention they should've been paying from the start.			"

												Talisman is the classic adventure board game of powerful magic and ferocious creatures. Play as one of many classic fantasy archetypes such as an elf, wizard, monk, thief (and many more!) as you gain experience, powerful items/weapons, followers, spells and so on. Adventure around the board until you're ready to tackle the dreaded inner region, reach the Crown of Command, and claim victory! If you like gameplay that is all about playing the odds, you'll probably enjoy yourself in Talisman. At first glance it seems like a simple roll-and-move game where the player has little control over what happens to them during any given turn, but it's actually very involved as winning requires understanding how to create good odds for yourself. It's also a game where you need to understand that bad things WILL happen and there's nothing you could've done about it; or even if you lost a fight you shoulda won - it's ok because 80% odds in your favor means you'll still lose 20% of the time. Talisman is a very interesting mix of a laid back casual game (because of how simple any given turn is) and also a very cutthroat game. Players will clash in many PvP battles over the course of a game and powerful items will switch hands as players take them from each other through force or other means. You'll need to always take into account the other players, knowing which ones you should target and which ones will target you.So if you like fantasy adventure and gameplay that's all about navigating the wims of random luck, I highly recommend Talisman. It's a light game that manages to capture that feeling of going on an epic quest and overcoming great challenges. There's a reason this game is still around despite many bigger and more involved adventure board games being released since the 80s, so play this digital adaptation and find out what makes Talisman so special.

Do not buy unless it is on sale for $1.Talisman is one of the best board games that have ever come out. However, I am talking about the original board game, not the digital edition. I am not going to describe the single player feature as it is very poor and AI does not demand any thinking from the player, making the single player game easy, boring and discouraging. Therefore, I will concetrate on the multiplayer feature since it is the only feature worth looking at.The rules are very simple: roll a dice, move that many spaces, draw a card or cards, read them and d what the instruction tells you to do. Simple isn't it? Well, for developers it is not simple. The game is full of bugs and developers insist on working on new addons instead of correcting existing bugs. In other words - the game is not finished and really rushed and I need to point out it was released a long time ago. Too long for such issues to happen. The game can freeze or crash just after loading it. I experienced game freeze on the main menu several times - solution, do not leave the game on the title screen or it will stop responding. You will be forced to start the game again and/or start Steam again, and/or reboot your system.The game was not properly tested before release and it is more than obvious.  A lot of cards do not work as they are supposed to. Many card effects lead to a dead end as you will not be able to do anything (I see that problem with many spells while casted on other players). Example: after casting for example, Misfortune spell on the opponent, the game stopped responding and did not give any player any opportunity to make their moves, the game stops, the timeout counter freezes and you or any other player is forced to leave the game in order to make it move on. Connection issues occur every game. Some players are kicked out of the server for no reason. Sometimes you cannot go back to the game you were playing.  After joining the server and starting or looking for a game, your game can stop responding, forcing you to reboot your game and ocassionally your Steam and/or your system. Who put Quit button in the Settings? Standing ovation for the analysts/architects/developers and anyone responsible for this sensible chuckle design. I laughed, my friends laughed. Good comedy. There is no way to speed up the game play. It goes very long and I played some games for such a long time that I do not recall any actual board games to last that long (and I played with 7 people at a time!). You have to wait for every action even if no action is available at the moment. For example: even though you have only one choice, the system does not automatically go with the only choice but waits for you to select it. Bad idea. There is a number cards that do not work properly or do not work at all and when it comes tot he interaction betwen some cards, majority of such situations lead to a glitch, mostly forcing you to rejoin the game or restarting it. Each new addon comes with a new set of bugs. Beware. Random Number Generator is really poor and developers should think before they do something rigged as this. There is a chance that you will throw ""1"" for about 5-10 times in a row which is impossible if you were really rolling dice. This NEEDS to be fixed. I remember rolling the same set of numbers several times in a row. Bad development. There is no explanation for such bad execution of dice roll simulation. You can be kicked out of the game without any chance (yes!) for coming back. The game tends to bug out and nothing can be done to go back to it. Progress is lost. The most disappointing. Inviting your Steam friends is very buggy. I have never successfully invited anyone without a crash, so I do not use that feature.TL;DR - If you want to play the great game which is Talisman - go and buy the original board game, you will never have to reboot anything, wait for anything to happen, look at bugs, being surprised that nothing what the card described happened. Digital edition is faw away from being a good product. It is fair for now, but it is closer and closer to being bad if noone takes care of basics like card working. Less development on new addons, more at bug fixing, please.I paid $1 for the game and that's how much it is worth Pros:- Classic Talisman game!- Many addons and characters that make games more interesting- You do not need addons to actually play them, only one person in the game needs them- Very good music- The cards are taken straight from the board game version!Cons:- The game is not finished- Bugs ruin the game experience- Connection issues that seem to go worse with time- No way to join the game that is currently in progress - in the board version that's what makes this game so attractive, no matter how many people are currently playing, you can always join- Bad mutliplayer and overall game issues force players to leave the game early (ruining the game)- Less and less players (20 average) playing the game online (which is very sad)Do not get me wrong = the game is fun but the way it was developed forces you to abandon the idea of playing. Board games are not supposed to be that frustrating when it comes to gameplay. This game would be better if not rushed so much. If developers concetrated on the Basis of the game instead of looking for easy cash selling characters or addons - I would recommend it 100%. Sadly, I cannot do that and reasons for it are mentioned above.These issues are serious as I see less and less players online. "

												There's no satisfaction in winning or losing as the entire game (except for the spells aspect) is based 100% on luck. I'd never thought I'd find a game based more on luck than Monopoly, but here it is. If you like to strategize then this game is not for you, your ability to reach the end and win is purely determined by dice rolls and luck of draw cards (all dice rolls are pre-calculated before the game starts). No strategy will overcome events like being turned into a toad 7 times within 8 turns (yes this did happen) or losing a fight with a 60/50 chance of winning 13 times in a row (yes this happened too). Talisman is really just a dice simulator with music and ren fair style graphics, and just ended up in my uninstall pile.			"

												Talisman is a very poor board game to begin with. Main game mechanic is frustrating the player. A dice game that goes on for 3-8 hours. The Digital edition is a bad port of the board game. It forces you to watch hundreds of die-roll animations every game. It's bug-ridden and you can not expect anything to work at any time - it will just not function, at random critical moments. Interaction with the game is often non-intuitive and cluncky. You can forget multiplayer as it crashes at random roughly 9 of 10 games. Talisman Digital Edition runs a DLC greed-scheme, where they offer you the game piecemeal for an insane price. This is as bad as it gets.			"

												2 Words: DLC marketplace. Its one thing when you have dlc in your game, its another when the minute I try to create a game I'm slammed in the face for not having 90% of the content available. This is most evident in the player selection where it shows you the 6 heroes you own and the 50+ that you do not in a hodgepodge of little icons with no labels.Look, I can understand having DLC as a part of the game, but DLC constitutes almost 4 times what the base game has to offer. And if you really want to enjoy this game, its basically mandatory. Avoid this marketing strategy and avoid this company. A 14.99 game should not feel like an incomplete experience and have dlc content that is pushed this heavily on its players. Expansions are fair, but DLC should not be required to enjoy the game nor be pushed as heavy handedly.			"

												A little bit too complex for its own good.   A game took me a good two hours with myself and three AI's, and you couldn't speed the AI turns up enough for my liking.  The second game was broken by an elf who spent the entire game teleporting between two forests, increasing their stats endlessley.  I would like to try the board game though.I played two more games to completion with 2 AI's, and the game is just way too random.  The frog mechanic can move a character from first to last place instantly, and sometimes there's nothing you can do to prevent it.  Getting the rolls you need to win is incredibly difficult, and once someone gets to the Crown of Power they almost always win.			"

												Not recommended for single player.Played the demo through several games. Did not play multi-player only played single player.Ran into game breaking problems with the AI in single player:1.) AI is dumb as a rock. All it had to do was move foward to the command square and crush me. It was way overpowered from running around the board collecting loot/kill trophies but instead of attacking it continues to run around like a headless chicken. I sit at the crown square and roll one dice (d6, 1-3 no damage, 4-6 1 damage to all enemy) over and over and over and over....bleh Can't move out and I'm using a melee character so only option was rolling every round. I was actually hoping the AI would crush me to put me out of my missery but quit game and started another. 2.) There was a healer card on the board at the forest during one game. All other AI's dead from attrition by d6 crowning them. The elf can teleport from woods to woods so there I am rolling d6 at the crown square and the elf just keeps warping from woods to woods back and forth healing. That's it. It's a stalemate, unbreakable loop. I can't move, attack, nothing while the elf just teleports from the woods with healer to another woodland square than back again. Well played AI, you have defeated me with boredom.Shut the game off and decided not to purchase after playing demo.			"

												My first gameplay...Picked the Gambler.Rolled low, went to Tavern. Got drunk, lost a turn.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Dragon with 7 strength that rolled a 6. Lost a life.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Craft 5 creature that rolled high. Lost a life.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Pig with 1 strength.OMG.. I'm going to beat it. Pig rolled a 5. Beat me by one point. Lost a life.Lost the game.Beat by bacon. 10/10 Would lose to bacon again.---------------------UPDATE: The game can be fun.. but after finding out that all dice are predetermined at the beginning of the game I will not be recommending this and giving it a thumbs DOWN now. This is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor mechanic and development choice for any developer. Why give people the illusion they are rolling a dice for random rolls if they are not truly random when thrown? Those times I'm feeling lucky and end up with those craptastic one's make me feel cheated since I now know they were picked when I started the game. Coding in a SIMPLE RNG routine for each roll is NOT that hard and actually would use less resources than storing up a predetermined roll chart. I know this because I AM a developer. You wanted to prevent people from reloading a game and possibly rolling a better RANDOM roll? **WRONG** The same principle can be used by that same person because they know what the next roll is going to be and they just reload and choose a different course or action. You haven't foiled their attempt to get ahead.			"

												This is not a computer game. It's a board game on a computer, which is perfectly legitimate.But how does it stack up as a board game? Even there its basic design fails.Don't get me wrong. There are some great things about this board game, especially the replayability and variety of interesting scenarios (for a board game), if you're willing to fork over money for a lot of DLC. However, where the game fundamentally fails in two areas:1) You have very little ability to control where your character goes and what it does, which means you can spend long portions of the game just wondering around, rolling dice and seeing what happens (or doesn't happen, as the case may be). This makes the game very luck based, but worse than that, it becomes pretty tedious, especially when the board becomes filled with cards that effectively don't do anything.2) It's really hard to end the game; partially because the game requires you luck out on a series of dice rolls just to get to the point where the game starts to end; partially because the game doesn't really penalize you at all for trying to power up indefinitely before heading to the end game; and partially because the first character to get to the end of the game gets the dubious honor of being forced to sit there doing nothing but rolling one die to see if maybe they'll do 1 point of damage to the other characters.With some of the above problems fixed, Talisman could become a fun board game/computer game, but as it is, you spend most of your time waiting for your turn in the hope that you'll get to do something interesting.

												I'm a lifelong board game fan, and bought Talisman: Digital Edition to see if I would like it well enough to purchase a tabletop copy for my collection.  Unfortunately, this digital edition has bugs and glitches that have kept me from finishing a game, primarily with AI getting stuck - unable to make a decision, and unable to force the AI to continue.  What I learned is that Talisman relies almost entirely on luck - rolling dice and drawing cards for everything.  Not enough strategy for my tastes.  And this digital edition still seems to have serious issues that make me not want to play, despite decent art and music.  If you like the fantasy theme, stick to the tabletop version, or try Descent: Journeys in the Dark instead.			"

Priestess = OP  same with the other classes that cycle spells.  Quick note about the AI, if you let them get to the vampire's Tower get ready for the AI to get stuck in a loop for hours.  They can't decide which follower is worth getting rid of.  Best fix I've found is restart the game until the AI decides to go away from the Tower.Collecting Runes does provide some replayability.

												First off, unless I'm mistaken, this is my first Steam review. I hate that it's negative, but I am way too ticked off at this game NOT to give it a negative review. Second, this game makes me wish I had bought it AFTER the Stean refund policy change. I would refund this pile in a heartbeat. Now let me get into the things I hated about the game. Also, for the most part, you are not going to read anything here that are not in the other reviews. If you like the board game, you might like this if you don't crash. If not my gripes are similair to othersSo, I bought this game a few months ago, but never got around to playing it. I left Neverwinter Nights, and get a pop-up saying if I buy a character for Talisman the profits with go to charity. Great! I love to help charity. And it is a shaman. Shamans and Druids are some of my favorite characters. So load up the game, and search the main page for a tutorial. There's none, which is troubling, but I figure, 'hey, it's probably a tutorial as you play kind of game'. Which it is. Problem is you ghave to choose your character with stats that you have NO CLUE what they do. So I do what I always do in a fantasy game where I'm not sure about the mechanics. I pick the Warrior, because it is almost aways the easiest class. I also make sure there is only one  opponent, because i wanted the make the game as easy as possiblee.Then I get into the game. My first turn I roll, get a 6 move to the temple. My whole strategy tois to get the two weapons that the fighter can have, then play from there. I roll again, then have to fight an ape. I lose. No prob. It's the beginning of the game, and I can't expect to win every dice roll. Now I don't remember all my opponents turns, (partly because he was taking turns when I was reading text) but basically he didn't have ONE bad thing happen on any of his turns. So, I take my thirds turn and fight a creature with craft, and lose again. Next turn, roll again, got a dragon, lost again. Now mind you, you don't get a choice on whether to fight or not. Some classes give some choice in some situations, but mostly, roll and get blssed or f-d. So, I'm down 3 lives, and have some event where I lose ANOTHER LIFE! My opponent. Again, my opponent has lost no life, and hasn't even had to fight. I am a WARRIOR and I have won no fights. I just want a weapon. So I spend my one gold to get back 1 hp because I am at one HP. THEN I get the second gold that would have allowed me to get a weapon.  Then I roll a demon which I would have to roll a 6 to tie. So back to 1 hp. At this point I say F this game. So I want to see what happens when you die, so I attack the creature with craft (magic) because he should have an advantage. And THEN I win. *Faceplam*Anyway I was done within 5 minutes of that. My opponent was already in the second ring. This game is JUST RANDOM LUCK. I own 600 on Steam, (though I've prob only played a little over 500 of them) and this will likely wind up on the bottom 50 of them.			"

This makes the game very luck based, but worse than that, it becomes pretty tedious, especially when the board becomes filled with cards that effectively don't do anything.2) It's really hard to end the game; partially because the game requires you luck out on a series of dice rolls just to get to the point where the game starts to end; partially because the game doesn't really penalize you at all for trying to power up indefinitely before heading to the end game; and partially because the first character to get to the end of the game gets the dubious honor of being forced to sit there doing nothing but rolling one die to see if maybe they'll do 1 point of damage to the other characters.With some of the above problems fixed, Talisman could become a fun board game/computer game, but as it is, you spend most of your time waiting for your turn in the hope that you'll get to do something interesting.

												I'm a lifelong board game fan, and bought Talisman: Digital Edition to see if I would like it well enough to purchase a tabletop copy for my collection.  Unfortunately, this digital edition has bugs and glitches that have kept me from finishing a game, primarily with AI getting stuck - unable to make a decision, and unable to force the AI to continue.  What I learned is that Talisman relies almost entirely on luck - rolling dice and drawing cards for everything.  Not enough strategy for my tastes.  And this digital edition still seems to have serious issues that make me not want to play, despite decent art and music.  If you like the fantasy theme, stick to the tabletop version, or try Descent: Journeys in the Dark instead.			"

												Love it. I first played this board game when it came out in the 80's and loved it. I have played it several times since with various expansions and seeing it come to life digitally brought back so many memories.It is practically identical to the original board game, and does have a few annoying bugs (mostly around spells not quite activating the way they should) but outside of that this is a really well done port of the original.It is just as unbalanced as the original board game but the runestones go a small way to helping that out, bringing the weaker characters into the mix nicely.Recommended and looking forward to all the future expansions. Bring on the dungeon!			"

												A great fun game that I have played loads with the bird. I'm giving it a negative review becuase it seems to bundle the updates (which are few and not nearly good enough) with the DLC which means you dont get the vital updates unless you pay for the expansions. I might have that wrong but it is what is seems to suggest in the expansion descriptions. If that's true it is the most disgustingly cynical behavour I have ever se... oh wait it's Games Workshop.

												One major complaint is the dice rolls are most certainly not in your favor by any means. Literally, I've been at the command spell space for over 100 rounds, 1 out of 10 rolls is higher than a 3. Every time my cpu opponent gets to 1 life, he gets a perfect roll to get his life completely recovered... rediculous!!!This completely turned the game from a thumbs up to a most definite thumbs down.

												This game is a joke, I've never seen a game with so many bugs. It's just unplayable in multiplayer. The game ALWAYS crashes for some reason, when it's not network connection being lost. I played it when it came out, bugs. It stopped playing for 4 months and gave it another chance, as buggy as ever. You play for one or two hours, and then bang! game freezes. The only reason why people are still playing it is that it's a cult game, and actually a great game and fun to play when you're a fan. It's sad because this game had so much potential.			"

												Brilliant digitial port of this classical adventure boardgame!  If you liked playing the original boardgame you cannot go wrong buying this.  With the added bonus of no taxing setup and no errant pets/children suddenly destroying the game position as well as the ability to simply exit from your game and then resume it at a later date (works with both single and online gameplay) with no hassle.  Excellent online community allows lots of replayability once you've mastered the AIs efforts.  With the game getting constant further expansions and updates this game can only get better. "

												As the Germans would say, ""Na Ja"". Games like this shows the flaws in the Steam review system. I'm going to have to give it a recommendation, simply because it did entertain me for a couple of hours, but however much fun with the family a board game like allows at Christmas, playing on a screen is just boring. For the uninitiated let me explain.For the first couple of hours I was enthralled. Learning all the rules, all the magical cards and their powers, all the items and followers. I thought I found something really deep to get my teeth stuck into. YAY! 4 hours in, I come to the damning and sad realisation. I am playing monopoly, in a D&D setting... but it's still monopoly. Aka, roll a dice over and over until you win or lose. The lack of strategy and the high percentage of luck mean that the hour long games that are needed to complete Talisman feel like little more than flipping a coin over and over to see who gets more tails than the other. So 5/10 from me... but if you see this for a buck and want a few hours novelty, it could be worth it!			"

												A  fun and entertaining game, however the AI is complete and utter, bull. I can not stress this idea enough. I spent half an hour trying to kill the only remaining Swashbuckler in a 1 vs. 5 AI game. He would not simply die. What i mean by this, is that he would honestly get down to 1 life point remaining and then miraculously roll the die into the perfect number to land on a square in which he could heal. It did not also help that he had a card that gave him a minimum of 1 gold at all times. The game finally ended when the AI moved him into the most inner ring where he had no methods of self healing.  Overall it's a great game and lives up to the experiences i've had through the actual irl gameboard. However this game requires a lot of patience. I don't reccommend this game if you don't like waiting forever to end the game. (If the turns are slow, you can fix that in the advaced settings.)			"

												I got this game as a gift from Aione, one of my female friends. Wasn't really interested into Dice games before, mainly due to the lack of multiplayer. But first game I played with two friends went freaking brutal. This game gives no ♥♥♥♥♥ about how well your doing... you start doing well is only a sign that something is about to royally f* you over.Which makes this game highly entertaining to me :DTalisman the base game, is exactly like the board game. Everything is up to chance, and it is your mission to conquer the board. Digital Edition offers progression as you win or loose games. With the multiple expansions to this game, the season pass is WELL WORTH IT!If you like RPG Dice Based board games or simply want to keep in touch with people across the country with game nights. This game is right for you.			"

You will behold:-Getting stuck in a marsh.-Having your face punched in and your best items taken by other players.-Encountering a dragon on your first turn.-Becoming a toad and roaming the land uselessly for three turns.-Meeting Mephistopheles, becoming evil, and then on your next turn meeting an Angel who smotes you for being evil.-Watching other players fight at the Crown of Command while you run around trying to get your stats above 5.-Being forced to drop all of your stuff and watching another player roll perfectly to land on it and get it all.But all is not terrible in the land of nut-punches!  You will also witness amazing feats of fiat!  Behold:-Other players getting a Talisman on their first turn.-Other players getting the holy lance the turn before landing on a dragon.-Other players being showered with gold and followers.-Other players facing the difficult choice of which of your items to wrest from your battered body.-Other players dropping their extra Talismans to make room for Rune Swords and Rings of Can't-Be-Affected-By-Your-Stuff.-Other players not fighting each other because beating up other players is bad, unless those other players are you.-Other players dicing with Death and winning effortlessly.This game is a ten out of ten for those people who enjoy failing miserably, being ground into the dirt, and generally being regarded as a loot pinata by every other character.  If you are into having your sensitive parts shocked with electric pokers, this game is going to make you tingle.  4 out of 5 schoolyard bullies recommend this game.			"

												Adds nothing to the Talisman experience. If you don't have the boardgame it may be worth a purchase, but finding out that basic game breaking bugs *still* exist in this game while they push DLC is really disappointing. They should at very least add an option to back out of queued spells before they are cast.			"

												Spend your time with RNG.Also, crash a lot in multiplayer.A lot.Granted it IS a fairly done rendition of the board game, but lack of added features combined with difficulty of certain things in-game that are easy to do in real life (like just taking a closer look at a particular area) make this less than a stellar pick.  As a recreation of the board game, not the worst.  But as a computer game overall, not good.I don't regret the money I spent on this, but I *really* cannot recommend this unless you're a fan of the board game. If you are a fan of the board game, pick it up; you can typically find a game at least on Europe server (and you can easily see different servers for different areas of the world and switch between them), though you will crash, you *can* rejoin so it's not the end of the world.

												It’s unfortunate but Talisman is regrettably too feature starved to recommend.And it’s not the expansions being individually sold, as that’s how the tabletop game is presented – it’s the awful connection issues, the inability to save an online game (you can resume the last game played online and those who played may reconnect, but that limits you to one game on the go), the bare minimum of the interface being explained (Counterspell must be queued up – ie; cast before the spell you’d like to prevent – because…because I don’t know) and the like.  Players can’t view the board spaces and the cards on it on another players turn.  And the AI (which can be played with in a multiplayer game to add players to the game) isn’t really competitive.  It doesn’t try to “win” the game.Now, the good is it’s pretty faithful to the boardgame, and when it works and everyone remains connected it’s a pretty good way to scratch that itch. But the constant interruptions just drag the game on. It's a shame. "

												I don't understand how the metascore was so low... then again, i don't use the metascore as a solid guide anyways.  I would recommend this game to folks who are in to fantasty board games. i thought the game was fairly simple and it only took me about two games to fully understand the concept and what the characters do.  i have had a grand time with friends who also purchased this game.  i would not necessarily recommend the game to individuals who want to play by themselves.  some of the matches can last up to 3 or 4 hours and playing by yourself is just not my cup of placenta.  talisman is fair in the sense that it is chance; your battles are similar to that of risk, however you build on your attributes such as strength and craft (magic).  some characters have neat perks to assist you in acquiring the talisman to reach the center of the board.  the characters provide you with a bit of variety and the adventure cards and item cards you get to draw are numerous.  i find the game both amusing and entertaining.  i would recommend this game if you like old school board games i.e. dungeon (from gary gygax in 1980.) hope you cats have fun too! <3			"

												I recommend this game, however, with one caveat: This game WILL BE an excellent game, once 2 things are ""fixed"".  1. there are still a couple of bugs that still need to be fixed.  and 2. The game is very ""simple"" compared to the old Talisman version with all the expansions. (city, dungeon etc).  So its gets ""boring"" very quickly and limits ""replayability"".  I see great potential for this game and the initial beta purchase was well worth the money and time spent.			"

												Within the supple folds of this ancient board games embrace you will find nothing but horror.  To step foot in this tortured program is to witness suffering and agony unlike any before.  You will behold:-Getting stuck in a marsh.-Having your face punched in and your best items taken by other players.-Encountering a dragon on your first turn.-Becoming a toad and roaming the land uselessly for three turns.-Meeting Mephistopheles, becoming evil, and then on your next turn meeting an Angel who smotes you for being evil.-Watching other players fight at the Crown of Command while you run around trying to get your stats above 5.-Being forced to drop all of your stuff and watching another player roll perfectly to land on it and get it all.But all is not terrible in the land of nut-punches!  You will also witness amazing feats of fiat!  Behold:-Other players getting a Talisman on their first turn.-Other players getting the holy lance the turn before landing on a dragon.-Other players being showered with gold and followers.-Other players facing the difficult choice of which of your items to wrest from your battered body.-Other players dropping their extra Talismans to make room for Rune Swords and Rings of Can't-Be-Affected-By-Your-Stuff.-Other players not fighting each other because beating up other players is bad, unless those other players are you.-Other players dicing with Death and winning effortlessly.This game is a ten out of ten for those people who enjoy failing miserably, being ground into the dirt, and generally being regarded as a loot pinata by every other character.  If you are into having your sensitive parts shocked with electric pokers, this game is going to make you tingle.  4 out of 5 schoolyard bullies recommend this game.			"

Killing other players is so hard it's almost  a pointless feature to have in the game.Reading some forums I've seen people mention that you can configurate the rules to make the game more playable, but their initial setup/the way they want you to play is worse than any other paid game I've ever tried.The game has also been a bit buggy (crashing and unable to find some friends when making a game.)

												Not a very fun game unless you enjoy praying to RNGesus. I played my first and last game against the AI to learn how the game works. Got to the crown around turn 60, then spent another 60 turns sitting on that space doing nothing. Once you get to the center you're stuck rolling until you get booted or you kill everyone. Meanwhile, the AI jerked around in the outer ring of tiles healing up at least as must damage I was dealing from the crown.While sitting through this mind-numbing experience I found that you can set ""house rules"" to end the game when someone reaches the crown, or to stop healing when someone is at the crown, but the fact that there are such glaring design flaws in the base game is pretty unforgivable.

												They really need to fix the RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Countless times have my friends and I used fate to re-roll, only to get the SAME EXACT ROLL AGAIN. When you roll a one, which turns you into a toad, you're more than likely to re-roll. I've never seen my friends, or myself for that matter, manage to re-roll ANYTHING besides a one. It's infurating.			"

												There is a marathon game of talisman with each players having a one of the unquie characters each and I suggest a pull of a barrell draw with first the correct amount of players being enough but no more for each player to have one character of each type. The  method of which each player must outlay the total sum of money to the amount of supposing one dollar per character in total , Roughly 50-60 $ or around abouts , Then each of the 50-60 players approximately the exact amount of the full number of characters that the talisman game and all supplements included for one dollar each , Then the barrell draw for first player who receive no money but first choice of the character selection un-inhibited then the next barell draw is a players that receive a choice of characters , without the previous character chosen by the first player and also receive one dollar back for each number that lessen the characters being chosen by dollar of increment for the players  one after the next until last person to receive the only character left with all but one dollar return so what the last player wagered is the same as every player but they all received the increment according to how they were picked in the cue and their was less choice of character but more initial return for their lessened choice of characters ,So first out of the barrell gets no money back but chooses first from all the characters  where the opposite gets  all money bar one dollar and the last characters left , all leaves a amount that can be from expenditure range from first mentioned to previous mentioned and the in between through the incremental prize pool where once these are ready then a sum of the entire pool minus 10% for handling the the game by administration and the rest of this prize pool going too the winner(s).

												Brilliant digitial port of this classical adventure boardgame!  If you liked playing the original boardgame you cannot go wrong buying this.  With the added bonus of no taxing setup and no errant pets/children suddenly destroying the game position as well as the ability to simply exit from your game and then resume it at a later date (works with both single and online gameplay) with no hassle.  Excellent online community allows lots of replayability once you've mastered the AIs efforts.  With the game getting constant further expansions and updates this game can only get better. "

												As the Germans would say, ""Na Ja"". Games like this shows the flaws in the Steam review system. I'm going to have to give it a recommendation, simply because it did entertain me for a couple of hours, but however much fun with the family a board game like allows at Christmas, playing on a screen is just boring. For the uninitiated let me explain.For the first couple of hours I was enthralled. Learning all the rules, all the magical cards and their powers, all the items and followers. I thought I found something really deep to get my teeth stuck into. YAY! 4 hours in, I come to the damning and sad realisation. I am playing monopoly, in a D&D setting... but it's still monopoly. Aka, roll a dice over and over until you win or lose. The lack of strategy and the high percentage of luck mean that the hour long games that are needed to complete Talisman feel like little more than flipping a coin over and over to see who gets more tails than the other. So 5/10 from me... but if you see this for a buck and want a few hours novelty, it could be worth it!			"

												A  fun and entertaining game, however the AI is complete and utter, bull. I can not stress this idea enough. I spent half an hour trying to kill the only remaining Swashbuckler in a 1 vs. 5 AI game. He would not simply die. What i mean by this, is that he would honestly get down to 1 life point remaining and then miraculously roll the die into the perfect number to land on a square in which he could heal. It did not also help that he had a card that gave him a minimum of 1 gold at all times. The game finally ended when the AI moved him into the most inner ring where he had no methods of self healing.  Overall it's a great game and lives up to the experiences i've had through the actual irl gameboard. However this game requires a lot of patience. I don't reccommend this game if you don't like waiting forever to end the game. (If the turns are slow, you can fix that in the advaced settings.)			"

												I got this game as a gift from Aione, one of my female friends. Wasn't really interested into Dice games before, mainly due to the lack of multiplayer. But first game I played with two friends went freaking brutal. This game gives no ♥♥♥♥♥ about how well your doing... you start doing well is only a sign that something is about to royally f* you over.Which makes this game highly entertaining to me :DTalisman the base game, is exactly like the board game. Everything is up to chance, and it is your mission to conquer the board. Digital Edition offers progression as you win or loose games. With the multiple expansions to this game, the season pass is WELL WORTH IT!If you like RPG Dice Based board games or simply want to keep in touch with people across the country with game nights. This game is right for you.			"

If not...the game is very slow (even at highest speed), clunky, and boring. I only played a couple hours and it literally consisted of clicking dice roll, and then moving that many spaces. This is just not a game that works well without friends present.Additionally  the layout of the game is just plain confusing. There were so many times I was trying to click on cards to read them, then accidentally moved there, or did something else. The interface is not intuitive at all.			"

												Buy the board game, and walk away quickly from this digital debauchery.Each of the cards at least seems to work exactly like the board game, though the interface leaves a ton to be desired. Game may crash after finishing a round, stays in windowed mode at all times, ignores most key presses, no help dialogue, and on and on.The game likes to automate SOME the things that are player choices (like using the Orb of Knowledge) and other times make you click Continue way too many times. The worst part about it is  the inconsistency. There are actually times where your turn is finished for you, even if the timer doesn't run out. Another issue there: there's a mandatory timer! Shortest timer is 30 seconds, longest is 2 min.Overall, this version taught me some things that were a little confusing in the tabletop version, but via teeth-pulling. If you're a hardcore fan, buyer beware.			"

												Awesome game. Truly one of the best board to digital game i've ever had the opportunity to play. The add-ons are completely worth it as well.  Now for the bad news. There have been multiple instances when playing with my group of friends where someone or multiple people will drop connection. SOMETIMES, you can resume game (which is a cool feature) but othertimes it just will not work. It gets really funky. Now, to me, there is nothing worse than spending 2.5 hours on a game with 3 other people and right as it's getting good the multiplayer takes a dump all over and we can't finish the game. The support is also non-existant (thanks Nomad) so don't believe this will change any time soon, but if enough people are buying and playing maybe that will change (I highly doubt it. Wishful thinking maybe). TL;DR: Solo play is worth it at sale price, but mulitplayer is a big risk although it is insanely fun.			"

												Talisman: Digital edition is a game I had never heard of before this free weekend.  I immediately liked the game.  This Talisman: DE is a digital Board game, literally.  You play as a variety of classes trying to buff your stats and make it to the center of the board before anyone else gets there.  The game relies heavily on RNG type randomness, Most actions involve dice rolls, and most ""encounters"" rely on the way the deck is ""shuffled"".  Another thing to note, I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but this game is long, I have been in the same game for about 4 hours now. no one has come very close to winning yet. I don't know how long the average game against the ai lasts, but mine are always terribly long.   Overall though I like the gameplay and art a lot. The art reminds me of classic Dungeons and Dragons art, and less grimdark games workshop art. I recommend this to anyone still interested after all that. I dont know  what kind of player will like it most really. If you get it, I hope you have fun!			"

												At first the RPG element of this game is fun. And truly I bought it because I enjoyed playing this board game when it first came out and I was hoping that the game would move along faster. Unfortunately, though some elements of the game are fun, most of the time it is boring and completed a game takes a LONG time. In fact, it took me about 60 turns to reach the end and then it took another 30 turns to kill everyone else with the Command spell. [which was really dull since I did nothing but try to roll 4, 5, or 6 for those turns). I ended up cranking the AI speed to 11 just to get it over with as fast as possible, I ended up not caring or paying attention to what the other players were doing.			"

												The AI is as dumb as a bag of elbows. Combined with the ridiculous amount of bugs and terrible programming, I'd say pass on this. Only playable with human opponents...locally...who can laugh with you at the bugs and failure.  Don't expect to play through a game of this without it crashing 5+ times.  Don't expect all spells and items to work.  This thing screams ""Outsourced programming to the lowest bidder"" loudly.  Unacceptable in a released product, especially one with DLC already out.  Potential to be great, but cannot recommend in its current state.			"

I have been on the crown of command for two hours now trying to kill one char who can not ever come close cause he has a warlock quest he cannot complete and he just keeps healing himself and I don't hit the 50% chance roll often enough so gay.

												I love a great boardgame but let's face it, these ""cardboard children"" - to borrow a line from RPS - can take a LOT of table real estate to play. Talisman is a massive game in its ""analog form"" and with all of the expansions and four players, the setup is considerable and games can be marathons. But that's all good as boardgamers expect that. That said, Talisman Digital Edition fots nicely on my PC, requires mere minutes at most of setup an most importantly, captures the sheer fun of Talisman, Isn't that why we play games, for fun?A few negative reviews commented on the woeful AI. But, perhaps these folk are playing the prelude titled Talisman: Prologue. I have found the AI to be pretty good. And let's not forget that Talisman is largely a luck based game. All of the so-called tactics I have seen and heard about the game must still bow to the capriciousness of the deity known as RNG; even an AI like Deep Blue cannot predict the vagaries of dice rolls.There are a few issues that linger. One of the most annoying is when an AI opponent draws an event card. Unless you are a speed reader or you know every Talisman card by rote - and with all of the expansions in the physical boardgame there is an insane number of cards, you won't have time to read what the event is. You have to zoom in on the board section where the event is. The same holds true for other non-spell cards. This has been brought up to the devs but as yet there has been no fix for this.The digital version allows you to earn runes which grant advatages in gameplay. [AI also collects these as well]. I like the mechanic as it lends a sort of leveling up feeling.The Dungeon Expansion is next up and I cannot wait for its release! If it is as faithful as the physical version of the game, it's going to be a blast.I think that Talisman Digital Edition is a wonderful introduction to the fun world of tabletop boardgaming and it scratches the itch of tabletop boardgamers who want to play without the crazy setup and rather forced solo variants for the physical game found round the interwebz.This is a STEAL at the price and I would advise buyers to spend a little extra dosh and get The Reaper and Frostmarch expansions as they add considerably to the game.I hope that more boardgames experience a digital conversion. Are you listening Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight?EDIT: 18 November. The Dungeon expansion really ramps this game up considerably. The AI can be quite nasty and that's good as Talisman is a cut throat game. I am hopeful that the devs will release Blood Moon and The Dragon next. These two expansions literally change the game, adding a bit more unpredictability to a game that can punch you in the face already and have you smiling about it.UPDATE January 15: Ya gota love this developer. With the latest update there are two new free characters. These two are not even present in the physical boardgame but were last seen in the 1986(!) version of Talisman. More achievements plus what seems to be a hint that the Highland expansion is next! This is very cool as it is a one of the big corner expansions!!			"

It's a delightful board game to frustrate and encourage slight meadering. This digital version on the other, is awful-the graphics don't even make up for the annoying controls. If you want to play this game and lack the group to do so, save your money here and just travel down to your local comic book shop on a gaming night-playing with total stangers and risking a possible over abundance of B.O. is still better than taking a whack at this piece of garbage.

It's generally quite a fun game and I find myself enjoying it a lot when the AI isn't just rolling constant 6's and making me miss 4 turns in a row etc. RNG is one thing, but more often than not it doesn't actually feel random and it just favours itself. I've bought it now and will continue to play it every now and again in the hope of a better experience...but there is just no way i could recommend it to anyone.			"

												My family owns too many explansions to call this game playable in one sitting-but I can say I am very familiar with it. It's a delightful board game to frustrate and encourage slight meadering. This digital version on the other, is awful-the graphics don't even make up for the annoying controls. If you want to play this game and lack the group to do so, save your money here and just travel down to your local comic book shop on a gaming night-playing with total stangers and risking a possible over abundance of B.O. is still better than taking a whack at this piece of garbage.

												If you want a games night with a few of your friends this is the game for you. If you are looking for a solo experience this game is probably not for you.To get the most out of it i would recommend changing the game from focusing on the Crown of Command, to killing the Lord of Darkness, which will require some DLC, but it is worth it. When the end game is about the Crown of Command it can get very tedious to sit through an entire game in my opinion.Never trust the mountain goat.			"

												Nice game if you like games like snakes and ladders but with warrior and wizzard pieces instead of generic pawn pieces. There is very little to no strategy in this game, it is almost ENTIRELY down to dice rolls. You roll a dice and move here, roll another dice to see what happens, pick up an 'adventure' card which could be an item or enemy, then roll another dice to determine the outcome. It is about as 'strategic' as playing roulette or lottery. I'm not having a go at this game, it is an amusing way to pass time, but if you read that there is a strategy to winning this game it is not entirely correct.. unless by strategy you mean staying in one region of the board until you have enough items to progress to the next then so be it. I guess to some extent that would be considered a strategy. I have played this game for a couple of hours and it was amusing, but it was amusing in the way that snakes and ladders would be if you had beautifully crafted pieces available instead of generic pawn pieces and instead of there being only snakes there were dragons and goblins you had to deal with and instead of automatically sliding backwards down a snake you got to take a dice roll which can be modified by items you pick up to detemine what happens to you. I definately dont see myself investing a lot of time into this game but it is worth the investment if you are looking for an amusing 'filler in type of a game' that can easily pass an hour or so of your time when nothing else seems to tickle your fancy.

												Game start was fun. Midgame gets repetitive since you just run around and farm items and stats. End game boring as hell. You just need to get stats to enter final level. I expexted in the end some epic encounters or boss fight. Nope. Just random dice rolls all the way. If you are unlucky you just got teleported far away and need to run all across the map again. So fun. In the end you just roll dice 50/50 to make everyone lose 1 health per round. I killed that way 4 my opponents. But the last one had combination that allowed him to get 1 gold at turn start and get healed 1 health for 1 gold. So he just ignored my ULTIMATE COMMAND SPELL and kept playing. And what was the whole point for me to tryhard and rush in center of the map?...To hell this unbalanced random trash game.			"

												I have waited for a digital version of Talisman for a loooong time! I am really happy it finally happened, despite developement trouble. Pretty much everything is like the original board game. Pro's: Beautiful cards etcFantastic musicChoose how fast the AI thinks and camera speedHouse rules avaliableFINALLY I CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT FUMBLING WITH CARDS! :DCon'sThe interface is not very intuitive, before you learn how the system ""thinks"" you'll probably accidentally cast a spell on yourself or something stupid like that.. I sure did ;)There are unfortunately a few bugs, I walked into a game breaking situation because of it. You can get stuck in loops where the AI just walks around in circles, there's no way to break the loop since you are entirely helpless when the AI is taking its turn.It's a bit slow sometimes.All an all tho, its super fun!!And the expansions are worth the money, AT LEAST the ones where you actually get a new region and not just cards.

My only gripe with it is the character cards from the baord game are not all included in the purchase, game includes a msall hadfull of characters and then you need to purchase the rest. Otherwise, considering it's less than 1/3 of the price of the board game, it's not a bad deal.			"

												After taking 2 hours to learn the game with a couple playthroughs, we set up for a final game of the night. Rolling Thief, a few drinks in, I decide to fully immerse myself for this playthrough and give it an honest try. The adventure began, and McStickyfingers was unleashed upon the world. Turn one, McStickyfingers immediately heads to town and run into the Black Market. What a perfect way to get a head start, he thought, and jumps at the opportunity to pay 1 gold for a full suit of plate mail. Being the most obnoxious and unsubtle Thief in the land, McSticky is caught and hauled off to Jail to reflect on his life choices. Seven turns in, the world around him is passing by, with another filthy bandit behind bars. A wanted poster for anti-thievery is picked up by a travelling Pirate, passing through town. Ironically, the Pirate ceases his own mischief and pledges to ensure McSticky remains off the streets. ""There is only room for one bandit, here!"" - He thought. McStickyfingers is finally released from Jail on the eighth turn. Has he changed? Did he learn his lesson? You may ask him. In turn he would respond to you with a question, ""Are you kidding?"" Upon release, McStickyfingers immediately runs into the Pirate and steals the wanted poster of himself right out of Pirate's hands. The world is surely doomed, now.Many turns go by, which means many items are stolen from anyone and anything. A collection of swords is made within' McStickyfingers' inventory - one from every player leaving each of them unarmed. It isn't long before Death himself is unanimously tasked to put a stop to the McStickyfinger shenanigans. Fumbling around with his shiny swords, McSticky is caught from behind and beheaded with one stroke of the scythe. Was this the end? No. More like ...are you kidding? At the end of Mr. Grim's action, McStickyfingers is revived and immediately re-gathers his belongings before anyone else can act. It seems not even Death can stop the reign of McStickyfingers' mischief. It isn't long before deals are made from the other adventurers to our beloved Thief to spare their inventory from his sticky fingers. Gold is thrown in his direction from every which way.Having never given up on his quest, wanted poster or not, the Pirate is behind the scenes with an anti-theft bag to stash his belongings. Arming to the teeth, a rivalry is born. To be continued...10/10 would go on epic thieving heists again.			"

												I played the Talisman board game with my old gaming group and we would have hours of fun taking us into the wee hours of the morning without even realizing it. This game brings all that fun back, but with the option to save and quit when the sun starts peeking through the windows and you need to hide away for a few hours.However, it does feel like there are still some bugs to work out, such as abilities that can be activated 'at will' don't seem to be available to use when the 'at will' need arises. This may be a bug or I am missing the prompts to give me that opportunity. The only other downside I can see is you are not physically sitting at the table with your friends as you play to toss around the smack talk and make deals on the fly to take a problematic character down.All in all, this is a fantastically fun game to play and all of the expansions are more than worth it for the added content and additional characters. You would be amazed to see a Courtesan beating the heck out of a Dread Knight when things go in your favor.Definitely worth your time and money and everything goes on sale with some frequency. The standalone characters are also worth it if you grab them on sale. Otherwise you'll have plenty of others to play with un til they do.			"

												One of the few digital board games that isn't total garbage.  Talisman is loads of fun and I often compare it to an entire campaign of DnD condensed with PvP to those who have not played it.  My only complaint is that games can take a LONG time to complete sometimes, like 6+ hours... and the multiplayer save system doesn't always work as it should.  A game I would happily add to my sizable physical board game collection.			"

												If you like the boardgame, then this is pretty much an exact, digital replica of the Talisman experience.-It will do all your book-keeping for you, and list all of the options you have on any given turn, thus expediting the time it takes to go through a turn.-It has local hot-seat co-op so you can still have friends over for boardgame nightIf you don't like the Talsiman boardgame, then this will do nothing to make you like the game.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												Even better than I remember as a kid. A little quirky to get the hang of but after that it is great, old school fun. Has a nice in game chat feature to talk smack to your buddies while playing. I highly recommend to people that are fans of board games or card games like Magic or Pokemon.			"

												Amazing game!I got the game in July 2014 on a sweat -50% season pass. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! The amount of content added to this game is epic. I am a huge fan of randomness and replay ability and this game is perfect! No two games are alike and you have a lot of options to customize the speed and difficulty of the game. You might not be a fan of dice games because too much luck is involved, honestly so am I! I rarely play dice games, but I feel that talisman has the perfect combination of luck-to-strategy ratio. I like to compare it to real life. In real life, no matter how cautious you are, no matter how safe your daily routine is, on a particularly unlucky day... you can die... at the prime of your life you can get hit by a car... you can go to the hospital for routine surgery and die on the table... Talisman is like that! One minute you are the terror of the board, banishing demons and slaying dragons with the flick of your wand or tap of your sword, the next minute you are a cursed toad, powerless and vulnerable. The other night I lost a game after a series of 3 unlucky dice rolls, I was in the lead on stats, two turns away from winning the game, next turn I was dead. The odds of me dyeing there were 0.4%. I wasn't even mad, that was amazing! Good things can happen as well. One game I was the underdog, a lowly merchant, unskilled in combat, unwise in magic. After gathering a small pose consisting of a gnome, a guide and a faery; and armed with only a Talisman and a four leaf clover. I managed to pick the lock on the portal of power, brave the forgotten depths of the lost mines, escape a vampire's domain (RIP followers), then defeat four lesser demons in combat, cross the valley of fire and finally arrive at the crown of command. There, I obtained the power to command death as my servant and send him to kill my enemies one by one! All this was achieved with beginner level stats. I had no chance to win by overtaking my enemies the safe way so I risked it all, and this time I won.I have no problem finding games online to play with strangers. It's more fun to play with friends. I regularly buy copies of Talisman when it's on sale (usually 1-2 euro for the base game) and gift them. The good thing is that my friends don't need the expansions to play with me, because in a multiplayer game if one person has all the expansions then the game is played with all of them. In my experience games with 3 players are the best. With 4 or more the game tends to last longer. Two player games are also fine.The rules of the game are easy on beginners. Even if it's a complex game, the rules come at you one at a time. You don't need to know what all the cards in the game do, because you will only draw one or two cards a turn usually and then just read those cards and see what happens! I remember when I first played Talisman, I had no idea what was happening... and that was great! I'm a dwarf in a fantasy world. I fight monsters, find treasure, and buy drinks at the tavern. My opponent is a troll who found a unicorn. The unicorn is smarter than he is...I could say a lot more about this game, it is simply amazing and lots of fun. It's well worth full price, if you are undecided, buy the base game on sale and play it online. You will not regret it!			"

												This is a 51% recommend,  Yes but barely. I LOVE Talisman. I bought the first edition board game 30 years ago and played it to bits. It has its flaws (some of which were addressed in the 2nd and 3rd editions) but these are not relevant for this review.The multiplayer is an enormous pain in the backside to figure out. The user experience is tough going, the controls unintuitive and to top it all, a 2 hour game had to be abandoned because the Resume feature didn't work.Tread carefully, buy it in a sale and try before you buy any extra copies for other players.

												After taking 2 hours to learn the game with a couple playthroughs, we set up for a final game of the night. Rolling Thief, a few drinks in, I decide to fully immerse myself for this playthrough and give it an honest try. The adventure began, and McStickyfingers was unleashed upon the world. Turn one, McStickyfingers immediately heads to town and run into the Black Market. What a perfect way to get a head start, he thought, and jumps at the opportunity to pay 1 gold for a full suit of plate mail. Being the most obnoxious and unsubtle Thief in the land, McSticky is caught and hauled off to Jail to reflect on his life choices. Seven turns in, the world around him is passing by, with another filthy bandit behind bars. A wanted poster for anti-thievery is picked up by a travelling Pirate, passing through town. Ironically, the Pirate ceases his own mischief and pledges to ensure McSticky remains off the streets. ""There is only room for one bandit, here!"" - He thought. McStickyfingers is finally released from Jail on the eighth turn. Has he changed? Did he learn his lesson? You may ask him. In turn he would respond to you with a question, ""Are you kidding?"" Upon release, McStickyfingers immediately runs into the Pirate and steals the wanted poster of himself right out of Pirate's hands. The world is surely doomed, now.Many turns go by, which means many items are stolen from anyone and anything. A collection of swords is made within' McStickyfingers' inventory - one from every player leaving each of them unarmed. It isn't long before Death himself is unanimously tasked to put a stop to the McStickyfinger shenanigans. Fumbling around with his shiny swords, McSticky is caught from behind and beheaded with one stroke of the scythe. Was this the end? No. More like ...are you kidding? At the end of Mr. Grim's action, McStickyfingers is revived and immediately re-gathers his belongings before anyone else can act. It seems not even Death can stop the reign of McStickyfingers' mischief. It isn't long before deals are made from the other adventurers to our beloved Thief to spare their inventory from his sticky fingers. Gold is thrown in his direction from every which way.Having never given up on his quest, wanted poster or not, the Pirate is behind the scenes with an anti-theft bag to stash his belongings. Arming to the teeth, a rivalry is born. To be continued...10/10 would go on epic thieving heists again.			"

Theres more DLC's than there are expansions to the board game, and the board game had waay too many expansions. I wouldve liked to see more included in the base game here. Talisman was never my favorite game but this is no doubt one of the better board game interpretations on the market. 6/10			"

												Talisman takes its place as my number two favorite board game style video game of all time. The first place spot goes to Dokapon Kingdom but that is another thing in of its self.Talisman's gameplay is solid and, up until the addition of the house rules setting, the end game could get very boring and repetitive. The game allows you to play with many different playstyles and allows unique experiences every time you play. You always need to be aware of what other players are doing or you may just end up finding them on their way to the end while you are still making your way there.I do not care for the idea behind all of the new characters being their own idividual DLC, it seems to be a little over the top for me, especially with how little each new character actually adds to the game. Other than that, the biggest issue I have had with Talisman is the multiplayer and how terrible it can be to play when somebody has a slow connection, or when the game randomly kicks you or when somebody alt tabs and it freezes up the entire match.

If you like a meaty 2 hour plus length of game, then this is for you.  The game can be sped up with various options.  It is enhanced with several expansions.  The full table top board is huge with many new classes and adventure cards.  A classic with years of cred.  I would recommend this game to my friends as well as total strangers.

												Talisman: Digital Edition is a faithful update to the old school Games-Workshop Talisman board game.  The game is actually based on a newer iteration by Fantasy Flight games however much of the original feel is still there.  The digital implementation of the game features an intuitive interface, crisp artwork, and balance improvements that don’t allow a Chaos Warrior to run rampant across your game board and on top of competing players.  The only real downside is that the AI is not very good and doesn’t try to win the game –however the game plays well in multiplayer and is really a blast.  If you want to play an old school early 1990’s board game online, love games workshop, or just want to turn your buddies into a toad and curb stomp them . . . this game is for you!			"

												I personally like this game and I loved the board game version of it and this is a great version of it other than one major problem. The RNG or random number generator, I was just recently playing and this has happened other times but this one stuck out majorly. The AI I was playing with along with nearly every single creature kept rolling 6's every time. I would go and fight something I have equal craft to and roll a 4, it rolled a 6. I also used my lucky charm from the frostmarch expansion pack that I had to get a 6 against a frost drale. It rolled a 6, the AI that I am playing with is the leprechaun and he has gotten now 7 6's in a row. I believe that the rng might need to be fixed slightly as it is hugely unrealistic as that has an insanely low probability of happening, especially as I have not gotten a 6 this entire time.			"

												One of the greatest games ever conceived. I've been playing for weeks and have enjoyed most of my time with it, despite only having one other friend that will play this with me. Sadly, he won't anymore.The first game that started that: Within 10 turns death had landed on the last dungeon tile with an AI in control. Targeting my friend that had 6 lives and a talisman, he rolled a 1 on the death. Instant death with no revival.It took him a week to recover from that, I had to egg him on and even let him know I would disable death. He relented and within 10 turns on a Devils' Minion he had to fight a basalisk. Lost, instant death.11/10 because he was the one that bought me and himself the base game with all the DLC. Amazing experience.			"

I don't really rely on the players online because you can drop out at any time, but playing an AI/Online game with firends it is a great alternative to the physical game.

With the added extra boards on the layout, the whole game changes and is far more deadly, and far more fun.Right now it is still a great game and I would highly recomend it :)			"

												If you're looking for a fun, fantasy-themed board game...this is one for you. It is a fun play both solo and online. The game itself is enjoyable while keeping each playthrough unique and satisfying. The interface, however, can be confusingly unclear...especially when there are multiple things going on at once. The AI is reasonably challenging, but does make some repeated mistakes. Online is fun, but I have had connection issues and games that bug out and crash completly. It has been getting better, is something I've  heard from people playing from release.Overall, it is a fun, somewhat addicting experience. Once they stabelize the online play, and if they simplify the interface, this game will be one that any gamer, board or video, will come back to again and again. Plus the promise of a lot more future content doesn't hurt either.			"

												Excellent conversion of a classic table top board game to a PC game.  Keeps all the elements of the game I love and mixes in a few new options (you can choose to play with the new options or without).  It would have been cool if they could have added some on-screen effects (like snow blowing across the screen when you draw the blizzard card, etc.), as its relatively a plain looking game.  But it stays true to the board game and thats what matters most.  Thanks.			"

												Don't take any notice of the meta score, they don't know what they are talking about.Just the base game can be a bit vanilla, the fun of the game increases a lot with the expansions.If you are a fan of table top games then you will probably like this. A digital recreation of the proper board game.There are a few things that are a bit buggy, and they are being sorted. I've not come across anything game-stopping.A game with 6 players and expansions can last 9 hours +. Or you can set a limit on a number of turns.You can save games, and start another.I've not tried live multiplayer, only against the AI, which is very good, but sometimes leaves you wondering why it chose a certain action over another. Maybe I just don't know the strategy well enough yet.This is one game that I will be coming back to again and again.Highly recommended.			"

												If you like board games, then this is a definite go-to game. The point I want to make is that I have already tried the board game so I am a bit of a veteran on this game. The people I play with are used to this game, and so they can readily play it. I prefer playing the board game. After all, talking (or arguing) about the rules is pretty integral to every board game. But yea, -sigh-, I guess that people grow used to things being like they used to be. Game rules update, games become different, people become bored of both the old and the new rules. That brings me to the positive sides of this PC/MAC game. It is a card game, and each new card brings new rules. You can buy new cards easily. You can even buy new areas to explore.That said, it is your choice if you want the digital version of the game or the real version. Or both.This game is perhaps counter-intuitive. It is a set of rules, rather than an open world. The first times of playing will put you in situations where you still have to learn the rules. And since the rules expand as you go further, seemingly randomly putting you in a good or bad position, the game can be harsh and yet too kind at the same time. It is, in other words, quite random. But the best part is that it's a game where, every time you play, you don't know the outcome. Even if you lose, you might have done very well on the part of acquiring various things and seeing different events unfold, and thus the play time was worth it.			"

												Great game that deserves a serious look by every RPG, RTS fan. This game is as close to a perfect physical board game to video game as I've seen, and I have played 90% of all the board game ports. I can't recommend this game enough to at least put on your wishlist to wait for a sale if you don't want to buy the original price.Pros: good overall flow of the game, intuitive AI, the best board game port to dateCons: slight to minimal delay in the UI in the main menu/options screen that may turn off some playersI have this same version in the iOS format and both versions are identical to each other, with the PC exception having better animations overall. The game itself plays great and the computer AI really is impressive with the difference of behaviors each character and how they interact with the board. I have never played the board game, but after 50+ hours on the mobile version and purchasing the PC port I will be one day purchase the physical board game from my local hobby shop. One of my favorite things that was added to the video game is a chance to reroll dice that is called Fate. To me its the best mechanic to the game and in my opinion the most important. The game can be played in multiple ways to achieve the victory. It incorporates player vs player feel but games can be won by solely player vs environment while allying with other players (limited pvp encounters and purposedly avoiding other players on the board). Any fans of fantasy, saturday morning 1980s cartoons, dice rolling, and board games in general will appreciate this.			"

												Faithfully recreates the classic board game. Games are dictated by a certain level of rng, like most board games that utilize card draws and dice rolls, but they also contain enough free will choices to have an adequate amount of strategy.The downside is; it is too faithfull to the board game. Matches can take up to an hour or more to complete and are rather boring if no one chats during the game. The game is best played among friends or with people willing to chat and get into the intrigue of attacking each other, forming alliances, and general♥♥♥♥♥♥talking each others bad luck.There are some bugs but the devs are very responsive to the community and activley work on swatting the annoying crashes or disconnects.

												Ah, Talisman... what a great walk down memory lane.  Picked it up for a free play weekend and I was transported back about twenty years to my big brother's kitchen table: it's 2 am, our group has been playing for hours, only a few of us with a shot at the center card (we played with the extension set that replaced the Crown of Command with one of six options, including the dreaded black void). Finally, someone made a play at the end game...!!!This Edition brought that back, for me. I hope for you, too.			"

												If you like board games, then this is a definite go-to game. The point I want to make is that I have already tried the board game so I am a bit of a veteran on this game. The people I play with are used to this game, and so they can readily play it. I prefer playing the board game. After all, talking (or arguing) about the rules is pretty integral to every board game. But yea, -sigh-, I guess that people grow used to things being like they used to be. Game rules update, games become different, people become bored of both the old and the new rules. That brings me to the positive sides of this PC/MAC game. It is a card game, and each new card brings new rules. You can buy new cards easily. You can even buy new areas to explore.That said, it is your choice if you want the digital version of the game or the real version. Or both.This game is perhaps counter-intuitive. It is a set of rules, rather than an open world. The first times of playing will put you in situations where you still have to learn the rules. And since the rules expand as you go further, seemingly randomly putting you in a good or bad position, the game can be harsh and yet too kind at the same time. It is, in other words, quite random. But the best part is that it's a game where, every time you play, you don't know the outcome. Even if you lose, you might have done very well on the part of acquiring various things and seeing different events unfold, and thus the play time was worth it.			"

												Great game that deserves a serious look by every RPG, RTS fan. This game is as close to a perfect physical board game to video game as I've seen, and I have played 90% of all the board game ports. I can't recommend this game enough to at least put on your wishlist to wait for a sale if you don't want to buy the original price.Pros: good overall flow of the game, intuitive AI, the best board game port to dateCons: slight to minimal delay in the UI in the main menu/options screen that may turn off some playersI have this same version in the iOS format and both versions are identical to each other, with the PC exception having better animations overall. The game itself plays great and the computer AI really is impressive with the difference of behaviors each character and how they interact with the board. I have never played the board game, but after 50+ hours on the mobile version and purchasing the PC port I will be one day purchase the physical board game from my local hobby shop. One of my favorite things that was added to the video game is a chance to reroll dice that is called Fate. To me its the best mechanic to the game and in my opinion the most important. The game can be played in multiple ways to achieve the victory. It incorporates player vs player feel but games can be won by solely player vs environment while allying with other players (limited pvp encounters and purposedly avoiding other players on the board). Any fans of fantasy, saturday morning 1980s cartoons, dice rolling, and board games in general will appreciate this.			"

												Although I never played the board game, I can easily attest to the fact that this game brings the worst out in yourself and your friends, which in itself leads to hilarious and memorable moments. That, coupled with the random nature of the game, is in my opinion its greatest strength, as it allows everybody to compete on an even level. The randomness might get frustrating in single player though and I clearly recommend that you band together and buy the four pack, so you have somebody to play with, because the social aspect of the game is half the experience.On the downside, the technical aspect of multiplayer matches does have some hiccups. I have experienced sync issues and game crashes a couple of times, which is aggravating when you are about to wrap up a game session, which easily runs in at about two hours. This shouldn’t keep you from buying the game if you have some friends around to play it with though.			"

												Almost identcal to playing the board game with a few major exceptions. the most important being speed. A real life Talisman game can usually take up 6hrs. With the turn speed for the PC ramped up to 10 I finished my first game in 3hrs.  This is not a problem as playing well in games causes you to level up unlocking new stuff. Quite what I'm not yet sure as it will take more than one game to level up. The other major difference is price. A full set of Talisman with the expnasion will srt you back nearly £100 for the physical version.I do love my physichal set and this does lack the atmosphere of having some like minded mates round for a good boardgames session. But as an introduction to the game or as a way of killing the hours over the summer while your mates are on holiday this is highly recomended. Also if you have friends who play but dont live locally it is also possible to set up an online game over the web.			"

												Faithful recreation of a classic board game.  TERRIBLE UI  As much as I love talisman and like having a digital version, something MUST be done about the god awful UI.  Casting spells makes magic users a pita to play, can't look around the boardto inspect thigns unless it's your turn, and unforgiving timelimits make this a hard sell.  I def. enjoy it but can only barely reccomend it.  Saving is a straight up nightmare in multiplayer conditions.  That said updates seem frequent and the devs. do seem to be listening to the torrent of complaints from loyal fans who are putting up with the current conditions.   Great with friends but more of a hassle than a joy to play.  It basically jsut makes me want to break out my physical copy instead.  6/10			"

												I can understand why this game might get rated low. Talisman is sort of fundamentally ""unfun,"" especially when played without face to face or voicechat. The multiplayer is significantly buggy, and the autosave system doesn't always work. There are fewer technical problems every patch, though, and there's still a game to be played here. As an adaptation of Talisman, it's perfect: It does what Talisman wants to do. I wouldn't recommend going into it with anyone you can't comfortably have a loosely-contextualized conversation for hours, but it seems absurd to criticize an adaptation of a board game for being like that board game.

After an initial play through, I'll be glad to play with a few friends would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a trip down memory lane or something a bit different. There's a depth here that makes the game difficult to master and with the inclusion of multiplayer, each human opponent are going to make this an excellently devious game. "

												The Pros:The game is pretty. The art is pretty much as I remember the board game. The UI while unintuitive does cover most things. Winning can be fun.The Cons:Losing can be really boring. Being stuck on the command crown for endless turns whilst your one remaining opponent wanders the outer regions merely healing when you get the command spell to hit (every 1 in 5 times, and I started that end game approach with 8 fate) is not my idea of going out in a blaze of glory. The AI makes no attempt to get near you once you are down to two players.There are many moments of frustration in the game. Many of them aren't particularly meaningful except as an ""I gotchya"" tweak that the game pulls on you. (Being unable to control when some spells go off, having situations where you are forced to target yourself with abilities or spells because the UI doesn't allow you to back up, losing all your items/gold/followers to bad encounters, rarely ever burning a fate point that actually helps, the list is probably endless.) That said if you are a fan of random, I think this game really hits that spot. Whilst Catan (the online version) is kind of sad for not having multi player options, Talisman does have this.I can't say I think much of the pay to play nickle & dime approach (and what big dimes they are!) but it is nice that you can customize what you get in terms of characters/boards. I haven't done that but I expect those who want to enjoy multi player will eventually get the relevent characters. One thing seems a bit inobvious but is probably true anyway: You are able to win with any of the characters. The key being that you spend the time to learn how that character survives and adapts appropriately. Some might have a steep curve.I am recommending this game with a 6/10. Meaning: ""caveat emptor"" if you have problems with random games. It is fun once you set aside the disappointments and frustrations.			"

												A real fun game for you and three buds!!!  You have characters to choose from and they all have special abilities that effect game play. The base game has plenty to choose from so don't worry. Each player begins at a character specific start square on the outer ring on the board. The board is made of three rings of space each with location names on them, some of these locations also have special abilities that effect your pawn. You have 2 sums that are used in combat, strength and craft, then life, fate and gold all of which can be leveled up or chipped away at to reduce them lower that starting amounts.You roll a random generated die and move to the tile options you come up with, than you draw an adventure card that may be a monster, loot, item or event to challenge youor the other players. The object is to level up collecting items boosting your stats and fighting the other players, It plays just like a board game- one player after another takeing turns but as the game goes on the difficulty and struggle increases. You want to get to the center of the board crossing through two ""rings"" of board tiles to get to the tower where you take control and cast a spell that slowly kills off the other players to win. After a game is finnished you claim XP and level up to the next level where you can get bonuses to the pawn you pick for the next game.WARNING!! The games seem to take a long time to play through, I've played many- finnished two and both of those took longer than 3 hours to play. Lots of fun! Very replayable, lots of laughs with your friends.If you like tabletop games, GAMES WORKSHOP games you should enjoy this one, I got it for 5 bucks on sale but can say it is worth the full price. The game also has lots of DLC in the form of new player characters- ($1.99) each and several boards or expansions... ($5.99)) and up.-Mr. GrAnD			"

												Great Game, so long as your playing with other people.My only three gripes about it would be the AI opponents, Runes, and the online connectivity.The AI is not the greatest. They do some incredibly stupid things, things not even new players would conceivably do. And often with certain characters (Ogre, Necromancer, Ghoul, Minstril to name a few) will not even use the characters abilities at any point in the match. Runes ruin the experience if you use them, and make certain characters blatantly overpowered compared to others. Most people do not use them anyway, so it's not that big an issue, but i just don't see any benefit for them existing.And for online, connections can be a bit shakey at certain times of day, but so far the dev's have been working hard at relieving that issue, and its shown (for me anyway).There are a few other bugs here and there, but they are also being dealth with all the time, and usually don't interfere with a match.A friend of mine has said Hot-Seat Multiplayer also works quite well, so playing with real friends just like you would on the physical version is a plus. If you like board or tabletop games, or decent games to play with friends, pick up Talisman: Digital Edition. The season pass is also worthwhile considering all of the content that is ahead. Overall its one of the better games i've played in the past year or two.			"

												I wanted to like this game, and it is quite enjoyable once you get the hang of the game mechanics.  The problem is the speed.  Half your time is spent watching dice roll and player markers glide around the board, and having to click 4-5 times for no reason (""Continue"", ""Cast Command Spell"", ""Roll Dice"", ""End Turn"") just to cast the Command Spell in the endgame is painful.  It's also impossible to know exactly what happened each turn without opening and scrolling down the events log.  A few tweaks in these areas might lure me back.			"

												My first game lasted almost 3 hours, but it worths it!I'm a quick disinterested guy when a game doesn't appeal me, but eh. Pro:+Rules easy to understand: You have to be the last one standing on the iron throne in the middle (ok there's no throne). For that, you must weaken your opponents during the early and mid game, and strenghen yourself killing monsters or training yourself with event cards. Eventhough you can win with luck only, if a dice roll doesn't please you, you can reroll it using one ""destiny point"" which are limited depending on the character your choose. Because yeah, each characters have their own special ability. +This boarding game is also a RPG, and it's well mixed! +SFX are ok, I didn't have to mute the background music.+Addictive: Because you never know what will happen, you won't stop playing-Con:-The basic board is quite small, eventhough it's easier that way, when I ended my first game I wanted more! -DLC's ... I like the game, but I wonder why I have to pay to have additional content and heroes.-The UI is boring. I wish I could only use my keyboard in the game But... I'm so happy to win over an assassin who was 4x stronger than me, a sorceress who annoyed me the whole time with her spells and a gambler, which is also the hero I chose, who was far worse than me because he didn't know how and when he should have used his destiny points to win. That's why I would recommend this game =D			"

Ходишь по карте и тебе попадаются всякие ништяки, которые помогут победить и преуспеть. Еще есть уникальная штука, как смерть с косой, которая ходит по пятам, когда она меня догнала, у меня была паника: ""Что же это? Все? Гаплык?"", но тут, волшебные кубики, и выпало 7 и черт возьми, смерть меня отпустила))) В общем, если хотите вспомнить старые настольные игры, обязательно скачайте, а еще лучше, с друзьями поиграйте(=			"

												Fun board game that you can waste hours on. Has errors and crashes occasionally which can be annoying but usually able to rejoin or resume a game so that's good. Also like that only one person in an online game needs the dlc for everyone to enjoy it. Has a few problems like the errors and crashes I mentioned and could use some simple features like canceling a spell you didn't mean to cast or being able to get the experience from an online game if you die without having to leave the game open for sometimes hours until it's over, but overall if you like fantasy type boardgames I'd recommend it.

												I can't judge the game against the old board game as I have never played it.  That being said, the game has a great variety characters, gear and encounters to make your e-board game experience feel like and adventure.On the down side, the game can seem to drag on due to alot of unlucky rolls.  It can get so bad, that die rolls don't feel so random.  If this was Yahtzee, I could get bonus yahtzees with 1 rolls all day long on the Crown of Command.  I am guessing they have nerfed some of the game mechanics so players might be more inclined to buy dlc instead of grinding it out.  Perhaps I am being cynical, but I enjoyed the base game at a discounted price, so I will give it a thumbs up.  If I had paid 79.99 for the complete game, I would definately not recommend it.   There is no groundbreaking, earth-shattering, gameplay (in the base game, nor the dlc) that justifies that price.			"

												It's a great game, and really satisfies that boardgame itch that needs to be scratched.  I wish it was a little more graphically enhanced, like little spell effects or something, to add some flare to the game, but it stays true to what it's like watching a game play out set up on your table, so can't really complain.  With the option of expansions to add to the experience, it really does cover its bases nicely.There are only two negatives I can think of.  1, as with many games where you roll a die, at times it can feel like the computer cheats.  Or rather, I just now played a game, where any space I landed on that could have turned me into a toad for rolling a 1 on, I rolled a one.  Every.  Single. Time.  I feel like 1 is a very common number rolled, and I'm not sure why, but I get that gut feeling that something isn't balanced.  You get to moments where the game poops on you repeatedly, over and over, and just runs you through the mud.  I'd say it's just coincidence, but all too frequently it happens.The second negative is that there is no option to speed up gameplay and just auto-resolve a winner.  Why is this a problem?  Because I was playing a 4 player game - me vs 3 other AI players.  I died first when one character got to the Crown of Command.  Problem?  The game will not end until all other players are dead too.  Well, it's been an hour and a half and I'm still waiting for one AI to die.  One repeatedly rolls to use the crown and rolls twos about...three times out of 6 rolls.  The other AI player is repeatedly healing himself.  What does this cause?  A NEVER ENDING GAME.  I can't quit, or else I lose the progress of playing this entire game (maybe I can?  I don't know, but I'm not about to quit to find out I do...), but now I have no choice other than to wait for this game to play out, even if it takes more hours.  This.  Is.  Maddening.  Completely broken. >_<  Once you die, it should end the game and tell you who won....not make you sit and watch for hours and hours while a computer plays against itself.....			"

												I used to play the old boardgame in the early 90s, fond memories. I wondered if the digital edition would even be true to the original. I tried it and was not disappointed! We even play it with my son on the living room TV, the excitement passed to the next generation. We can save our game if interrupted for dinner or if it gets too late and continue at another time, which is a bonus compared to the board game.I recommend it to any fans of the board game, you will feel right at home. If this is your first contact with Talisman, you have to see past the average graphics and lack of fancy animations and use your imagination to immerse yourself in the game. If you can do that, you will enjoy hours of solo, hotseat or online fun!			"

												Gather your friends, get on VOIP and have a great game night. A lot easier than cracking open an actual boardgame of this complexity.Only the host needs the DLC boards and if you play with random characters everyone uses the host's too.			"

												If you are new to Talisman (like myself), you will find that it is an easy game to get into.  I haven't even read the instructions but after playing with others online, I am learning pretty quickly how to play this game.  It's a fun fantasy/strategy board game.  It isn't too complex and it's kind of luck-based. There is a low player-base, but I am always able to find a match without waiting too long.  The servers that people seem to play on are USA and Europe.  Another cool thing about this game is that other people can share their characters with you.  By this I mean that if you don't have the DLC, and the HOST of the game does, then the host of the game is able to share their characters with you and the other players in the game.  Also, if you have a bad internet connection and disconnect from the game, you are able to rejoin the match once you re-open the game. I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale for only $4.49 and it was well worth it.  You should definitely buy this if you are into board games.			"

												This is almost a completely straigh electronic version of the table top game. good points- looks good- the charecter pices look almost like real gaming minis! each time you play through its a different game and each of the different charcters play slightly diferently giving it great replay value. not so good points- it lacks the one thing the real version has. this is social interaction. single player is quite dull with out friends to talk to. playing a multiplayer and chatting over skype made this fun. Otherwise it can get quite boring.			"

Many people got this for online multiplayer, where there is nothing wrong, but they reported large amounts of crashing in this area of the game. clearly something is wrong with these people's computers.

												I'm sure that this is a really good game 73% of players have said so plus, I would love to pick up some of the DLC that are on sale this week, I just wish I could play it. Unfortunately, it will only run for about 3- 5 turns then it freezes not the whole PC just the game and I have to ctrl-alt-del out. I am well in excess of the recommended PC specs plus, have tried all the available fixes on the forums here and elsewhere and asked many questions.I reported the problem to Nomad Games however, as there is no crash report generated when it freezes they have very little to work on except my PC specs and my list of tried but failed fixes.Apparently I have logged 2.4 hours play, this is NOT actual play but running the program just to try out various ""fixes"" .I have tried every fix I can find on line plus, turning off background process or varying game play combinations that I can think of that could be causing the problem, add my research time to find an answer and I must have spent at least 5 hours on this game without actually playing it.Perhaps with the soon expected patch it will finally work for me.I'm very disappointed so far, especially as I will miss out on the current DLC sale, the only consolation for me is that I bought the base game during a previous sale.Why a thumbs up? Well, I can't really not recommend or criticize it because I haven't played it yet plus, the freezing problem seems to be a very rare occurrence for the majority and it would appear that most of those who had the problem found on line answers that unfortunately did not work for me.I will revise this review if I ever get this game to run.UPDATEI have no idea what has changed but, the game has been running without problems for over an hour. I'm still somewhat confused over parts of the gameplay although the tutorial has helped. I guess i'll just have to read the game manual again as well.It looks like this is going to be a fun game based on my experience so far with an understanding of gameplay around say 75% I would give the game at least 7 out of 10 andf I have the feeling that after more playing that score will increase.I originally bought this as a precursor to buying the board game if I enjoyed it and I have a strong feeling that I will be buying the board game as well.

												It's a great game, and really satisfies that boardgame itch that needs to be scratched.  I wish it was a little more graphically enhanced, like little spell effects or something, to add some flare to the game, but it stays true to what it's like watching a game play out set up on your table, so can't really complain.  With the option of expansions to add to the experience, it really does cover its bases nicely.There are only two negatives I can think of.  1, as with many games where you roll a die, at times it can feel like the computer cheats.  Or rather, I just now played a game, where any space I landed on that could have turned me into a toad for rolling a 1 on, I rolled a one.  Every.  Single. Time.  I feel like 1 is a very common number rolled, and I'm not sure why, but I get that gut feeling that something isn't balanced.  You get to moments where the game poops on you repeatedly, over and over, and just runs you through the mud.  I'd say it's just coincidence, but all too frequently it happens.The second negative is that there is no option to speed up gameplay and just auto-resolve a winner.  Why is this a problem?  Because I was playing a 4 player game - me vs 3 other AI players.  I died first when one character got to the Crown of Command.  Problem?  The game will not end until all other players are dead too.  Well, it's been an hour and a half and I'm still waiting for one AI to die.  One repeatedly rolls to use the crown and rolls twos about...three times out of 6 rolls.  The other AI player is repeatedly healing himself.  What does this cause?  A NEVER ENDING GAME.  I can't quit, or else I lose the progress of playing this entire game (maybe I can?  I don't know, but I'm not about to quit to find out I do...), but now I have no choice other than to wait for this game to play out, even if it takes more hours.  This.  Is.  Maddening.  Completely broken. >_<  Once you die, it should end the game and tell you who won....not make you sit and watch for hours and hours while a computer plays against itself.....			"

												Very happy to have this game on pc.  I still own 2 versions of the original board game which I have played countless times.  As such I can confirm the game rules are superbly accurate to the original, making this game a must for all Talisman fans.On occasion, it can be difficult to use an ability or specific card during your turn (within the time limit given) as the game will not remind or encourage you to check your inventory lists, so you need to pay attention.This is a rare occurance, however, dependant on character chosen rather than any particular oversight due to the game design.  There are plenty of new characters to purchase as well as three of the original six expansion packs already released.  Dice roll for me is depressingly unlucky (just as it always was for my board games) so i find the gameplay quite difficult.  Animations are colourful and the addition of runestones and customisable rules keeps the game interesting. You can even save your progress on multiple games and come back to them when you want.I highly recommend this game already and will love it even more when the Timescape expansion is added.			"

												Ah, nothing like being able to play one of my favorite board games again. Without having to find the missing pieces that is. Anyway, I believe this is a great digitalization of a great board game for the whole family to play; a thrilling adventure every time you play with a competitive/ co-operative nature to each player being exemplified by the actions you choose to take. Unlike most board games made computer games that I've played, this one, with its DLC, holds true to the original in all but the board and table setting. The online play feature is most definately a bonus as now you can play with friends even if you are miles away from eachother. 10/10 in my book,			"

												I don't think you could ask for a better digital edition of Talisman.  Now you can play Talisman with those gamer friends who may have moved away, or when no one else is up for a game.There are times that playing against the AI feels like playing against a drunken gamer with the number of WTF moments that occur, and there are a few rules that don't seem to fire off properly from time-to-time.

												If you're looking for a fun, fantasy-themed board game...this is one for you. It is a fun play both solo and online. The game itself is enjoyable while keeping each playthrough unique and satisfying. The interface, however, can be confusingly unclear...especially when there are multiple things going on at once. The AI is reasonably challenging, but does make some repeated mistakes. Online is fun, but I have had connection issues and games that bug out and crash completly. It has been getting better, is something I've  heard from people playing from release.Overall, it is a fun, somewhat addicting experience. Once they stabelize the online play, and if they simplify the interface, this game will be one that any gamer, board or video, will come back to again and again. Plus the promise of a lot more future content doesn't hurt either.			"

												The basic game played fine for me, so that is strongly recommended and quite a bit of fun. However, it gets old after several games...So I added the Frostmarch expansion and my first two games using that expansion with AI opponents the game crashed due to glitches in the gameplay mechanics. The AI was trying to do something and got caught in a loop  (a ghoul was trying to use a cross after having used Ancient Artefact and it got stuck on repeat...)Then it crashed altogether when the AI tried to play lucky charm on a Ghost encounter... selected a 6 for the dice roll and the game closed with an error message to email support (which I did).So I strongly urge the developers to FIX the expansion content... I see they have so many more expansions offered, why would I buy the newer ones when the first DLC is buggy? This game has a lot of potential, is a lot of fun and I give it a thumbs up despite the flawed DLC, hoping we can get this fixed.			"

												Amazing game!I got the game in July 2014 on a sweat -50% season pass. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! The amount of content added to this game is epic. I am a huge fan of randomness and replay ability and this game is perfect! No two games are alike and you have a lot of options to customize the speed and difficulty of the game. You might not be a fan of dice games because too much luck is involved, honestly so am I! I rarely play dice games, but I feel that talisman has the perfect combination of luck-to-strategy ratio. I like to compare it to real life. In real life, no matter how cautious you are, no matter how safe your daily routine is, on a particularly unlucky day... you can die... at the prime of your life you can get hit by a car... you can go to the hospital for routine surgery and die on the table... Talisman is like that! One minute you are the terror of the board, banishing demons and slaying dragons with the flick of your wand or tap of your sword, the next minute you are a cursed toad, powerless and vulnerable. The other night I lost a game after a series of 3 unlucky dice rolls, I was in the lead on stats, two turns away from winning the game, next turn I was dead. The odds of me dyeing there were 0.4%. I wasn't even mad, that was amazing! Good things can happen as well. One game I was the underdog, a lowly merchant, unskilled in combat, unwise in magic. After gathering a small pose consisting of a gnome, a guide and a faery; and armed with only a Talisman and a four leaf clover. I managed to pick the lock on the portal of power, brave the forgotten depths of the lost mines, escape a vampire's domain (RIP followers), then defeat four lesser demons in combat, cross the valley of fire and finally arrive at the crown of command. There, I obtained the power to command death as my servant and send him to kill my enemies one by one! All this was achieved with beginner level stats. I had no chance to win by overtaking my enemies the safe way so I risked it all, and this time I won.I have no problem finding games online to play with strangers. It's more fun to play with friends. I regularly buy copies of Talisman when it's on sale (usually 1-2 euro for the base game) and gift them. The good thing is that my friends don't need the expansions to play with me, because in a multiplayer game if one person has all the expansions then the game is played with all of them. In my experience games with 3 players are the best. With 4 or more the game tends to last longer. Two player games are also fine.The rules of the game are easy on beginners. Even if it's a complex game, the rules come at you one at a time. You don't need to know what all the cards in the game do, because you will only draw one or two cards a turn usually and then just read those cards and see what happens! I remember when I first played Talisman, I had no idea what was happening... and that was great! I'm a dwarf in a fantasy world. I fight monsters, find treasure, and buy drinks at the tavern. My opponent is a troll who found a unicorn. The unicorn is smarter than he is...I could say a lot more about this game, it is simply amazing and lots of fun. It's well worth full price, if you are undecided, buy the base game on sale and play it online. You will not regret it!			"

												This is a 51% recommend,  Yes but barely. I LOVE Talisman. I bought the first edition board game 30 years ago and played it to bits. It has its flaws (some of which were addressed in the 2nd and 3rd editions) but these are not relevant for this review.The multiplayer is an enormous pain in the backside to figure out. The user experience is tough going, the controls unintuitive and to top it all, a 2 hour game had to be abandoned because the Resume feature didn't work.Tread carefully, buy it in a sale and try before you buy any extra copies for other players.

												Game runs smooth, but HUGE problem trying to get the expansions to work.  Payed for them and can not play with any of the new character cards.  Finding help major problem, in fact I'm still looking for somewhere I can contact help to solve the problem.  Great game, but absolutely no customer support.			"

												It's Talisman, but digital! If you haven't played the board game you are really missing out. However, for all of your board game ports, this is how it should be done. Besides a couple bugs, this game really nails it. Easy for anyone to pick up, and hopefully they fix things like the inability to cancel a spell cast or making spells uncastable sometimes when they should be. I would still recommend to anyone.			"

												Okay, right off the bat, this is an awesome game to play! So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach ""the crown of command"" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a ""Talisman"" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!			"

												If you like board games then this game is great.  You'll want to get DLC at least to Dungeon to make it more replayable.  You do not need humans to play and the AI isn't that bad, except for their use of spells.  Spells aren't utilized very well by AI.  It will take time to learn the ""When can I cast this system.""  Spells do not have a natural or intuitive system for casting.  Even after 10-15 games you can still not cast them at right times always. Lots of options for which DLC to use each game and what parts of each can be used.  Know games can take 30 minutes to 3 hours to win.  What character you play and what cards you and the others get make a huge difference in the time involved.			"

												If you like board games, then this is a definite go-to game. The point I want to make is that I have already tried the board game so I am a bit of a veteran on this game. The people I play with are used to this game, and so they can readily play it. I prefer playing the board game. After all, talking (or arguing) about the rules is pretty integral to every board game. But yea, -sigh-, I guess that people grow used to things being like they used to be. Game rules update, games become different, people become bored of both the old and the new rules. That brings me to the positive sides of this PC/MAC game. It is a card game, and each new card brings new rules. You can buy new cards easily. You can even buy new areas to explore.That said, it is your choice if you want the digital version of the game or the real version. Or both.This game is perhaps counter-intuitive. It is a set of rules, rather than an open world. The first times of playing will put you in situations where you still have to learn the rules. And since the rules expand as you go further, seemingly randomly putting you in a good or bad position, the game can be harsh and yet too kind at the same time. It is, in other words, quite random. But the best part is that it's a game where, every time you play, you don't know the outcome. Even if you lose, you might have done very well on the part of acquiring various things and seeing different events unfold, and thus the play time was worth it.			"

												Talisman is a great game gone slightly sour in the digital edition by the many technecalities that were wrong, mostly have to do with spells and when they are available to cast. Many of the spells that can be cast on ANY character cannot be cast on yourself, as well as not being to cast path of destiny on a character with the false grail, the spell should be able to be cast but the character simply should not gain the quest. it is also ruined by buggy AI as in AI who will keep 3 talimans while discarding belts of strength and such, and AI that will not put anything in a bag of carrying.

I didn’t know or understand all the nuances or anything, as even at the time of this review, I’m still a novice (only 22.5 hours played and at level 3). But I can’t begin to express to you my enjoyment of this game. I pick a random character and play. No game ever plays the same way twice and no one knows what they’re in for once they reach the pinnacle. The developers have really made a clean and engaging game here and continue to do so. I hate the word ‘fun’, but the fun factor in this game is through the roof. It doesn’t even resemble a ‘card’ game once you get started. Final verdict: 8:10			"

Now you can play Talisman with those gamer friends who may have moved away, or when no one else is up for a game.There are times that playing against the AI feels like playing against a drunken gamer with the number of WTF moments that occur, and there are a few rules that don't seem to fire off properly from time-to-time.

												I purchased the game through the Humble Bundle and so far I have been impressed. Online does have some issues. 1 play through online took about 3 hours and we had 3 total disconnects. After each one we were able to reconnect though. The reconnect process really wasn't that bad especailly if everyone is already on Skype, Mumble, etc. I don't want to dive too much into the gameplay as honestly the best method of researching that is YouTube. Anyone interested in the game I would encourage to watch a few lets plays to get the hang of the rules and also to see if this is a game they will be interested in. If you do not have a group of friends to play the game with I would recomend staying away or using Steam or Reddit to find people to play with. The AI leaves much to desire. Anyone who is a fan of board games and have a few friends willing to play with then this game is worth the purchase and with these factors I would give the game a 7/10 in its current form. With more NET improvements and Spell casting changes to make it more intuative I could say my rating going higher.			"

I made it to the end then just had to keep hoping to roll a 4-6 to  make the AI lose a life.  I would get him down a couple lives then he would heal back up.  Then I would roll 1-3 a few turns in a row.  Then get him down a life then he heals.....UGH!!!  If the end game was different I would give this 5 stars.  As it is for me it is a 3.5 to 4 star game.  It is probably beter when playing with friends.			"

												The Pros:The game is pretty. The art is pretty much as I remember the board game. The UI while unintuitive does cover most things. Winning can be fun.The Cons:Losing can be really boring. Being stuck on the command crown for endless turns whilst your one remaining opponent wanders the outer regions merely healing when you get the command spell to hit (every 1 in 5 times, and I started that end game approach with 8 fate) is not my idea of going out in a blaze of glory. The AI makes no attempt to get near you once you are down to two players.There are many moments of frustration in the game. Many of them aren't particularly meaningful except as an ""I gotchya"" tweak that the game pulls on you. (Being unable to control when some spells go off, having situations where you are forced to target yourself with abilities or spells because the UI doesn't allow you to back up, losing all your items/gold/followers to bad encounters, rarely ever burning a fate point that actually helps, the list is probably endless.) That said if you are a fan of random, I think this game really hits that spot. Whilst Catan (the online version) is kind of sad for not having multi player options, Talisman does have this.I can't say I think much of the pay to play nickle & dime approach (and what big dimes they are!) but it is nice that you can customize what you get in terms of characters/boards. I haven't done that but I expect those who want to enjoy multi player will eventually get the relevent characters. One thing seems a bit inobvious but is probably true anyway: You are able to win with any of the characters. The key being that you spend the time to learn how that character survives and adapts appropriately. Some might have a steep curve.I am recommending this game with a 6/10. Meaning: ""caveat emptor"" if you have problems with random games. It is fun once you set aside the disappointments and frustrations.			"

												For a game that isn't an alpha, it's incredibly buggy.But sometimes the bugs work in my favour and screw my friends over, so it aint all that bad.If you want a polished game, avoid this like the plague, if you like to gamble and hope that the bugs will go in your favour, then grab it.

												My friends and I have been playing this game here and there for almost about 2 weeks and overall its pretty fun. There are still some bugs and sometimes it breaks the game (unplayable at that point in multiplayer), but from what I've played on singleplayer, it has not bugged. Even through the multiplayer sessions where it breaks and people get frustrated, they also had fun and for most games, it is pretty funny.10/10, I've seen spellsword Thief, a strength focused Warlock and a spirit elk of a strength of 1 kill many people amongst many, surprising things.

												I'm not a fan of Games Workshop.  In fact, I don't like Games Workshop at all.  But this review is not about the company, but about this game.  I played Talisman when it first came out.  When I found out it was on Steam, I was intrigued.  When I picked it up with the Humble Bundle, I was interested in giving it a shot.I enjoy the game.  I enjoy running around the board, gathering power, and making a push for the crown, leaving everyone in my dust.  Yes, the game begins fairly random, but there is a strategy to the game, and if you know what you're doing, the game becomes less and less random as you shape your character into the champion (or horror) you want it to be.Some simple tactics:  1)  Get to the Warlock and try to get the Clockwork Owl as quickly as you can.  This turns your die rolls for movement into something you can control (since you can move your die roll or less after this).  2)  Get to the warlock and get the bag of holding.  Having 8 concealable slots to carry your most precious gear in is a good thing.  3)  Go to the warlock and get the orb of prophesy (or be lucky and draw the magic item which does similar).  This allows you to control your encounters.  Along the way you should be getting magic items or followers to pad out your abilities.  But once you have those three items (or heck, even just the first), you're able to control your fate fairly well, and can make the push to get to the middle of the board and win.The introduction of runestones is an interesting twist, as is having fate points.  Those both help to deter getting hosed early in the game, and I think they're a workable addition.  I plan on picking up the expansions.I give the Digital Edition of Talisman 4/5.			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition is a fun time killer if you have nothing to do for a hour or so.  It's convenient if you just want to relax, play a quick single player game and move onto to other things you need to do that afternoon.  There's plemty of expansions and alot of characters to choose from that keeps it interesting.On the downside, however, the game does have its flaws.    Spells not working when casted/que'd. Picking targets for spells sometimes doesn't work properly or is confusing.     Some cards don't work occasionally like, ""Use this card before another players turn"" where you'll try to use it but nothing happens and you just get a ""dismiss"" option only.   And my personal complaint is the computer player almost always rolls a ""6""  and you'll get ten ""1's"" in a row which can be frustrating.Overall, it's still a fun game to play if you look past the flaws.   Catch it on sale.   Highly recommend getting the expansions (Dungeon, Highlands, etc) for it as well as it adds another level to the game.			"

												This game is probably a bit coloured by nostalgia for me, as it was a fond summer event to meet my cousin that had this game and we had a lot of fun with it, even without any expansions. This game is a very faitfull adaptation, and the expansions have never been more accessible. They are doing hot-seat right with regard to hidden cards. And a great set of houserules avaliable. If you are not familiar with talisman, it is a very laid-back game where the focus is more on experiencing stuff than actually making any big decissions that matter. This newer version include a faith point system that older versions didn't have, that somewhat alievates the otherwise a bit ""snakes and ladders"" feel the game might get when you are used to it. So recomended if you want a easy somewhat competitative game with fantasy theme (the theme is strong with this one). If you want more challenging decissionmaking there are probably better options.

												Talisman is a really fun game that I usually play with a few friends from time to time. We would often try to send the Grim Reaper after each other and see what happenes. There's usually one person in the group who goes into the dungeon area (can't remember the exact name). It has a mixed feelings of D&D, HearthStone, and a board game (best way I can think of to describe it and my feelings about it).I haven't  played this for very long, so I can't give a very good review of the game, but personally, I do find it really interesting to say the least. The game confuses me at time, but wtih people you know, you'll be able to figure the game out in no time. On a side note, it's an enormous amount of fun with a group of friends (or people you know). It's not as fun playing this alone, having done this on a number of occasions. The game isn't for everyone as it may be a bit slow pased. Personally, it's a good time passer when I have some free time on my hands.But what I can say is that, if ever playing with me, please note that playing the game any time past midnight, Terrible decision will be made on my part.

												I used to play the original Talisman board game with my parents when I was a child, so when I saw that it had been remade as an online-capable computer game, I knew I had to try it.  I got a four-pack, so that I could gift a copy to my parents and sister, and I have to say that it is pretty faithful to the original.  There are some minor glitches, made less minor by the fact that some of them can make it impossible to finish a game (making it necessary to start a new one), but it is a fun, semi-relaxed game to play, and provided a nice trip down memory lane for me.

												The basic game played fine for me, so that is strongly recommended and quite a bit of fun. However, it gets old after several games...So I added the Frostmarch expansion and my first two games using that expansion with AI opponents the game crashed due to glitches in the gameplay mechanics. The AI was trying to do something and got caught in a loop  (a ghoul was trying to use a cross after having used Ancient Artefact and it got stuck on repeat...)Then it crashed altogether when the AI tried to play lucky charm on a Ghost encounter... selected a 6 for the dice roll and the game closed with an error message to email support (which I did).So I strongly urge the developers to FIX the expansion content... I see they have so many more expansions offered, why would I buy the newer ones when the first DLC is buggy? This game has a lot of potential, is a lot of fun and I give it a thumbs up despite the flawed DLC, hoping we can get this fixed.			"

												I like tabletop games, but they are hard to get where I live and really expensive. So after seeing what this looks like purchasing was a no-brainer. This game have maximum of what you can adapt from real, touchable tabletop game into a digitalized version. It almost feel like a real one, especially if you gather your friends in one room (but online play is nice, too). It have even this bitter-sweet rage inducing ""dice-effect"". So, if you looking not just for an adaptation, but a ""simulation"" of tabletop experience, then I personally can't recommend this game enough. Worth every cent.			"

												It's a game, I'd never think off as being something I'd enjoy. Its not overwhelming to play with a little background reading, on the rules and if most gamers that are willing to give Talisman a fair try they should at least get something out of it. From what I have read it is a pretty true copy of the Talisman board game. If I was to pick on Talisman its that it really needs a way to communicate. Its not a deal breaker as many VoIP services could be of use. As with any digital board game it can't complete with a room full of friends.

												This very much brings me back to the good old days the first time I went to college and my suite-mate brings out this magical board game and says ""You want to learn a new game?""... Awesome remake of the classic and the expansions! If you have ever played the physical board game, you owe it to yourself to get this. May the good old days rule once again.			"

												Although the charachters look a little bit like they may take your children away from you in the night: my inital impressions were good.The game did keep freezing on me (possibly because I was making this awesome video.... ) which made getting a good feel for it hard. There also did not appear to be a huge amount of depth, but, again, this is just a first impression. A very, very short first impression.

												I am just tickled by board games, and I love this game so much! Normally I like to go witht the thief class in these kinds of games, but this one is encouraging me to try others, I've found I've gravitated towards the Druid and Warrior as well, so far! Unfortunately, I've only played because of the free weekend, but this is DEFINETLY going on my wishlist, and I am DEFINETLY getting it later on for keeps.			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition is a fun time killer if you have nothing to do for a hour or so.  It's convenient if you just want to relax, play a quick single player game and move onto to other things you need to do that afternoon.  There's plemty of expansions and alot of characters to choose from that keeps it interesting.On the downside, however, the game does have its flaws.    Spells not working when casted/que'd. Picking targets for spells sometimes doesn't work properly or is confusing.     Some cards don't work occasionally like, ""Use this card before another players turn"" where you'll try to use it but nothing happens and you just get a ""dismiss"" option only.   And my personal complaint is the computer player almost always rolls a ""6""  and you'll get ten ""1's"" in a row which can be frustrating.Overall, it's still a fun game to play if you look past the flaws.   Catch it on sale.   Highly recommend getting the expansions (Dungeon, Highlands, etc) for it as well as it adds another level to the game.			"

												I really enjoy this, yes to some people it might feel tedious and long winded especially if you play against the AI, however I actually like it that way because it means I can sometimes actually listen to what my wife is saying about the house needing new doors or floors, not sure, because I was watching that Thief sneaking around. If I have one complaint it does seem like the dice mechanics might not work that well on a re-roll, too often the same number comes up again on a re-roll or could it be the theory of the bread always fall on the floor with the butter side down.

												Okay, right off the bat, this is an awesome game to play! So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach ""the crown of command"" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a ""Talisman"" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!			"

												If you like board games then this game is great.  You'll want to get DLC at least to Dungeon to make it more replayable.  You do not need humans to play and the AI isn't that bad, except for their use of spells.  Spells aren't utilized very well by AI.  It will take time to learn the ""When can I cast this system.""  Spells do not have a natural or intuitive system for casting.  Even after 10-15 games you can still not cast them at right times always. Lots of options for which DLC to use each game and what parts of each can be used.  Know games can take 30 minutes to 3 hours to win.  What character you play and what cards you and the others get make a huge difference in the time involved.			"

												Talisman, with all the expansion content enabled, is a very fun game with an expansive, adventurous feel that supports a variety of diverse play styles.  Without the expansion content enabled, it's a much more straightforward and less interesting experience.  The UI could also benefit from some adjustments, as it's sometimes difficult to click spells before the game moves past the point where they're legal to play, and at times you're forced to make a decision without the ability to click around to examine details of the game state... issues which can both be largely mitigated by familiarity and careful attentiveness, but which will hopefully be remedied in the future.All of this together makes for a game that's a lot of fun with a bit of investment, but which does not make a good first impression.

												This is a game that's very true to the original board game.  If you like playing board games with friends that could take 45 minutes to several hours, this one's for you.  But you can save your progress in offline games, unlike the real thing ^^Overall, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Fantastic board game! It's an emotional rollercoaster to play it. You are either extremely happy with how luck has favored you because you're winning, or you get turned into a toad and you want to punch your monitor. I haven't had a boardgame do that to me in a long time, it's that fantastic!			"

If you just buy the base game and have a friend with all the expansions you can still play the expansion content, so buy the game!			"

												This is by far one of the saltiest games to play with your friends.  I just got out of a 6 hour game with five of my friends only to have it crash when almost everyone died.  This game was fun, everyone had a chance to be in the lead, and there was never a point where I felt I wanted to give up.  The balance, interface, and pacing are all very much improved on what was origionally implemented allowing for smoother flow and more fun for all players.  The AI still gives me a lot of trouble, but i'm not complaining as it feels less like a win engine now			"

												If you're a fan of boardgames then this is great. It has a lot of different characters and offers quite a lot of gameplay variety, especially if you have the expansion packs. Best to buy the season pass on sale.Gameplay wise, you pick a character, travel around the map battling monsters and completing quests in order to increase your character's strength or craft (magic) score. Eventually, you'll be able to move into the inner region to reach the crown of command, where, you might complete the generic victory condition or a special victory condition (if you have this feature turned on).It's fun, especially with friends. It does take awhile to play though, and all the extra content might seem a bit jarring. 7/10			"

												4 hours in to a game, one turn away from winning, and you get pulled out of the middle and robbed. 3 hours in to a game and your friend turns you in to a frog and kills you. 2 hours in and you're on your 4th character because nothing will go right. You get Talisman'd a lot in this game... why would anyone want to play this? Cause its a heck of a lot of fun. You spend the game raising your strength and craft, the two stats you use to fight battles. Talisman is one big journey to level your character up enough to go challenge whatever is in the middle of the board. Sometimes you might have to fight a boss to win the game, other times you might have to steal everyone's items, or you might even vote to see if the persons worthy. It's the mix of endings, cards, and characters that make the game interesting.I highly recommend playing with actual people, while the computer has decent decision making skills it is far from perfect.

												If you enjoyed playing the Talisman Board Game in real life and really want to play it again: get this game!Otherwise, do not!This is a pretty good emulation of the board game. HOWEVER, it does suffer from slowness and could really use a few settings to quicken up the game. Additionally there are some problems with crashing every once in a while.If the developers are listening please implement a way to skip through dice rolls in which there is no way for there is no way to win or lose. For example, if my roll of one dice +5, resulted in an 10, then the dice roll of the other person is just a dice roll +2 then there is no need for that dice roll to be rolled...Bottom line, good emulation of game, but suffers from some serious slowness and crashing. Only get if you want to enjoy some Talisman nostalgia.			"

												Okay, right off the bat, this is an awesome game to play! So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach ""the crown of command"" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a ""Talisman"" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!			"

												Love this game. Love it! I'm a board game/TTRPG junkie (multi-time Gen Con attendee). There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.For instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG. The Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was ""The healer with 2 free heals "" (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and ""The Shrine"", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest. I also had spells of one Counterspell, one Random, and one Temporal Warp. I was going to use the Temporal Warp when I finally started making my run to the Crown! I made a huge mistake by going into the Village and not realizing it ditched the Poltergiest! OH NO! Since I had 10 STR and 5 CRA, I decided to make a run for it. The Devil's Minion rolled BADLY on quite a few Crown spells. I luckily made my way all the way to the Crown with 11 STR from figting one monster along the way and cashing some in. So the Devil's Minion had 5 lives, I had 4. But I definitely had the upper hand from a mathematical standpoint. So what does the Devil's Minion do when he fights me, he picks STR!! WHAT IN THE. I was afraid it was going to be a race to 0 to see who could roll luck (he COULDN'T beat me in STR 11 vs 5, but he had a chance in CRA 5 vs 6). So I whittled him down to 1 health, and THEN he finally lets loose with a CRA attack and actually wins. I beat him the next turn.This is what I mean by the AI makes some poor decisions. What should have been a nail-biter, ended up being a big WHA? What is he doing?! Still love the game!!			"

												If you like board games then this game is great.  You'll want to get DLC at least to Dungeon to make it more replayable.  You do not need humans to play and the AI isn't that bad, except for their use of spells.  Spells aren't utilized very well by AI.  It will take time to learn the ""When can I cast this system.""  Spells do not have a natural or intuitive system for casting.  Even after 10-15 games you can still not cast them at right times always. Lots of options for which DLC to use each game and what parts of each can be used.  Know games can take 30 minutes to 3 hours to win.  What character you play and what cards you and the others get make a huge difference in the time involved.			"

If you played D&D True RPG games from the 60s 70s and 80s then you know about how to use your imagination. If you have an imagination this is a dream to play! This game design wants you to think to learn about its world and believe.. Another great aspect of Talisman Digital is that through game play with AI (computer) the players can learn the rules of the game, this game is like Jumanji the movie that starred Robin Williams, it you imagine your in the fields with a thieif and he is trying to steal your gold or take a life and if your lucky an item from your inventory, it might just feel more real too you than you think.

That list of numbers is used for the whole game, in the order that they are determined at this point.Those numbers will be rolled in that order no matter what is happening.""I would of expected them to use procedural number generation and generate the dice rolls when the player rolls the dice. ""They"" claim it is to curb cheating and being able to close the game and re-open it in hopes of getting a new, more favorable roll. FFS, really? Personally, I attribute it to lazy programmers.

												Game start was fun. Midgame gets repetitive since you just run around and farm items and stats. End game boring as hell. You just need to get stats to enter final level. I expexted in the end some epic encounters or boss fight. Nope. Just random dice rolls all the way. If you are unlucky you just got teleported far away and need to run all across the map again. So fun. In the end you just roll dice 50/50 to make everyone lose 1 health per round. I killed that way 4 my opponents. But the last one had combination that allowed him to get 1 gold at turn start and get healed 1 health for 1 gold. So he just ignored my ULTIMATE COMMAND SPELL and kept playing. And what was the whole point for me to tryhard and rush in center of the map?...To hell this unbalanced random trash game.			"

												If you want a games night with a few of your friends this is the game for you. If you are looking for a solo experience this game is probably not for you.To get the most out of it i would recommend changing the game from focusing on the Crown of Command, to killing the Lord of Darkness, which will require some DLC, but it is worth it. When the end game is about the Crown of Command it can get very tedious to sit through an entire game in my opinion.Never trust the mountain goat.			"

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game. especially with the season pass. there are so many more characters and new stuff added in the season pass that it adds almost unlimited replayability. even just the base game has a ton of content to be worth the $15. it takes them a while to put out new DLC in the season pass, but by now, almost all of it has been released. i don't mind how long it takes them to update the game and add the new content because the content that gets added is always worth the wait. tons of endings, tons of ways to play. it's got local multiplayer so you can play with anyone who might be in the room. plus they recently increased the maximum number of players from 4 to 6. depending on what endings you choose and/or how you decide to play the game (what features/options you decide to turn off) can affect the length of the game. some games can be over in less than half an hour and others can take 3 or 4 hours. i've played almost all the characters at this point and i have to say that i'm impressed that they can really change the way you play the game. there's a monk who can add his craft to his strength but can't use weapons. there's a minstrel who can tame animals and add their strength to his. there's a warrior who can use 2 weapons instead of just one. every character feels unique and changes the way you might play the game. it's hard to describe what a typical game will contain as the large number of items, enemies, spells, and characters make every game different. honestly, the biggest problem i have with this game is the dice rolling. all the dice rolls are predetermined the moment you start up the game. for example, if it's your turn and you roll two dice and one is a 4 and one is a 2, then you move and land on a space and draw a monster from the deck and roll a 5 and the monster rolls a 3-then you quit the game and start it up again but just roll 1 dice or use an item/spell to move and get a different monster, all the dice rolls you just had will play out in that exact order. if you get that 4, you'll roll a 2 in the monster battle and the monster will roll a 5 and if you use a fate to reroll, you'll get that 3. it essentially allows you to know the future and what numbers your enemies will get on their turns. i don't know if they can, but i hope they can fix it.Edit:i think what draws me to this game the most is the fact that you can play with the same character against the same enemy characters time and time again and every single game will play out differently. sure, you might win every time, but what you do along the way will be different every time regardless of what characters are in the game.

												tl;dr I didn't like it.Pre-Disclaimer: Please don't comment to tell me I'm wrong, refer to the disclaimer (next).Disclaimer: I'm sure I'll get somewhere > 10% ""people thought this was helpful"" with me for this review... but I have to post it anyways. Reviews are people's opinions. And like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, everyone's got one and they're all♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways. So here I go...I could not get into this game at all. I've never played the board game or heard of the franchise until I started playing. The pop up rules and tips and hints, etc go on and on and on. They do almost nothing to actually help you play the game, so much as they just blather on about this and that and so on and so forth.. kinda like my review..Anyways. the graphics are a board game that's poorly drawn, with hard to see squares (but you figure out that everything is a square, and there is no point in them anyways). The characters are poorly drawn. The animations are basically cards flipping and moving around on the screen and a die (or sometimes two dice) rolling. So that's about a 2/10.The audio consists of fanfare queues and other nonsensical sounds that notify you that something is happening even though nothing really is.. and you get to hear the sound of a die rolling a lot. If I wanted to hear dice rolling a lot I'd sit at my table, alone and roll real dice. so sound is a 1/10.The gameplay is as I stated above, and it's kinda glitchy. I played with AI opponents and they'd get a card, then roll a die or two and then they're in battle, then they roll more die, then draw a card, etc. then it would be my turn and I'd roll a die, land on a square and then end turn. I don't think that's a glitch but when you play every round and each AI is doing 3-4 actions and you get 1 (or maybe 2 if you're really lucky)... it just feels off and/or unfair. Then when you look at turns and actions in general, they're rather uninspired and not fun. there's also no free will in the game (other than an option or two every couple turns) so you could literally set up the game to play 4 AI players and no user and get the same amount of enjoyment from it. Plus it's a luck based game so no matter what you choose, almost nothing is affected. so gameplay is a 0/10. So totaling up our 30 point score here, the game gets a 3. out of 30. 10%.. 1/10. F-------. Yeah this game wasn't for me. Feel free to mark this as not helpful. I've heard that's the ""I disagree"" button, right? whatever.			"

												Note: This review is subject to change when/if the developers get off their asses and create a stable release schedule.7 Months on, season pass has not been updated.Until the developers get into a proper release schedule, this review will be negative. I love the game itself, however having bought the season pass and expecting releases as promised, they have essentially abandoned this version of the game to focus on ""Horus Heresy"" and their other versions.The next DLC at time of writing should have taken 1-2 months maximum, adding a tiny section and very little else to the board (No new cards, characters, anything other than a new ending) So far it has taken 6-7 months.

												The company is dishonest. Many players bought the seasons pass because its said to contain all future dlcs of the game. One day, they edited the claim and added an optional shaman char and we were told to buy it for charity and its not included in season pass. What happens to all future dlcs?Here the original terms https://web.archive.org/web/20140111132045/http://store.steampowered.com/app/258817/The new terms have changed to chargeable future dlcs. The game is ok, art is beautiful, but controls not fluid. Have to wait for buttons animation to appear everytime u select something. Not responsive due to bad UI and slow loading animations. Makes the game very slow. No controller support.UI designed for mobile platforms.Dice rolls random but are pre seeded.			"

												Game is lots of fun, but absurdly overpriced. The developers took someone else's idea created a buggy digital version of it then jacked up the prices, even higher than a Triple AAA title game release. Buying the base game for the actual worth of the game at 5$ is okay(75% sale). Unfortunately due to the ridiculous amount of DLC the game requires now you will be paying 71$+, THATS ON 50% SALE and only for DLC. Also to make sure that you dont get a good deal, they don't bundle the DLC in hopes to force you to pay more for a season pass.  For the price of the full game, you can buy several games that are top rated and came out within the last year. Not worth it IMO until the people who made this game get off their greedy high horse and just make the game affordable. It is a digital boardgame, not some next gen game with a new engine that needs an amazing PC to play. "

												Loved the Boardgame, hate the incompetent QA on this computer game though.  The UI bugs break the rules of the game.Lots of games have a few bugs here and there.  And there are some bugs that are only slightly annoying - or make you have to perform workarounds - but after just 2 days I'm encountering bugs in *THIS* game that actually cause the game to cheat the player out of their win.  Not in the usual sense, but in the sense that the user interface breaks and fails to let you take the actions the rules say you're supposed to be able to take.For 2 whole months there was a longstanding bug that if any AI player tries to cast the Weakness spell, the UI freezes and gets caught in a loop unable to continue the game so you have to start a new game.  And if you have the Weakness spell in the deck, and are playing against 3 AI players, then the chance of this happening at some point during the game is actually pretty high.  They had this problem reported for over 2 months and didn't fix it until just yesterday.So now I try again.  And run into another rules-cheating bug that stole my shot at winning the game away.  The HERMIT (the guy who gives a talisman to the first player to land on him) appeared in the Plain of Peril.  I open the Portal of Power, which puts me on the Plain of Peril where I'm planning to interact with the Hermit and get that talisman (a necessary item to be allowed to win the game), and the user interface doesn't have a provision for how to let you interact with cards on that space - it doesn't let you.  So the hermit is effectively a dead card when it appears there, which is definitely not how it's supposed to work.  By this point in the game other means of getting talismans were too far away and I wasn't going to be able to get one in time before another AI player would win.  Had I known the game was lying when it said the HERMIT would give a talisman to the first player who landed there, I might have tried a different tactic.  As it was, in this game it was too late.The game was basicaly too buggy and not ready for release yet. "

												What a pointless game. I've won this game nearly every time I played and I never left with a feeling of satisfaction. The interface of this game is atrocious. You can never make moves efficiently and half the time it is not clear how to use the cards you possess. And pray to the gods that you or your opponents never lose connection temporarily. The worst case scenario- the games takes a dump and everything goes to hell; the best case scenario- the atrocious AI takes over and immediate proceeds to ram as many items as it can into its own eyeballs in an attempt to impress the other players with its edgy suicide performance art. Really this is a terrible video game implementation of a terrible board game. I've yet to play a game that lasted less than 90min and most have lasted at least 3hrs. It takes no skill to win and the game frequently misinterprets spells or just plain bugs out and hamstrings the front-runner. All games tend toward every player colluding to ensure a swift end to the experience. How can anyone love such an RNG heavy, tedious piece of garbage. Even if you want a long-form RPG-style board game experience (and why would you) there are so  many better ones. Buy this game if you are a masochist.

												A neat digital rendition of a Talisman tabletop game. Unlike the ""prologue"" version, which is oriented towards the single-player experience, this one is primarily multiplayer, local or online.In case you have never played the tabletop version, this game is somewhat like an RPG Monopoly. Dice-based, with some strategic decision making, but with few of those qualities that most gamers look for.Not much of a depth to it, but the replay value is quite high. The rules are rather customisable and you may finish a run rather quickly.The game does have occasional bugs (some spells can't be thrown and there are problems with Steam overlay compatibility in Win 7), but seeing as it was published recently, I expect the flaws to be ironed out rather soon.While this is not going to be anyone's GOTY (you should get it during a sale or in a bundle), I recommend it for those chillout evenings with your family and friends.

												What a pointless game. I've won this game nearly every time I played and I never left with a feeling of satisfaction. The interface of this game is atrocious. You can never make moves efficiently and half the time it is not clear how to use the cards you possess. And pray to the gods that you or your opponents never lose connection temporarily. The worst case scenario- the games takes a dump and everything goes to hell; the best case scenario- the atrocious AI takes over and immediate proceeds to ram as many items as it can into its own eyeballs in an attempt to impress the other players with its edgy suicide performance art. Really this is a terrible video game implementation of a terrible board game. I've yet to play a game that lasted less than 90min and most have lasted at least 3hrs. It takes no skill to win and the game frequently misinterprets spells or just plain bugs out and hamstrings the front-runner. All games tend toward every player colluding to ensure a swift end to the experience. How can anyone love such an RNG heavy, tedious piece of garbage. Even if you want a long-form RPG-style board game experience (and why would you) there are so  many better ones. Buy this game if you are a masochist. Buy this game for your friends if you are human trash.			"

												This is a near perfect recreation of one of my favorite board games ever. I used to play this game all the time IRL, and I LOVE it, but now that a lot of my RL friends have moved away, this allows us all to keep in touch and still play games together.The game's not for everyone, it's god a heafty dose of luck involved in winning, and sometimes the game can be downright cruel. But it's epic, it's involved, it's got plenty of strategy, and absolutely boatloads of replayability. And the online matchmaking seems to be pretty stable most of the time (only ever had an issue just once).So yeah, for 74.98, you're getting every expansion for the game ever (with the exception of the Shaman Character, who's 1.99 and supports charity with purchase), which is a stellar deal considering each expansion is between 24.99 and 39.99 in real life and the base game is 49.99 if I'm not mistaken. And if you can get it on a sale, hell, even better! :D Totally worth the asking price, great game, can't recommend it enough! :D			"

I run 2 players against 2 computer multiple times.   Computer will beat monsters 9 out of 10 times.  Players lose 9 out of 10 with things like 'Only way to lose is roll a 1 and the computer a 6' occuring several times in a row...re-reroll get another 1.   It is difficult against monsters in an all-human player game, nearly impossible if NPC players are added in...they are just 'lucky' beyond probability like the monsters.  "

												Talisman is formulaic yet random to a fault.I am a board game fanatic, I own and play every board game that even somewhat catches my eye, so of course I picked this one up.What I experienced is kind of a mark against board games and a tough sell to even diehard board game fans.It is extremely static in how to progress and do well in the game. Once you know how the game works, you will do the same thing every time you play.And at the same time, its a pure dice rolling game which can make it random and frustrating when you are starting out. Approach this game with extreme caution, it might be worth buying on heavy sale but even as someone who loves board games I can't recommend this one.			"

												The random nature of the game is part of its charm. You roll the dice and craziness ensues. Simple, fun, with a little bit of strategy and cost/benefit analysis.

As far as I'm concerned, the only reason to purchase the game is for the multiplayer aspect. So basically the game is unplayable for me in the state that it is in.			"

The expansions make the game play more interesting, and challenging.For the price, I'd recommend anyone who enjoys table top gaming to pick this up.			"

It'll take some time still and there is a bit of a learning curve with the digital interface (how cards work, when in the turn order they should be used, etc.) but thats hardly a problem. AI is totally trash of course, I couldnt imagine how they could even program a 'good' AI for this game anyway. I got it to play with other people so not a problem for me. Get this and come play with me! BEST part of the game, if any player or host has any expansion, it opens it for all. Very mindful and generous of the publisher.			"

												This game is fun, but only if you have the correct mindset: sit back in your chair and relax, maybe pop a beer and most of all, play with your friends and socialize. The randomness makes it really hard to have control of the game and it can be infuriating to spend half an hour to try to move into a specific space that is necessary in order to move forward towards winning the game. Another thing to keep in mind is that a single game takes several hours to complete.The game gets pretty dull already after one game and I really recommend that you invest in some DLC in order to make it more interesting. A good starting point is to buy the Highlands expansion and The Dungeon Expansion and if you want to live dangeroulsy: the Reaper expansion.  If you want to shorten the game length (and don't want to grind) it might be a good idea to buy the Runestone deck. I've never tried any of the DLC that modifies the victory condition, so keep that in mind if you listen to my recommendations.I've played the tabletop version of this game and have about 10 hours of in game time divided on two Steam accounts at the time of writing this review. Now to the implementation: the game is extremely buggy. You can play  a whole game without issues, but it gets really irritating when the bugs appear. All cards don't work as they should and during my last game we had to restart it twice because we were unable to do any actions. The AI is stupid and I don't recommend this game if you plan to play it alone offline.So do I recommend this game? Although it's glitchy it's not unplayable. It's fun with the right people and it's an OK way to waste some time, but it's really not for everyone. So yes, if you are OK with all the downsides I stated I think that it's a good buy!			"

												My introduction to this game was the physical board game, 2nd edition. It was a lot of fun, and when I saw that a digital version existed, I had to get a four-pack for myself and my friends and family. It's just as much fun as the tabletop, especially with a video Skype call running.The main caveat is that some of the game rules are a little glitchy and/or still being smoothed out. The developers are fixing them as they become aware of them, so some patience is in order.As well, sometimes the games will lag/timeout, and I haven't figured out a good way to save progress so an online game can resume where we left off. We had to start all over when this happened. Another thing that is hopefully fixed soon.These two issues aside, we still have a lot of fun playing, and it captures the spirit of the physical game well. If you're a fan of the board game, and your friends are scattered across the globe, pick it up and give it a try!			"

												Easily the best replication of the real Talisman: The Board Game.  It seems to go off the later rule sets, which make it really good. (Fate was something not in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed until after 2nd edition)The expansions are really worth the few bucks they ask for added gameplay. The additional characters, well, id wait till they're on sale because they DO add flavor, but not really for the current price.I have played many hours and I have but this to say:Talisman is a cruel mistress.  Those 1's can kill youand no matter how powerful you are, you can succomb to being a toad and lose.10/10 would swear out loud because of my bad die rolls again.			"

												I still recommend this game as it is a very nice repesentation of the physical board game.  There are issues with the randomization of the die rolls (doppelganger rolls a 6 every first attack) and a few other bugs but the developers are responsive and have worked to address the issues that I brought up.

												Talisman: Digital Edition!  Where do I begin!  Great if you're actually playing another game and really don't care whats happening.  An interesting experiment into randomness awaits you - the player and also a very long climb up the levelling tree, which would be much more exciting if it was exponential rather than linear because then it would drag you in (unless it is expontential and it takes 3 games for your first minor upgrade that has the same effect as a horde rolling its eyes at an oncoming avalanche of over-excitable honeybees.  Bare Pass unless you don't even have the boardgame and want it cheaper and with flashy lights.			"

												Roll and move now on a PC.Talisman: Digital edition is a PC implementation of tabletop board game Talisman. In it you will take a role of one of many adventures and embark on an adventure. Roll dice to move, pick a direction and deal with the consequences. Many characters have special powers that you can utilize in one way or another to make achieving your goals a bit quicker. Talisman came out a long time and as many old games it has it’s share of issues that modern board games have learned to deal with. However like old games it also has a big fan base. Talisman: Digital edition is for better or worse a faithful representation of the board game. But as digital board games go it is quite well done. You are able to save your progress without occupying a whole table. You can play with your friends that are spread across the globe. And you can play by yourself if you don’t have any friends to play it. If you buy season pass that gives you access to all the dlc, of which Talisman has many, it will save you quite a bit of shelf space as well. Most of the issues with Talisman: Digital edition come inherited from the board game. That means it can take forever to finish a game and is quite unbalanced and a lot depends on a roll of a die. Added to that are a few AI issues where computer controlled players can get stuck in a loop of selling and buying swords or make actions that are not quite optimal. Dad rating: FineYou can save only on your turn. But you can pause the game during computer opponent turn.Some of the art on some cards can be a bit scary but it’s always static images that you could see in a book or a board game.Talisman is not my favorite board game. But I do like board games and it’s good to see some of them cross over to PC world. With digital implementation of board games they usually fall short because playing with physical components is so much better. In Talisman: Digital edition a lot of the hassle of playing with real board game is removed and that’s why I recommend it.			"

The challenge that I had was when playing with our group of four, the game seemed to take forever. As you can see below the I actually had to break down the game session into three different videos. Time to play aside, this is a very fun card based game. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the genre.Gameplay:

												Game is basically dead, rolls are all predetermined and only spells like time steal change who the game will favor. I have played enough to see the pattern by now and the game will favor one character at random from the start. The devs have opted to go with a predetermined dice sytem instead of RNG and that really kills the gameplay.If you want to play talisman play the original board game and not the digital version as this game is balanced when you do not enable every expansion all at the same time and is a good game at its core. It is the terrible progaramming that ruins it.			"

Worst board game I've ever playedI've played dozens of, if not over one hundred board and card games in my life. It's my favorite hobby when I can gather friends. Most of my income comes from tabletop games as well. Still, this is by far the most broken, dumb, and luck-dependent game I've ever played, not to mention it has player elimination in the late game, which might stretch for hours and hours and hours.I had heard about Talisman before, but never got the chance to play it. I ended up getting it on Steam recently to play it later. Also, after reading good reviews and trying the solo mode (the other app), I thought: ""It looks dense, but nice after you get used to it"". I even decided to get the Season Pass during last summer sales--oh, how I regret...Indeed Talisman gets slightly better overtime, after you get used to it. But in the end, it's a bad game, made worse in every aspect I could find. I ended up playing one match with a friend plus 2 AI's. One of them (Martyr) started off nicely, them the other AI (Assassin) and I (Sorceress) started catching up, until the Assassin made it to the end, trying to kill us off. Martyr was really close, but she got really, really bad rolls, despite she had built up pretty well, and she was the first to be elimnated, despite having dominated the entire game. My friend was next. Then, I spent DOZENS of turns surviving the Assassins attacks, not being able to reach him in any way. I couldn't get in because there were no amulets available, and I couldn't drop my quest (to get another one), which was to hurt another character, in order to maybe get a Talisman, because the only character in the game was out of reach. So I quit the game with 6 life, because I was tired of just surviving, not being able to do anything against it.The only pro in this game was getting a friend to laugh at it together, because Talisman is just ridiculous with all the luck-fest (and those who deny it have either been away from better, modern, and more balanced board games, or are just blind fans.... or both). The cons: too much luck (you roll dice for EVERYTHING), INSANELY slow, even with AI on top speed, broken mechanics, very unbalanced, takes way too long (almost 2 hours had gone by when it felt like the game was finally starting)... Not to mention broken achievements on top of that.To sum it all up, stay as far away from it as possible! Go buy an actual board game to play with friends. Or pick ANY OTHER board or card game on Steam, because you have a very, VERY high chance (I'd almost bet on 100%) of getting something better.			"

												 this is a good game it sticks to the board game, but it needs loads of work yet to be a great game, The only trouble being that because there is so many different items and spells that you can use that have unique rules. there tends to be a lot of bugs. i don't think i've played one full game through without spotting a bug or an error, This game needs some serious work to get rid of them all and get it working right. It can be really annoying when you think your in a winning position with a spell you've got and you cast it and it either doesn;t work as intended or doesn't work at all. Or what as happened to me several times it crashes the game!!! very annoying when your typical game lasts a few hours and can be ruined at anytime. You find yourself not wanting to use spells and items, which goes against everything that is enjoyable about the board game. Its a shame i think the game developers should concentrate more on getting everything working right than releasing new expansions that just add to the frustration.			"

I was trying to replicate the same result I got in game.https://www.random.org/dice/?num=9I wasn't able to reproduce the same result of all dice being 1-3Try yourself. If you are lucky enough you can succeed, but just try 100 times and see how many times it will happen.My suspect is almost a certainty: the rolls are not equiprobable in game.Maybe it is just a BAD random number generator, nontheless it is not fair.

I've only played as the prophetess - her discard ability fails to work correctly if you draw more than 1 card at a time... How pointless to have a game that cant even follow its own stated rules!?!They've also made it so all face up cards in players' inventory are hidden but can be seen if the game is paused???			"

												A pretty simple and straightforward, yet classic board game about choosing whether to go right or left - and that statement really isn't that far from the truth. I don't mind it myself because it can be really enjoyable to play with your friends and in my opinion that's what's most important about these type of games.But when you're making a video game adaptation of a board game, you have to somehow compensate for the lack of physical interaction between the players and the social part of it - by making the game experience much smoother, faster, more manageable (simplifying the things that the players have to do mechanically - taking away all of the mess with tokens and cards etc.) and approachable.And this is the standard that I expect from every board game adaptation like this - this is something that is pretty much must be if there's any point in hoping that one would play it longer than 2 game sessions.And this is where this title fails - the UI is really, really clunky, a lot of interactions seem not to work as expected; not to mention some pretty annoying bugs that we've tackled very early on into the game. These are the basic things that the game should provide, and while I find the existence of bots really helpful (when someone suddenly has to go somewhere or just got really tired of the game, he can leave without spoiling the fun for everyone), this is not really enough to compensate for the rest of the issues this game has.The game itself is quite fun, as I said, but the board game original is the one that should be praised - the digital edition is very mediocre and is, as it seems to be, a superficial, hastily made, badly playtested piece of programming crap, and for that, thumbs down.

Sessions take between 1-5hrs at a time depending a lot on dumb luck with rolls and overall it's well worth the price on sale. Multiplayer is solid and putting friend sessions together is also pretty easy. 8/10 game.			"

												I am going to rate this my way ok it is like D&D with out every game you can choose to start with a new character or your old but you cant start with your old character and also this very much a♥♥♥♥♥♥game I have played multiple round havent won a single one not because I made a mistake or they made a mistake just cards were poorly favored toward my opponents or team mates when everyone is bad and it is like they just want kill each other which I find highly dumb. That is not the gamers fault now I like playing hey leave me alone I am doing my own thing I am quiet now I understand that is what gets me in other games but this game there should be a little more leaway but It just shoves it in your face then there is the fact that the AI in this interface never really changes up it's moves it some how always knows whats best which I find highly insulting because even if one them just gets screwed over they find a way to screw you over to it is fun at time but not nearly as much it is frustrating			"

												I own every expansion for the physical version of talisman and am sorely dissapointed with the digital version.  The game is a buggy cash grab.  Crashing randomly and not giving you achievements.   Only a few of the actual expansions from the physical game have been made available with the developers deciding to opt for making individual characters(which i have been told now by someone with access to the dev build were just reworked characters that didn't make it into the original games that were just rebalanced which is even LAZIER than if they had created them from scratch) that cost roughly half as much as an ENTIRE EXPANSION!  for reference each expansion comes with 4 characters as well as roughly 100 new cards to add to your game.  The whole thing  is designed to milk your cash.  Nowhere near as enjoyable as the board game. Do not purchase this game. Especially avoid the season pass as who knows what new and incredibly lazy ways they will attempt to exploit their customers or if they will finish at all.    The physical game will be yours forever and doesn't require an online community that was already dying off when i got disgusted with the way this game was being mishandled.			"

												This game stinks. I don't know how they wrote their random number generators, but I am highly dubious. Far too many instances of AI players getting the rolls they need while you somehow manage to always come up short. It's infuriating to play three games running and feel like you are getting rolled every game.			"

												The RNG in this game seems awfully fishy. I have been playing the board game version of Talisman for literally decades and I have never seen the kind of ""luck"" the computer players get in this game. They always breeze through the portal of power and right up to the crown of command. Computer player draws the poltergeist? No problem, they cast teleport on their next turn, go to the warlock, just happen to roll the quest to deliver a follower and boom, free talisman. It's all random, riiiiight.			"

												I remember countless hours I spent playing ""Talisman"" when I was a teenager. I loved how you could travel through the different realms and get more and more powerful. The different additional boards such as the City, the Dungeon and the Timescape added so much to this game. Especially the Timescape addition, with its Warhammer 40K science fiction theme was brilliant.When I first saw the digital edition, I remembered those great hours of joy I had as a teen and bought the Gold Pack. Unfortunately, the digital adaptation turned out to be extremely boring and lackluster. The additional sets are only integrated with new cards and, in the case of the Dungeon or the City, with one additional region on the main board, not with an entire board itself. There's no delving into the streets of the City with all its dangers and possibilities; there's no Dungeon to enter; and, which is at least to me the biggest issue, there's no Timescape with all its weird possiblities, deadly adversaries and powerful artifacts. I really don't understand all those comments who say that this adaptation is faithful. It seems as if those guys have never played the original board game with all its expansion sets. Of course, you can say that the developers are still working on the game, but they've already published the Dungeon as well as the City expansion, and both of them are very poor adaptations of the original expansion sets. And this isn't simply a case of different subjective tastes or different valid opinions: just take a look at the original board game and its expansions, and then take a look at how these were adapted in the digital version. If someone wants to tell me that this is a faithful adaptation, then he's no idea what he's talking about.The AI isn't really convincing. It searches for the most direct way to reach the central region, making the player to rush forward in order to beat it. In the two games I completed, the AI characters killed off each other, so I had only to deal with one weakened survivor.There are only a handful of characters who are useful, so most players probably won't care for the other characters at all. This was an issue with the original Talisman as well, but each addition had some new useful characters that the digital version doesn't have. The Dungeon and City boards had some mediocre but useful characters to choose from, and the Timescape addition came with such great characters such as the Space Pirate, the Space Marine, the Astropath, the Chainsaw Warrior or the Cyborg. All of them were powerful additions that gave the player a greater rooster of useful characters to choose from. However, the digital version doesn't have them and leaves the player with only one or two characters to choose from; the others are just underpowered rubbish.I haven't played the multiplayer version, but I've heard only bad things about it, so, even if I did find anyone who plays it, I wouldn't try it.Damn, I really wanted this to be a good game. I really wanted to give a smaller studio a chance, even if this meant that I paid a lot of money for an unfinished product, quasi at face value. How I was disappointed! Admittedly, the developers come up with new content on a regular basis, but it's just not convincing at all. This is one of my all-time favorite board games, and they turned it into a dull, uninspirated, luke-warm rehash.CONCLUSIONIf you haven't heard of Talisman before, don't waste your money on the digital version. Better try to find the old board game, gather some friends and play it. If you, like me, loved the original board game, then don't make the mistake to waste your money on the digital version. Grab the old board game, get some cold beer, try to find some surviving friends who still have time to spend an evening with an old school board game, and enjoy it.			"

												This is by far the worst game that I have ever played in my life, it is nothing more then a series of dice rolls, in fact I think you would have more fun if you spent 2 hours mindlessly rolling dice then play this game. the first game I attempted to play I was doing great almost going to hit the last space, but an A.I characters cast a spell on me that turned me into a toad, in which I lost all my items, then the next turn he stole all of my items, which after that I restarted the game. to which I was treated to the most mindless and boring experience of my life, I quickly was able to aquire enough items to make it to the last square, instead of winning like I assumed I would, all it did was trap me and force me to cast a spell to kill the other players. Not so bad you might be thinking to yourself, let me explain what this spell does, first you have to wait untill the other players take their turns, then since its a spell any player may counterspell or other things to stop you. Then you have to roll a dice at 50% chance to succed, which after the end of my game my total percent of succeding was a whopping 12 % (in which i rolled 2 in particular over half the time) and then after all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t all you get to do is take one life from the players, in which they can prevent, or heal back up (which there are a bunch of chances for players to be healed back to full, normally 4 lives). You might be thinking thinking thats not so bad, after 8-10 turns all the players should be dead, thats what I thought at first... but after 2 and a half hours, YES THATS ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT, AFTER 2 AND A HALF MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING HOURS OF WATCHING THE AI TAKE THEIR TURNS AND ME DOING NOTHING BUT MINDLESSLY CASTING A SPELL AND LOSING THE DICE ROLL I ENDED UP LOSING THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. How in the ♥♥♥♥ing world of mathamatical averages could I lose that game you might be asking me? well, since the AI gets to take their turns, they just ran around the board building their stats up and healing every 4 or 5 turns. At 10 points in the game I had a single player 1 life from dying and lost every dice roll, I did not end up killing a single player during the course of my 3 and a half hour game, the odds of me losing 10 ""coin flips"" in a row is .09 percent by the way. and now to how i lost, after 3 and a half hours of playing this mindless god forsaken game, one of the players, a warrior, managed to turn me into a toad for 3 turns while being at 1 life for 6 turns, heal up and make his way up to the middle square in which he then had to battle me to kill me, at this point i was at 12 str with 2 modifier and a +4 str follower to his 11 str and +1 modifier. but when it came time to battle I realized that somehow during the course of my toadness the follower had vanished from the game, the AI then managed to beat me every single time, he rolled five 6's in a row by the way, I cant even do the math on that one. so my final thoughts on this ordeal, DO NOT ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS GAME, I wish I could get those hours of my life back but I cant, I will be haunted by this experience untill the day I die, if I ever am able to meet the creator of this game I will not be held liable for my actions toward that spawn of satan. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

												The user interface is a little iffy sometimes, with the occasional mis-cast spell or item timed incorrectly, but this game accurately captures the magic of Talisman in all its random, insidious and unbalanced glory. It's fun as heck. If you only play games to win, well, you're a shallow loser and this game is not for you. If you play games to watch unpredictable upsets, see a toad kill a mammoth, or lose 7 points of strength in a single die roll and then laugh it off, you will enjoy Talisman.			"

												Until they fix the DICE and Spell system, I would avoid this game. Players constantly get low rolls while the AI gets 6's. The dice rolls are not random. they are script fed and pregenerated and the AI knows what is coming next. Which is why the AI constantly charges into fights with dragons using a stick and underwear and slays them while I get throttled by sewer rats while using a sword. You also have an issue trying to cast spells on other players... It always selects yourself, as in there are no other options to choose... Like I want to paralyze myself so other players can kill me... or destroy all my own items so everything on the board can kill me even though I spent the last 2 hours struggling against the BS dice to get enough equipment that I no longer need to roll to win but auto kill. THANK YOU FOR REMOVING ALL MY EQUIPMENT.    F.U.   FIX YOUR CRAP!!!			"

												I cannot recommend this game until they improve the Enemy AI.Talisman, itself, is a really great game... but I would much rather play it with freinds around a table, than here on Steam. I picked this up because it is not always possible to get a third of a dozen people together for a day to play boardgames, and this was meant to satisfy my gaming itch at those times.Unfortunately, the AI cannot truly handle themselves... they constantly make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices, and they will spend forever farming for items and ability points without making any effort to actually win. Only once have I ever seen an AI player advance towards the crown, and even when they find themselves in the inner region by pure luck, they will typically turn around and leave on the next turn.To make this game worth the price, you must play it with real people... but there is very little online activity, and if youv'e got three freinds with a day to waste, you may as well just buy the IRL boardgame.

												If you like Talisman the boardgame, don't play this. Not only did they change so many rules and not expressly say so, and make the game moreo r less pay to win, they expect you to know this without being told. Additionally, half of the cards and characters do not function as they are writen. Prime example is the Ninja: It says you can evade anything outside the inner circle, but in actuality you can't evade anything that can gain an advantage over you. Additionally, it says it can lower an enemy's strength down by your craft; It will only ever reduce it by -3, regardless of your craft, bonus too, or even base craft from runestones. Talisman was functional when players interperated the rules , not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard coded computer.			"

												It's so boring and random. At first I was like, oh neat a games workshop game that came with a humble bundle. Running around the board collecting goodies was fun, and then i got strong enough to go for the center and after nearly dying to death due to a string of bad roles I made it to the tower or whatever in the middle, hurray! Then i spent 15+ turns sitting in the tower waiting for the remaining enemies to die, except they weren't because I would either roll a 1-3(no damage to them) or they would get healed.Then I quit and uninstalled and played something less tedious.

												As someone who regularly brought Talisman (Second Edition) to Sega game nights and who no longer has a group to tabletop game with, my knee-jerk reaction to seeing a digital version available on Steam was one of irrepressible excitement - I didn't even bother reading any reviews, I just bought it immediately, so compelling was my nostalgic glee. Boy, what a dope I was. In fact, playing this now, I can't even imagine or remember why I liked it so much in the first place. To paraphrase another reviewer, all this game wants to do is make you lose. I thought perhaps one of the expansions might make it a little better, but here's how a list of the Reaper Expansion adventure cards reads: A robber gobsmacks you from behind - lose all gold; flash flood - if you have a mule, it dies a miserable, horrible death by drowning and you lose all your possessions; plague outbreak: all your followers become infected with bubos and die miserable, horrible deaths. And so on. Actual play with AI characters using the base set goes something like this: AI player 1: roll 5, land on a Forest; you encounter a frightening, powerful Wraith...who smiles at you and gives you an Amulet - no one can harm you with a spell, ever! AI player 2: roll a 3, land in the Crags; you found three gold! AI player 3: roll a 6, land on a Field; you encounter a fiery, angry dragon - you pit your Strength 3 Wizard against a giant Strength 7 reptile...and win! You: roll a 1, land on a Stream; your Strength 7 Troll encounters a Strength 2 Wolf...and loses! Lose 1 Life! Lose all Gold! Lose all will to live or ever play this effing game ever again! Basically, you spend hours and hours trying to beef up at least one trait so that you are strong enough to pass a duel with the Sentinel guarding the gate to the middle ring, then work your way through the middle ring (which is ten orders of difficulty harder than the outer ring was) to pass a trial which will allow you to get to the center of the board and engage in ultimate combat to see who is the winner. Unless someone has the Reverse Decision spell, which can reverse the outcome of any combat, making you start all over again from the beginning. There is very little fun to be found in this game, both by design and because of the clunky, unfriendly nature of the user interface (after seven hours, I STILL can't figure out how to make sure I get to use a particular item or a spell in combat). Also, it uses the first edition art, which is fussy, cluttered, and amateurish at best, and, ""Hey, my little brother got a gold star in his art class, can he draw the Prophetess card?"" at worst. MIGHT be fun for five seconds from a nostalgia standpoint, but, really...save your money - just look at the screen shots and video and say to yourself, ""there but for the grace of gaming gods go I.""

												This is not a game so much as a hobby.  Every square on the board has different rules.  Every player has different rules.  There are four different decks of cards to draw from and of course each card drawn is unique.If you're thinking this is a role playing game where you might choose to pop over to that trader, stock up on items, then head over and kill that creature, you are going to have a bad time.  Game play is random.  Very random.  Strategy tends to be very broad and take hours to play out.  Mistakes are painful.  At its best, any one turn might have a 33% chance of something good happening, 7% bad and the other 60% of the time is just time spent.  Better maybe than real life but its hard to play with a goal of ever finishing.  And by something good I mean anything good.  You hardly ever get to do what you want.  Most often its just pragmatism: ""choice a gives me slightly better odds at improving my lot than choice B, and choice C is suicide, so ""A"" it is.""  Worst part is learning what effects what and where and when so you can tell the A's from the B's.You'd think computerizing the gameplay would at least make things faster but it absolutely does not.  Delays are built in automatically to attempt at giving all players a chance to respond to every action. And it's unforgiving.  You'll end up missing opportunities for counter moves because there arent always hard prompts when you could take action and no way to go back if you click wrong.  Wishing for a much freindlier interface like ""You just took damage, would you like to cast that heal I see in your inventory?""  ""You have a spell, which player would you like to have skip a turn?"" or for Pete's sake ""No one can effect gameplay until the next turn, why don't we skip ahead until then?"" And please plaese please do something about the end game. ""Autoplay to finish? Y/N"" would shorten most games by hours.  * UPFDATE * (I found the house rules to shorten end game, makes it much better.  Why isnt that the standard?  Other way suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks.  I get some of the appeal now, but still ""No.""))			"

												To explain this game in one word: LuckGet lucky with the character you getGet lucky with your draws, your dice rolls, your enemies dice rollsOr you lose.This game has no skill in it. You get lucky with your rolls, And you win. Simple as that.But, only problem is, that is horrible game design.Now that wouldn't be as much of a problem if it where not for the card effects, namely those from the DLC.Bace set is good and fairly balenced, But once you add all the DLC in, things get a little bit... well... kids use steam. So I'm just going to say stupid. Lets look at the clasic set for a moment. There are some spells, and other effects, that allow you to teleport, but not in the inner regon.. Thats all fine and dandy. But then there are cards from some of the DLC cards that let you teleport. And thats it. They let you teleport up to the crown of command. The item that exist to end the game. There are no downsides to these teleports. You just use the card, and get a free win. It would be fine, if it wasen't so easy to get said items. No long is it this fun race to the middle, it is now a race to see who can get the teleport item first, and thus win the game. I unfortunately thought that this game would be as fun as the table top verson was, But I was wrong.Oh wait, I'm not done yet! This game is dead! No one plays this game anymore, So I suppose there is no reason to even write this revew, But you never know. The graphics are outdated, And the devs clearly don't want to improve them. There might be 2-3 open public games, so unless you have friends who also want to waste money on a dead videogame, or you did what I did and made the mistake of doing and buying the 4 pack, you have to fight horrible made AI that play overly aggressively, and will never try and progress the game. I can never finish a game because I tend to get too fustrated with the fact that an AI just attacked me for the 5th time in a row, and the game has gone on for about 40 minutes, or atleast it feels like, and there is nothing interesting that happens, making it imposobal to keep playing.

												very buggy, AI is horrible does the most dumb tings you ever saw, only unit worth playing againsts is the troll and mainly because of its high str number. not even worth $14.99 what a ripoff. Wait for bargain bin priceing on this one. You'll be glad you did :)Also it's easy to see the rnd numbers aren't random because loaded the same game serveral times after a crash and the same number was rolled and the ai went to the same square and drew the same card....can't even play fair gotta cheat and now the game crashes even more than before. They broke it even more not fixed it.EDIT: Still the same crummy game with the same crummy 4 characters. When yah gonna make the real game with 6 characters?Something else fishy is going on with this game. It says I have played 282 hours I haven't played anywhere near thta many hours. They must log your playtime for the amount of time you're on STEAM lol. I barely have played a couple of games online and I ran one tournament of AI just to see how the ai played and what was the best one's (3 best are Troll, Cultist, and Druid) they won their matches and made it to the finals. The cultist won one game so fast I couldn't believe it. I ran them all with no grim reaper and fest to tower wins.But, seriously I haven't come close to playing this POS 282 hours lol. They are just pumping the numbers to make themselves and this game look better than it is imho. ;)			"

												I've played both the physical and the digital version of this game. Though I really like the physical game, I've come to hate the digital version. Why?1. The rng is HEAVILY skewed in favor of the AI. They will consistantly roll 5 and 6, game after game. First time I met a basilisk it rolled double 6!2. Despite the equipment and spell cards saying they can be used in a situation, the game will not always allow you to use them. This hasn't been as big of a problem as #1 but we've run into it on numerous occasions.3. The game will randomly pick a player and everything bad will happen to that player for a while untill the game picks a different player. EVERY player I've played with has mentioned this trait. It shouldn't happen, but it does.So I've stopped playing the digital version. An rng game should be just that, this one constantly shows a pattern that I'm just fed up with.			"

												To preface, I have played hundreds of hours of the physical board game. This is one of those games that holds a special place in my heart and I bought this specifically so I could share it with my friends... The base ruleset is unplayable, unfun and without a workshop for mods to fix this, I will never recommend this game for anyone.In the board game, once someone has the crown of command, no more healing can occur. On THIS however, a troll with 6 gold can face tank the spell, run up to the top with nothing I can do but spend over a half hour (yes we counted) clicking ""yes, continue"" etc. On top of that, making the command spell have a 50% chance of success is just prolonging the game.I believe that adding a steam workshop to this game so you can customize rules, card sets and characters more easily would fix all my issues with this particular version. However as is, this is a literally waste of time and effort. Please games workshop give the community the chance to do what I know so many have done with your board game and let us make the game more fun as we see fit.			"

												The game has good AI, almost insidious at times, almost abysmally idiotic at others. So it is a work in progress as one has to expect from a beta-ish product which is being offered at a beta price. Since it contains a functional solo game, one that sells for a significant fraction of its price, this makes its purchase a pretty low-wattage afterthought, if you have any interest in getting in on a value - and have some friends of a similar temprament who like these kind of board/card based RPGs.The game is nearly impossible to complete playing with 2 human players over the Internet. Over a LAN, maybe OK. But in my experience, especially if wireless communications are in the equation somewhere (cellular or WiFi), I seriously doubt there can be played a game between 2 people all the way through to the end as of the time I wrote this comment. For this reason, I cannot recommend it right now.			"

												First off I love the boardgame. I love it so much I was actually going to spend the full $60 for the game and season pass. Thank god I didn't.The game is very unbalanced and not in your favor. I've played about 20 games now and every single time the AI wipes the floor with me. Every single time, I'll draw enemy cards that are stronger then me and lose 99% of the time. While the AI collects all the good adventure cards. There has been games by the end my strength and Craft will be pathetic like 6 strength and 5 craft while the AI by the end will have 12+ for both. Whenever I play as the Wizard I always get stuck with a counter spell and the AI never uses spells against me so I'm stuck. While the AI doesn't even have to be a wizard and will end up getting to use all the good spells. I've played the board game for years and there has been very few slim times it has ever worked out like this. Everything good happens to other players while I'm stuck getting nothing. And like I've said this has happened every single game. 20 out of 20 games. Also the AI is very stupid. There's too many things to list that the AI does that no one would ever do.So then you figure ""Ok just don't play against the AI, play the game online against real players"" Nope, not gonna happen. There's never anyone online to play with. So there goes that feature.I try to play by the rule and make all players including myself random. So far every single time the AI will get the Wizard and the Prophetess. So even the random feature is useless. Also the game isn't accurate. It will allow to have 2 of the same characters in the same game. So if I pick the Wizard or the Prophetess, the AI will also be one of them.There's only a very few reasons to buy the digital version and it's really scraping the bottom. Only in certain situations would this be a good buy. If you don't have or want to spend the price of the board game, but want to play with a couple of your friends and not playing against the unbalanced AI. Or if you're lazy and don't feel like breaking out the board game to play with your friends or to show people how the game works. Other then that, even at only $7 I feel ripped off. I'll say it again, thank god I did not buy the season pass!			"

												Overpriced rubbish.$70 for a digital boardgame that costs 10cents in electricity to reproduce, and you are paying 6cents in your electricity bill.The game chooses who it wants to win.If you have a 10 stat lead in all stats, and you are sitting on the throne. You will roll constant 1s, 2s and 3s. Meaning the command spell is useless. Then over a period of 300 turns, the computer players will steal all your equipment, followers and dignity. And then somehow an npc who has inferior stats to you, will acquire a talisman and teleport from the outskirts of the board, directly to the centre of the board in a single turn.This mother fukcr has 1hp which he has had for OVER 300 TURNS, now is the time FOR HIM TO DIE. You roll a 4! YES VICTORY!!Just kidding, you roll a 1. Then his next turn starts, and he uses a temporal wave.He is nearly at the gates, YES IT'S YOUR TURN AGAIN! Nope immobility spell. Miss a turn.Now it's his turn, and he uses ANOTHER FUKCN TEMPORAL WAVE.Now he's attacking you, don't worry he has 1hp, and you have 8hp, and all your stats are greater than his.ROLL! 1.

												This is an amazingly bad game.  I have never played the tabletop version but see no reason why this isn't a totally accurate port to pc.  The game is simply an endless sequence of random good things and bad things with not the slightest element of strategy.  If more good things happen to you than bad, you will buff your stats a bit and then it is off to the equally random quest for the killer command fire. Roll a few hundred more times and hope that the other players finally run out of lives (or that you do because you just want the pain to end). You could replicate this game for free by shuffling a deck of cards and, if you turn up a red card, move one square forward.  If you turn up a black one, either move one square backward or don't move at all.  When you turn up a Joker the 20th time you win the game.			"

												Despite having spent many hours in this game I really can't recommend it.I've been playing Talisman for what feels like years and they weren't able to fix the many bugs of the game until now. If anything it feels more buggy than before. But the technical issues are only one part of the problem.To sum it up:-The algorythm for calculating the dices is plain broken. It can have several players rolling the exact same dices again and again-There are occasional crashes in the middle of an ongoing game that often make it unplayable, forcing every player to quit or start all over again-The game is highly exploitable. You can quit a running game and rejoin right away to undo the last move. Some people do it to prevent a move that would have killed them or brought them in a difficult situation. There are also character-based exploits like infinite supply to coins etc.On the plus side, it can be nice if everything is working properly for a change and if you get some decent players. There are many cards and items, lots of areas and expansions to explore... but it's a matter of luck whether or not you will be able to enjoy it.			"

												Super unhappy with this purchase. I've tried multiple times to play this digital version. The AI takes too long to make the game woth playing. I've turned the speed to max (10) and it drags on forever. Two hours into a game  currently and no one has won (Me vs. 3 AI). Save your money and pick up Tabletop Simulator instead. To drive a plus side if you still feel like picking this game up. It plays exactly like the tabletop version and the interface isn't very clucky. 3/10 Would not recommend.			"

												I honestly feel kind of ashamed for purchasing this game. There are so few meaningful decisions to make, and the game is so long, yet I bought the expansion hoping that things would be different. More a ride than a game, you can accomplish the same thing and better by watching people streaming a roguelike.			"

												I've tried with all myself to like this game. Heck, I've even played it for an absurd quantity of time (but not the ones you see in my profile, as I often open it during work and let it in the background) and bought two expansions.But no, the game planly sucks. It would be a really nice and good game, but let's be honest: there is no randomness in it, the game just choose a set of possible winners from the beginning and drive the events and the dices accordingly.You know who is going to win since the firts 6/10 turns, as it's pretty obvious who always get the best dice results and cards. Among those there is then a bit level of uncertainess of who will exactly win, but halfway of the game you know the winner.And this apply to you, too: the moment you start the game and EVERYTHING that happens to you is useless for, let's say 20 turns in a row, you know this is a game you will not win. Just quit, start another round, and try again.Useless like never getting a single enemy encounter for 20 turns, just always getting the exact dices number to move to all those area where you don't draw an event card, or getting a couple that are totally useless. Or you never getting the number you hope, and the IA getting ALWAYS the number you get, so you just go on for 5-6 turns in a row moving to a useless space and the IA getting the same exact number and landing every time in your space and fighting you and killing you because it ALWAYS get the good number even if they have like 20% of chance for it.And, no, it's not just a matter of bad luck: it's a matter of bad luck for a couple of games, but it's not when you play like tens of games and the pattern is always there. I'm sorry, but after having tried so many times, I don't buy it anymore, the game is scripted.			"

												Honestly, this game will make you the saltiest mess you have ever been. The element of randomness is so prevalent and unforgiving that you will find yourself calling this game names that i will not disclose in this (short) review.Your entire game depends entirely, and i can't stress this enough,  ENTIRELY  on luck and dice rolls. You have little to no input into what you do, either you go one way or the other, hit one guy or the other. 80% of the time that will end in a random event.Most of the time you'll just be expecting one of the other characters to jump on you and kill you instantly, which will happen.The card that broke me; Assassin from the city expansion. 3 gold (close to nothing!) for 3 lives off me, killing me instantly after two hours on the map. I don't want to play this anymoreIf you want a game where you watch ♥♥♥♥ing grass grow before getting curb stomped by a large fat ♥♥♥♥ with a t-shirt that says ""NUHMUD GAYMS INC"" and a badge saying ""IM A SPECIAL"" then play Talisman today. ♥♥♥♥ me.

												If you're a masochist go ahead and buy this game.  I did so foolishly.  It has some great mechanics that are fun, but is crippled by extremely punishing RNG.  The game is a dice fest.  Everything, and I mean everything depends on your rolls.  After that you get to chose where you go, whether right or left and that's pretty much all.  Everything else is a no-brainer.  Kill the guy who is winning.  Steal the best items.  Rinse repeat.And how you win...*sigh*.  The goal is totally anti-climatic...the objective is basically a king of the hill thing where you kill off the other opponents to win.  It would be much better if you could just end the game there but since its so hard to even get there thanks to everything based on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ die rolls, they really have to make it so that someone has a chance to get to you while you do nothing but roll to try and hit everyone for a life point.  Talk about fun...not.  The slow drip of waiting for your turn even when you're not on the hill creates more stress than it should.Worst of all is the hateful RNG.  Yeah, I know that getting toaded is just part of the game but you may as well rage quit if your toaded because you are going to be hard pressed in getting everything you earned back while the rest of the players go ape $#*%!.  When you miss a turn or are crippled like the toad during a turn, it is maddening...and maddening doesn't make a fun game.If you just want to bs and drink beer and do something because you enjoy getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by die rolls, this is the game for you. If you like playing slots this is the game for you.  If you like playing Hold'em this is not the game for you.  If you're simply looking for a strategic challenge in trying to win, this is not the game for you.  I'm unfortunately the later.Edit:  I'm editing my review because I couldn't get my refund so I kept trying this game and I noticed something:  How is I reroll the same number after a roll that is negative, 4 out of 5 times.   Each time it happens I quit the game and start over.  Am I really that unlucky or is it the game just trying to present me a challenge?  Either way, it is the most frustrating thing...even more so than getting bad teammates playing League of Legends.  Maybe I can trade this crap away.			"

												Bought this game for 2 dollars : it's not worth it.It's just about rolling the dices. You roll an roll the dices until you manage three times the good result ; if you fail once, you have to start all over again. It is barely a caricature, this game is really ennoying.Avoid it, there are many good free games.Je l'ai acheté pour 1 euro et quelques : c'est encore trop.Ce jeu est juste un jeu de dés vaguement amélioré. En gros on attend sans fin de faire le bon tirage 3 fois de suite ; si un mauvais tirage arrive, retour à la case départ. Je grossis le trait, mais à peine.Bref : d'un ennui sans nom, à éviter quand on voit tous les bons jeux gratuits.			"

												4/10: This game is just silly, wildly-imbalanced nonsense. It's like the pay2win version of monopoly... for nerds.Typical pay2win, imbalanced garbage, the kind you would expect from GW. Here's some reasons why:It's based on a boardgame from like... the late 70s? It's a VERY old board game, at any rate. That should tell you A LOT. If you're all playing only the base game, and playing the same character (which will never happen), the game is about, 60% luck, 40% ""skill"" (knowledge of how to play).Now, If someone is playing an OP character, or any spell caster, for that matter, you can throw those percentages out the window. Then you will be 100% fu cked. That's because any spellcaster that refreshes spells can just spam spells until they (inevitably) win. Spellcasting is THAT advantageous.There's also PLENTY of pay2win OP characters that you can buy, which will be blatantly overpowered. And I haven't even tried the new Warhammer expansions (LOL... Warhammer characters, why not? Seamlessly fits into any game, right? Because GW knows they can milk a nerd OVER AND OVER AND OVER again).BECAUSE OMG SPESH MARINES *Every nerd on planet earth or gasms instantly*TL;DR: Typical pay2win garbage from GW, set in a chance-based board game that was originally created in the late 70's... Sound sh it enough for you?			"

												The game is just like the original board game. Very easy to learn if you never played Talisman before because it has a very nice tutorial.The AI seems to be pretty good but in my opinion it needs to take more ""chances / risks"". It seems to be playing very safely just to survive rather than winning. But it is still fun. I guess Online mode is there for more challenge. But would be nice with some AI improvements for those of us who don't have time to play online.			"

												h1] Talisman is the perfect Trolling Game	 [/h1]And I mean that in a good sense. Because it is so total random. You can have the best character in play, be ahead of your friends and than someone or something turn your character into a TOAD. I love the dice who can without problem roll four 1 in a row (including re-rolls) to avoid being turned into a TOAD. Like the Original Talisman from GW it is unbalanced, totally random, and above all so fun to play. Laugh at your friend's misery as he is dragged screaming into a portal and sent to...wherever. Or when the Evil Assassin has his alignment shifted to Good by the Mystic in the village, and he sulkinly has to leave behind his runesword of pure evil. this game loves to troll you, and will do so constantly. And if the game won't give you a hard time, sure your friends will. cast spell at each others, attack eacht others, steal items or even followers from each other in Trollisman	 ...aheh Talisman. One instant you are fighthing wolves in the hills, the next you find yourself drunk at the tavern, only to be beaten up by a farmer. stuff of legends.  this game is.			"

												If you're a fan of the board game then I'm sure you'll enjoy this.The graphics are okay, and reminiscent of the first edition of the board game.The AI is a bit iffy, but not terrible, although I suspect some of the RNG is a bit dodgy.I've played through a couple of times so far and the only frustration I had was trying to kill off an AI Warrior when I was at the Crown of Command. I was rolling 3s more often than not (you need 4,5 or 6 for the Crown to take a life from the other characters) and he was healing himself up at the Castle and at a random Healer card that had been drawn in the middle region. Took a *lot* of dice rolling before I eventually beat him. But he was massively overpowered in terms of Strength and yet was still not coming after me at the centre of the board. If he had he would have thrashed me. But he just kept bumbling around the middle region, losing lives, healing them ad nauseum.Hopefully some of the other endings will fix this frustration and make it a bit less RNG.Still recommended though.

TL/DR: Good game, Online play is full of bugs.For anyone not familiar with the board game, this is basically a turn based RPG which can take anywhere from 30mins to 3 or 4+ hours per play through. It depends a lot on how fast you take your moves and what cards the RNG throws at you.For people comparing this with the boardgame, it's pretty much an exact replica and actually works quite well.You can play offline taking turns per character or against AI, the AI is okay, but nothing spectacular and will more often than not end up either playing it really safe and possibly making your game unwinnable, or sometimes not being aware of  small nuances in the rules which make it sacrifice Life points continuously by trying to fight unbeatable opponents.By far the biggest flaw with this game is the online mode, it is so buggy it makes it virtually impossible to complete a full game online. People's game or connection will bug out, people will rage quit or get bored and leave and in all cases be replaced with AI players, which means you're playing an offline game, but have to be online to do it.If you're only interested in the offline mode I recommend this game, if you want to play online, I recommend you play something else.

												Having been a fan of the various versions of the boardgame for more years than I care to remember, the anticipation I had for a true commercial digital version was tremendous. Talisman DE does not disappoint in any way, and with the promise of all the current expansions, looks set to continue to be a firm favourite for countless more years. The game is an accurate conversion of Fantasy Flight's revised 4th Edition, with all the content, and more. AI opponents are continuing to improve as the game develops, offering a good challenge when no-one is available to play online. Online multiplayer works well, and offers gamers like myself the opportunity to play against like-minded folks from across the globe. Gameplay is generally quite simple but with many strategic nuances the game can be played over and over again, and should continue to keep players interested with hopefully frequent updates containing the expansion packs.

There is definitely strategy and a meta-game to it, but you'll occasionally find yourself glued in last place through no fault of your own.

												The game is pretty fun.  If anybody has played the iOS or Android version, it's a lot like that.  The only downfalls are:1. The number of DLC packages available - I feel like I've bought a playable demo with the amount of extra purchasable items available.2. The gameplay is REALLY slow.  The AI turns feel like they take FOREVER to complete.  It would be nice if you could skip or speed them up.3. Somehow my game went into windowed mode and I have no idea how to flip it back to full screen.I would recommend this game for anybody looking for a fun and casual boardgame, but I'm not sure that I would recommend it at its full price - especially with the huge amount of available DLCs.

												So far a fairly faithful representation of the game. Some bugs which I expect will eventually be worked out. My only major gripe is that the AI opponents aren't programmed to win; they never go for the Crown of Command (CoC). When a human player reaches the CoC, the AI opponents just keep running back and forth healing making the endgame mind-numbingly boring. The only way to play this game with AI is with the Race for the Crown option turned on. Improved tweakable AI algorithms would go a long way to solving this issue.			"

												This is a solid recreation of the, I believe, 4th edtion of the tabletop game published by Fantasy Flight. Some of the itnerface and timing takes  alittle egtting used to. But, if you're looking for something that is a faithful recreation of a tabletop experiance, this handels that nicely.			"

												FANTASTIC game. I have the board game and In love it. Now I get to enjoy the game without having to carry around my board game. The great thing is being able to invite your friends from the own comfort of your home. So, if I want I could play this game while wearing my undies and bra. They would never guess. ;]			"

												If you're a fan of the board game then I'm sure you'll enjoy this.The graphics are okay, and reminiscent of the first edition of the board game.The AI is a bit iffy, but not terrible, although I suspect some of the RNG is a bit dodgy.I've played through a couple of times so far and the only frustration I had was trying to kill off an AI Warrior when I was at the Crown of Command. I was rolling 3s more often than not (you need 4,5 or 6 for the Crown to take a life from the other characters) and he was healing himself up at the Castle and at a random Healer card that had been drawn in the middle region. Took a *lot* of dice rolling before I eventually beat him. But he was massively overpowered in terms of Strength and yet was still not coming after me at the centre of the board. If he had he would have thrashed me. But he just kept bumbling around the middle region, losing lives, healing them ad nauseum.Hopefully some of the other endings will fix this frustration and make it a bit less RNG.Still recommended though.

												h1] Talisman is the perfect Trolling Game	 [/h1]And I mean that in a good sense. Because it is so total random. You can have the best character in play, be ahead of your friends and than someone or something turn your character into a TOAD. I love the dice who can without problem roll four 1 in a row (including re-rolls) to avoid being turned into a TOAD. Like the Original Talisman from GW it is unbalanced, totally random, and above all so fun to play. Laugh at your friend's misery as he is dragged screaming into a portal and sent to...wherever. Or when the Evil Assassin has his alignment shifted to Good by the Mystic in the village, and he sulkinly has to leave behind his runesword of pure evil. this game loves to troll you, and will do so constantly. And if the game won't give you a hard time, sure your friends will. cast spell at each others, attack eacht others, steal items or even followers from each other in Trollisman	 ...aheh Talisman. One instant you are fighthing wolves in the hills, the next you find yourself drunk at the tavern, only to be beaten up by a farmer. stuff of legends.  this game is.			"

												Great game to play with friends. (Not so much AI, but thats fine too to get a fix in) Game always is random, and with more expansions and new cards, game will not get dull. Will be a lot more depth involved once corner boards are added. Base game itself without any extras WILL BE DULL! Always was in 1st - 3rd edition. So do make sure you get the expansions for maximum tactics and fun!			"

												If you have played the boardgame and like it... what are you waiting for? This is a great adaptation. I can't resist chanting ""toad!, toad!, toad!..."" every time someone has to roll and may get the infamous one. An ""advantage"" of a digital version over playing with board and pieces is that it resolves the ""rules lawyering""; no more arguments over taking the doppleganger as a trophy or which spells can be cast together. In some cases the reading of the rules may be a little unexpected (deducting the base craft instead of the current craft, for the ninja's secret strike) but I think in the end the designers achieve a good game balance.If you don't know Talisman but you like turn-based fantasy boardgames that are easy to learn, with games taking a couple of hours, then this is a great choice. The game mechanics are: you compete against 3 othe players, each with different stats and abilities (RPG-like). Move around the board where different events happen, building up your character's abilities. When your abilities are at a good level, try to get to the end game (this is the ""inner ring"" on the board, for the base game, or it can change depending on expansions). Like the original boardgame, you can add much variety with the expansions, it does not get repetitive. The events are fun and well balanced. Generally you will make progress by making the right choices but... don't get too complacent! Even for the strongest character there is a small random chance of a minor ""disaster"" that brings your stats down a few notches. By the way, the base game does provide plenty of fun, the expansions are very nice, and I do recommend getting them if they fit into your gaming budget, but the base characters and cards should also provide with a good dose of variety before you need to spice things up. Also regarding the expansions - they are selectable from the options screen, you can try them out and turn them off (e.g., if you want to show the game to a new friend and want the ""simpler"" game, or if you feel the expansion makes a game longer and you want a quicker game today). For the character packs you can turn them all on or all off.In terms of bugs the game is quite stable; very rarely I've come across a situation of a missing ""continue"" button or a seemingly endless loop of questions but it was easily solved by exiting and restarting.Overall - A great game, and after getting it for myself and playing a couple of games I also bought additional copies as gifts for my friends who I used to play the boardgame with :)			"

												This game is fun. Until you are winning. And have to spend potential hours casting the command spell and hoping the AI players dont heal themselves while you roll less than 4. Select 'first to the crown' house rule if you dont want to havethe worst gaming experience ever.			"

												While I do definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a board game to play or is a fan of Munchkin and is looking for an experience with more depth, this game definitely has a lot of issues as of this review that the developers need to work on. There are a lot of gamebreaking bugs that sneak in with every release, the game has a tendency to crash a lot with no real reason, and there is definitely function that could and probably should be added within the future such as more custom house rules or the ability to use characters from an expansion without using the whole expansion.That being said, I still like the game a lot. I would say it has the potential to be a lot better and while I do understand that the developers aren't a big group it doesn't mean it has to show.  This review might very well change to a more favorable one as the developers work on the game some more but I'm just letting people know that plan to get this game to expect a clunky experience to say the least, it's a diamond in the rough of a game.

												I really do like this game. I've own multiple copies of the box version of Talisman (and the expansions). The reason for multiple copies is because we played it so much we just wore them out. The great thing about this game and the people behind it is that they were able to take much that is good about this game when the converted it to this digital format. And they keep putting out expansions and enhancements. I recommend this for people who (1) like the box game version, (2) like board games in general, or (3) people who just would like to enbrace the randomness of rolling dice and dealing with the results. This game has a LOT of multiple play through value.			"

												Fantastically fun game. Two Thumbs up, will keep you occupied for hours. It's only missing one thing...an actual pause button for single-player and co-op. Pros:Hours of gameplayFun and entertaining Can play with friendsMany different characters to choose fromAlways something new everytime you play.Cons:No pause buttonSome characters appear to have better abilities or starting stats to progress further in the game.100% do recommend!
