												In the world of gaming, where modern games tend to become ever more colourful, faster and action-packed, and even complex strategy titles like the Total War or Civilization series offer more and more eye candy, this grand strategy game is the ugly duckling. It's not one of the cheerleaders but the geek you choose to learn math with. It's like an encyclopedia among hollywood movies. Instead of stunning effects and pretty graphics it has statistics and maps.It presents itself with minimalistic visuals and sounds. But this is not what this game is about so I leave it at that.HoI3 lets you take control over almost any nation that existed from 1936 to 1948 and lays its destiny during this difficult time in history in your hands. This is your chance to rewrite history, depending on your actions historical events like Japans attack on Pearl Harbor can occur earlier or later (or never) than they did in reality. Let's say you start a game in '36 with the U.S. You will have some time before Japan decides to attack. Will you prepare for war in the Pacific or build strong trade relations with Japan to make a war with you undesirable? And when all hell breaks loose in Europe, will you join the allies against the German Reich or do you have other goals? Or maybe you long for a real challenge, want to stay away from the major powers and try your luck with one of the smaller nations? How about playing as Brazil, joining the axis, trying to conquer South America and hold your ground against the U.S.A. The possibilities are unlimited.You are given an enourmous amount of freedom when organizing your military. You can even put together your own divisions with three to five brigades to combine different types of units to tailor them to your particular needs. Set up chains of commands to influence supply lines and and combat strength or let the A.I. play individual commanders (and with them all units under their command) for you.Not only do you command your troops but you are also responsible for reconnaissance, diplomacy, espionage, domestic politics, technological research, industrial production and infrastructure. All these elements are important and influence each other. For example: If you use your entire industrial capacity to produce troops you will not be able to produce enough consumer goods to maintain the approval among your civilian population and you will have to deal with uprisings (in totalitarian nations) or a power shift towards opposition parties (in democratic nations). The same goes for your A.I. controlled opponents: Use spies to influence their domestic political climate to your advantage and weaken their war efforts. Every one of these tasks can be delegated to the A.I. but its highly recommended to do at least the most important jobs yourself. The A.I. is not totally incompetent, in fact it does a pretty decent job, but a reasonably experienced player will still make the better decisions. And besides, why would you want to spend your time watching a game play itself?Only new players might want to concentrate on one gameplay element at a time to get used to it before taking over complete control.The size of the world map is immense, it is divided into 15000 (!) areas and maintaining the overview can become a difficult task, especially when you're playing as one of the big nations, with a huge army, war on several fronts and try to handle as much as possible without the help of the A.I.HoI3 is played in real-time but lets you adjust the speed to your liking or pause any time during the game.If you like a game to take you by the hand and tell you what to do, Hearts of Iron is not for you. It is difficult to learn and difficult to master, the six short tutorials are not overly helpful. It doesn't even lay down objectives for you. You won't miss them because there's always a lot to do and take care of. But if a strategy game with an impressive depth that puts all other representatives of the genre to shame in terms of complexity is what you want and if you have the patience and time to get over the initial steep learning curve, you can have fun for years to come with this title.A few words about the DLCs (HoI3 has a lot of them): Semper Fi, For The Motherland and Their Finest Hour are the must get expansions, all the sprite packs... not so much. You will most likely not want to use the option to replace the nato symbols with new fancy sprites, as they provide more information about the units at a quick glance. The three aforementioned larger expansions on the other hand come with a great many features that really enhace the gameplay a lot. These include but are not limited to: New types of units for many nations, A.I. improvements, an extended espionage system, enhanced economic diplomacy, a strategic warfare screen that visually displays important combat information, improved, more in-depth naval warfare and more realistic amphibious assaults, enhanced character development of your commanders, additional combat tactics, balancing adjustments of unit attributes and many more.

												This is the game for leaders, commanders and heros. If you want to play as Germany in 1944 and push back the Russians and stop the invasion of Normandy, do it. If you want to play as Japan and never attack the USA, do it. If you want to Austria and refuse to be annex by Germany, do it.If you want to play as Luxenbourg and join the Axis so you dont die in a useless war, do it. If you want to play as Switzerland and stay netrual through World War II and War World III, do it.If you want to play as Cuba and nuke the USA in 1938, do it. If you want to play as Tibet (The Peace-loving country with little to no IC and has a 8-year old monk child as a leader) and invade India and nuke America, do it. If you wand to play as the USA and ""Unite"" all of North and South America, do it. If you want to play as France and over throw the Italian government before World War II is started, making them a puppet of france, do it. If you want to play as the Soviet Union and refuse the Non-Agression Pact Stalin and Hitler signed, so it. If you want to play Britian and let Germany take everything over (and most likely you), do it. THE POSSIBLITIES ARE ENDLESS!If you want to play as Hati and... have an earthquake, do it!If you want to play as Ethiopia and get taken over by Italy in 1938, do it. If you want to play as Australia and join the Axis or Communists, do it!Do it! Do it! Do it!To be honest though, this game is not for the light minded. You don't sit down and have a ""small"" match of Hearts of Iron III. My friends an't play this game bcause its too sonfusing for them and it gives them headcahes. People may think they can just get into this game in the first 3 hours. I am almost 300 hours into the game and I am still finding new stuff everytime.As my first playthrough I decided I was going to the small island nation of Haiti. I didn't even know cheats exsited and on top of that the tutiorial was too f****** confusing for me. Being the strategy player I am I had to play this game. I managed to make it to 1943 before the US decided my fate would end with a small invasion of my capital.My next playthrough I played as Germany. It was simple. I never declared war on the Soviets so I managed to invade Britian, France, South America and for the lulz America. The game ended with me dropping a nuke on Washington.My next playthrough was as Romania. The whole slavic region was my b****. I took over Yugo, Hungray, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Iraq (after many attempts of overthrowing thier government), Persia and Afganistan. The Western Roman Empire was ack at its peak.This game has never failed to give me a challenge and make me think.I give this game a 10/10Helped me pass Geography my senior year of high school			"

												Hearts of Iron III is an excellent game. It allows the player to control any nation in the lead-up to WW2, or during it if you prefer. These range from Nazi Germany, of course, to the Dominican Republic, which gives you an idea of the level of choice on offer. The game essentially drops you into the world as head-of-state of one of these many nations, and it's entirely up to you what to do from there: will you align with the Axis in Europe to gain your share of the economic gains in the upcoming war? Or will you side with Stalin's Russia and work to undermine Fascism and the Allies, in an attempt to dominate the world with Communism? However, the level of historical accuracy in HOI3 is astounding, despite the player's ability to make independent and alternate choices. For example, there is a system of ""decisions"" in the game which often provide some sort of benefit, one of which is the historical Anschluss of Austria for Germany. As well as this, there are literally thousands of officers, with their own traits and skill levels (which can be improved with combat), to assign to command your divisions or brigades. These are just two examples in an intricate web of historical detail. WW2 history buffs like myself will be elated at the opportunity to not only, for example, command Rommel's Afrika Korps, but lead it to complete victory in the Middle East! Again, this is just an example that popped into my head, the level of possibility is insane. Aside from the military aspect of the game, which is the focus, there are various other sectors of your nation that you can alter control. There is the politics tab, where you select your ministers and make policies, as well as administer the areas that have come under your occupation through war. There is the diplomacy tab, where, if you are a leader of a faction, such as the Axis, you can influence nations to join you in alliance, and make trade deals, sell equipment, declare war, ETC. Other tabs include research, production, intelligence. I won't go into detail on these, but all are as important as each other.PROS+ Insanely high level of historical detail (accurate divisional names, commanders, ministers in governments, literally tens      of thousands of provinces)+ Ability to relive or rewrite history, in your own unique way.+ Greatly immersive, you get to the point where hours just slip away in what feels like minutes!+ Huge scale wars, on land sea, and air, where you are the commander in chief.CONS- Not recommended if the player is looking for amazing graphics- the gameplay is what sells HOI3, not the visuals.- A tad buggy. The game crashes relatively frequently, especially if tinkering around in console commands.- Steep learning curve, but once you get the full hang of it, you'll realise it was well worth the time put into it.Overall rating: 12/15 (Great!)

CategoryRatingGameplay8/10 Very fun, and somewhat difficult, big learning curve.Difficulty8/10 Its easy to get money and recources, depending what country you are, it can be hard, or easy to research things/ train a load of troops. But if you play as a small country, its hard to get a lot of people in the military, and you usually have to watch what techs you research, and be sure to at least research agriculture, and change some policies to get manpower.Graphics6/10 Unit graphics are good, counters are easy to read, most map modes are good, but the terrain one is bad.... its a grand strategy, it doesn't matter anyways.AI7/10 Somewhat good, it at times can make very bad decisions and do things poorly, other times, it can stomp things, and maintain whatever well. Some times its hard to beat, and a lot of the time, if you don't plan well, it can STOMP you.Freedom6/10 Compared to other Grand Strategies, there isn't much freedom. The time span is only a few years leaving little to happen (but the days are extended with long hours) The game is pretty much set. Its very difficult to do extreme things like changing history in a bizzare way, though it is possible. But all of those things aside, its still fun. BTW, I created a Soviet Poland and avoided getting stomped by Germany by luck.Bugs, crashes and problems4/10 Warning, there is huge problems here. The game is somewhat unstable, it will usually crash after some hours. It may not even start. For a lot of people lucky or not, it will crash, it will not start. There are ways around this, deleting files, downloading other things and such, but its troublesome.Compared to other Grand Strategies9/10 Hoi 3 is a great game overall. Its a gem, if it works. It is better than most Grand Strategies, aside from game breaking things. It will amaze you, but it is somewhat harder.Overall8/10 The game is great, recommend picking it up, but it actually is barren sadly, you have to get Semper Fi, For the Motherland, Their Finest Hour, in that order for it to actually be worth while.

												If masterminding the below sounds like your idea of a good time then this game may be for you (warning: TL;DR).September 1941The dark of the night was lit up by the bombs dropped by the He-111s and Fw-190s. RAF Hurricanes tried to respond but were met by the escorting Bf-109s. The bombers pounded the remnants of the British army dug in around London and throughout Kent, the motley handful of survivors from a disastrous attempt to turn around the war through a raid on Germany itself via Kiel. Few survived that as the British army was quickly cut off, surrounded and annihilated.However tonight the bombs weren't the only thing falling from the sky.  Other shapes came down, softly, dangling beneath canopies. Paratroopers of the XXIV Fallschirmjäger Korps commanded by Generalleutnant Student dropped throughout Dover, immediately assaulting the harbour and RAF Hawkinge. Less than half an hour later, with the battle for these key locations ongoing, explosions rocked the coastal defences as three Admiral Hipper class Heavy Cruisers opened fire whilst landing craft flooded into Dover, disgorging thousands of marines in support of the paratrooper drop. The Home Fleet could do nothing to disrupt the landings, with the Channel being completely dominated by the German main fleet consisting of the battleships Bismarck, Tirpitz, Schlesien and Scharnhorst  in support of the gargantuan super-battleship Götz von Berlichingen with an escorting screen of destroyers.But all of this was a distraction from the real attack. A couple of hours after the initial assault, with all of the British attention on Dover, almost a hundred and fifty miles further west a second wave of paratroopers dropped onto Bournemouth. The British Army had nothing in the area to respond with other than handfuls of local garrison troops and Home Guard units which were quickly overwhelmed by the elite German troops and the harbour taken. With the door now kicked in transport ships steamed into the harbour, disembarking the XVII and XXII Panzerkorps which quickly spread in all directions. The biggest push being, of course, for London and from there to Dover.On the outskirts of London a brief armour battle broke out with the remanants of the once-proud British armoured divisions fighting tenaciously but hopelessly to prevent the assault from breaking through into the capital itself. Eventually, however, the inevitable happened and as paratroopers stormed the gates of Buckingham Palace the British Army retreated from London. The forces fighting in Dover, now cut off entirely and surrounded, fought ferociously to break through with some limited successes. But for many, completely out of fuel and ammunition, all they could do was surrender. Britain was not yet conquered, but with two supply routes from France forced open and more German divisions arriving every hour the end result was no longer in question, it was just a matter of time.January 1942I sip my coffee in a Parisian cafe as I study the reports from across the Channel. Five long months since the first attack but now the British Isles are almost completely pacified. I sign off on the orders to begin transferring the Panzerarmees under my command back to France and from there to the eastern front, as well as to Student's recommendation to let his two Fallschirmjäger Korps cross the border into Ireland to finish off the last potential threat in the theatre. I lean back in my chair and sigh with fatigue, staring at nothing.A cough brings me back to my senses. An aide holds out a piece of paper, snapping a salute, a staff car idling behind him. Raising a brow I take the paper and read it. Stalin has finally made his move with an attack near Königsberg. Worse, a large force of the Red Army has also assaulted Finland and the Finns are close to breaking point. My attention is needed in the east, personally.I stand, carefully settle my cap into place and drop some money on the table and make for the staff car whilst asking the aide to find out the progress on the Panzer VIII Maus super heavy tank project I ordered for development. I think I'm going to need some very big guns for this one...			"

												I was a big fan of HOI2 and played it a lot.  It had a good balance of playability and realism and there were some issues which needed fixing, such as convoys and the occasionally flaky AI but it was a good game.HOI3, sadly, is not.  It has taken me a while to work out why, but I think it's because, in trying to make it a complete war simulation, the developers have failed to either make it accurate or make it fun.  The accuracy claim sounds harsh, so let me explain.1 - Research.  There's no logic to it.  One has to seperately research the gun carriages and weapons for anti-tank guns, for anti-aircraft guns, and artillery.  That's six separate thingies to research.  Then there's a seventh bit for heavy AA for your provinces.Now in reality, what happened was that the best anti-tank weapons (British 17pdr, German 88, American 3"") all started life as AA guns.  It would make far more sense to have a 'foundry' option where guns could be researched and then applied to different areas. Why even force people to research three lots of gun carriages?  It makes absolutely no sense.The same applies to separate research for cavalry weapons, militia weapons, and infantry weapons.  What, we're all using different rifles now?As a minor aside let me come on to the logic behind the naming of each progressive unit.  For example, the British medium tank starts as the A9 cruiser, then when you research 1940 tanks it becomes the A15 Crusader (skipping the A13), then for 1942 tanks it becomes the Sherman Firefly.  What?  No Cromwell?  Why the Firefly?  This isn't the only case of a total lack of logic in the choice of naming. The naming doesn't affect the game but for a game which boasts of its realistic nature it is totally out of place.IMO the complexity of the research tree does NOT add anything to the game.  I think it could have been halved in size and been far more enjoyable to use without losing any gameplay.2 - Convoys.  The problem with convoys is that there is no mechanism to manage their routes.  This was a problem in HOI2 where the German AI could sink the entire British convoy fleet by hanging around in a few areas of the North Sea and continually sinking ships.  The very least HOI3 should have had is a convoy management system.  The player should be able to tell the convoy routing system NOT TO SAIL through certain areas.  Instead I have to watch convoys being sunk in the middle of the North Sea and around the English Channel, instead of rerouting all my convoys to the NW coast of Scotland or Liverpool and Belfast (as was done historically).  It's a huge oversight and it is one of the primary problems with playing as the British.  One of the other problems is that the cost of both convoys and escorts is fixed and does not fall over time (as it did historically with Liberty Ships and corvettes).  It's almost as though the game is written solely with land combat in mind and about 3/4 of the way through someone said ""Hey, wasn't there someone else in WW2 beside Germany and Russia?""It's a real problem and affects playability and the prospect of a historical outcome to WW2.3.  Naval AI.  While I'm on the subject, the AI doesn't seem to know what to do with its ships.  The Germans send their battleships out unescorted to hang around the west coast of England and get sunk.  Which they do.  A lot.  It makes me suspect that the major emphasis for the game was on land combat and naval was not addressed properly.4.  Allies.  In HOI2 getting allies to fight for or with you was easy.  They often sent you units, and there was an option for you to take over their entire armed forces.  In HOI3 that option doesn't exist.  And they don't send you units.   You have to 'set objectives' to get the allies to work with you.  These objectives don't really work.  So, when playing as Britain, Canada keeps its air force and navy and army in Canada.  When you urgently need Canadian fighters to defend your airspace and Canadian destroyers to patrol the Atlantic, they won't budge.  There is no way to unify command, so you don't fight as allies but merely as participants in a global war where you aren't fighting each other.  It's poor.5.  Crashes.  Oh my goodness, the game's unreliability is terrible.  It crashes to desktop the whole time.   To minimise the inconvenience of losing my game progress I set it to autosave every game week, which is the most frequent autosave setting.  However, if you are in the middle of a huge amount of preparation for your forces (reorganising your divisions for example) the game might crash.  This has happened a couple of times to me, where I've been playing as Soviets and have been engaged in a major reorganisation of my 300+ divisions, and the game has just crashed to the desktop, and of course the autosave hasn't kicked in because I'm not progressing time through the game.  HOI2 never did this, and it's by far the most infuriating feature of the game.6.  Graphics and Interface.  It's cluttered and it's illogical and it's poorly laid out and it's not designed to work on higher resolution settings.  It's a bloody mess.  And let's talk about the little pictures for each unit that appears in the research window and the production window.  Apparently it was too much effort for the devs to dig out the pictures of the units that they used in HOI2.  As a result far too many units, which had the correct photo in the previous game, have a 'stock' photo in this game.There are historical oddities, too, ones which ought to have stood out like a sore thumb.  It is now possible to build (assuming you have the IC) lots of provincial AA without expending any manpower.  Who's manning all those guns?  Historically Nazi Germany had to commit a million men to defending their homeland from bombers, and that was a drain on manpower.  In HOI3, they don't have to.  They had to in HOI2.I could live with the game if it was new.  If it had been out for a couple of months I'd say ""Well, every game ships with bugs so I can live with it for now.""  But this isn't a new game, it's been out for years, and instead of fixing the very serious reliability bugs, and instead of sticking in a few dozen stock photos, Paradox decided that an urgent priority was some 3D counters which they could charge extra money for.  It's not good enough.I can't recommend this game.  If it was claiming to be a beer-and-crisps wargame I could overlook its historical inaccuracy.  It's claiming to be a very accurate game, and it isn't.  It's not accurate enough for a historical wargame, it's not fun enough for a 'quick dip in and have some fun' wargame.  It's too unreliable to be any kind of game at all. "

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING. this is the most comprehensive, most complete game I've seen in any gernre. It's definitely the type of game you need to invest time into learning. There is a deep learning curve but once you get a feel for the game, it makes sense why its so difficult to learn, because it basically lets you control almost anything. The game dynamics are amazing and very complicated but then again, so is global warfare. There is a great community of devoted HOI3 players who have answered literally every question related to this game so if you get it and find yourself not understanding the game dynamics, such as the supply situation, you can easily go online and read up on it. The supply dynamics, while sometimes buggy, is one of my favorite aspects of the game. If you're invading Western france, make sure to get large ports and not to outpace your supplies, less you fall victim to an axis counter attack that finds your front undersupplied and pushes them back in chaos. I like how the game manages the organization of the troops, both in terms of command structure and in terms of the org of the specifc unit. If they're under supplied or disorganized, they'll fail in an attack and soon you'll find the enemy routing you across the continent. It really takes a great deal of practice and patience to mount the correct offensive. You get a sense for how underprepared offensives can go awry in a second, especially when playing as Germany and trying to raise through the Soviet Union. You might get within 2 provinces of Moscow before you realize that you're supply lines havent caught up (because you didnt research the techs you needed) and then the Soviets counter attack with inferior forces and you have to scramble to recover. Thats the fun of the game though. You can prepare all you want but if things dont work out the way you planned, you often have to plan on the fly. I played as the Soviet Union and thought I was perfectly set up to protect the mother land against the germans but got my but handed to me three ways to leningrad. It was the game of my life, reorganizing and launching desperate and doomed counter attacks to slow down the germans while I get more troops ready. It's very interesting because when you play as the Soviets you get the impression that the germans better conquer you within a year, because if they dont, you can create about 10 infantry divisions a month and thats a pace the Germans can't ever sustain. Anyways, this game is amazing. You can play as anyone, Brazil for example, and work just to contribute a tiny amount to the war effort. Or you can play as the US and let Europe be while you focus on hunting and eliminating Japanese carrier groups that you know they can't replace the way the US can. Nimitz, Halsey and Spruance to the rescue! If you like strategy and grand warfare, give this game a try, If you take the time to learn it and you understand what kind of game you are buying, you will not be disappointed!			"

The King of Grand StrategyMost of you who visit the shop-page for Hearts of Iron III probably already know what this game is all about. It's a hardcore (as hardcore as it can get, actually!) Grand Strategy Game by Paradox Interactive. That one sentence really says it all.This review is intended for those who don't yet know what Grand Strategy (the capitals are there with a purpose!) is all about. Simply put: Grand Strategy games are the best, but also the most complex,  pc gaming has to offer. They are immersive, complex, and very addictive. They are not for everyone, that's for sure. You don't play them for the graphics, nor for the sounds or some great level-design, but only for the gameplay, which can also be very, very difficult to master. There are tons of stats, of units and/or provinces to be controlled and only one person who has the power to control them: you.Let's take Hearts of Iron III as an example. Untill less than a year ago, I was convinced that this kind of games was nothing for me. Too difficult, too one-sided, yoo much of an effort to learn playing it; I had lots of reasons not to delve into them. That's untill my son convinved me to at least have shot at this one. I gave it a try, but stopped playing after an hour of so. I couldn't make anything out of all the numbers and stats on the screen, and the static map where nothing seemed to happen except for the slow advancing of the time. Then I read a superb guide made by the famous HOI3-community. It took me over a month to study guide and game (and it was really studying, not even really playing), but then I was hooked. You see: it literally takes effort and even study to get into this game, but once you've done that, the effort more than pays off, and you can start guiding your nation to victory, survival or downright defeat during the crucial period 1936-1948.HOI3 lets you play ANY of the nations in the world, starting on 1/1/1936 and going into World War II (or avoiding it by following a more peaceful path). It's a tough challenge because you have to manage all aspects of government, economics, technological research and military, but once you see your nation flourishing, the reward is enthralling. The amount of management needed to succeed is staggering: you'll spend most of your time playing HOI3 by looking at screens full of statistics, numbers and tech trees, but once you realize that you can really have an influence on how all of these evolve by making the right decisions, it feels like being in command of something very complex.Just give it a try if you feel it's ok to have to study a game in order to be able to enjoy it; the rewards will be there for sure. Very important: do get the expansion packs Semper Fi, For the Motherland and Their Finest Hour as well (all three needed). They really improve upon game mechanics and are needed if you decide to give one of the many, many available mods a try.Gameplay: 28/30Graphics: 14/20 (they do the job more than decently, but could have been a bit more engrossing)Sound: 7/10 (playlist is great!)Gameplay for your money: 18/20 (multiplayer is a technical disaster, but SP can keep you going for years)Technical/stability: 8/10 (after lots of bug-problems, it's now fairly stable, but MP is really difficult to set up)Personal feel: 10/10 (just love this one)Overall: 85/100			"

												This game is something for you if you are interested in history and strategy and have patience to ""learn"" how the game works.Graphics are minimalistic and the musical score is ok.But the true potential is the freedom this game offers you.You can pick a nation beginning as early as 1936 and start to pave your way to world domination/liberation.Through the game there are some scripted historic events that trigger some opportunities, but without pushing you too much in one direction. You have A LOT of ways to influence other nations and can slowly change their attidute towards you and other states.The research option is plentiful and each mayor nation has some different ""Wunderwaffen"", but no ""I-win"" units.You have a LOT of resourcess and units to manage in realtime and sometimes it gets annoying to adjust silders back and forth and micromanage the commanders of you million-man strong army, but once you know the drill it´s done quickly.But the real deal is the fact that YOU are writing an alternate history as you play. In this game you can really explore all the possibilities of what if...What if Hitler hadn´t attacked the Sowjet Union before conquering Great Britain?What if France had not collapsed so quickly in 1940 and stopped the Blitz?What if the USA had joined the war much earlier than December 1941?It´s all in your hands! Most historic strategy games drop you on a (often small) map and say: Reach that mission-objective with these units.Here the whole world is your map and it´s up to you with what units you go where.The main flaw is that you have to invest a LOT of time before you really understand how the game mechanics work.The in-game tutorial is meh and as minmalistic as the graphic...I watched several let´s play's and read a lot of Wiki-info on the game before I knew how to get the Panzers rolling.This game is for you if you always wanted to life out your megalomanic world domination fantasys without limitation and have the nerve to learn a lot of stuff before you can get the game going.

												This game lets you play as any country during World War 2. I played the base game plus all expansions (SF, FtM, TFH).You can manage every aspect of the war, from diplomacy to espionage to research to actual combat. You can even try to stay neutral and sit out the fighting if you want, but what fun would that be?There is an enormous amount of complexity - casual gamers beware! If one part of the war is too tedious for you, it can be set to be automated. For example, rather than personally overseeing every trade deal you can check a box and let the computer handle all of your trades. The computer is not as smart as a person and it can't metagame but in most tasks it does an adequate job.Personally, I'm a WW2 history buff and I love to wrap my head around complex rule systems, so this was right up my alley. This is one of the few games I've played where I wrote out multiple pages of notes to plan my strategy.For my first game I decided to play as Canada, which is a good beginner choice because you're safe from imminent invasion and have a decent (not overwhelming) amount of resources to play with. Just like history I joined the Allies. I sent troops to help France, getting my first taste of combat. I lost of course, but learned a lot and even got to stage my own hectic Dunkirk evacuation to get my battered troops out of harm's way. Later my rebuilt forces kicked the Italians out of Africa and captured Sicily. An amphibious invasion of mainland Italy failed, but when my British allies successfully invaded Nazi-occupied Greece I joined them and had great fun. By 1944 the Soviets had overrun most of northern Europe, with the western allies in control of the Balkans and Africa. I quit at that point, since finishing the war against Japan was a naval battle and most of my fleet had been sunk.Next I decided to play a totally ahistorical game. I chose Brazil and decided to ignore WW2 and try to conquer South America. I built a huge army of militia and other low-quality bullet fodder, successfully overwhelming my neighbors through sheer numbers. Alas, my flagrant violations of the Monroe Doctrine had attracted the wrath of the powerful USA. Shortly after I captured the Panama canal the Americans arrived in force and their tanks proceeded to pulverize my hapless militia. Still, it was fun, and I learned about the importance of anti-tank weapons and combined arms.My next game came about while fooling around with the espionage tools. As Germany I helped the national socialists win the 1937 election in the Netherlands. It was a huge electoral upset, sweeping away the liberal democracy and replacing it with a totalitarian state. Accusations of fraud and vote rigging were completely unfounded (tee-hee!). I thought, wow, this is so cool, I just changed a government! But the only thing cooler would be to actually play as this new government. So I saved the game and rejoined it as the new extremist Netherlands. I joined the Axis, but refused to join Germany in declaring war on the UK or Soviet Union. Instead I conquered a bunch of neutral nations, and acted essentially as a resource ""banker"" for the Axis faction, as the Axis powers are resource-starved in the mid to late game. What fun!I've played many other games but the stories are too numerous to repeat. I'll just say if you like military strategy you're in for a treat!I have a few criticisms. Despite the manual being 80 pages long, it wasn't enough. There are many things in the game which aren't well documented. HOI3 is even more complex than Civilization V, but it lacks the helpful ""Civopedia"" feature that game had to quickly look up how something works. For example, in one game I was playing as Finland and planned several years in advance to declare war on Germany and then launch an amphibious invasion of Norway. I spent considerable time (years in-game, hours in real life) building up my fleet, but when it came time to attack I found I couldn't move my ships to Norway. After much puzzling I discovered that since the Germans owned a specific province that the Danish straights were blocked to me. There was nothing in the manual about straights being blocked, and nothing on the map to illustrate that they were. So all my preparations were for naught. Lesson learned: Save often! Or better yet, set the autosave for every 6 months so if any similar nasty surprises happen you'll be prepared and maybe able to recover.My other criticism is that the supply system is dumb. For some reason ports and airfields don't stockpile supplies. So if you re-base your planes or ships to a new base you immediately run out of fuel. Even worse, all supplies are distributed from your capitol. So if you're playing as the USA don't be surprised when your troops in California start starving to death because their supplies are inexplicably drawn all the way from Washington DC (and each province the supplies go through results in a supply tax). I would think the solution to this problem would be to create supply dumps at appropriate locations. Unfortunately Paradox's solution to the problem was to create an ""Arcade mode,"" an optional mode in which all supplies magically appear wherever they need to be all the time. But this just creates new problems because a big part of the military strategy is about cutting off enemy forces from their supplies, using bombers to shred their logistics, ect. With arcade mode you lose all of that, so I ended up sticking with the default supply system despite its flaws.Overall I recommend this game to WW2 history buffs and military strategists. Casual gamers should stay away though.			"

												Decide to try and hold of the Fascist Juggernaut as Greece. Build up a respectable military to hold the boarder, War begins and I wait for Germany to roll up Yugoslavia. theenemyhasarrived.jpg. I hold the boarder and wait for British reinforcements. Italy Lands troops in the south. I have nothing to stop them. Italy Annexes me in 4 days. 12/10 would waste an hour preparing for failure again.EDIT: People seem to have actually seen my review so I may as well post some useful information in it.Pros--Almost unlimited replayability (Almost everything you can think of doing is possible, Fascist America is always fun. Making Sweden conquer all of Europe is equally fun.)-Learning curve is brutal and unforgiving but is very rewarding to master.-Fun to play with friends online. (You can create some truely strange situations with the help of friends, my Estonian Baltic Empire for example, having taken most of Northern Europe and Scandinavia.)Cons--Its a reasource hog in the later parts of the game, once millions of men are being deployed across the globe. Say goodbye to your RAM.-Rather bland research trees. There is tonnes to research and different nations have different units and weapons to research but in the end its all just numbers and stats, all the nations are essentially the same.-Can be bug riddled depending on if you buy DLC or not, Patches are contained within the DLC so if you want to get a better, more stable game you need to buy DLC.This game does require a lot of time to learn all the mechanics and systems but (personally) is highly rewarding once you do so. If you can't be bothered to do that, there are plenty of cheats in the game to enable you to do some completely insane stuff (I personally took over the world as New Zealand) All in all, its a great game, not much else like it on the market other than other Paradox games, which I would highly recommend as well.

Sophisticated & immersive // Recommended for intense micromanagers+ Huge selection of nations to choose from; each have historically faithful features and statistics+ Map is meticulously detailed; it may look somewhat sparse at first, but when zooming in the detail fills the space+ Notations can be made upon the map; this is a massive quality of life feature, and it becomes integral when planning offensives and operations+ Myriad map layers and filters available; this works with the other features of the map to make for planning troop movements and developments down to the tiniest detail+ Diplomacy is robust and detailed; one of the easier features to get a knack for, and meshes eloquently+ Period-appropriate soundtrack; works very well with the game in that it fades into the background comfortably and doesn't distract form the gameplay or player's concentration+ Research, like the other aspects of this title, is staggering in its depth+ Building and deploying troops offers a massive pool of information, and units can be custom-designed to work as the player intends- Tutorial is a slog to get through, and doesn't do well to help the information sink in- Massive learning curve, largely due to the length one must go to in order to sift through so much detailed materialLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Despite a terrible launch, Hearts of Iron III has taken the throne of it's precursor(Hearts of Iron II) in WW2 stimulation.Paradox Interactive has outdone themself with the better graphics,more provinces and they still support the game, I would get the expansions though because the base game is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ without them and you could have a way better time if you would buy the expansions.Some issues are still that the AI isn't the best it could be and that it can also be shallow sometimes in history/realism, But it is already hard to get into the gameplay due to alot of factors and numbers playing a factor in how to build your armies/nation etc.Great modding community though like all paradox games but I wouldn't get into this game if you are not going to spend alot of time on it since it has a learning curve that can be quite steep.Great WW2 stimulation game with some minor flaws but a great game that if you can get into can get you alot of hours of gameplay.

												Decided to make Poland stronk and stop German invasion in 1939. Needed more IC so invaded Romania and Bulgaria. Made the smart decision to become Communist and hopefully get help from Soviet Union to stop the germans. By 39 I still wasn't totally ready, so when Germany demanded Danzig, I gave it away. 2 months later I was ready, and waited for the invasion that never came. Germany invaded France, and I saw a gold opportunity to attack while they were occupied. Invaded Germany, but Slovakia and Hungary were able to hold me until Germany was ready to counter-attack. The Germans came and handed my♥♥♥♥♥to me, while the Soviets only watched from a distance.11/10 Would feel betrayed by the Soviets that never helped me, again.			"

												Rating: 9/10Hearts of Iron III is a real-time grand strategy and operational tactics game set during the Second World War. All aspects of warfare at the divisional scale upwards are represented, including military command structures, military appointments, economics, production, international trade, logistics, espionage, military research, legal polices, and political appointments. Players can (and should) automate as much of the game as they wish, and the friendly AI is very good at handling routine tasks and reducing micromanagement.The sheer scale of this game can be overwhelming at first. You can play as any nation and even avoid participating in world wars altogether. You can start a small scale regional war to advance your nation's expansionist interests whilst the rest of the world is distracted by the threat of even greater wars, such as the first half of the Second Sino-Japanese War before the bombing of Pearl Harbour. This period in history centres around total war, or the use of all the state's resources towards warfare and some countries will find it incredibly difficult to avoid being engulfed in the Second World War.Admittedly, it's a hard game to love at first. The music score is mediocre, and the UI offers so much information players won't know on what to focus. To make matters worse, both the tutorial and manual are useless. Luckily, there's an excellent video series by Michael Broschek covering everything you need (YouTube). I strongly recommend you watch this tutorial series. Afterwards, the UI becomes very easy to navigate and you'll know what and how to automate using the AI, making gameplay a breeze without losing control.The command structure for land units is a unique feature of this game and I haven't found anything else like it. Once you've mastered them they become incredibly powerful tools for automation. Largely static lines of defence and slowly advancing attack can be reliably handled by the AI, whilst you can focus your attention on the main thrust. Military units at the lowest level are brigades organised into divisions. Divisions can then be attached to corps, corps to army, and armies to army groups. Having different levels of command grant powerful bonuses. Depending on which general you assign to a division, there are additional bonuses or downsides. However, you must remain within the command range of each respective command level in order to gain those bonuses or units will lose cohesion. Navies and air forces are much easier to handle, due to how their command structures operate differently.There's endless replayability within the standard game, but for those wanting more it's essential that you shop around for some of the user made modifications. There are literally dozens of top quality mods on the developer forums (Paradox Plaza[forum.paradoxplaza.com]), though you'll need to create a free account in order to access it. The standard game provides a good challenge at the hardest difficulty level, but allows for unrealistically easy and effective Blitzkrieg-style tactics. In my opinion, the best realism mod right now is the Iron Cross Edition, or BlackICE (Paradox Plaza Thread[forum.paradoxplaza.com]). It's intended for those looking for a realistic and incredibly difficult challenge, and is meant to be played at the hardest difficulty setting.			"

												If you are looking for a complex WW2 strategic simulator this is your game! The game takes place between 1936 and 1948 and you can control any nation during this period and attempt to forge an empire whilst the world is at war. The complexity of the productive, technological and combat system is very high. The logistic system, especially,is more important and more detailed than in many other games. These all work to the game's advantage, since they make for a very good experience for players that want to deal with things complex and not just ""produce units and rush"". Terrain, weather, organization,morale, how many officers you have, who's in charge of what division/corps etc, means a lot in this game, and this will probably please more experience players looking for a challenge.And of course like other Paradox games, it has a a bit long learning curve.

This is worth every penny and more.			"

												So far, the most complex and the most difficult to learn global strategy game about the World War 2. Choose some (any of known at moment) country, and prepare it to the unevitable bloodbath. You may not be the one who'll start it, but in any scenario you'll have to deal with it somehow. Generally - by warfare means, as this series, unlike some other Paradox games, is certainly lacking proper diplomacy. However, there are spies, who alone can provide quite a challenging game on their own! I am so missing them when playing Hearts of Iron 4 now...So, you run a country, choosing what you'll be producing and researching, what allies you'll pick, and what goals you're hoping to achieve at the aftermath. You preparing grunts - providing them with technically advanced weaponry, making drills - and then sending them to death. To make sure the score will be at your benefit, you gotta learn many details of operating the armies, and, the most, the logistics. Logistics! It can burn minds, but, if you'll master it, you are ready to pass the exams at your local HQ school. Which seems a nice achievement for me.However, to answer a general question, if the game is worth buying... I don't think so. Especially if you're new to Paradox strategies. There are too much info to master, and too little in-game measures to ease the pain. Tutorial is just a cameo for Shekelgruber, who seems to be one of the gamedev's favourites. And what Adolf can teach you? Yeah, nothing good. There are, of course, some helpful youtubers, who are willing to get you going... But even with them, HoI 3 is basically a nerd's stuff. If your general field of expertise is shooters and racing games like NFS, I seriously doubt that's the game you need to buy. I'm tired of reading all those stupid negative ""reviews"", where people blaming HoI 3 for being too difficult for them. I agree, it's hard to learn, and there are some questionable mechanics like using of artillery or air/naval forces... and diplomacy is far from perfect as well... and interface is so lame... and dlc's are total crud, basically...The list of negative features is much longer, but, all in all, Hearts of Iron 3 is still a biggest and arguable the best strategy on the given history period. And it's rivals are - Hearts of Iron 2 and 4! 2nd is so good, but so old, that not every PC will manage to run it. And the 4th is much more oriented on multiplayer, than on single-play. So if you look for really deep game with thousands of outcomes and countless possibilities for replaying - that's the right stuff. Just come prepared and don't whine about, if it's too complex for you.My mark 8.5/10.			"

												If you don't have a very strong rig to support HoI4 and play it properly, you should definitely try HoI3. Since my review comes this late, I'll try to give a few pointers why this would still be relevant to play now that HoI4 is out (single player mode) and also give my impressions, as I remembered from when I played the game. Why is it still relevant?The order of battle in HoI3 is the most immersive part of the experience. The new version doesn't have anything similar and being able to assign commanders all the way down to the level of army corp makes you feel like the actual strategist in charge of the army. The generals available are alter-egos of generals that commanded armies during the actual WW2 and they even have actual portraits, not an artistic icon. In the new game, you only add the chief of any single army group, no matter how large it is. You're allowed to disperse the divisions to whatever theatre with no repercussions and in general organising your troops on the frontline is broken in the new game (at least as it is in v1.1.0). You don't get a large pool of generals to use, as you did in HoI3. The battle system is just as easily exploitable in HoI4 as it is in HoI3, so why not play the more immersive version? Unfortunately, the new one brings a superior production system, which is also a good spin imo. Air planning is strictly better and also more immersive in HoI3. You can specify a cone, a sphere or region(s) that a squadron should cover and it can be customised to as far as the range of the aircrafts permits. Unlike in HoI4, you can make sure that your aircraft engage the enemy only in the areas that are relevant to your plans. It's not very intuitive, but once you get the hang of it, you won't want anything less.Ultimately, the best part about HoI3 was the learning curve for me. It is good that HoI4 made things more intuitive, especially for returning Paradoxians, but the learning process was part of the experience for me in HoI3 and that's cool. This includes game mechanics and how battles unfold and how to organise your army tree properly to maximize your chances, which will make you wonder about similarities to real life. If you're a new player to the HoI series and think you'll want some explanations and tutorials, you simply have more for HoI3 and they're better, so again this will be your #1 option, imo. Actual things about the gameLots of stuff are broken. Performance wise, it works well for me (even on a laptop), but there are plenty bugs still. Planning your divisions and triggering various manoeuvres are so immersive that it makes all issues fade away. The Ai is not very good, but this won't be obvious in your first playthroughs. You have multiple areas that you'll have to pay attention to in order to do well. One single game can take tens-hundreds of hours, but if you focus you can move through at a faster pace, if you must. But I didn't, the micromanagement is too tempting in HoI3.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is, literally, the most complex strategy game ever developed. Created by Paradox Interactive, the game starts in January 1936 with your selected nation from the Allied or Axis, and win dominations of your choosing. Want to play Germany? Go ahead and research technology before everybody else and invade nations before they can stand a chance. Play as the United States? Declare war against Japan before they can strike against your interests and prevent them from dominating Asia before Japan can even start conquering them. These scenarios are one of the very few that has an endless of possibilities, bringing up the replay value with maximum outcome. What surprises me the most is how complex the game is, like diplomacy, research, production, and a whole lot of other factors that you can think of for a strategy game. Regardless of the game's strong presentation, Hearts of Iron III has its flaws...particuarly of game crashes, little patches that brings little outcome, and a very steep learning curve with a failure of basic tutorials that cannot teach or instruct well. In addition, the game is ONLY recommended to those who are interested in general history, military history, political science, and/or in social sciences. Reason is mainly because many gamers are not interested in these subjects and the game only appeals to small audience (mentioned in the previous sentence). It is not a discouragment, but an understanding of how tolerant that you are willing to play the game since the main gameplay element is seeing ""boxes"" move around the global map with a strong emphasis on military tactics, like coordinating strategy in a military map. I would not be surprised if anyone would say the game sucks because of ignorance and expect a lot of action (because of the stupidity of the Call of Duty generation). Again, this game is NOT for everyone and those who actually play a good amount of othe strategy games like Total War series, this game is very different from the others. If you are actually interested in the game, I strongly suggest for you to watch Youtube videos on the gameplay to see if it is suitable to your game interest. If not, then it is not for you. Only recommendation is for gamers with strong interests in social sciences and military.			"

												Excellent game. I have played over 1500 hours (other account) and can say that this is my favourite game on steam. Basically, you choose a nation in the world and begin in 1936, preparing for the World War. Wisely choose the units you produce and deploy in order to achieve your victory. Beware of manpower as it can be your best friend, or your worst enemy. Use Technology to research up-to-date technologies to improve your industries, army, navy and air force. Politics will enable you to enact new laws and replace ministers in order to create your desired backbench. Intelligence will allow you to gain an advantage over your opponents. But beware, as spies are always watching. The AI in the game is probably the only thing I would criticize, but then again why wouldn't you want to control an entire nation by hand? Performing encirclements is probably the most satisfying thing about the game. Barbarossa is always intriguing and exciting. Many would simply play as a major nation, but don't forget the minors who play a large factor in the war. Hold the Southern Flank as Romania or attempt to defend against the Japanese as the Phillipines, there is always a new nation to play.Join a faction or attempt world domination, it is your choice.

The gameplay is deep; running through a year of wartime often requires dropping the speed several steps. Taking care to keep forces equipped with the latest weaponry and in supply range is difficult, but nowhere near impossible; if anything, it's almost pleasing to be both general and logistician.The real issue, however, is stability. It's rare to be able to complete a whole game in one sitting, even as a neutral power that never gets involved in a war. Particularly when playing a major power, the game is unstable and prone to crashing. Monthly autosaves alleviate some of the frustration, but long load-times compound the problem and rob it of some of the entertainment value. The fun is bulletproof, but only so long as it remains stable. Crusader Kings II might prove to be a better option for someone looking for a general strategy game; Hearts of Iron IV is listed as in-development, so I might consider that a better option if it turns out to be stable.

												There's no doubt that this is an incredibly complex game and a fair degree of perseverance alongside trial and error is required to gain a proper grasp of the 'in and outs' of it so to speak. None-the-less once the game mechanics have been learned HOI 3 provides fantastically enticing gameplay, with enough historical units and generals to make a history lover weep, and only gets more fun with repeat playthroughs!

												Great game, no grand strategy game has held my attention quite as good as this one. From managing your orders of battle to making sure front lines are secure to ensuring entire theaters are operating at full capacity to managing economies and entire countries, this game has quite the scale and an easy learning curve with high skill cap. You can ease into the gameplay by enabling AI control of certain aspects and slowly disable AI as you feel more comfortable. The general theme can get boring as a lot of stuff is scripted for the campaign, however you can break out of the scripts sandbox by just not following some historical paths.There are plenty of mods for the game that go from realism, content, a-historical to complete fantasy,My personal favorite mod would be the RandomHoi mod that places random nations all around the world.10/10 would buy.

												Coming back to this from HOI 4 makes me really appriciate this game a whole lot more. There is something about it that feels dense, real and engaging. Not like a video game or a simulator but a real experience. Similar feeling towards the ARMA series. I have more memories of this game than I do most, which is odd... The failed landings on Ireland, the communist take over of the Americas and the Portuguese conquest of South America, all are very real in my head. I play other games and all of  those experiences just mush together into a compact ball of video gamey fun. Which is fine and all ,but I don't remember them so well. You have to love history to play history. "

												One of the most engrossing games I've ever played. It's fantastic. I've seen other reviews that say there is too much complexity and micromanagement, but I love it. I think you've just got to commit to it and it becomes clear after a few hours (or less). It's not as simple as Hearts of Iron 4, but you're able to do more with it. I've sunk so much time into this game, it might be my absolute favorite. It plays like a few different games as well. Play as Germany and you've got your hands on just about everything and a game could take you many, many hours. Play as a little guy like Romania and you've not got a lot to do, but maybe you can influence the outcome of World War 2 if you're careful and clever. It's wonderful. I love Hearts of Iron 4, but I'm starting up another campaign in 3 today, I think.			"

												While i like the game very much, i cannot recommend it while it is unplayable. And since they moved on to the next game in the HOI series, i doubt it will ever get fixed. It crashes constantly and there is a fix, supposedly, hidden somewhere on the HOI paradox forums. After a day's work, i just want to play something and relax, not to start fixing games that should have been working from the moment they have been released. This game is on steam since Aug 2009. It's 2015, the issue that causes the game to crash is well known and yet they did not fix it in a patch. You should fix it yourself, because they already got your money and they don't care anymore. You'll buy HOI4 anyway.I just regret purchasing all the dlcs at the same time with the game. I should have made sure it works well before spending more on it. I found out the hard way, that with paradox games, it's usually a gamble. When they work tho, they're awesome.			"

												Ah another World War II real time strategy game? What could this one have in store? Lets find out! Get your Comrades together, grab your commander's baton, and put on a monocle! Were gonna take over the world!Pros:+ Amazing Detail in the combat, some of which I've yet to understand even to this day!+ Great Soundtrack, it really sets in the mood that the world is at war and that you're fighting for a big cause.+ The AI is pretty intelligent, I mean its not unfair amounts but its atleast self aware... unlike other games.+ Each nation can play a part in the war, even small countries like Bulgaria, Denmark, Belgium, ect.+ You can change history in many different ways, making this game a playground of new alternate scenerios.+ National and Global events give you multiple choices that impact the world and history it self! Choose wisely commander!+ You can sit down and create your own battleplans; now hear me out... what if I told you that sitting down drawing arrows and lines in this game can some how... boost the fun? I know I know, its weird right? Well you can draw out strategic battle plans across the many nations and continents for your amusment and of course strategy.Neutral:/ Creating armies and going through the logistics is tedious and often VERY hard to micro manage but on the flip side it feels SO good to sit in the boots of a real Commander's job of working with the huge military forces of WWII./ The Military Research is bland you go from ""Infantry I"" to ""Infantry II"" and so and so on. However its easy to understand and grasp, so its not exactly all bad.Cons: - DLC out the rear end, I could understand like... one big pack for the Sprites and multiple for the bigger DLCs but the Sprite Packs are all seperate for different nations such as Germany, America, Italy, Russia, ect. Which is ridiculous.- Diplomacy is a joke; Diplomacy is useless unless you're allied or friendly with the nation you're speaking to its practically a waste to even use it as most responses otherwise are ""No"" even if you present a gift.- Politics is also similiarly a joke; politics boils down to one of two things, you're either replacing ministers to give better stats, or you're creating puppets/liberating puppets. Thats it, no massive change to certain ideologies or anything.- Naval and Air combat is a bit lack luster, nothing is really gained nor is there a sense of urgency when using the navy or airforce.- Some nations are ungodly powerful two that come to mind are the US and Germany; don't get me wrong both were super powers but they seem unrealistically buffed and over powered; for nation that suffered greatly under the great depression.DLC Specific Parts:Pros:+ Their Finest Hour's additions are quite great with the Custom Mode being my favorite; you can litterally rebuild a nation from the ground up as you see fit!+ New units and abilities! Fun Fun Fun.Neutral:/ Some of the content from ""For the Motherland"" and ""Semper Fi"" I don't even use often, but the abilities are there I suppose.Cons:-♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of Skin packs that really don't add that much to the game.- They could've just bundled Semper Fi, For the Motherland, and Their Finest HourConclusion:I love Hearts of Iron III, great game for the Commander in you! I give it a 7/10 without DLC and with all major DLCs a 9/10. Its just simply a game any WWII History Buff or hardened RTS Commander needs.			"

												I just started getting into the Paradox games, but I'm not new to strategy games by any means. I've only played HoI3 for about 9 hours, but it is already one of my favorites. This game is centered around the war aspect of strategy, while the other Paradox game Victoria 2 (another really good one) is more centered around the economic aspect of strategy.So I'm still on my first campaign and of course I picked Germany because I knew it would be the most fun. I started in the year 1936 and I've just conquered Poland and am about to take France with the ""Fall of France"" Decision. I am going for the historically-accurate game on my first playthrough and it is turning out very well.I very much recommend you read the manual and look at the Noob's Tutorial series of video's that can be found on Youtube. There's about 13 videos that cover basically everything you need to know to get playing. The only thing it doesn't really get into is in-depth strategies, but if you are a strategy game veteran then you will be just fine. The built-in tutorial on the game is only good to get familiar with the game's interface in the most basic way possible and isn't very helpful. I recommend doing the built-in tutorial, then read the manual, then watch the Noob Tutorial video series, in that order.I highly recommend this game!!!Also, I should add that you shouldn't hestitate to let the AI take over some aspects of the game for you. You don't need to micromanage absolutely everything, although in important situations feel free to. The AI does a good job at whatever it is tasked with.UPDATE: I feel like adding more now that I've gone through quite a bit of my first campaign, though I'm not done yet.  Some things I've noticed from playing and from mistakes I've made:- Every country starts out with a different amount of different resources and a different amount of income of those resources. For instance, Germany starts out having a lot of energy and they also receive about 300 income of energy per day.Some other of their resources they start out by having quite a bit of, but have a negative income. Therefore, trade away that energy for other resources you need. If you plan on gonig to war with a country, then don't trade with them if they ask because they are your future enemy. Don't help them out.- In the beginning. depending on the choices you make, you probably won't be gonig to war for a few years. As Germany, I'm trying to play very historically accurate, so war started in 1939. Spend you Leadership points on basically only technology and don't spend production on upgrades or reinforcements until war starts looming around the corner. This will help you get a headstart on tech and production knowledge points early on.- Make sure to bolster your infantry with artillery, engineers, and other support units for maximum effectiveness of your military divisions on the front.- Make sure to have a decent stockpile of supplies (for the whole military) and fuel (for tanks and airplanes) on hand before war starts. War drains these supplies quicker because your guys are moving around and fighting and what not. Also, know that fighting a two-front war will drain supplies and fuel much quicker than a one-front war, so be prepared for this with a large stockpile before war starts.- When you build new military divisions and brigades, make sure to attach a General to them. I forgot to do this in the beginning when I started.- Also, probably most importantly, go in with a strategy. What I mean is, don't overspecialize or overgeneralize your military. Having a focus on too many different units (what I did since I was giddy about building everything) spreads your production knowledge points and tech levels too thin. At the same time though, going only with infantry isn't going to work very well either. Maybe have a larger focus of light infantry/medium tanks for land, strategic bomber planes for air, and light cruise ships (to protect convoys) and battleships (for fighting) for the sea. Or maybe you could focus on rocket technology and nuclear technology with a smaller fighting force. It all depends on what you want, but have a defined strategy that isn't too broad nor too thin.Your first playthrough you might make some mistakes, but you will learn from them. Hopefully this helps some people get into the game.			"

War doesn't determine who is right, only who is left. In Hearts of Iron III that could be anyone! This game is very frightening at first, as the tutorials in the game doesn't care for a new player as myself. So quite some time is needed to be spent on viewing tutorial videos on FailTube. And even those forget to tell you the basic things you need to get started. Also the UI* isn't exactly friendly to begin with! A better paradox than this I don't believe exists, Hearts of Iron III being the most advanced strategy game I've played, with the lousiest tutorials** I've encountered in a great while... Thus the name Paradox Interactive perhaps? You who played Axis and Allies will see similarities because Hearts of Iron III is AAA on steroids. There are some things I don't like with the game because it is very strict on terms of history. Even if you assist Finland in pushing out the Russians during the Winter war, the truce is written and Finland lose what was lost. So basically playing the non major powers seems a little off. Hearts of Iron III is focused on land combat, with order of battle for the armies, but it doesn't have a similar hierarchy for the navy or air force, which I feel very strange. Despite this I won't look at other strategy games the same way again because this has it all! You have to make up a strategy for how you will spend your resources in the most efficient way, what units you can and can't build, what technology you need to prioritise.*** You have to think carefully of how you place your units during and setup of combat so you don't get encircled and get your resource lines cut off. Hearts of Iron III has some advanced combat rules which can either win or lose you the conflict.The trade system makes sense with prices being depending on what relation you have to the nation you're trading with. Politicians are stupid as usual with moronic traits such as ""-5% money"". Some other politicians have good traits, but you can't really form your government the way you want as you're not playing as a politician.I'm happy that I took the time to learn how to play this game and when I did get into it I was possessed by Gustav II Adolf, and that's where I am now, hell bent on reacquiring lost territory... Oh and yes, this game is very addicting. ------------------------Second thoughts.Even tho' I recommend this game there are some things which you should consider.It's old, so it doesn't work on newer computers with graphic glitches, lag and CTDs.(Paradox Interactive requires you to register the game on their site to get their technical support site. But I'm not sending my CD-key onto a site without SSL)The AI is incredibly stupid when it attacks, you have to control every aspect of combat with the ""attack/defend here"" thing, which is tedious...The Russians have dive bombers with unlitmited range...213 hours as of today was mostly fun, but too frustrating in the end.* Before I realised how to select some and not all units from a stack I spent hours arranging my armies. ** Then again I remember a time 17 or so years ago where you had to turn the manual inside out to understand how to use the manual. Time has changed, but not at Paradox Interactive. *** This is especially vital if you play minor countries such as I did.			"

												A decent WW II simulation. It's a little quirky and takes a while to figure out, but offers a pretty comprehensive platform at a reasonable price point. There is a lot of DLC for this, most of it is just eye candy. Three are 3 functional upgrades that enhance and modify game play. I'd recommend upgrading to the ""For The Motherland"" version and skipping all the sprite packs. If you like long boring strategy war games ? This is about as good as it gets. Better than the current - HOA 4 - version.			"

I've a new Windows 8.1 laptop with all the drivers etc. up-to-date and tried re-installing HOI3, but that didn't help. There are some workarounds floating around on the forums, pointing to a non-existing paradox forum, so I wasn't able to test them. In the act of desperation (I want to play this game badly) I just bought it from gog.com (as they list Windows 8 as supported) and surprise surprise - so far so good, it hasn't crashed on me during 2 hours of play o Barbarossa.So, YES for the game, it's great. NO for the Steam version.			"

												There are two groups of people. Hardcore gamers and others. The 1st group plays Hearts of Iron III, others goes for the easy way - Hearts of Iron IV...Hearts of Iron III took basically everything from HoI2 and made it bigger. There is hell a lot more provinces on the map, hell a lot more units, u can set real chain of leadership from down to brigade up to army group assigned into theatres.Wanna recreate Operation Barbarossa with 3 german army groups going north, middle and south? Here, u can do it. Without chaotic battlelines in Hearts of Iron IV...and with Rundstedt leading Army group South and Manstein leading LVI.panzer corps or 11.army under Rundstedt. Stuff that just can´t be done in HoI IV.This game is the most complex Hearts of Iron game till now and probably ever judging from the way HoI IV took.Btw. if u wanna try HoI III, u just have to get all of the expansions - Semper Fi, For the Motherland and Their Finest Hour cause the game is so complex, it really took Paradox a long time to polish all the functions... It´s really easy now compared to when the game was released and it was unplayable for maybe 1/2 a year until they patched it several times and enhanced with at least the Semper Fi. PS: I have just few hours played here cause I have and used a boxed version of the game and that was before the ""activate on steam"" times, only recently re-bought it here with all the released enhancement stuff, which is pretty much pointless as I do play HoI games only with Counters...

												Quite a interesting Grand Stratagy game, Where you are able to play out of hundreds of countries during WW2. Tons of replay value. Had a game playing as the Soviets. Where, i was able to defeat Germany quite quickly and declare war on the Allies. Did not turn out too well and was defeated a few years later due to a lack of anti air, the brits kept bombing my factories, crippling my ability to produce more units.Great game, would recommend it to anyone.looking forward to Hearts of Iron IV			"

While it may have a few flaws here and there (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ leader management) the overall game is extremly realsitic and polished.  9/10, totally worth the learning curve and a overall thrilling, realistic, historically accurate title definitly worth picking up for any history buffalso you can be hitler			"

												Certainly one of the best strategy - war history games I have ever played in my life (Just look at the bloody hour counter!! and those are online). Very deep mechanics and too many stuff to learn, not easy but certainly not impossible. Taking away the mods, is limited when it comes to play in a sandbox way; although you have certain degree of freedom, some things just won't happen, that is in historic terms. As for technology and military focus you really are the ruler of your country: whether as Germany you start focusing on building a decent Kriegsmarine or as Japan on building tanks to send them to support you Italian ally in Africa. I think the game can suit your gamestyle depending on how much micromanagement you want to do or simply if you just want to FF the game only watching how your armies advance. Personally, I try to balance between both: invading the Soviets with Germany I prefer to go fight by fight meanwhile for crushing China with the Japs I just let it go faster or also checking from time to time how is the US fleet managing to stop the Japanese advance. Certainly a game that needs tons of time and pacience (that also still depends on your gameplay). The only major setback is the bloody problem that crashes it almost every 20 minutes almost every time, and although it is said that there is a fix on the dev's page, is not precisely the word straightfoward on how to fix it. Overall 8/10 because of that damn issue. P.S. I hope it dissapears completey  with Hoi4			"

												A capitalist North Korea and a communist USA are two examples of crazy things that you can do with any country of the planet, if you like WW2 and strategy this is your perfect combination, unlimet possibilities because you are the one who rule everything and you can do whatever you want BUT be careful with your resources with your diplomacy and basically with everything even the minor detail is important when you want to conquer the world, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I even conquered the world with canadians and with italians). But for real, this is an old game that is going to teach you that graphics in videogames don´t matter after all, people want to have fun. Also you can download and add a lot of mods, for example I´m playing the WW1 mod and is epic. In conclusion: Extremely fun game, every campaign is very long but don´t worry because you will enjoy every second of it, music is just amazing (tipical music like the one of Brothers in Arms and The Pacific) and I forgot to mention that you also can play with your friends or random people in multiplayer and is awesome. Even the DLCS are worth.Ok, stop reading my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review and just buy it.			"

												In a word: The Best WW2 simulation game out there... With that said, this game is one of the best strategy games available. It might not have the appeal of some of the other AAA titles like Starcraft but it offers insane amounts of replayability.In this game you take control of any country in the world from 1936 up until 1948 (or even further using mods, more on that in e sec) and guide it through the events of WW2. You can follow a historical path or you can carve your own path through history.Fascist USA? Check!German victory in USSR? Check!Italian superpower? Check!You can do what you want. It is that simple.That said though... It has a HUGE learning curve. Maybe the most difficult Paradox game, and that is saying something. If you are patient this game will reward you like few games can. Trial and Error is this game's moto. Can you take it on? I know I can!10/10 for Paradoxians. 8/10 for strategy gamers. Not much in offer for casual players...			"

												This might be the greatest RTS game I have played to date. And you're not doing yourself any good wasting time reading reviews when you could be playing Hearts of Iron! Although the game is complex at first, once you get the hang of it, it's extremely addictive and fun. I can compare this game to one of my favorite classic board/PC games (Risk) but obviously 10000% times more in detail. If you've ever wanted to change the course of history in the Worlds most devastating war. Or you're really into history or just WW2 this HAS to be in your collection or ELSE! Buy now! (Since this is a honest review there is another con besides the learning curve. All the units of measurement are in metric, so myself and other Americans cant really relate to the speed of objects as they dont mean anything to us.) You might be able to find a mod to replace it with Farenheit and MPH/Miles though so dont fear!			"

												The whole HOI concept is incredible.  HOI III is the best so far, but while I will give a recommendation I will also give a caution.Save constantly while playing, the game can't make it more than a month of GAME TIME before it crashes.  If Paradox were to actually fix this issue alone they would have one of the greatest strategy games ever.  Because they don't they have an excellently frustrating game.A very, very qualified recommendation...			"

												Hearts of Iron 3 is a classic! This game holds its own in every aspect and consistently intrigues me with its well thought out mechanics of war.Pros:+Historically accurate.+Actually feels like a perpetual war.+Historic events and decisions.+/-Can make the Axis win.+Graphically pleasing.+Diplomacy and Trade are nice.+Has a large fan base with lots o’ mods.Cons:-Gigantic learning curve! [1]-Some models are glitchy.1.) The learning curve in this game is ridiculous, it took me forever to figure out this game even with a well thought out walkthrough on youtube. The tutorial for the game is atrocious; it either teaches you too much or too little. The game has so many options and so many buttons that it is hard to keep track of it all. Just be prepared to not know what the hell you’re doing and get your but kicked by the US.Summary: It’s a very good game, only if you are dedicated! If you are looking for an historically accurate simulation of WW2, you came to the right place. However, if you want it to be easy and jump right into it, you might want to look elsewhere.

												Paradox is a developer whose games most people will either love or hate. Furthermore, most people who like one Paradox game seem to like most or all of them, as they are almost all different takes on the grand strategy genre. I am a fan of other Paradox games I have played, namely Hearts of Iron II and Europa Universalis IV, but I found Hearts of Iron III to be buggy and unmanagably complicated. Complicated with a capital C. For example, you'll be creating order-of-battle hierarchies that take into account things like HQ placements and radio range, micro-managing logistics and supply routes, etc. Like other Paradox games, the tutorial is woefully inadequate, but unlike other Paradox games I've tried, there just wasn't enough fun in the early stages for me to push through the steep learning curve. People say the expansions do a lot to mitigate the problems with the base game, and I don't doubt it, but if the game needs these expansions so badly, they should've been released as patches, not as paid content.If you enjoy extremely deep and realistic war games and don't mind bugs, this just might end up being one of your favorite games of all time. If you find micromanagement tedious, it probably won't be. I have spent literally hundreds of hours on Paradox games, mostly playing Darkest Hour and Europa Universalis IV with my friends, but this game just kind of left me feeling a bit overwhelmed by choice, and underwhelmed with fun.

												Well this game....It altered so much stuff from HOI2 engine that makes me play both this and Darkest hours still a lot.It is hard to decide which is better.Paradox made HOI3 not just different also on the gameplay part, but the new autonomous historical ai can make the game a little more ahistorical than the earlier games. Not saying it's bad, just different and some people may not like it.The Combat system got a lot complicated, Technologies too. But theres a catch... If you don't like any of these new features or are just starting out you can put individual parts of country into AI hands, which helps a ton if you are just learning the game.I consider the HOI series one of the hardests off the Parados titles so this game made it a lil bit easier to start I think, especially with the AI features. But I really suggest you play Darkest Hour too after seeing this game. It is a really well made HOI2 enhanced edition.Overall Score: 7/10 "

												-September 19th, 1936: Yugoslavia has annexed Albania in a 2 day war.-October 2nd, 1937: Bulgaria is the second nation to fall to Yugoslavia, after a brutal 6 month grind.-October 22nd, 1937: Spanish civil war starts and ends with a Republican victory in one day.-December 8th, 1937: Hungary falls victim to Yugoslavia's newly adopted Blitzkreig tactic, the war ends within days.-January 4th, 1938: Yugoslav troops march over the Austrian border. A major boost to industry for Yugoslavia.-April 11th, 1938: With the two new battleships in the Yugoslav fleet, CJMN Sarajevo, and CJMN Zagreb, the Yugoslavian Army, Navy, and Air Force launch a coordinated attack on all Greek VP's. Greece falls to Yugoslavia with little fighting.-December 19th, 1938: The Yugoslavian armed forces are presented with a tempting target, the lone Italy, who has not joined Germany, and relations have since deteriorated. With the initial attacks, the Italian navy lost almost, if not all of its transports, and so more than 80% of their forces were trapped in Italy's colonies. Yugoslavians overwhelm Italian forces, and so, the Mediterranean  sea is almost mastered.-September 1st, 1939: Germany rolls through Poland. WW2 begins officially.-May 2nd, 1940: Germany recently broke the Maginot line, and has since pummeled France. France surrenders after Paris falls.-February 11th, 1941: Germany takes Czechoslovakia with force.-October 20th, 1941: After what seems like a mutual coalition of both war participants and non participants, Germany's national unity wavers below 30%.-October 25th, 1941: Germany invades Denmark, who's independence is supported by the mighty power of Yugoslavia. Thus, Yugoslavia is dragged into war, where they swiftly take German VP's, and so, Yugoslavia liberates a new Poland, the old France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Czechoslovakia, but keep the German Territories. By joining the allies, along with Republican Spain and Finland, the only nation that Yugoslavia had the ambition to take on, was the Soviet Union.......Aftermath: The Allies were called in on the war with the Soviet Union. They were all too happy to oblige. With the initial lull in fighting, the Allies started gaining momentum, where soon, Leningrad had fallen, followed by Moskva, and finally, the Soviets broke, when the last major VP was taken. The result was a huge gain of territory for Poland, Finland, ans especially Yugoslavia. When Sinkiang was eventually put down after a year of fighting, the Japanese were the only force foolish enough to stand in the way of the allied Powers. Progress was swift, and so Yugoslavia was the greatest power the world had known. (King Tvrtko would be proud of me) I give this game 10/10Next up, Brazil!			"

												Always wanted to lead a nation through WW2? While managing it's  army, navy and airforce?Then Hearts of Iron III is the game for you! Hearts of Iron III is an excellent game and It is really advisable to getif you're into the theme and up for a challenge. Because yes, it is a challenging game as the learning curve of the many features might be a bit hard to get around with at first. But once you got it, it will be well worth it!I've got up to a 1000h on the vanilla version and although that's a damn lot of wasted time for a game. I don't regret it, It's just doesn't get boring. You can either follow the historical road by following a road of events and decisions or you can go on a completely alternative non-historical road.I mean who doesn't want to make their own grand stategy plan and excecute it accordingly? Controlling your armies, corps and divisions on the battlefield!And once that all get's you bored, you can always check out the many amazing mods made for this game. Examples are BlackICE and the Great War. Both giving a whole new and unique experience that will keep you going for many more hours!Definitely recommendable!			"

												I don't many(or any at all) hours logged into the steam version yet, but I've put about 6 hours into the Gamersgate version, which doesn't come with a Steam Key. I had originally got the Hearts of Iron III Collection + Their Finest Hour DLC + 'Arsenal of Democracy: A Hearts of Iron Game' on sale on Gamersgate a couple weeks ago since it was so cheap and I've never tried a Grand Strategy before.I was very impressed. While it loads a bit slowly on single state drives(at least I think that's the term), it was an amazing game. The Scale is huge. Each Continent and each Sea is made up of Provinces, which works much like the Hex Grid from Civilization V, but less uniform. But in Hearts of Iron III there are over 10,000 Provinces, and only a very small number of that is the seas. Like I said, the scale is huge.It takes place during World War 2, and you can play any nation that existed at that time. And all the events that happened in real life during that time frame, also happen in the game, though you'll only see it if you're playing as the nation it happened too, or a nation also affected by it. But other than that, things can go any number of ways. Things tend to drift towards what happened in history, but other than UK always being Allies, Germany always being Axis, and the Soviets always being Consortium, any nation can join any faction potentially, or even remain neutral. Wanna play as Japan and seduce Mexico and Canada to the Axis and nail Murica'(♥♥♥♥ yeah!) in a 3-way? It might take a little while, but it's certainly possible.There is a huge tech tree also, though I won't get into that.There are also many unit types, and a very detailed military hierarchy, and an extremely large amount of room for tactics.This game, and pretty much any other Paradox Interactive and/or Grand Strategy game, is very difficult to get into though, due to the steep learning curve. Even now I'm still getting the hang of the game, though I'm loving every moment. I recommend watching Michael Broschek's tutorial on the basics, which helped me immensely. Here's the linky link.Also, this game is best played with all it's expansion packs, which are 'Semper Fi', 'For the Motherland', and 'Their Finest Hour', in that order of release. You also need the previous expansion to play the next. To clarify: You need the base game, Hearts of Iron III in order to play Semper Fi. You need Semper Fi in order to play For the Motherland. And finally, you need For the Motherland to play Their Finest Hour. All the other DLC's are mostly cosmetic, so you can have all armies have the appearance their real army had at that time period.Anyway, I recommend this to any Grand Strategy fan, Paradox Interactive fan, or a Strategy fan looking for something much, MUCH deeper.

												Hearts of Iron III has been such an amazing game and is a good representation of what grand strategy games should be like. The game is defintely not for the faint hearted as it has a decent learning curve and can be very hit and miss with whether or not you enjoy it. The game is defintely aimed at fans of the grand strategy genre and the second world war. For a game made in 2009 its definitely aged well and still has a fairly active player base with around 200-800 players at any one time.The game itself involves you controlling any nation in the world from early 1936 through the second world war up until 1946. During this period players mostly control the production and operations of their vast militaries. However diplomacy, espionage and trade does play a role (albeit a small one). Players control units right from Brigade level up to Theatre commands and Army Groups. I highly recommend purchasing all of the expansions for the game as they expand upon the games great model and bring some really useful additions. You dont need the skin pack dlcs but these can be useful for those wishing to increase the level of immersion, but I know that I personally tended to just stick to using regular counters. Once you've had enough of the regular vanilla game there are also many many community created mods which allow for endless oppertunities to experiment and game. These include such mods as the WW1 mod, Black Ice mod and the Modern Warfare mod.While this game does have a large learning curve and does not sport the most interesting of user interfaces it defintely does the genre proud. I would rate HOI3 a solid 9/10.			"

												If you're a kind of a conqueror and think about dominate the whole world this game is what you're looking for. You dont have to follow history, actually you can change it. But i should warn you that you will be feeling frustrated in the first trys of gameplays like as Hitler... oh not the real one. This one below:

			Hitler tries to play the Grand strategy game that is Hearts Of Iron 3 However things don't seem to go exactly as planned...		

Despite its complexity its a great game, after you learned the basics of combat, industry, techs and how to build a division correctly you will be fine and can even conquer the world as Luxemburg, Albania or another tiny country.			"

												*I've never played a Hearts of Iron before this*When you put the time in this game, you will have a great experience. It has however some really annoying drawbacks.Since HOI4 is just around the corner, you should get HOI3 on sale.7/10+ Amazing campaigns.+ really long campaigns.+ Settings for days (command structure, etc.)+ Finally beating a major country is incredibly rewarding.+ Great map.+ So incredibly fun just to play this for hours.- Hard to get into when you never played a hoi before.- Sea invasions are a bit broken.- Command structures are overwhelming.- Surrounding the enemy is pretty much useless unless you outnumber them 1000000 to 1.- When playing as the Soviet Union, the Allies don't do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥- When playing as the Allies, the Soviet Union advances unrealistic fast rate. What makes intervention pretty much useless since they will crush the Axis all by them self without any ressistance.- Operations just arent fun to make since you have to micromanage every attack.

												Hearts of Iron 3 is the penultimate WW2 Grand Strategy game. It is endlessly complicated and extremely difficult to master, but well worth the experience of learning and in the end it will have you playing it over and over. Have patients and take the time to learn and love this game and you will feel all powerfull when your 1st Panzer Korps is slaughtering the garrisons of Moscow and Waffen SS are storming the beaches of Washington D.C. which is being bombarded by your great navy!

												Hearts of Iron 3 is without a doubt, the most in-depth WAR game ever made. If you've never played a paradox before, you'll be in for a major surprise. It took me roughly a month of every day play to ""master"" all of the basics. The tutorials are woefully inadequate and a complete waste of time, but the strategy guide is a gem and the paradox forum is an excellent resource. To ease your learning, parts of the game can be automated. Anything you have to do can be assigned to a highly sophisticated AI; it is possible to delegate every task to the AI, or just the ones you aren't yet familiar with so you can take things one step at a time. The breadth and scope of HOI3 is enormous. You can pick any country in the world from Germany to Tannu Tava (I never heard of it before, either) and the developers have done an excellent job modelling historical limitations, while not restricting flexibility. HOI3 is essentially a war game, unlike other paradox games. Its focus is just that, with only the minimum necessary attention to the homefront. Battle, however, is beautiful. There are so many different brigade considerations, such as toughness (how many casualties does it take?), soft attack (infantry attack), hard attack (tank battles basically), defensiveness, organization (how much damage a brigade can take before retreating), strength (how much damage can it inflict), etc. You have the ability to craft each brigade and assign its leaders, all the way through the chain. A well-organized army enjoys significant benefits over one without proper leadership. The bread-and-butter of any army are infantry, and I highly advise tacking on an artillery brigade to each infantry division. Each unit draws supplies, and fuel in the case of mechanical ones, from your base. The supply system has serious flaws, however, but recent patches and independent fixes remedy this issue. In addition, Paradox has added an arcade version that ignores supply routes. What fun is that, though? All it takes to turn the tide of war is to bomb your enemy's choke points, and bam! -50% battle penalty and no reinforcement to the front lines. Indeed, supply lines/routes will make or break you, especially when playing as a sea-faring nation, such as Japan.Battle itself is effected by the values I mentioned before, plus many others. What's the weather in the province? A wise man doesn't invade India in the middle of a monsoon. Combat width determines the space of your battle, and frontage determines how much space each unit takes. The more space it occupies, the more it attacks in a round but the less each attack does. A unit with small frontage and high combat is ideal, though armored units operate oppositely. Tanks rely on a high frontage to rush enemy lines. There are ""events"" in battle, like ""Ambush!"" or ""Breakthrough!"" that give benefits to one of the belligerents. You can increase your chance of getting a beneficial event through researching doctrines, which are highly useful because they improve your army without using your IC (Industrial Capacity, each country's industrial output). Battle lasts until one side runs out of organization or strength, though the former comes first 95% of the time. Air/naval battles are represented well. Planes play a huge role, despite costing an arm-and-a-leg to produce. Smaller countries often can't afford to field a division of tactical bombers, but for bigger ones when you already have enough infantry, it will determine the course of many battles. Navies are optional for land-based countries, such as the Soviet Union, but absolutely critical to survival for the UK or Japan, the latter of which is forced to fight a multi-front war with a small manpower pool, few resources, and no nearby allies and a vulnerable homeland.The world is divided into factions: Allies, Axis, Comintern, although one can be unallied. Each has its perks, but Axis are the easiest (and imo, most fun) to play. On top of that, each country poses unique challenges that model history. The Soviet Union has a gigantic manpower pool, but a disorganized army and a stalling industrial base. Germany enjoys significant boosts from '36 to '39 in its industrial output to prepare for the war ahead, yet becomes very strained in the east. The USA is the powerhouse of the game, yet can barely build a proper guard army until '42. Whatever country you pick, know your strengths and weaknesses. Building a major tank force with Argentina, for example, would be foolish. Tanks aren't well-suited to the jungles, and that money could go toward building a decent infantry base. Similarly, research only the techs you need. The basic infantry ones require only 4 research points, but planes require vastly more. Some countries just can't catch up to the giants like the US or Germany. That isn't a fault of the game, it's just history (although you can expand significantly; I have played a game with The Netherlands where I conquered over 10x my original area).Whatever path you choose in HOI3, you're in for the most thought-provoking game you have ever played.

												So this game has 4 titles, The base Game, Hearts of iron 3, the DLC ""Semper Fi"" the DLC ""For the motherland"" and the last DLC: ""Their Finest hour"" released in that order specifically, I'll just review Their finest hour for the time being.Hearts of Iron, their Finest hourSo in hearts of iron 3 you assume complete control of a country from 1936-1948, Lead your nation through the second world war, you can play from Costa Rica to The United Kingdom in this Strategy game that takes place in one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, with several scenarios to play through, from the Winter War to Operation Unthinkable, you're going to have quite the time playing the game.So basically the game is a Grand Strategy Game, like most of Paradox Interactive's titles, this game however focuses not on colonization but complete domination and Victory against the Enemy.And Like all of Paradox interactive's games, this one can become very chaotic really fast, play as the Soviet Union and Spread your Ideology to the European nations sick with Capitalism, play as Nazi Germany and destroy Communism and Democracy, play as The United States of America and Nuke everything that moves, the game is yours.However, this game is very restrictive, whereas Victoria 2 had war justifications to declare it, in this you need zero neutrality, something that is nearly impossible to do due to the system, however modding and cheats allow for a more free play.Also small nations' games usually are quite boring, whilst FTM fixed the neutrality system somewhat and gave small nations the ability to lower their neutrality to the point of joining a faction easier, the system is still somewhat broken.However smaller nations' games are still fun, once I do recall a Haiti game where I joined the Allies, invaded Northern Brazil when they were Axis, and after they were annexed by Argentina, I was able to keep a small strip of land in Brazil as a reward, all this without modding or cheats, however it was 1953 by the time that happened, so almost 20 in-game years since the game started.The game is much better to be played as a larger power though, then at least you have a chance to grow much larger armies and much better weapons, for example a France Playthrough would be much better than, say, a Liberia or El Salvador Playthrough, simply due to mechanics.The game has some issues, for example TFH takes 5 minutes of loading to start up, this is especially annoying when I'm modding and have to exit the game to open the files up and edit the saves to make Haiti a nuclear, technological, economic, and military superpower, also the game won't allow you to exit to the desktop and return to the game without having to shut it down and start the game up again so that's a bother.How is it as a strategy game? Pretty damn goodFor example, Tanks will be♥♥♥♥♥♥in mountains and thus move and attack worse when positioned/traveling through them, but trusty mountain troops on the other hand are great at that stuff, but mounties are crap against tanks on an open field, unless they have back up or the tanks they face are technologically backwards and the mounties' country did some fine research on Infantry Anti-Tank weapons, but nevermind! The tanks are cut off thanks to the quick work of the brave Calvary units, now the mounties are on the offensive!There's also combat width, unit weight for transporting across the seas, and even morale, organization, and attack levels of units, there's paratroopers, V2 missiles, V2 Interceptors, Battleships, Super heavy battleships, light tanks, heavy tanks, super heavy tanks, super duper heavy tanks (I kid), Armored cars, submarines, Carriers, Military Police, Naval, Tactical, and strategic bombers, and nuclear weapons.Back to the game, you can also assign Units to AI HQs who will then move on the impulse of what the AI thinks is good to do.You can assign wargoals after/during the declaration of war, and once a country's national unity is lower than the amount of its important cities are taken, it will surrender, for example if Poland braves Germany and invades them by sea, nuking Berlin thrice in the process, and Germany loses a lot of important cities to the Poles, Germany will surrender once the percent of important cities taken are more than the German national unity, which would be low due to all that nuking.Unlike Victoria 2 or other Paradox titles, games go by not by days but by hours, making 10 years in HOI3 seem like 50 in Vic2, games are usually longer than the 1948 end and sometimes require going into the files and making the game end in 2005 or whenever, just to see how ♥♥♥♥ed up the world can get, if Japan ever annexes Australia, if Ireland ever conquers Germany, if Haiti ever nukes Hiroshima.Along with this, there are in-game events that occur that mirror historical ones, like the Crashing of the Hindenburg, the loss of Amelia Earhart at sea, the final construction of the Pentagon, the White Death during the Winter war, the first atomic bomb dropped on another nation, and so on.If you've played other Paradox games and wanna try your hand at conquering rather than colonizing, try out Hearts of Iron 3, you'll enjoy it.

												A fantastic game and probably my favorite of the paradox history games. Sadly it's just broken. Crashes every 20 or so minutes and I've tried everything to fix it. Reinstalling, Patching, Map Cache, Updating, Nothing works. I'm not the only one having issues either and this seems to be a frequent thing. Rumor is the game just has issues with AMD graphics cards but  can't say for sure. It's a true shame but getting this game is a complete risk and it may not work. In my opinion, wait for Hearts of Iron IV and hope that they've fixed the issues.			"

												Hearts of Iron III - the spiritual successor of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial - is a simulation game which mostly revolves arround offering the player the most possibly scripted experience humanly possible.The Gameplay begins with constant random CTD's that can easily be solved after you just look up the problem find after ages of searching a link to the Paradox forum where a fixed .exe download is offered. So after you finaly registered yourself in the forum just to get told that you arent permitted to look up the forum for hearts of iron 3, just to be informed after another lenghty search that i have to register my game, just to wait roughly 2 days till the page synchronised with my steam library so i was finaly able to access the thread in the forum to download the fixed .exe for the game that will keep the random CTD's from happening. I have to say this kind of gameplay was totaly new for me, and i was really surprised that this here wasnt a ww2 strategy game but more an interactive online adventure! So yeah, after finishing the campaign that evolved arround getting used to how great the paradox forum, with the final goal of finding the hoi3_tfh fixed .exe, is - I started playing the additional minigame that was included in the hearts of iron 3 collection, i think it was called ""Their Finest Hour"".Their finest hour appears to evolve arround an interactive map full of scripted events with mostly broken triggers. Especially the politics simulation is mentionworthy, because states that loose wars badly and got every single town of theirs nuked wouldnt actually reject offers of the invader surrendering to them. I am sure that in reality when the USA would invade north korea and the USA would offer to surrender to the north koreans, the glorious DPRK would never accept such a foolish offer cause they would fight till final victory over capitalism is archieved.The overall combat in TFH has much depth, it is on a realism level that permits you to - like in reality - invade all of europe with cavalry in 1941 because the whole Luftwaffe and Royal Airforce is not Able to shoot down 70 units of tactical bombers that exterminate every single of their soldiers in europe. Meanwhile the victory conditions are on such an well working, level that after defeating all the allies, axis and comintern - causing all these pacts to not have a single member in the end anymore - the allies realisticaly win in 1948 and you loose, cause you arent democratic and the allies are democratic. they didnt had a single member but thats not relevant cause we all know that western ideology always wins.Overall would i recommend every player who looks for a realistic ww2 strategy game, to rather take the 10 bucks you would pay for this game and instead buy a peed in diaper on craigslist with it.

												After a couple tries at the game and after finally understanding it i decided to play as Germany for the 2nd time (First time i didn't understand the game so Poland,France and the UK invaded me.)

By now Nationalist Spain,Portugal, Italy, Japan (and all of it's Puppet countries are in the Axis.Mid 1938- Decide ♥♥♥♥ it and Declare war on Lithuania to get Memel back but afterwards realise that there is an event for that(Spend all of the rest of 1938 to march 1939 making troops.)March 1939- Tell poland to give me Danzig. Poland refusesrest of 1939- conquering all of the Allies in Europe. Eventually took the UK after a couple triesEarly 1940- Declare war on the Scandanavian countries above Germany (Non were a part of the Allies for some reason but mainly drifting torwards it.)Mid 1940- Conquer Norway, Denmark and Sweden all in this time period (kek)Late 1940- build up troops in these countries and realise that i could build stuff on greenland and ice landEarly 1941- Don't want to deal with Iceland so i made it a Puppet of GermanyLate 1941- Help out Italians in North Africa and make several puppet states out of North AfricaEarly 1942- Revoke Non-Aggression pact with the USSRMid 1942- Take Movska and Stalingrad (Historically accurate so far)Late 1942- Nearly made Soviets surrender but then start pushing my mighty panzers backEarly 1943- Finally defeat RussiaRest of 1943- Rebelions happen all over the USSR and put troops everywhere in Russia(Even in Siberia)Early 1943- Make Communist China my puppet stateFeeling good by now since i have destroyed all of Bolshevikism in the WorldMid 1943 - Take over AustraliaBy now my armies are very stretched thinEstablish bases in Australia to send over to the USLate 1943 - Launch invasions in the US and canadaEarly 1944 - Alaska is mine (Fallout 3 flashbacks)Late 1944 - Canada is mine nowEarly 1945 - All of the US is mineHaven't paid attention to Europe and Asia for a while by nowMid 1945 - Right when i was about to invade Mexico, Rebels in Europe are popping up in my regions so i frantically send all of my troops back to Europe and Asia to put them down after i do that however, rebels pop up in Canada and US and take back their nationsLate 1945 By now i start getting Frustrated and about to give up; Right when i finished  putting down rebels in Switzerland, France and the UK, Rebels appear in the USSR and take back a quarter of the country near Asia.I eventually Rage Quit from this and deleted the savei wish i had a screenshot of the nation at it's height...10/10 Wouldn't make puppets again and was very historically accurate			"

												Bought this game at Walmart years ago, easily put hours into, enjoyed every minute of it, then I lost the disc and forgot about it until I saw a steam sale for it.  The strategy in this game is very good. You will have to think very carefully about every move you make in game. The interface is a bit difficult to learn but once you get the hang of it, its simple to use.  The fun in this game is great. You wanna play as a small country and show those major powers who the boss is, go for it. Wanna play as Soviet Union bring communism to the world, do it. Wanna play as USA and skip ww2 and go right to ww3, go for it. The possiblilities are endless and there is countless hours of replayability. The vanilla game, no patches is buggy and crashes, so I have to recommend get For the Motherland and Semper Fi to get rid of the crashes and glitches. Overall, the game is great for the strategy fans out there. People who like action and gunfire and explosions should avoid this.			"

I highly recommend it to anyone interesting in WW2 who are looking for an in depth game. 8/10. You do need the major DLC to make it more playable.

												As with most Paradox Development games, HoI3 has a huge amount of depth, and a wonderful potential for generating memorable stories. Unfortunately, I also found the game to be extremely unstable*, and very heavy on micro-managing huge numbers of units, officers, and upgrades, which I really didn't enjoy.If you really like the period, and especially if you enjoy micro-managing a large military organisation, then this may still be a great game for you, but in general I cannot recommend HoI3.*) I got a crash to desktop on average once an hour playing as the USA on a Windows 8.1 machine. Strangely enough, Paradox has produced an .exe that makes the game much more stable, but for some reason it's not in a patch. You have to track it down it on their forums (which require you to first get a Paradox account) and install it manually. :-(			"

												This is one of the best strategy games ever made.   It has enormous modding potenial.  It was abandoned by Paradox to follow the glossy no-brain HOI-4.   Some of the mods over on Paradox HOI3 mod section will give you a great game.  It is a pity on HOI3 because they are worked out about 95% of issues and I only needed a facelift and the last 5% fixed.  Pity, HOI4 will never stand the strain.....			"

												Coming back to this from HOI4 feels like a completely different series. Between the two obviously HOI4 is the more casual one, its shallow, easier to learn as well but still fun. Where as this game has an actual learning process that takes a bit longer, it requires more thinking as well which makes it so fun/satisfying and different than HOI4.			"

												HOI 3 is a great WW2 grand strategy game. I enjoyed playing as different nations and infuencing history to try and swing WW2 events in different directions. However the game is showing its age badly. If you don't use the Paradox support forum and try to fix all the issues the game will crash to desktop constantly. Even if you install the fixes that the support forum suggests I found that it is still no guarentee the game won't crash.I worked for 3 hours trying to solve the crashing issue and I still found that after a certain amount of time the game would still stop working and crash. Playing this game is not only trying to win WW2 but a war of attrition to keep the game running and make sure your save game works. Even the big fans of this game I've seen do let's plays of HOI3 have had issues with it despite obviously spending a long time patching it. If you play the game for extended periods and have a lot of units on the screen it begins to lag horrendusly. The UI will start to break and show no numbers. You have to re-start the game at that point. Which is a pretty big inconveniance.  For the technical reasons I can't give this game a positive review. The game is pretty much broken at this point because of its age. If you want to buy a WW2 grand strategy game just wait for Hearts of Iron 4.			"

												this game is absolutely AMAZING. i would suggest vicky 2 first as that is essentially a tutorial for this. the only major downside to this is the fact that there are STILL bugs that randomly appear that make the game 100% unplayable and because this is one of the older paradox games and the new one is being made. who needs patches? i mean apart from the large amount of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off people who now cannot play an otherwise brilliant game. just taking a scroll through their forum on steam/paradoxplaza shows the amount of bugs that this game has that havent been fixed. very disapointing. for now i dont reccomend but i will update when and if they fix the most common problems/the ones i have(which cause unplayable lagg spikes and crashes and there is no known fix). also known as mapmode locking/province colours not updating/rivers and borders disapearing and re-rendering constantly. considering i only got it after i bought all the DLC's (minus semper fi/for the motherland) in one pack, i think that buying the basegame and the first two major DLC's seem to be completely fine. it is a yes and no. yes to first to DLC's, no to all the others.

												I ask you to read this before you downvote it. The reason I feel this game sucks is because it is not an imporvement on previous games, in fact, it takes a lot away that the other games had. Sure HoI III has pretty graphics and some overpriced Unit packs....but come on, is that really all you care about? Hearts of Iron III lacks most key events for WWII, as in barely any events are in the game. They try to justify this by saying its supposed to be a 'sandbox' even though that doesn't make any sense. First off; they are perfectly capable of writing up branching event paths that allow for alternative history like they did for the previous games in the series. This seems like an attempt to appeal to a new audiance that failed horribly.Among the events missing are some of the most important to include, like the aftermath of WWII! In addition there are missing mechancs like land trading and claiming that are absent from this game that are badly needed, there is also a lack of nations and alternative nations and ministers in the game too. And don't even get me started on the map. They also removed a lot of key bookmarks that are present in other games.The few features that are new or improved are poorly implimented or completely broken.I recommend you wait to see if HoI IV is any better or buy Darkest Hour.

 First sorry for my english.     Sotto la recensione in italiano. Hearts of Iron III is a 2009 strategic game on a large scale, the third representative of the paradox about World War II.You are free to choose from hundreds of nations between 1936 and 1948.The game is based on several levels: the army management, industrial production, technological research, diplomacy,espionage and politics.The game is in real time, but you can pause when you want.Pros   Not high hardware requirements Multiplayer and coop Cards Some fantastic mod Light download and occupied space Excellent longevity Once mastered becomes extremely rewarding Wide range of nations The whole world to conquer Three major expansionsCons   High price many dlc of dubious value No workshops, cloud and achievement Insufficient tutorial Bugs and crashes Graphics and sound No demo No linux and steam OS  Extremely difficult Without mod loses points Initial loading very long Micromanagement It requires much effort and timeNotes   Serious technical problems reported in some cases especially with mod Easily activated cheats Dlc Hearts of Iron III - German Sprite Pack in some bundle can not be detected Mod downloaded via Paradox forum (it is a paradox policy) The DRM free versions is present on other platforms Not present holocaust management and other controversial parts Suitable for all ages (no violence, at least not directly) There are reported problems of downloading through SteamWith the release of the 4th chapter has lost relevance because of its extreme micromanagementand not easy accessibility.Strongly recommend modding because the basic version is not satisfactory.Is present an active and expert community  for the multiplayer, and the game gives wonderful emotions, if you enter in mechanical.The air force in the game unfortunately has a secondary part, before you buy you should inform well for not abandon it at the first try (the fun-frustration border is very thin).Compared to the 2nd chapter is divided into thousands of provinces, and the beauty of the game is to shape the story to their own will for example by bringing Italy into allies.Probably many person will choose the major nations because they offer more tactical strategy, however for its size it remains a milestone of its period.graphic 6sound 6.5longevity 9gameplay 8Rating 7.5 / 10 vote with mod 8/10Fundamental dlc: Hearts of Iron III: Their Finest Hour, Hearts of Iron III: For the Motherland and Hearts of Iron III Semper Fi.Purchase recommended under $ 5 price for the collection  (note that the game was released in a bundle).Mod recommended:""BlackICE"": vote 10 (exceptional mod that makes the base game magnificent and realistic, with thousands of events and dozens of new units and technologies, fixes many bugs and balance the game).""Random Map Generator and Scenario"": 8 vote (generates dynamically nations and other for endless possibilities).FANTARMA COMMUNITY

												Hearts of Iron III is a pretty good grand strategy game. It is definitely improved since the first two games. It plays best with all three major DLC pack upgrades.In the game you spend time building up your army, researching technologies and limited trading for resources. Major countries can also persuade minor countries to join their faction (Axis, Allies, Comintern).When war breaks out things get messy. Many battles will be fought with your units. It is a lot of fun to see your hard  preparations at work.The game is fun but there are few tooltip popups or help files in the game explaining things. Such areas as how national Unity is raised are not fully explained and the numbers seem to be wrong. I am still not cetain of a few things in the game. I do know that Officer Leadership greatly influences Organisation and that Organisation of zero is when your troops retreat. Not certain what else Organisation does, or Morale. I have a few ideas but not certain. I do know that they are just as important as combat ratings. There are some wiki helps online.Anyway this is a fun game. I use the sprites for the units when zoomed in. For many decades I did not but the unit sprites look cool.Good to pick up this game when it is on sale.EDIT: Game is very clunky. Many crashes and lockups on loading because Paradox does not know how to program. Wait for Hearts of Iron IV = maybe, just maybe it will run better.			"

												Hearts of Iron is a excellent stradegy based game, it combines all the organization elements of running a military and the result is great. At first, the game is very overwhelming, and it may seem extremely confusing, but my suggestion is to watch some YouTube series' on the game first, this way you can understand what you need to do, and the crucial stradegies of the game. Another essiential in my opinion is the Black Ice mod. This mod makes the game heaps better, and adds tons of new elements to the game which make it feel even more immersive, Black Ice doesn't tally your game time on Steam though, so be wary of that, this is why I have such a low amount time played on the game. Overall, I really recommend this game for anyone who enjoys hardcore stradegy, this game does a great job of making the player feel like he is really running the military side of a country, the game is extremely addictive too. The lack of graphics may scare some, but most will adapt to it.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is a game you really need to think about twice before you even start the game. At first this game is overwhelming in scale and that can scare you a little for the first few hours you play it. Once you realise the basic rules of it then you can conquer the world in many, many, many, many hours. A week later, without sleeping or eating... you realise that it's taking a while to conquer the world... so you go sleep...Then the next time your eyes cross the Hearts of Iron III icon you start shaking with a mix emotion. ""Should I launch it and feed my addiction... or have a life..."" Of course the natural answer will be ""here we go for an other round!""  Now of course you can break free of the addiction at some point for diverse reasons and you may end up staying away from that game, not so much because your tired of it. But because it's soo addictive that you don't want your relative and friends to wonder were you have been last few months?			"

												8/10 because Soviets kick♥♥♥♥♥Don't let the hour record fool you. I have probably spent 1000+ hours on this. Very difficult to learn. Played it since 2009 and I am still learning new things every time I play. Very challenging, time consuming but really fun if you're into Grand Strategy and need something a little more complex.But it isn't Europa Universalis or Victoria II diverse-like. There is a single great event, WWII, and history will more or less allways repeat itself. You can expect Germany to win or lose the war, but the war will allways break out, and you won't see a powerful Luxemburg rising up for example.As for the main DLCs, I don't really know what they add to the game exactly, apart from the last one with the battleplans. I feel as if I am playing the very same 2009 game even with all the DLC's installed.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------8/10 porque los Soviéticos lo petan.No dejes que el registro de horas te engañe. Habré pasado 1000+ horas en ésto. Muy difícil de aprender. Lo he jugado desde el 2009 y sigo aprendiendo cosas nuevas cada vez que juego. Muy desafiante, consume tiempo pero es muy divertido si te gusta el género Grand Strategy y necesitas algo un poco más complejo.Pero no es diverso como el Europa Universalis o el Victoria II. Hay un único grán evento, la segunda guerra mundial, y la historia se repetirá con sus más y sus menos. Puede que Alemania gane o pierda la guerra, pero la guerra siempre estallará, y no verás a Luxemburgo alzarse como potencia nunca por ejemplo.En cuanto a los DLCs principales, no se realmente lo que hacen, excepto el último con sus planes de batalla. Tengo la sensación de estar jugando al mismo juego de 2009 aún con todos los DLC's instalados.			"

												I am just getting into this game myself so I will keep it simple.  What do you think of the following generals (1 admiral)?Omar Bradley, Charles DeGaulle, Heinz Guderian, Ivan Konev, William Slim, and Isoroku Yamamoto.Were they under-rated?If you said ""yes"" to at least three of them then this is your WWII game.And after buying any Paradox game use your key code to register your game on their forum.  It is not uncommon to pay $20.00 or more for strategy guides for other publishers' games.  All e-manuals and e-guides are free once your Paradox game is registered.  And the forums are very helpful in their own right.  In most transactions my relationship with the seller ended with the purchase.  With Paradox it was just the beginning.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is the long awaited sequel to probably the best Grand Strategy game available today and it's a fairly big change.The most noticeable change is the change to the Clausewitz Engine which means everything is prettier and better presented although this was never an area that really needed much improvement it is nice to be see graphics not being completely forgotten by Paradox.The most meaty of the new changes is the new AI. Every level of command can now be assigned an AI to simply the sometimes unmanageable big armies and while this seems like a nice feature I can't help but feel much like I did the first time played Master of Orion 3. Out of control.Paradox has also, like with EU3, taken as much determinism out of the game as possible and while this opens up the gameplay quite a bit it also increases the chance of games that never get going when some of the big players never enter the fray.A great game but I still like Hearts of Iron II better.

												I've been playing this game on and off since release, i own all the DLC and have played it on numerous mods including many campaigns on vanilla. I really believe that HoI3 is better than HoI4 in many perspectives. For a game of it's age, HoI3 can provide you hundreds of hours of replayabilty, including a very helpful community that seems to always produce new mod content. While there are noted shortfalls with the AI, the game itself has a lot to offer players who want to micromanage. Or if you're a kind of player who wants to delegate, everything can be automated all the way up to your theater HQs. This is not a game for fancy graphics or amazing sound, it is merely a easy war simulator designed to letting the player decide how they want to play. With a plethora of research trees, troop variations, and a multitude of other features, this is one of the best WW2 sims on the steam store.			"

												Hearts of Iron 3 is an incredible world war 2 strategy game where you control nearly all aspects of any country in the world. From researching new weapons and units, to mounting huge invasions. You can fight on land, air, and sea. You can join one of the major faction: The Axis, The Allies, and The Commitern, or you can stay independent, and conquer for yourself. I would highly recommend it for any fans of strategy games like Europa Universalis.			"

Posted: November 8, 2014
												Hearts of Iron III is an excellent game. One of Paradox's best strategy games, in my opinion, it allows the player to control any nation in the lead-up to WW2, or during it if you prefer. These range from Nazi Germany, of course, to the Dominican Republic, which gives you an idea of the level of choice on offer. The game essentially drops you into the world as head-of-state of one of these many nations, and it's entirely up to you what to do from there: will you align with the Axis in Europe to gain your share of the economic gains in the upcoming war? Or will you side with Stalin's Russia and work to undermine Fascism and the Allies, in an attempt to dominate the world with Communism?However, the level of historical accuracy in HOI3 is astounding, despite the player's ability to make independent and alternate choices. For example, there is a system of ""decisions"" in the game which often provide some sort of benefit, one of which is the historical Anschluss of Austria for Germany. As well as this, there are literally thousands of officers, with their own traits and skill levels (which can be improved with combat), to assign to command your divisions or brigades. These are just two examples in an intricate web of historical detail. WW2 history buffs like myself will be elated at the opportunity to not only, for example, command Rommel's Afrika Korps, but lead it to complete victory in the Middle East! Again, this is just an example that popped into my head, the level of possibility is insane.Aside from the military aspect of the game, which is the focus, there are various other sectors of your nation that you can alter control. There is the politics tab, where you select your ministers and make policies, as well as administer the areas that have come under your occupation through war. There is the diplomacy tab, where, if you are a leader of a faction, such as the Axis, you can influence nations to join you in alliance, and make trade deals, sell equipment, declare war, ETC. Other tabs include research, production, intelligence. I won't go into detail on these, but all are as important as each other.Anyway, pros and cons:PROS- Insanely high level of historical detail (accurate divisional names, commanders, ministers in governments, literally tens of thousands of provinces)- Ability to relive or rewrite history, in your own unique way.- Greatly immersive, you get to the point where hours just slip away in what feels like minutes!- Huge scale wars, on land sea, and air, where you are the commander in chief.CONS- Not recommended if the player is looking for amazing graphics- the gameplay is what sells HOI3, not the visuals.- A tad buggy. The game crashes relatively frequently, especially if tinkering around in console commands.- Steep learning curve, but once you get the full hang of it, you'll realise it was well worth the time put into it.9/10 The cons do not affect my opinion of the game significantly in any way, and I hope that you too will be persuaded by this long-winded review to buy this awesome game too!

												If you like grand strategy wargaming, then this is the best one there is....provided you get at least the first two expansions, and preferably all three. People love to complain that its graphics are bland or unimpressive, but those people are looking for an RTS or shooter with lots of eye candy. This game is all about the grand strategy. Others may complain about the AI not being smart enough, but they overlook the fact that this is the best grand strategy AI ever written for a PC game and no PC based AI is ever going to be a match for a decently operated human mind. Now the specifics:Standalone game: somewhat buggy, some serious design limitations that impede some aspects of smooth game play. might wear out your mouse button with all the micromanagement required to play a whole game to the end. 3/5 starsGame with all expansions: very few bugs at all; added management tools and AI delegation options reduce the micro-management clickfest of the vanilla version to a level much easier to handle; custom game mode (CGM) from final expansion adds whole new worlds of replayability once you exhaust your options with the already incredible scope of possibilities. 5/5 stars without reservation - all time best of this class. Its only rivals for that distinction might be other recent titles from Paradox, e.g. Europa Universalis IV, though that would be partly a matter of personal taste, of course.If you are a casual gamer, stay away from this. But if you are a serious wargaming strategy-buff - this game is an absolute must have!			"

												While Hearts of Iron III isn't for everyone, people should not be grossed out or write the game off based on its screenshots. Despite most of the game being looking at a map, it offers in depth detail into being the government and military of a country with total countrol. Most players find peacetime the most boring time throughout the game, this can be worse if your playing a country like the United States which doesn't enter WW2 for quite sometime. However, people may find it boring during this peace / build phase but if its not thought out well you'll be quickly regretting and possbily restarting because you found that phase unimportant. If you are like me, and love to add flavor of events and hard decisions during peacetime especially and wartime I would highly recommend the Black ICE mod. This mod adds hundereds of historical events and decisions which have major to minimal impact on the game. These events can both be helpful and hurt you but I feel like it makes the games events harder as its not always a easy decision. For those reasons and the diversity of units and divisions that can be accomplished give you a more fun and tough time, as the AI also build more diverse and recieve events just for them to keep them up to par with you. If anyone ever has any questions or thoughts about getting or already has the game and just wants to discuss anything about it I encourage you to message me. As stated above I strongly recommend this game in its vanilla state or its various mods such as Black ICE, HPP and August Storm.			"

												UPDATEDI love this game, and I play it often. If your going to pick between hoi3 and hoi4, and you want a GRAND strategy, get this game with all its dlc, which doesn't cost much (Is actually cheaper than hoi4 at this point in time). It lives up to other installments in the series like hoi2 and (In my opinion) The best standalone mod(and hoi game), Darkest Hour. You have more freedom to do what you want and the files are hella easy to edit. Want to play as north korea but dont want to be a puppet? Release it as japan, save the game, go to the save game, and remove it as a puppet. Ever wanted to take over the world as luxembourg? Join the axis! Its a really fun game.All of this adds up to the hoi3 planning system, which is in vic 2, but looks more ""Neater""..brb planning an invasion of the world as luxembourg.			"

												A strategy game with seemingly infinite possibilities on how you can change the tide of World War II. Want Canada to become Fascist and annex the United States? You can do it if you play it right. Want to conduct operation Sea Lion as Germany on Britain successfully and take control of it? You can do that. Want to name yourself Tony Abbott in-game and destroy Australia from the inside-out? You can do that too.It's a bit lengthy depending on where you start, but the results are definitely worth it. You can get some hilarious results, like South Africa attacking Italy or Germany. You'll also occassionally get really obscure countries like Liberia attacking too. It really is a blast, grab it while it's still on sale. Just use Tunngle if you're going to go on multiplayer, as the standard multiplayer has been broken for a while.			"

												Take control of a country, any country before/during WWII and see if you can alter history.Spoiler: You can. In my 140+ hours playing this game I have:* Conquered the entire world as the Irish.* Took Brazil on a trail of mass annexation.* Carved out a vast territory with the mighty Swiss.* Made Latvia a proud, multi-continent, empire again(?).* Ruled the ambitiously expansive Albania to glory all over the known world.* Eradicated the Japanese and conquered East Asia through cunning strategy using the wily old Tibetans.and most recently, took the humble and near forgotten Luxembourg from its simple one province state, rallied with the Axis, and through some laughably inept AI diplomacy (claiming land before my allies conquered it), totally crushed the Allied powers within 4 years - with the exception of the USA, which joined the ComIntern and are currently at war with the Axis (and losing their homeland to my unstoppable (borrowed) forces.Yeah, if you're looking for historical accuracy from your game, try the TW series instead. This isn't for you.If however, you want a challenging and hugely rewarding game of global war on a truly grand scale, grab a chair and get comfy. It's a long ride.The best advice for anyone wanting to play is: Be prepared to learn. This isn't a game you'll pick up and understand in the first 10 minutes several hours. Check out some Youtube tutorial videos and Steam community guides. Register at Paradox forums and check out the After Action Reports, they really helped me learn some of the strategy involved when I first started playing.Even *ahem* ..read the manual! Once you break through the initial learning curve, this is one of the best wargames you'll ever play... Until HOI4 (probably).9/10 - Would definitely help Albania colonise the world again.			"

It's still the only game I've ever seen where you could choose different types of nuclear warhead based on known technology at the time - and then match that warhead with a missile system of choice and either launch it from the ground if it's an ICBM or from a sub or plane or whatever appropriate.This game reminds me a lot of that genre of gameplay, where the depth is there - it doesn't bore you after 8 hours of play with only 10 unit types and 3 research lines or something.Definitely a strategy gamers strategy game.

												If you are willing to imerse yourself in WWII with an amount of depth seldom seen before, this is for you. Single player is pretty neat and playing with a freind certainly take the game to the next level, allowing you and your friend(s) to scheme and strategize in ways that flesh out to incredible degrees.HOWEVER, the game is very glitchy, more so once you install DLC. I believe the motherland DLC is required to play online.It's a real downer that you have to pay for sprites that really should have come with the vanilla version. If you've ever wanted an abusive, neglectfu,l signifcant other that puts out infrequently, but satisifes your every desire when it does, this is the game for you.			"

 Hearts of Iron III is a Grand-Strategy game based in WW2 to the start of the cold war, to be more specific, 1936 - 1948, it was developed & Published by Paradox Interactive and personally is a spectacular Grand-Strategy.Hearts of Iron III (HOI3) is an educational, engaging and in-depth experience, it allows you to micro-manage every aspect of your military (Army, Aviation & Navy), politics, industry, espionage and more, however if you do not wish to be engulfed with all of these aspects, the AI can take over for you.HOI3 allows for countless do-overs and often answers the ""What if?"" questions comically or quite grimly, it has countless events that allow you to make choices about your nation, such as limiting parties or getting completly rid of a party and other events such as illegal acts.HOI3 also allows you to invade other countries though your military, yes, but also through your diplomacy and espionage, do you want to stop Nazi Germany from getting far at all? Then send it spies to ruin their party and make other parties more strong, however good luck with that. :)If you wish to have a friend to play with, you're able to do that, however be aware that the servers are not up anymore and you will be forced to host your own server through port-fowarding or using a program such as Hamachi, playing online is very interesting and is often more difficult due to the AI sometimes being very predictable.The game does suffer from bugs, game crashes and HUD bugs are very common and get worse the longer you play for one session. If the game does not even launch, it is often Steam or your system and a reinstall is very handy. Game crashes seem to get worse the longer you use a constant game copy, reinstalling this game every time crashes become common is a good idea and modding the game can also cause crashes, however I would reccomend the WW1 mod.I full-heartly reccomend this amazing game, with over 600 hours on Steam and much more off Steam, it helped me learn more in-depth about World War 2 and made me truly see the effects of the war. 9/10+Unique game with much replayability+ Extremly In-depth if you want it to be+ Able to attack a country through unique ways+ Great moding community with WW1 mods to game enhancing mods such as ICE-  Bugs, often forcing a reinstall after a unknown period of time- No official servers			"

												For the guy who likes to dig so deep into things so quickly he drowns in dirt; this is the game for you. But how should I describe this game? Imagine it as Civilization was taken thorugh several industrial grade filters and refined so far it lost it's flashy 3D graphics but became so rich in content it's hard to get the taste out of your mouth.Only having played about 10 hours so far I can whole heartedly say that this game is arguably the most complex I have yet come across. The inter-twined connections that just the technology section alone makes a newcomer to the Civilization-esk game genre very overwhelmed, very quickly. I know I was. But, once you read up on a game's mechanics ( Gasp! This is 2015, I don't want to actually read how to play a game somewhere outside the game! Hold my hand and show me the way!) things become much clearer and even if you haven't read the entire wiki like I have, you can kinda figure stuff out on your own.This game allows event he most fanatical of WW2 fanboys to squeal with joy at the historical events taking place in your games. It also allows WW2 fanboys to live out your most amazing/hilarious alternate history ideas in a world so deep, you'd mistake that you where the president of the US.Now for my Good, Bad and, Ungly section.  The Good  The complexity of this game has yet to be matched by any game I have played thus far. The menus are layed out in a nice fasion and automatically close whenver you open something else. This game will impress any history buff, regardless of specific period they like, as the detail to history is fenominal This is a great game to really slow down and think, you can make it as fast or as slow as you want  The Bad   The game lacks polished graphics and would benifit from them amazingly (Haven't bought any DLC, I'm talking about the stock game) Not being able to make some decisions because the game requires another condition to be met was frustrating (for example, not being able to change your economy because you wanted to stay neutral but you have to go to war in order to mobilize) Having to research a unit's basic requirements was wholy unnessicary (some units had half of their stats missing because one perticular technology wasn't reasearched) The Ugly  The UI is horribly outdated and just bad on the eyes, I feel like this is the original SimCity (as sated before, a bit of a graphical polish would amp this game's general apeal way up and would make more people at least try it, I recommended this game to a friend and he said ""It looks so menu intensive and full of data; it just doesn't look like my game."") As stated by the people over at Extra Credits, this game does not hand-hold in any shape or form(there is a bit of a tutorial but it barely scratches the surface of whatt his game has to offer and it still leaves a newcomer alienated.) There's just so much information not given to you, it's hard to fully grasp what everything does untill it's too late(the detail windows that pop up when you hover over ceratain things need to have more actual, and more literal, descriptions of what exactly things do)And for all you Reddit junkies out there:TL;DR:This is an immensly complex game which will not only immerse you in detail and content, it will drown you in it. The UI and the game in general feeld oudated because of the lack of graphical polish and optimization. With this deep world comes a dificulty curve that's so steep, it's essentally a brick wall; but once you climb over it, the reward is almost priceless.			"

												         By far one of the most in-depth grand strategy games I have played. I am impresssed with the detail put into each nation, such as the various parties and individuals of national cabinets. Overall, everything seems to have a good amount of detail in it, from tech to diplomacy, even the map with varried terrains and climates affecting troop movement and success in battle.I highly recomend this game.

												Hearts of Iron 3 may not be as extraordinarily in depth as say, Crusader Kings 2, or Victoria 2, but it offers really great gameplay to alter your place in the Post-World War 1 era.  With the appropriate DLCs you'll be able to say, take France out of the Allies and have them join the Axis, so Paris wouldn't fall to Germany, and could instead help them against England.			"

												my current campaign i am playing as Japan. by the year 1939 i have conqured Indochina,shanxi,nationalis-china and communist china. Guanxi Klik has also joined the axis. I am currently putting forces on the border of xiebesanma. Meanwhile The US puts a embargo on the Axis powers but is then attacked by the allies!!!!! so there is currently a atlantic war raging between the USA and The Allies. Mexico which has joined the axis has taken many british holdings in central america and a showdown between brazil and argentina looks very likely as argentina rockets towards the axis and brazil to the allies.In europe Germany has decided NOT to invade poland. and has instead conquered france and formed a vichy france 3 times bigger then it was historically. While taking down denmark. Im not quite sure what they are planning since its 1939 and they should have attacked poland by then. Ireland joined the axis and was then completely destroyed by Britain sadley. And finally in oceania Australia and New Zealand join the axis and fight the neatherlands in new guniea. A new kokoda track between australia and holland! XDthe year is 1939 and the world has gone mad.i look forward to playing black ice next or the man in the high castle modGET THIS GAME			"

												Hearts of Iron 3 is a marvelus game and a real treasuremine if you like strategy games. The game offers you enormus fredom as in you can play as any country that exsisted in the years 1936-1948.  The expansion packs are a nice feature too but if you like expansion packs i recomend you buy the Theyre Finest Hour one. It has the most potentian as in warfare politics espionage and overaly it improves the game. Yes this game is a pain in the *** to lern and start whit its complexenes, but when you get the hang of it (after playing for about 6) hours you know the basics and are abel to start playing. Hopefully theyre new game HOI4 witch would be relesed in 2015 exceds this one in inovation new units and tactics.			"

												Its a complete pile of junk in terms of how it seems to run, constant glitches and crashes, more issues then you can count. and i love every second of it. Why?Because this is more then likely the most content rich, most enjoyable, most mindbowingly entertaining indepth stratagy games i have ever played. i will run through my issues with it first to get it out of the way.-lack of power behind airforce.Not only does it feel like it takes an eternity to build an airforce that wont be swept out of the air in seconds, but even if you completely out gun your opponent in terms of bombing power, or ground attack planes, they seem to do very little. air power is what won the war in the pacific, and what kept great britain alive, but in this, your airforce either get shot down in seconds from the ground, or they can sit over an enemy force for months and do jack all. it starts to feel like a complete after thought, why would i invest in bombers or fighters when i can simply build anti air in major cities, and mobile anti air for my army? why build bombers when they do minimul damage, even when your in full scale combat, a time you would think the enemy would be simplist to be hit. it feels hollow and empty, especially when certain nations dont have the tech they should, why am i starting without proper radio tech as britain? they created chain home, which i have built, but i dont have the tech to build more?-most add ons to provinces. this is a pretty big one. i had to go through wiki pages and asking uestions on help forums to figure out exactly what all the numbers ment in forts, naval fortresses, anti air guns ext. I know as a gamer that two naval forts are better then one, but in terms of game mechanics i have no way to guage it on my own. it will usually say +2 from fort. plus two to what? defence? hard attack? soft attack? naps? it has so many numbers and stats flying everywhere that it forgets to properly explain most of them, even in the tutorials.-navy. this sorta goes with aircraft feeling useless. during the second world war, the british empire quickly found out that the battleship was not longer the king of the ocean, after one of theres was sunk minutes after leaving port for the first time. but not here. because aircraft feels so useless, it come down to min maxing your ship composition, it takes a year or more to build one aircraft carrior (which yes i know it takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of time to build a ship) not to mention the upgrades to make it worth a damn, which take up valuble time that you could use for upping production. i have been able to win several games with only building destroyers and light cruisers, maxing out there weapons and armor, and building them on mass. because much like the air combat, it  feels poorly done.-casulties. very small complaint, battles feel.... incredibly small scale. if i send an army of say... 20,000 infantry and a few thousand artillary pieces against the same amount of infantry, once the battle is over, you will most likely have only last a handfull of men, a few hundread, maybe. i understand its ust numbers, but it makes historical events feel so small. landing on a heavily defended beach? eh.... 200 dead. firebombing capital as your military marches over it? 20 dead. as i said, its incredibly small scale, but in a game so indepth, i would expect them to pay attention to those small details. my men in hongkong had full supply, and were dug in as well as possible, had air support, and full moral this should have been a meat grinder for both sides, but my guys throw up there hands after 30 of them drop and leave there fortress of a city. and how many japanese did they take? 56-lastly there is a feeling of ultimatly missing somthing. perhaps it could have been fixed by letting me start a few years before it does now, or staying into the early days of the cold war. its just missing somthing. if i drop 14 atom bombs on germany they still wont give up, why? why does an atom bomb not destroy a city completely? why does it barely hurt a military force, only there moral? why can my naval forts not deal slight damage to ships that pass close by them? isnt that what those huge anti ship guns were for? why cant i trash everything as i retreat as russia? and most importantly, why do some of the lesser great powers feel so boring? why does canada play the same as chile? why does norway play the same as communist china? because there missing personal flair. and you might think its impossible to have that, but they have in crusader kings 2. now thats a completely different type of game yeah, but it still lets you have more control to have your own fun. why not let me have a bigger hand in designing my tanks, like choosing from a list of guns, rather then one flat out being better (which they werent) why not let me choose who i conscript for, like my airforce to speed up there recovery like the english did in the battle of britain. hell let me edit my own political party, sure it might not be historically accurate, but the great thing about these games is, its historically accurate up until the player enters the game.now enough of my complaining. the good.+Oh wow them tactics. i still dont get it half the time, numbers slip by you, hard attack vs soft attack, defence bonus, flanking bonus, composition bonus blah blah blah. i dont care.  its an amazing feeling when  you set up the perfect plan to hold back the germans before they can take paris, as you spend every ounce of strength you have to ust barely screech them to a halt. its a fantastic feeling to plan and execute raids on areas to try and liberate them, send a small force to bring greece back into the fight and so on. its great.+The tech. oh lordy its amazing.... just... look at it. so indepth, and i love it. 10/10 would get all agriculture again.+Freedom of choice. you wanna be mexico? how about poland? why not just play south africa? you can. any nation that was around at the time, play it. love it.long story short, there are alot of little things that might♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, bt at the end of the day, i have went through all that, and i still find myself turning it back on. because i love it. and i hope you will aswell.

If you haven't played these types of games before, don't worry. It'll be hard at first, but after a while it will be very simple to understand it. There are many guides, and tutorials on how to play, and for help online, in case you have a question or need help in general, which I find great as to how helpful it's community can be. Anyways, I rate it a 10/10 due to multiple reasons, one of many being the simple fact that you get to play as the axis, which is rare for a videogame.			"

												I adore this game. It's intensity is riveting as well as abrasive. I bought it and played for a couple of hours, but soon dropped it, after playing as the US. I recently picked it up again and found myself entranced, playing Germany. ""Five more minutes and I'll go to bed."" *Five hours later* My recommendation for others is to start as Germany and truly understand the mechanics of combat, leadership, and national events. It is also exciting to watch the socialist parties grow in the United States, Britain, and France. The US was too big for me at first, as I struggled to handle the drastic management requirements. I look forward to the upgrade in HOI4.			"

												This is a great game, really. After many hours of playing it, I would have to say that I truly recommend this game to others. If you haven't played these types of games before, don't worry. It'll be hard at first, but after a while it will be very simple to understand it. There are many guides, and tutorials on how to play, and for help online, in case you have a question or need help in general, which I find great as to how helpful it's community can be. Anyways, I rate it a 10/10 due to multiple reasons, one of many being the simple fact that you get to play as the axis, which is rare for a videogame.			"

												An amazing game without doubt. For the lovers of WW2 and Paradox-style strategy games, this one is a must-have. Even though it focusses a bit too much on warfare, leaving the gamepay on peace times a bit dull and some times even lame and tireful, the war time gameplay is absolutely astonishing. It's highly tatic and strategic style makes it a very historically accurate game, together with the outstanding work and effor that was put in researching political party's names, political figures and their pics of each different country, makes playing with each country a completely different and immersive experience.

												This game can be complex at first. It might take a while getting used to, but if you are a world war II buff, definitely get this. Especially so  if you felt like Hearts of Iron IV was not even a challenge at all. Seriously, 200 hours on HOI 3 and all I got to show for it are 2 full games playing as Germany Conquering the world and some random playing of several minors here and there that lasted until 1939 when♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan and I just quit. Have not even touched any of the Allied or the USSR as I am daunted by the task of playing them. Meanwhile, on HOI 4, everything is simplified and while it gave more flexibility in terms of diplomacy (Major Nations now have national focuses, allowing them to go ahistorical such as France joining the Comintern, as compared to HOI 3 where Factions were considerable more static. AI Italy, in a normal game of HOI 3 would almost certainly join the Axis all the time). While the role playing element was highly fun in HOI 4, the warring side of the game was lacking and did not show any semblence of the depth and micro that HOI 3 had. It simply did not satisfy the military nous within me. Fighting the war in HOI 4 is like colouring in a colouring book. (Assuming you arent doing something insane like world conquest with Tannu Tuva). In the end, you still got a complete picture but it just doesnt feel as satisfying as HOI 3. Fighting in HOI3 is like drawing on a canvas. It was tedious but the picture that you get at the end is damn well more satisfying. You felt like a real commander, microing each individual unit to help you gain victory. You feel more like an accomplished artist, not some 7 year old that was instructed to go shade some circles in a colouring book. You could just hand over your units to AI, much like HOI 4, but you won't cos the AI that controls your units here is rudimentary and should only really be used for garrisoning conquered lands and swatting rebels that pop up. The HOI 4 AI was meh, but it was functioning.Both games are good in my biased opinion (I always dreamt about directing military operations when I was young so this series was pretty much a dream come true for the armchair strategist in me) but both have pros and cons. HOI 3 is much harder to get into and very terrifying for a newbie but it feels more rewarding. HOI 4 is good in that games dont take as long as they do in HOI 3 and it is a much gentler entry into the world of grand strategy than HOI 3 is.TL;DR pick up HOI3 if you want a more complex game then HOI 4.Not that great of a review writer but then again, I am only doing this for a badge.

												I bought this game orginally without any previous experience of any other Paradox game, riding the wave of dissapointed and betrayed feelings after Rome 2:Total War's very rocky launch. I admired the fact that this apperaed to be nearest thing to actually commanding the conflict that one can ever hope to achieve, save for the people who actually fought in it. A very daunting, and perhaps even unfriendly game to beginners, it took me,  a realtively seasoned Strategy player of nearly all the Total War franchise, Company of Heroes and the even older Populous games, a very long time to figure out the games extraordinary complicity, and even today, I have only scratched the surface, after well over 200 hours of playtime. It is a flawed masterpiece however. The games AI, can be rather strange, commiting entire Heersgruppe's to deal with Norway, or in one instance, USA joining the Cominterm due to a pre-existing lend-lease treaty with Soviet Union. Also, those who have had their fill with singleplayer and dare venture forth to Multiplayer, will discover an ardous process of checking checksums, arranging private servers, and endless re-hosts,as Paradox did away with the Meta-server. However, Multiplayer can be very exciting and challenging, and even vetrans of singleplayer can be brought down by the novice in Multiplayer. Another great feature is mods, which deliver unparreled realism and depth, as well as hundreds of hours of playtime. To conclude, as I have said before, this is a flawed masterpiece, but certainly  a masterpiece of nontheless, doing something which, as far as I know, no other game franchise has done before, offering in depth realism of commanding any nation that existed between 1936-1948 in reagards to the Army(Airforce and Navy), Production, Diplomacy, Politics and Espionage. As well as that, it has thousands of real time generals, ministers, and commanders for each nation and party, even if you go a-historical, which is one of the games charms. A game that will never lose it's value or esteem.TL/DRBuy this game because Nazi nukes and Soviet cliches.

												If you're playing Hearts of Iron, then you have been playing variations of World War II. Such variations as Axis and Allies through Gary Grigsby's World at War. Hearts of Iron (HOI) is the most detailed WWII game i've ever played. Not only is the military detailed, the very foundation of your nation is at your control; determining Research and Int'l Trade. The game interface allows you to play any nation on the planet, no matter how uninvolved they may have been. Some fascinating games I've played include Romania, Yugoslavia, Norway, and Spain. The game has scenarios, or start in 1936 and plan the entire war. It is a real time game, pause is avail but has a (2 min) timer which permits others to release it. So, if you're REALLY ready to run the entire nationm starting in 1936, while deciding what to build (months are usually req'd per unit), and how 'buffed' they are with your research! Are your troops receiving enough supplies? Is your infrastructure in need of explansion? Are you doing the long, slow research for nukes? World War Two at its deepest player involvement!			"

												I've played a lot of the base game and still enjoy it, there is a lot of replayability.  Hearts of Iron 4 just came out, but I like Hearts of Iron 3 too much for me to justify buying it.The game does have a problem on my laptop where it crashes after a couple of hours.  Even with monthly autosaves, crashing on the last week of the month just after I sucessfully microed an entire theatre worth of troops indeed prompted a rage quit or 2.I got all the dlc on a paradox super sale.  I really like the expanded mechanics, especially on the intelegence screen, where I can coup places who have enough opposition party support.  In a recent interview, Josef Stalin agrees: ""The whole new coup mechanic makes speading the worker's revolution overseas so much easier, I could not imagine my life now without this wonderful product""8/10, would watch the world burn again.

Rather limited options for doing anything, and unless you know the tricks you'll be doing absolutely nothing the first half of the game.3. This game is drudgery galore. It's main game-mechanic consist of organizing your troops into a proper chain of command. Doing this is about as time-consuming as in real life. A clunky and unintuitive interface makes this chore into your own personal hell.4. HoI3 is spent waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never does.5.

												The game set high expectations but fail to deliver in too many areas. The bottom line is the game is very complex, unfortunately although I took the time to learn the various mechanisms, what I found behind the complexity screen was very disapointing and a bit holow for a strategy game which such high claims. It is not a completely empty shell, but the ratio of complexity vs substance is really bad IMO. HoI2 had a better playability overall.A major issue is also technical bug and glitches, just check the forums. it is a pity that after several expansions, and many patchs, that the game is still unstable.The game piles features upon features, but that didn't add up to make neither a interesting nor fun experience. From HoI 2 to HoI 3, each sub-systems increased in complexity, but this feels really gratuitous, as despite the complexity, the un-modded game is a poor political and historical simulation.. What the point in making such a complex game if the game so quickly move into fantasy land. in one game as the Germans, while I was dealing with Poland, Italy invaded France through the Alps in early 1939. In the end Italy reachedd Paris by the south in July 1939, at the same time I reached it from the north by the historical path. It so badly fails to reproduce the historical course of events, I won't give him any credits for portraying ""alternative history"" Worse for a WW2 game, the military operations are poorly implemented. Moving units is tedious, and combat feedback is very poor, you neither feel as a frontline commander, nor as a HQ staff officer planning operations. The idea of making a pseudo real time game (actually the game move in 1 hours increments), doesn't work so well with such a long and intense conflict. Micro managements is very high, but the tools and interface to give you orders are inferior to many 4X games.You can delegate a number of functions to the AI, however the AI is just bad even for simple thing. In fact it doesn't work well because if you pursue a specific strategy the AI assistance won't go in the same direction as you. For example setting trade on AI automation, the AI sold critical ressources I was in short supply instead of buying them. Another exmaple setting part of my units under AI control, I had the surprise that he AI abandoned the French Frontier in 1940 to move to the Eastern front leaving the border vacant.There is an important supply and command chain in the game: Division>Corps HQ>Army HQ>Army Group HQ>Theater HQ. However after a few days of battle your units can easily get messed aroundq the frontline as you react to enemy threats. Yet, tracking which units belong to which HQ is not easy as units and HQs are not color coded as in other games. Hence you spend hours unlinking and re-linking your units after every major operations. This is a real chore, and computer assistance is pathetic for such a mechanical task.The game attempt to do too many things at once but the end result is a failure.			"

												Hearts of Iron 3 explores the thrilling history of World War 2, from the onset of the infamous war, to Nazi Germany's demise (or victory). Although the game does usually follow the real-world timeline, what-if scenarios can occur at any time, such as Japan invading Siberia, or a communist revolution in France, or even... the fabled Axis victory. Being able to strategize is a MUST, in HOI3, giving minescule armies the ability to conquer a colossal military force. If handling the military isn't really your thing, you can delve straight into politics. From firing Stalin (and probably sending him to perish in Eastern Siberia), to giving the German people, the right to vote, and hate the Nazi party. The other main part of Hearts of Iron 3, is diplomacy. A neat chart, allows players to see where their nation is on the political spectrum, and which alliance (Allies, Axis, Comintern) they're drifting towards. And so much more. I highly recommend the third installation of the Hearts of Iron series, and would pay more than double the price for this legendary game. Darkest Hour is better though.			"

												By far one of the greatest games I have ever played. I love the aspect of taking on any nation in history and just changing history. I for example went as Communist China and defeated Japan in mainland China then annexed the rest of China before the 2nd Chinese civil war ever kicked off. It was awesome! My only issue is that Tech should research perhaps a bit faster to match the pace that people were actually inventing new technologies in the war. Also making fleets and airforces much easier to manage wouldn't hurt at all.			"

												 where does one start with a game as conceptually hugamungus as this? Playing Hearts of Iron can be mentally taxing, intimidating, and utterly compelling all at the same time, and there’s no easy way to ‘sum it up’. But for want of a better topic, we’ll focus on what’s new, the most obvious being the graphics. Using an entirely new engine, Hearst of Iron III has been brought visually more in line with Paradox’s other flagship title, Europa Universalis III, making a shift from 2D to 3D. Counters, whilst still present at a certain level of magnification, have been replaced by generic 3D sprites to represent the different kinds of military units. The world map itself has been giving colour and life, with the different land types been visually represented. The only flaw to be had here is that the developers seem to have gotten rid of a lot of the urbanised areas, which is a shame because urban fighting was a major hallmark of this conflict.Not only are the graphics better, but the game ‘world’ has gotten bigger. Just as Empire: Total War shrunk the number of land provinces available to conquer, so have Paradox increased them, to the tune of around 14,000. That, coupled with the 100 + playable nations, means that this game is clearly the largest yet.The other ‘big’ changes are mainly to do with the AI and player interface. With a new streamlined military organisation system in the form of official ‘headquarter’ units, it’s possible to ‘assign’ the AI to various parts of your army. Whilst useless in combat, HQ units provide structure to sometimes unmanageably huge armies, and posse’s different levels, the top being the ‘Theatre’ command. Let’s say you’re playing as Germany, and World War II is about to start. Don’t fancy managing both the Easter and Western fronts? Simply tell the AI to control one of them. Assign it overall goals and objectives, and you can pretty much leave it be. Whilst the AI seems to get slightly dumber the lower down the command chain you go, it nevertheless proves to be a decently made system, and is definitely one of the games strong points.Indeed, this idea of AI control is a subtle theme running through the game, as you can assign pretty much everything to the AI, with minimal input. Reminiscent of Nintendo’s up-coming ‘Demo play’ feature, it begs to question why anyone would want to simply watch the game being played, but sectioning off certain areas to the AI’s commands can certainly make things easier on players who find the level of depth intimidating. There are a whole host of other minor improvements as well, such as the ability to customize divisions (the basic military unit of a game) mixing and matching the various brigades to form dynamic and diverse armies. However, most of these you will have to find out for yourself.			"

												I love in-depth strategy games, but this game is truly a pain in the a** to learn. It is incredibly convoluted and tedious, and to make it even worse, the tutorial that comes with it barely scratches the surface of what one needs to know in order to play successfully. What is important and what isn't? If you were to decide to do something, how do you go about doing it? You'll be left guessing at every step of the way. This program is better suited for someone who actually wants to study real military tactics of WWII rather than have fun playing a strategy game.			"

So it was no longer possible to get a Refund..Overall the Game is great, but if you are thinking of buying this game on Mac i would recommend buying it on the Appstore. It will give you the best experience, the game being updated, multiplayer, all the dlc's, fixes and new scenarios to play. 5/3 Would buy it a third time			"

												Hearts of Iron 3 is a real-time strategy game that places you in 1936 as a leader of a country just as World War 2 unfolds. You will be commanding troops, handling politics, and trying to keep your country alive. There is no real way to ""win"" the game as the real victory comes from achieving goals that you set up for yourself. Maybe you want the United States to become a member of the Axis or maybe you want to take a minor power and transform it into a super power; the choice is yours. Of course there is ""realism"" mode where everything plays out as it did in real life.I highly recommend getting the DLCs ""For the Motherland"" and ""Their Finest Hour"" just be warned that you MUST have them in that order, just getting ""Their Finest Hour"" will not allow you to play the game. The learning curve is also very steep, but after a couple of games you will figure everything out and will still learn new things later on.Hearts of iron 3 is a great RTS and it gets my seal of approval.A+ "

												I've tried all the major powers in Hearts of Iron: Germany, France, USSR, UK , US, and Japan. If you really want to develop an alternate history, you have to begin in 1936. The most difficult country to play as is Japan. The essential elements for success in this game are leadership and industrial capacity. Japan and France are both challenged in these areas. The easiest country to play is definitely the US. By begining in 1936, the US can concentrate on research and building industrial capacity BEFORE building units. To my mind, the worst mistake made by the Western powers was letting Republican Spain be conquered by the Fascists. If France, UK, and US had gauranteed Republican Spain's soverignty, they could never have been driven out of Europe in 1940. Worst case scenario, they could have retreated to Spain, and continued the war from there. Should the US joine the Allies early? No. Even if they have to support Spain alone, it is very important for the US to preserve it's freedom of action. In a game that I played as the US, Spain actually drifted to the Fascists BECAUSE the UK was bombing Spainish infrastructure. Defeat the Nationalists in Spain:yes. Destroy their country in the proxess:no.			"

												I love this game, its given me hours of fun and it led me to getting into the other paradox games, which are all absoultely fantastic.However there are some problems with the game, the learning curve is the most obvious and the most unattractive problem in the game, however, once you play it maybe one or two games you should get it fairly well.Another problem is that the game tends to crash, and when playing at a slow speed, means the loss of your save data quite a bit, however this may just be a problem with my computer, while yours may run the game fine.Either way this is a great game and I suggest it to anyone who wants to get into Paradox or if you love strategy games in general.

												Back when I was younger, when the original Playstation was still a thing, Paradox produced a LOT of rushed video games to cash in on the hype of what some refer to today as the ""90s WW2 craze"". These games shared many of the same qualities and problems: Shoestring budgets, tiny production teams, and camera issues up the wazoo. They also made convenient birthday gifts among the lads and even some girls; Mind you, this was back when gaming was still an almost invariably ""guy"" thing to do. Nevertheless, every kid I knew, regardless of gender, played them, as the characters were familiar, the gameplay was usually self-explanatory, and, if you got a PC version, you had the added satisfaction of spending so much time on Dad's work computer (and subsequently getting in his way) that when your next birthday came around, your folks caved in and bought you a computer of your own.A shining example of one of these games was Hearts of Iron 1, released toward the end of this era, in 2002. I remember sliding it into the disc tray one hot Saturday afternoon, and I remember being grounded for screaming frustrated obscenities at my monitor within earshot of my parents shortly after.The game was difficult. Apart from the camera issues I mentioned, there were also the instant deathtraps, the ridiculous distance between checkpoints, the strange projectile controls, and the worst micro I've ever had to do in any grand strategy game, but you know what? I couldn't put the game down. Despite its glaring faults, I pressed on, mainly to see just how hard it could get. Along the way, I discovered some fairer parts that I willingly replayed, along with a great soundtrack. More importantly, I became accustomed to challenge, and the satisfaction of finishing a campaign hammered into my mind that overcoming the constant obstacles was really what made games worth playing, as long as it gave me some type of pleasure to do so, but this isn't what I'm really here to talk about.This... this is Hearts of Iron 3... I don't know if this really qualifies as a game. If there is a way to fail at this, I have yet to experience it. If there is a way to not feel intensely bored as I slog through it, that, too, remains a mystery. If there is a ""challenge"", it must be hidden somewhere in the repetitive routines, if it exists at all.I mean, I get it. The game is targeted at little girls. Maybe I just feel sour at this younger generation for not suffering through their childhood with tough video games like everyone else did, but at the same time, I honestly feel that the target audience is getting a raw deal.The controls are terrible, and cannot be rebound. The graphics are bad. 2D objects are featured far too often, both in the foreground and in the background, in the most obtuse and noticeable way possible. Hitler's portrait picture, specifically that where he's lying on the beach, showcases this to an appalling extent. Speaking of Hitler, why are his eyes bugging out in two different directions? Did the designers never see his model in the Wolfenstein games? That is how you do it, and those were on the SNES, about three decades ago! Don't even get me started on how Churchill looks here...Of course, the biggest problem is just how boring this game is, and how many things exist purely for the sake of being a distraction. As far as I can tell, Blondie (Hitler's dog!) has no reason to exist, except maybe for screenshots to brag about on the internet, and to stretch the game out by mere minutes in giving the player something to customize beyond the army! Most of the campaigns are the same puzzles and micro over and over again, just with variations in theme (Poland, France, Kuwait etc..), all the while the player is receiving constant verbal reinforcement of ""You did it!"" and ""Well done!""Perhaps the most striking thing I noticed is how the player is occasionally not just told to make war or kill civilians, but to *please* make war, or *please* kill civilians. The implications of this are scary. One, is that the game is either well-aware of the fact that it's an active chore to play through. The other, is that it is just coddling the player, the chilling shadow of soccer moms that I felt myself when I was a kid. They ruined trading card games, they ruined cartoons, and now, they've video games. This, ladies and gentlemen, is Obama's America.			"

												As a WW2 History buff, this is the only game I have ever known to titilate and fulfill my hunger for the ""What-ifs""... the ""alternative"" history of WW2. Imagine the Third Reich invading the American east coast. Imagine the Japanese Empire victorious in its attempt to dominate Asia and the Pacific. Imagine Soviet Russia at war with the Allies, or billion other scenarios in the mix. Imagine? Hell, with this game, you can play it out!Right the wrongs of the past, or do the opposite. Fight for Facsism or Unite the World under Communism. Liberate the world for democracy or swallow it whole under the Iron Cross, this game is at your command.Yet for all its grandoise, for all its freedom in choice, this game has it flaws. Bugs are annoying, there are some restrictions in gameplay, and severe patience is required for the slowness of its gameplay and pace. At its worse, it is a confusing, overwhelming mess of a game. At its best, it is the most awesome WW2 Sim ever.			"

												Great game! But be aware. If you buy it on Mac you will get an outdated game (v1.04. When the updated version is v4.02) So you won't be able to play multiplayer. And you can't get the dlc's either.I did this, and wasted 9.99€, 3 days before the 1.99€ sale.. And unfortunatly I played the game more than 2 hours before I tried Multiplayer. So it was no longer possible to get a Refund..Overall the Game is great, but if you are thinking of buying this game on Mac i would recommend buying it on the Appstore. It will give you the best experience, the game being updated, multiplayer, all the dlc's, fixes and new scenarios to play. 5/3 Would buy it a third time			"

												New gameplay in battle. To many units and to many provinces to take care of. Its really good that they introduced a new system to take care of all that and make the ai take care of the big fronts, becouse its really hard. It tok probobly 20 hours before I figure out the basics of the new system. AI-controlled battle. Felt strange. And I dont know if I like it. I dont think I want that many provices to take care of. They solved a problem they themselfs created. I liked it how it was in Hearts of Iron 1 and 2. But the tech tree is fun again. Not as fun as Hearts of Iron 1, but better than 2. Spionage is nice, and there is much to do, but I really dont see where it makes any different in the war. Diplomacy is as always lacking. Its so seldom I can do what I want or what feels realistic in the game. Trade in the other hand is better than before. Not perfect, but its easier now to build some more IC without lacking in resurses.Its a harder game, but little more fun, but it took some steps back i some parts. Its nice with brigade units, but its not when 150 german or sovjet division becomes 450-600 brigades on the map and even more, now when they need HQ to form up the divisions and amies. Its an awsome amount of units, and for me the change makes me less interested in directing the battle as in the earlyer games.Becouse of it. its with a small margin that i recommend this game.			"

If you are new to the game I recommend you taking Germany since they start in a very good situation and then start allying all the countries you can. Italy is a obvious joice, also Bulgaria and eventually Nationalist Spain might be good allies. Once as Germany I allied Communist China so a lot of things is still possible!			"

Much better than the previous HOI and HOI2.I know that some are a bit sceptical and think the game is ""overwhelming"" at start, but it really isn't. It may look scary, but it is not really a ""complicated"" game to learn. The game is old, but I still play it. And with some of the community mods made, the game will probably last for years. If not HOI4 takes it out... But untill HOI4 is out, this is a great buy, and now at a low cost too. A ridiculously low price actually. This is Paradox best game. No doubt!

The only way it could be better is if they made it longer or made a few more of the smaller countries salvagable with shrewd management(lets face it, if you're not one of 8 or 9 major powers you're a nobody in this one).  Either of those solutions would add a lot of replayability.  Absolutely love the research and the land combat.  Sea combat and air power are nerfed and play a little wonky.8.5/10 "

												This is a complex and difficult game, but in a good way - much like Crusader Kings 2. If you make a comparison between HoI3 and Victoria 2 for instance you'll see that your actions have very significant impacts on HoI3, while in Victoria 2 - the impacts are delayed and not as obvious. The game lets you control a lot, maybe too much about your nation and takes a long time to play through, but if you can manage to learn the game - I promise you a lovely experience.			"

												I look forward to HOI4 with excitement and a little bit of unease. Hearts of Iron 3 was perhaps not that good a game from the start, but with all expension added later, this was a winner in my opinion. This is the game I have played by far the most. Much better than the previous HOI and HOI2.I know that some are a bit sceptical and think the game is ""overwhelming"" at start, but it really isn't. It may look scary, but it is not really a ""complicated"" game to learn. The game is old, but I still play it. And with some of the community mods made, the game will probably last for years. If not HOI4 takes it out... But untill HOI4 is out, this is a great buy, and now at a low cost too. A ridiculously low price actually. This is Paradox best game. No doubt! It may not have the ""fancy"" graphics from EU4 and CK2... but who cares.			"

Apparently they were alied with Germany and Italy and i got destroyed even though my glorious army managed to hold them back a while.  After another 10000+ tutorials i have decided to start as Italy. Things were going well, Ethiopia, a quarter of Switzerland , a small part of Yugoslavia, Albania and a third of Bulgaria were mine. My advanced intelect made me attack France, which was allied with the Allies (nice faction name) and even though me and Germany were slowly advancing in France, my African teritories were crippled by the Brits.

												Paradox - the masters of grand stategy. This is one of their classics along with Crusaider Kings and Europa Universalis. This time in World War 2. Less focus on diplomacy and more on grand scale tactics. Huge deph but sadly the scale of the game can be intimidating to beginners and even veterans of other Paradox games. But for the few who cannot get enough of depth and love to tinker between technology, kinds of army battalions and large scale tactics this is really the only game for you. Sadly it stuffers from a terrible net-code, bugs and crashes that Paradox is either unable or unwilling to ever fix. Problems that sadly persist in most of their games.			"

												I can safely say this is one of the best real time strategy games I have ever played. The accuracy of the history, units, commanders, map etc is unprecedented and I have never seen so much detail in a strategy game. Each country has it's own real military commanders and you're offered decisions that you can either make or ignore which caan change the course of history. You can influence other nations, declare war, trade and embargo them. Each new save is always a new experience, especially when playing as a different country each time, whether it be Germany, Soviet Union, Nationalist China, Australia, Siam, Sweden or whatever country you want. Each country has their own strategic and industrial advantages and disadvantages and creates a challenge every playthrough. I feel that although the vanilla game is brilliant on its own, it just isn't the same without the major DLC packs. However I believe that purchasing the DLC was a worthwhile investment. There really isn't anything negative I can say about this game, apart from the occasional crash and the lack of a multiplayer game browser, making it more difficult to get involved with others. I rarely give a game a 10/10, but the pros most certainly outweigh the cons so Hearts of Iron III gets a well deserved 10/10.			"

Only get that, don't bother with the other DLC's.I love it, so... idk, buy it if you want a multi tasking giant of a WW2 strategy game.			"

												This is a good game.  However, be careful about purchasing the DLC.As I discovered to my cost some of the DLC is badly programmed and is incompatible with other packages.  In particualr be careful about buying and installing 'Their Finest Hour' if you have either of the Dies Irae mods installed.  I made this mistake and it destroyed my enitre game making it completely unplayable until I was able to remove it again and repair the 103 critical files it had deleted in the process.This is particularly easy to do as Steam are actually selling both the Dies Irae mods and Their Finest Hour in the same DLC bundle without printing a warning about the consequences of installing them.The order of installation is also improtant if you want the game to work, even though this isn't explained in any of the DLC notes.The following orders should work:Either:-1. Semper Fi2. For The Motherland3. Their Finest Hour.or:1. Semper Fi2. For the Motherland3. Dies Irae Götterdämmerung or Dies Irae Stars and StripesBut not Their Finest Hour and Dies Irae or your game will refuse to load at all.			"

												Recently bought this game after seeing some videoes of it on Youtube (Thanks DiplexHeatedHD). Hearts of Iron 3 is a game that takes place in the years right before and during WW2. You can play as any nation in the world, though I can recommend playing as some kind of major nation (I tried to take over Scandinavia as Norway, didn't work out too well). You can align yourself towards a faction (Axis, Allies or Comintern) and once you join that faction you no longer control your own diplomacy. So if you want to be a rogue state and follow your own rules, keep yourself away from joining any of the three factions. Be aware though, that a lot of the major nations guarantee the lesser nation's independence and you can end up in deep trouble if you get an entire faction on your tail. However as a rogue faction, you can potentially exploit the world war by grabbing territories from unaligned factions creating yourself an Empire, or you can join a faction and fight for victory in the world war.  I gotta say, the game is surprisingly good. Once you jump into a session it's very hard to quit, like today I played as Brazil and I ended up sitting for 7 hours straight because it felt so satisfying when accomplishing stuff such as liberating countries, annexing neighbors and researching new technologies. This is my first paradox game and after playing this for only 15 hours I already feel like I have to buy the expansions in the future and perhaps other paradox games such as Victoria 2. A great strategy game if you like to micro-manage an entire nation's economy, diplomacy, military, technology, politics etc. 9/10, would definitely recommend to all you history-lovers out there.			"

												Paradox - the masters of grand stategy. This is one of their classics along with Crusaider Kings and Europa Universalis. This time in World War 2. Less focus on diplomacy and more on grand scale tactics. Huge deph but sadly the scale of the game can be intimidating to beginners and even veterans of other Paradox games. But for the few who cannot get enough of depth and love to tinker between technology, kinds of army battalions and large scale tactics this is really the only game for you. Sadly it stuffers from a terrible net-code, bugs and crashes that Paradox is either unable or unwilling to ever fix. Problems that sadly persist in most of their games.			"

												I can safely say this is one of the best real time strategy games I have ever played. The accuracy of the history, units, commanders, map etc is unprecedented and I have never seen so much detail in a strategy game. Each country has it's own real military commanders and you're offered decisions that you can either make or ignore which caan change the course of history. You can influence other nations, declare war, trade and embargo them. Each new save is always a new experience, especially when playing as a different country each time, whether it be Germany, Soviet Union, Nationalist China, Australia, Siam, Sweden or whatever country you want. Each country has their own strategic and industrial advantages and disadvantages and creates a challenge every playthrough. I feel that although the vanilla game is brilliant on its own, it just isn't the same without the major DLC packs. However I believe that purchasing the DLC was a worthwhile investment. There really isn't anything negative I can say about this game, apart from the occasional crash and the lack of a multiplayer game browser, making it more difficult to get involved with others. I rarely give a game a 10/10, but the pros most certainly outweigh the cons so Hearts of Iron III gets a well deserved 10/10.			"

												Incredibly detailed game. Play as any nation starting as early as 1936 or as late as 1944. The game runs until 1948 (but most people mod this). Force amplification, intellegence, technology, officer ratio, supply, moral, organisation, weather, time, temperature, headquarters, dissent, and combined arms all play a part into winning a single battle. You MUST pay attention to this in order for success. Requires vast amounts of patience and time in order to complete a campaign successfuly, as long as you're not playing as the USSR, United States, or UK, the game can be very hard.			"

If you like command level war games, this a 'must' have.Pro's:- Richly rewarding gaming experience once you get over the learning curve.- Can play minor countries like Romania, and change to a different country if you wish.- High replay value.- Fun trying to gain an advantage with technologies.- Multiplayer is fun.Cons:- Steep learning curve.- Air units are tedious to use for the value they provide.- Naval combat is unsatisfying.

												  After some tutorials, decided to start as Romania. I had a lot of troops, so after some upgrades i've decided to attack Hungary. Apparently they were alied with Germany and Italy and i got destroyed even though my glorious army managed to hold them back a while.  After another 10000+ tutorials i have decided to start as Italy. Things were going well, Ethiopia, a quarter of Switzerland , a small part of Yugoslavia, Albania and a third of Bulgaria were mine. My advanced intelect made me attack France, which was allied with the Allies (nice faction name) and even though me and Germany were slowly advancing in France, my African teritories were crippled by the Brits. It was a very hard war and suddenly... hoi3.exe crashed... 10/10 would get crashed again			"

												As a veteran of this series I can say that this is the best out of all of them. For beginners this is an ideal entry to the series as you can have the AI control almost everything and you still get to influence what is happening and feel like a leader. For veterans like myself you can still micromanage as much as you want. The ability to build custom divisions adds another layer of depth. You get a special sense of satisfaction from moving your elite divisions to strategic points to break the enemy!Like most paradox games this one has its bugs. Most of them have been ironed out however this game often crashes on me. I found that weekly autosave and not using max speed during periods of intense warfare drasticly reduces that crash rate. Even after a crash starting from my last save is no big deal. This doesn't make me love this game any less, however the problem is still there.All of the expansion packs are great and really deepen the experience. There is also an abundance of mods available that are easy to install.			"

												Steam refund of Max 2 hours play can be easy passed by watching the in game tutorial, which is a waste of time. The information you need to know and how it interworks is overwhelming in campaigns, just isn’t there in the in game tutorial you end up by just trying clicking and see what happens. The best information I found after a long time researching was the Michael Broschek series on You Tube split into bit sized episodes about 12, 15 mins long. Most other on line tutorials are basically long winded talks, get ready for some racist comments as well. Interface like in game tutorial is a waste compared to other games in game is off putting at least, really just click and see what happens. Unit counters have got too much info in too little space, but everything you need to know. Understanding this is critical too military manoeuvres and combat and on a campaign level of a couple hundred units, mm eye sight and computer screen well be you most nasty adversarial opponent. This is a game with a pen and a A4 pad of paper for memory for strategy, production, technology convoys etc. between playing.  The add on packages I never got to work so a waste of money at least.

												You know, I played the game for a while, and I had read reviews with people saying ""it keeps crashing, I can't play it,"" I thought I had an updated version of the game and they hadn't changed their reviews, I thought they were wrong. That was me without ANY of the dlc. A while back I bought all the dlc because it was on sale, and that's where I saw what they were talking about. I load up the game, everything looks the same, I go to load my save data and crash. It angered me a little because it takes a few minutes to actually load up the game. Anyways, after starting the game up and sitting through the loading screen, I go to load my save data again, and it crashed again. After that, I thought that maybe those reviewers were right, that the game can't go without crashing. After those two, I thought third time has to be the charm, and I try one last time. I start the game up, sit through the loading screen, but this time, I start a new game, as the game might not have been able to load the vanilla save for whatever reason, pick Germany, about 30 seconds later, it crashes again. It's at this point I stopped playing. If you're going to buy this game, sure go ahead, but don't buy the dlc, or you won't be able to play the game ever unless someone had to make a patch since the devs can't or won't.			"

												Can't recommend this game. The research, diplomacy and espionage part of the game is really cool.  Creating customized corps is fun.The downside is that managing wars(moving armies around) is very laborious.  Units can't really die unless being encircled so you basically have to orchestrate lines of units to do so.  The fighting style is Cruisader King or Europa Universalis.  Army, Navy and Air units are somehow hard to make them do what your want.Can't say I've enjoyed giving control of my military to AI neither.A lot of nice concepts with poor gameplay.			"

												This is a game based on the second world war,although there are bunch of mods where you can for example play in the first world war or create a country called Isis by tampering with the game files.PROS:-Good game conquered Sweden,Norway and Denmark with Finland (SUOMI KARJALA VIINA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).-Play as the Third Reich aka germany and stop communism (also invade poland and kill some jews).-You can choose to play as any country you want to.CONS:-The game has some problems with multicore cpu's, so it's best to limit the cpu affinity to one core from task manager while playing the game-If you don't limit the cpu affinity to one the game will be slow and eventually will crash. NOTE: This has happened to me many times and it works fine when the affinity is one BUT this might not occur on your PC.3/5 I would recommend this game, and play as Finland and create SUUR-SUOMI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												This game is awesome.You can play as any country before during and after World War IIIt runs from 1936 to 1948, but you can play longer than that with mods.You can control all aspects of the country, politics, diplomacy, espionage, military, everything.There are multiple start dates that go from early 1936, to mid 1944.Each start date has everything set up as it was in the world at that time.The earlier you start, the more you can change history.There are also multiple specfic scenarios to chose from, such as the Spanish civil war, the winter war, initial Japanese expansion into south east Asia, the Battle of the Buldge, etc.There 3 factions in the game; The Allies *Capitalist, democracy* Britain is the leader, and is the only member other than France from the beginning.The Comintern *Communist* The Soviets are the leader, and the only member from the start.The Axis *Fascist* The Nazis are the leader, and the only member from the start.Any country in the game can join any of the factions, as long as certain requirements are met. One time I got America into the Axis, and it was a serious ""Where is your god now?"" kind of moment.Anyways, it's an amazing game, and it has multiplayer, I would love to play it with some people.I highly recommend it, playing alone or with others.

												Very dissapointed actually.  I mean, it seems as though it would be a fantastic game to get into.  Really quite my style.  However, there seem to be so many issues with compatibility that crash issues abound.  Their forum is full of people with issues, and pages of potential fixes.  In the end, none of it worked for me.Additionally, they have packaged all the versions together, but Their Finest Hour should really be on it's own.  TFH is not compatible with the base game, Semper Fi, or For the Motherland.  So it uses a different launcher, and you can't select the other mods to play.  You have to go into your files folders and start the other launcher or launch the specific game version directly.In the end, the continued crashing has ended my play of Hoi3.  A real drag, cause I think it would have been great for me.STEAM, you should really address this one, and fix how the versions are packaged, at the least. "

Best of the best for what it was meant for, but it's for a select few This game is the most sophisticated game I've ever seen. It takes it's strategy elements in the world map you are presented and lets you start off as certain countries in certain eras of pre-WWII and WWII itself. However...As I said, this game is sophisticated. It's REALLY complicated, and as long as I've played I've barely been able to rename a few units and move 1 or 2 divisions / fleets. There are so many complicated aspects I could see myself getting into as I get older, but it's just too boring as it is, which I understand. I really respect what it's done and I'm glad it was done the way it was; with no flashy action all over the place all the time. That's not what this game is for or about. But, I just can't recommend this game to a general audience. It's for a very select group of people. For me, I have to give a 6/10, but if I had to grade it's ability to do what it was intended to do, what it was supposed to do, 9-10/10. It's done what it was meant for with excellence, it's just myself not being able to get into this specific type of World Map domination strategy game.			"

												The gameplay is great. (like Hearts of Iron 2)BUT: The game keeps crashing. The game crashes a lot. You can't play the game for an hour without expiriencing a crash. And I say it a fourth time: The game crashes frequently.(The basic game crashes AND the game with all major dlcs crashes too)So  you have to play a lot of parts again because you can't set the autosave lower than 1 time per week (And during war you can easily use a lot of time for one ingame week!!!).This makes me really angry because it ruins my game experience. And I'm not the only one having these crashes. Simply scroll a little bit down and you will see a lot of other people complaining about these issues.So i tell you: don't buy this game until they fix these issues.

												Fantastic Game !Iv'e spent more hours on this game then i care too think off, it's just so addictive.Unlike many strategy games where once you reach something the game is just a boring repeat this game keep's on giving. With all the many nations and different ways you can approach the thousands of situations, This game is challenging with its dynamic gameplay to the extent where even the most experienced strategist would meet his match.I must say though this game is not all true and great, First off there are the bugs and crashes.... Lots of them, Seriously. If you pick this game up save very very very reguarily. I once played as Ze German's for 9 hours, Conquered all of europe and just as i had the soviet union on the verge of capitulation my game crashed and none of it saved, Also don't expect any useful support from the developers, As far as they're concerned this game is dead. Some other useful info :1) Multiplayer does not work, You have to use third party online services to play multiplayer (LAN-Hosting). This can be tedious and is heavily prone to errors and not working.2) There are 3 main DLC for this game, Basically, The Vanilla is only 40% of the game, If you buy ""For The Motherland"", ""Semper FI"" and ""Their Finest Hour"" you will have the full game with lots less bugs and crashes, This is expensive though. Also you have to buy them in the order that i listed, You cannot buy a DLC pack without having the 1/2 packs before it,3) The community for this game is dying, if you have a problem that noone else has faced then dont expect support on it.

												This is without a doubt the most satisfying grand stratagy game to play. I have never played a game where I have felt so legitimately proud of everything I do. Though the learning curve is quite high compared to other grand stratagy on the market, I would say that learning this game is worth allthe effort it takes. The only problem is that it has a tendency to glitch out on my computer. Still. 9/10 would reccomend.			"

												Had some issues getting the game to run, then it ran well for a good 10 hours..Managed to win an axis victory as the German Reich, but the game decided to crash when I tried to screenshot.Now after loading the save, game crashes after any amount of time passes. I guess Moscow will never be mine...After watching some youtube lets plays and guides, this game is still very hard to play. Loads of things I take for granted in games like EU4 and CK2 are just not there. It feels like an old paradox game, which it is.I'm glad HoI4 looks like it's going to be a huge improvement! Still, if you get this game for cheap, its fun enough to play around in. Just let the AI do most of the work for you.			"

												In my top ten favorites.The scale of which the hearts of iron franchise is on is by far the best in any game I have played.I suggest that any future customers buy all three of the major DLC, Their Finest Hour, For The Motherland, and Semper Fi all add in vital and well used features such as OOB and Political options as well as tons of other stuff.Black ICE which you can find on ModDB and on their website is the best mod which adds in hundreds of units, hundreds of events and triggers and improves the overall feel of the game.To play with more than 4gb of RAM which is absolutely vital when playing mods and even the vanilla game you need the podcats hotfix which you can find on the paradox tech support forum.

												As much as I REALLY want to recommend the game, I just can't, even after 700 hours in game. The main reason is that about half of those were spent trying to get the game to work, or replaying parts of the game repeatedly because critical crashes wiped out my data. And no, that did not happen in previous iterations of the game, I am still having crashes that wipe my saves as of September 2015 on a fully patched game on a top of the line rig. In short, if the HOI formula is what you are looking for in a grand strategy game, skip this and go for Darkest Hour (and especially for the Kaiserreich mod) or wait until HOI 4 as it looks like they ironed out all of the major flaws this game had.________________A Few Other Flaws_________________As if the game's crashing issues weren't enough, there are other key design flaws in the game that make it a less than ideal WW2 Grand Strategy game. The AI is a big problem in the game, as it makes for a very underwhelming experience. For instance, the Pacific Theater is completely worthless because Japan almost never invades more than a few islands in Indonesia and always focuses on mainland China. The Pacific War can easily be won in 6 months by beelining straight for the Home Islands. The British routinely stack thousands upon thousands of men in Newfoundland and leave the Isles undefended for a very easy Sealion. When it does fight, the AI favors a straight line in direct combat and will never make use of actual Blitzkrieg tactics such as encirclement. Resources are almost never a factor in the game. Aside from supplies, I have never run out of anything unless I did extremely foolish things. As Germany I never felt the crunch associated with the loss of Swedish Iron that prompted the Invasion of Norway (this isn't even modeled in the game), nor the crippling fuel loss by failing to secure the oilfields of Baku. The map is not just ridiculous looking (probably the worst projection ever made in any game) it is also difficult to use, especially if you opt for sprites instead of counters. Clicking on airbases is sometimes difficult as they are overshadowed by ground units in many provinces. The provinces are not optimized well either, and it is easy to attempt to click one province and have the game register it as the same province thus killing all of your units' progress. Diplomacy is not very functional. While it works in theory, they do not work well. As the Axis your conquests will give you extremely bizarre and nonsensical borders that are both hideous looking and nonfunctional. For instance, as Italy I staged an amphibious invasion in Split and pushed for Belgrade while Germany took the rest. After the surrender, my border was a giant green line going straight into what was Yugoslavia surrounded by German territory. This lead to a strange supply situation where, despite the obvious land connection, my supplies were instead routed via the Adriatic and then up to my garrison in Belgarde, causing undue use of transports that were vulnerable to sub attacks.These are just a few issues that come to mind, but are by no means all of them. Overall I do like the combat compared to other games in the series, but that can't carry the game. I wish Paradox the best as they work on number 4, I am confident they will make it the best one yet. For now though, get Darkest Hour instead of this.			"

However, when I got more into the game it started crashing on me. Currently I cannot play more than 5-10 minutes without it going down. I don't know what happened in the game to have it crash when it was working prior.  This had a lot of potential but the crashes make this unplayable now. I would not recommend this game.

												IDK what the hell the devs were thinking, but if you play Very easy, with a large tech boost as the USSR, and your massive stocks of infantry are wiped out by a single German tank brigade (the said infantry also have alot of supporting armor along with their personal AT devices), there is definately something wrong, not with your strategy, but with the game itself.Not even War thunder, which everyone has said is ""biased"" to one side, doesnt have as much as this game. German tech may be ""better"", but again, level IV upgrades of the majority of your forces, and an increase of officer training lost to a SINGLE tank division, I just cant even begin to explain the complete bias of that.

												Fantastic Game !Iv'e spent more hours on this game then i care too think off, it's just so addictive.Unlike many strategy games where once you reach something the game is just a boring repeat this game keep's on giving. With all the many nations and different ways you can approach the thousands of situations, This game is challenging with its dynamic gameplay to the extent where even the most experienced strategist would meet his match.I must say though this game is not all true and great, First off there are the bugs and crashes.... Lots of them, Seriously. If you pick this game up save very very very reguarily. I once played as Ze German's for 9 hours, Conquered all of europe and just as i had the soviet union on the verge of capitulation my game crashed and none of it saved, Also don't expect any useful support from the developers, As far as they're concerned this game is dead. Some other useful info :1) Multiplayer does not work, You have to use third party online services to play multiplayer (LAN-Hosting). This can be tedious and is heavily prone to errors and not working.2) There are 3 main DLC for this game, Basically, The Vanilla is only 40% of the game, If you buy ""For The Motherland"", ""Semper FI"" and ""Their Finest Hour"" you will have the full game with lots less bugs and crashes, This is expensive though. Also you have to buy them in the order that i listed, You cannot buy a DLC pack without having the 1/2 packs before it,3) The community for this game is dying, if you have a problem that noone else has faced then dont expect support on it. If a forum about it didnt start when the game was new you probably wont find it now.4) Learning Curve, Hell, The learning curve is bloody mount everest ! I've had this game for ages and put countless hours into and i still have only scratched the surface of things you can do, At first glance the game seems complex as a mission to mars, And well... it is :). Do not expect to understand this game right away. Seriously look up how to play it and watch youtube videos, It will save you soo much pain. You may think ""im a pro strategist i can do it"", Seriously, you can't !. This game requires phenomenal amounts of micromanagment. (I like that though)I've probably put you off this game but i hope i didn't. It has its problems (And lots of them) but the hours, time and enjoyment you will place into this game are amazing.Hope i helped you make a descision of whether this game is good for you or not.			"

												I can only say I am very disappointed with Steam's version of HoI3, at least for a Mac.  First, Steam does not carry the expansions for a Mac.  More importantly, it crashes every hour or two.  I  used Steam's ""Verify integrity of game cache"" feature, which said five files were corrupted and reloaded them.  I did this every time it crashed, until I couldn't take it any more.I got a new copy from macgamestore.com, including all the expansions!  It has been working great!I have several other games from Steam that work fine.  I don't know what they messed up with HoI3.  It is very disappointing. "

												EDIT: I actually have played this game more like 300-400 hours, instead of just 30. It just didn't get counted through the fact, that I had to start this game manually via it's own .exe, as Steam forced it to crash.Somewhat complicated to get into, but totally worth it, once you understood everything.It's the only game that really deserves to be called ""global strategy"".You can play every nation during the begin of and throughout the Second World War. (And by that I really mean EVERY nation. It doesn't matter whether or not you want to play as Panama, Australia, USA, Germany, Argentina, France and so on and so forth. You can really play every nation.)As stated before, however, it doesn't give you a tutorial of what to do. You have to figure all of that out by yourself. There are a lot of Tutorials or some Let's Plays online though, where you can see how the game is played.From politics, diplomacy and trading over research and espionage to strategic planning, fighting and maybe even couping a country, you can do everything. (Or you can decide to let one thing be controlled by an AI, where you can decide which policy it should follow, so that you can focus on the other things more efficiently.)It's also quite open to modding and a lot of mods exist already. (You can also rather easily script your own events to make the game more historically accurate or to give it a complete alternative history twist.)I highly recommend it, as long as you are looking for a good strategy game that is really pushing you to the limits in terms of strategy. (Not in terms of mechanics though, as games like StarCraft2 are doing, for example. That simply wouldn't work out well in this game. It's not competetively oriented.)			"

												First off, by the date of writing this review (January 24th), I had not successfully played this game on a windows 10 machine, or on any machine. Within a few days of writing this review, I tried it again, and it worked. Thanks GandalfsBeard, as it did not when I tried it on a machine that did exceed the minimum requirements, but now does on the same machine I tried playing it on.The 21 hours GandalfsBeard is referring to were clocked by leaving the game's launch interface open on accident. I had spent about one of those hours trying to wait for the game to load and stared at a black screen. After the original post date of Janyary 24 2017 of this review, I did end up playing it to get the timer up to 25.5 hours, and it worked! It enthralled me so much, after such a long wait to finally play the game, that I was able to tolerate time elapse for a few years in about two games before I realized how terrible a game this is compared to HoI II in nearly every facet. From research, to UI interface and navigation, HoI III left a bad taste in my mouth. All the limitatiuons of HoI II were folded into HoI III, along with many new nuances that made this edition dul and feel more like a chore than a game. My expectations far exceeded the execution in this newer edition: the sprite animation is lacking, the information provided to the user is limited, troop navigation, diplomacy, espionage, research, all of these were built up from the previous edition in ways that deteriorated the appeal to HoI II. In HoI II, research was completed in one area once an area of technology was researched. I understand new methods build on old, but frankly making iterations of research based on historical year is too redundant and grossly misrepresents the strides in technological advancement these iterations achieve. All in all, HoI III was not fun for me, possibly due to previous exposures to previous editions of this game. In total, despite what the hours clocked say, I have really only played 4.5 hours of this game, and frankly, that is all I will every play. Previous review:Played HOI2 and LOVED it,playedHOI3 and... oh wait a minute, no I didn't.Thank you windows 10.** Note: THIS GAME NOW WORKS ON WINDOWS 10**			"

												I love the heart of iron series. Very engaging and addictive. This game has all of that from what I have been able to play. However, when I got more into the game it started crashing on me. Currently I cannot play more than 5-10 minutes without it going down. I don't know what happened in the game to have it crash when it was working prior.  This had a lot of potential but the crashes make this unplayable now. I would not recommend this game. Until they get the stability right, do not buy this game.			"

												It's deep, the mechanics are not always consistently functional. For example Diplomacy is for all practical purposes - broken. However, there are other mechanics that work wonderfully and create an engaging and consistent experience. Basically the objective of the game is to wait for WW2 to begin and then to officiall ally with one of the three factions (Axis, Allies, and Commintern). You score and assess victory based on the overall performance of your faction.			"

												IDK what the hell the devs were thinking, but if you play Very easy, with a large tech boost as the USSR, and your massive stocks of infantry are wiped out by a single German tank brigade (the said infantry also have alot of supporting armor along with their personal AT devices), there is definately something wrong, not with your strategy, but with the game itself.Not even War thunder, which everyone has said is ""biased"" to one side, doesnt have as much as this game. German tech may be ""better"", but again, level IV upgrades of the majority of your forces, and an increase of officer training lost to a SINGLE tank division, I just cant even begin to explain the complete bias of that.

												It's deep, the mechanics are not always consistently functional. For example Diplomacy is for all practical purposes - broken. However, there are other mechanics that work wonderfully and create an engaging and consistent experience. Basically the objective of the game is to wait for WW2 to begin and then to officiall ally with one of the three factions (Axis, Allies, and Commintern). You score and assess victory based on the overall performance of your faction.			"

												Overall I would say this game is really good, and a lot of fun. It does experience some problems at times so it is not perfect. The vinilla version has only crashed once for me, and most of the problems I've experienced are minor. When I installed the DLC however, It seems I have experienced many more bugs, and the game has crashed more in the past day than the vinilla version did over several months.			"

												How to stamp out Cultural Marxism in one generation: YOUR TO-DO LISTFeel no shame:Social justice relies on shaming tactics, usually by slandering an opponent with a label that does not really apply to him, in order to control his arguments and behavior. If you don’t care about being called a bigot, a racist, a sexist, a misogynist, a homophobe, etc., then there is not really much that they can do to you.Do not self-censor:This does not mean you should go out of your way to be antagonistic or act like an♥♥♥♥♥ but the thought police have power only if you give power to them. Say what you want to say when you want to say it, and do it with a smile. Let the PC police froth and scream until they have an aneurism. Cultural Marxists are generally weaklings. They avoid physical confrontation like they avoid logic, so why fear them?Realize there is no such thing as white privilege or male privilege:In reality, there is only institutionalized “privilege” for victim-status groups. There is no privilege for whites, males, white males or straight white males. When confronted with such claims, demand to see proof of such privilege. Invariably, you will get a long list of first world problems and complaints backed by nothing but easily debunked talking points and misrepresented statistics. People should not feel guilty for being born the way they are, and this includes us “white male devils.”Demand facts to back claims:Cultural Marxists tend to argue on the basis of opinion rather than fact. Present facts to counter their claims, and demand facts and evidence in return. Opinions are irrelevant if the person is not willing to present supporting facts when asked.Do not play the game of ""unconscious bias"":If social justice cultists can't counter your position with facts or logic, they will invariably turn to the old standby that you are limited in your insight because you have not lived in the shoes of a - (insert victim group here). I agree. In fact, I would point out that this reality of limited perception also applies to THEM as well. They have not lived in my shoes, therefore they are in no position to claim I enjoy ""privilege"" while they do not. This is why facts and evidence are so important, and why anecdotal evidence and personal feelings are irrelevant where cultural Marxism is concerned.Let cultural Marxists know their fears and feelings do not matter:No one is entitled to have their feelings addressed by others. And, a person’s fears are ultimately unimportant. Whether the issue is the non existent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥culture” or the contempt cultural Marxists feel over private gun ownership, their irrational fears are not our concern.Why should any individual relinquish his liberties in the name of placating frightened nobodies?

												I bought this game, and loved it. I played so many hours on it. So much that I got all the expansions, and many custom units... etc. Welp after the newest expanision I got, it would no longer work. Actually none of my Paradox games work anymore. So while i would recomend this game, I can't. Its a giant waste of money. Easily my favorite game, gone like that. I will not be getting HOI4. In order to play HOI 3 I have to dig through a lot of my files, and not start in Steam. I can't save if I do choose to play this way, meaning fast forward is the only way to do it. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A GAME THAT DOSENT WORK. I HAVE NO MODS, ONLY WHAT I BOUGHT THROUGH STEAM.			"

												GREAT GAME. Although now that I have played HOI 4 I would say this game has very little control over anything but army,supply, and starting wars. Win the war? Good job but there is no way of preventing Border Gore. I have won many wars in this game but the borders I end with are just ugly and bad. Also don't expect civil wars (other then Spain) because politics in this game are pretty much not there. Other than that Great game but only for people with weak computers and can't play HOI 4. If you can handle HOI 4 buy that and play it not this.			"

Posted: October 8, 2014
												The reason why I don't recommend Hearts of Iron III is because of its various limitations which I do not think are overcome by its many features.The game is set between 1936-1948.  That is, this is a World War II game.  If you enjoy WW2 lore and strategy games, this is not a bad game - the strengths of the game include technological advancements; the use of era-specific units; actual historical events that influence the overall experience (to make it more realistic in terms of both chronology and ""what are you going to do about that?""); and hardy diplomatic and espionage systems.  There are also levels of customization in terms of unit names, province names, and other minor details.Hearts of Iron III would be a totally awesome game if you could play it for much longer than just thirteen game years.  That is, the combat, economic, diplomatic, and province construction elements of the game are very, very cool.  But how cool can they be if you can't ever use them fully?  The biggest limitation, in my view (besides being limited to only thirteen game years), is that you MUST play as one of the great (or at least most significant) world powers of this era if you would like to do anything significant in this game.  If you simply want to develop, say, South Africa into an industrial or military or nuclear powerhouse - just to give the big boys a run - then you won't be able to do it (without significant modification to the game; you cannot accomplish this regularly).  The game is set up to historically accurate and plausible; so because a country like, say, South Africa never did anything so huge on a global scale, then you will not be able to make South Africa do anything globally significant in this game.  For those of us who like to play an underdog and build them up and alter world history, this game is not for us.  We are pigeonholed into the ""realism"" of the actual chronology and cannot do much to escape it.  So this limitation is probably ideal for WW2 enthusiasts, but it is certainly not ideal for us strategy gamers in general.For me, the two limitations listed above are what kill the game for me.  I am not a WW2 buff, though I do appreciate the historical accuracy in terms of units, events, and other things.  Nevertheless, as a strategy gamer, Hearts of Iron III makes it essentially impossible to play the ways that I want to.  So that is why I do not recommend it.  I could only recommend this game to people who are thorough enthusiasts of the period and only if you bought the full, complete game for $6 or less.  That is, if you just want to buy ""another WW2 game,"" then this one can give you some fun.  If you want to use the strategy elements of the game, then consider a different title from Paradox (like Europe Universalis III or IV or Crusader Kings II).  Even then, many of the strategic elements of Hearts of Iron III are not available in other Paradox titles except for other limited titles such as Victoria II.  Again, Paradox limits strategy players with period-specific games that do not allow for breaking from the mold and doing anything too free-form and significant (except when leading to a quick demise if you go too radical).Just as a side note, the Hearts of Iron series (all three titles) is entirely limited to the World War II era.  Hearts of Iron II, however, had an interesting expansion pack that enabled a time frame into the 1950s where the USSR provided a fictional threat to the USA (similar to the storyline of Indiana Jones IV with the pseudo-history of fictional Cold War events or possibilities).  Hearts of Iron III, however, will stop you at 1948 - either you played as one of the major Axis Powers and took over Europe, or you played as one of the Allied Powers and prevented that.  Period.--------I wanted to provide some more technical or more specific reasons for why I would not recommend Hearts of Iron III to the general strategy gamer.1)  Some technologies have twelve tiers to them.  That is, you will research one technology twelve times in order to cap it at Level 12/12.  Some technologies will require something like at least Level 3 of one technology in order to research a different technology.  This is really cool, of course.  However, you will find that unless you are either the United States or Germany, you will not be able to cap nearly any of these.  (As the USA or Germany, you might be able to cap just a few, even though there are several you'd probably like to.)  This is all fine if you just want to play a period-specific, relatively historically accurate game.  If you love strategy games in general, then this is a major let-down.2)  If you want to modify Hearts of Iron III, then you probably should be (or will get to be) familiar with tweaking certain values in the text file of your savegame.  However, unlike Europa Universalis III or IV, Hearts of Iron III is not so simple to figure out.  And once you do, you will notice that there is not much you can significantly do to change your lot in the game world besides cheating to full capacity.  In all, it is ridiculous how limited this game is if you simply appreciate its strategic elements and also don't give a crap about historical accuracy.  But, of course, if you are a WW2 nut and just want historical accuracy above all else, then modifying the game should not be important to you, as this game definitely limits itself to that period faithfully!

Support from the the developers, Paradox is slow and they send Mac users to a third party where it took another day to register a Support Ticket. The support person wrote that the game has been stable for some time other than the Windows bugs which they have just ported over to the Mac version. I was told that the crashes were about corrupt saves and other issues but it's clear the Crash Reports and information that I sent were not even read as I was asked in an email about RAM, Operating System and other info that was clearly already available.I'm not getting a sense that these people care about supoorting this program.

												This game needs a lot (a lot!) of micromanagement or you can use the useless AI to manage your armys, your economy and everything else. The game is so bad coded that you can find the following scenary:Rusians conquest Romania, you reconquest it (as Germany) only for your armies to leave the country because now is a free country and you cant order your people to continue fighting the russians. Russians reocupy Romania and then you reconquer it to start again. HQs are unkillable. They can be behind enemy lines, under heavy attack from many divs and they only retreat (or avance) but never die. The enemy AI knows your moves so is pretty normal for them to move to the space you left or leave the one you attack, so the game becomes a never ending of pursues.Have i said the AI is useless? How fun is to be battling the red hordes and then one partisans appear in Poland and half your army engaded in combat whit the russians disengage and go to kill that partisan. Or, when the south army decides is better to be in the north and leaves the south completely undefended.BTW is better to declare war on any potential ally. Frontiers make for a hellys nightmare and you can find yourself hating how a stupid allied unit messed all your front because your units cant fight in allied territories (AI mode, in manual you can go wathever you want).

The diplomatic, trade and espionage functions are just wacky.   And like all Paradox historical games, the rules are both gamey and fussy: they create amazing historical detail, and offer you the chance to rewrite history, but then they slam down artificial barriers to prevent you from rewriting it very much.

Despite having an actually interesting gameplay platform, this game is completely bulldozed with its horrible trait of crashing after only minutes of gameplay.

												Good game bad engineI have more than 10 hours that weren't recorded because a modded exe is required. The game has a RAM limit which caused frequent crashes until applying the 4gb patch. It also has an overly long load time even on an SSDMy biggest issue is with DLC and mods. The amount of DLC is absurd, most of which should be free like all the sprite and unit packs. In the full collection there are three games: original, For the Motherland, and Their Finest Hour. TFH is mandatory and is in effect the standard game and most mods are made for it. Mods are what could really make the game, but unfortunately I couldn't get any mod to work no matter what I tried. Others have the same issueIf you want to get into Hearts of Iron, I recommend trying Darkest Hour first. It's cheap and well supported with mods. Wait for HOI 4			"

												This game looks so wunderful! It has an amazing level of complexity and detail.  The sheer amount of information that you have to keep track of is a dream for strategy gamers who want something other then non-stop gore, violence, B movie acting and really bad story lines.  However, I do not recommend this game and here is why:1) The combat system did not feel very fun     --Too much like a board game     --A little too quiet      --Lacking visual flairGreat game and I highly recommend that you TRY it, but most people will probably find it a little too ""hard core"".  For regular, unskilled gamers, try Panzer Corps for the intense but fun experience and try Company of Heroes 1 + 2 for the typical RTS experience.  Great game, but I prefer different tea then this.

												One of the best WW2 strategies. About world war, not about moving tanks around.All common things, but much more realistic:It's hard to discover how to build tanks, if you never tried to build one.It's hard to build Armor, if you barely know anything about itIt's hard to develop effective combat doctrines, if your troops never fought before.New shiny tanks cant fight without ammunition and cant move without fuel, your cavalry at least could moveBiggest battleships without proper cover could be sunk by a couple of subs.Defeated division will retreat, instead of just disappear. It's almost impossible to kill entire division if they have a way to retreatYour troops are limited to your country manpower.A lot of troops can't fight efficiently if frontline is small.Diplomacy is tend to be more permanent than ""allies today, backstab tomorrow""And a lot more... It's complicated, yes, but not actually overwhelming. And a couple of cons:Game is buggy. Weekly autosave is good, but crashes are annoying anyway.You have almost no controle about your own state policy. As Germany you could make USA nazi. But you can't become liberal yourself.			"

												This game is mindblowing. Like any game, it has issues and annoyances, but this is a fascinating representation of WW2 which manages to be, content-wise, wide as an ocean but still deep as a lake, unlike its competitors. This is a classic example of high-quality Paradox grand strategies, and with the DLC, it's even better than its successor to me. Excellent, and worth the buy at three times the price. The DLC is essentially a must, though, and it is incompatible with Mac.			"

												First you conquer your neighbours and make them puppets if you can. Second you conquer your neighbours on islands and make them puppets if you can.

												A true masterpiece when combined with mods such as BICE. Perhaps the most comprehensive and in-depth grand strategy game available to-date.If you want to experience the closest possible simulation of armed conflict and all the associated things you need to manage (economy, politics, espionage, supply lines, diplomacy, forces composition etc) then this is the game for you.I would say that the game is quite complicated without any mods, but with mods it has a massive learning curve that requires hours of play time before most even understand what's going on, nevermind being able to actually win a game. A single game as a major power will require weeks/months of play time to conclude things, with the game being extremely punishing and implementing what I like to call 'major-management' - things you can't ingore such as the supply system which demand far more attention than comparable systems in other strategy games. Victory in this game does feel great though, owing to the amount of time and effort that needs to be put in. If you think you are a smart guy that knows how to implement war strategy and tactics, this is probably the best game to get gratification from, but you will probably belong to the vast majority (including almost all of the 'veteran' players at the beginning) that realise they don't know the first thing about real war manoeuvring. This is why I would argue so many players have less than 10 hours in the game (I'm looking at you, positive reviewers! - who obviously bought the game to look smart and cool!), not neccessarily because it's complicated, but because it requires real study and work to find success in. This is of course all assuming you are playing the Black Ice (BICE) mod, if not, the base game is still quite complicated and intricate but is a much easier learn.			"

												Here's what I have to say.Do I reccomend this game? It depends.I've played this game, though a more accurate correction - Is tried. I tried. I didn't put much time into it, and that's what you need to do. If you're looking for a game that takes a long while to learn, which involves  complex management that relates closely to history - Get this game.If you don't want the steep learning curve, and a bit more freedom history wise - Get Hearts of Iron IVBoth of these games are fantastic in their own way, and although I didn't particularly enjoy it, that had nothing to do with the actual gameplay, but moreso the learning curve involved. I, personally, much prefer HoI IV, but if you are a huge fan of games like this, you might want to take this instead.TL;DR Do I like the game? Yes. Would I reccomend it, based on MY preferences? No.What I provided in the whole review was an unbiased approach to this.  No but really, Hearts of Iron IV is dank. "

												I bought this game for Steam, even though I already owned the CD copy.  It has absorbed uncounted hours of enjoyment, and that was before the mods that made it even better.  It's so detailed that folks new to Paradox may need to tune down some of the options, but you get an incredibly deep game with anything related to Hearts of Iron.			"

												A true masterpiece when combined with mods such as BICE. Perhaps the most comprehensive and in-depth grand strategy game available to-date.If you want to experience the closest possible simulation of armed conflict and all the associated things you need to manage (economy, politics, espionage, supply lines, diplomacy, forces composition etc) then this is the game for you.I would say that the game is quite complicated without any mods, but with mods it has a massive learning curve that requires hours of play time before most even understand what's going on, nevermind being able to actually win a game. A single game as a major power will require weeks/months of play time to conclude things, with the game being extremely punishing and implementing what I like to call 'major-management' - things you can't ingore such as the supply system which demand far more attention than comparable systems in other strategy games. Victory in this game does feel great though, owing to the amount of time and effort that needs to be put in. If you think you are a smart guy that knows how to implement war strategy and tactics, this is probably the best game to get gratification from, but you will probably belong to the vast majority (including almost all of the 'veteran' players at the beginning) that realise they don't know the first thing about real war manoeuvring. This is why I would argue so many players have less than 10 hours in the game (I'm looking at you, positive reviewers! - who obviously bought the game to look smart and cool!), not neccessarily because it's complicated, but because it requires real study and work to find success in. This is of course all assuming you are playing the Black Ice (BICE) mod, if not, the base game is still quite complicated and intricate but is a much easier learn.			"

												Here's what I have to say.Do I reccomend this game? It depends.I've played this game, though a more accurate correction - Is tried. I tried. I didn't put much time into it, and that's what you need to do. If you're looking for a game that takes a long while to learn, which involves  complex management that relates closely to history - Get this game.If you don't want the steep learning curve, and a bit more freedom history wise - Get Hearts of Iron IVBoth of these games are fantastic in their own way, and although I didn't particularly enjoy it, that had nothing to do with the actual gameplay, but moreso the learning curve involved. I, personally, much prefer HoI IV, but if you are a huge fan of games like this, you might want to take this instead.TL;DR Do I like the game? Yes. Would I reccomend it, based on MY preferences? No.What I provided in the whole review was an unbiased approach to this.  No but really, Hearts of Iron IV is dank. "

												While Hearts of Iron III isn't for everyone, people should not be grossed out or write the game off based on its screenshots. Despite most of the game being looking at a map, it offers in depth detail into being the government and military of a country with total countrol. Most players find peacetime the most boring time throughout the game, this can be worse if your playing a country like the United States which doesn't enter WW2 for quite sometime. However, people may find it boring during this peace / build phase but if its not thought out well you'll be quickly regretting and possbily restarting because you found that phase unimportant. If you are like me, and love to add flavor of events and hard decisions during peacetime especially and wartime I would highly recommend the Black ICE mod. This mod adds hundereds of historical events and decisions which have major to minimal impact on the game. These events can both be helpful and hurt you but I feel like it makes the games events harder as its not always a easy decision. For those reasons and the diversity of units and divisions that can be accomplished give you a more fun and tough time, as the AI also build more diverse and recieve events just for them to keep them up to par with you. If anyone ever has any questions or thoughts about getting or already has the game and just wants to discuss anything about it I encourage you to message me. As stated above I strongly recommend this game in its vanilla state or its various mods such as Black ICE, HPP and August Storm.			"

												Paradox Interactive need to really think about this game. Because it is a good concept. It is let down by many flaws. Basically the Tactics and plans to fight battles. This is poor in this game, it poor in many other games too. Heart of Iron 3 is  not bad, but can be a little borning. Basically waiting to upgrade technologies for the head battles of Iron Curtain. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the game, but it gets to damn boring at times, the units are trapped without supplies, and everything like that in-game. There is no Units for Intelligence Units, a spy, or sniper teams. Nothing. Just a battle with units, until a there is a winner. In wars like in the WW1 and WW2 intelligence units were used, for information. Why, can we have some animated graphics, talking to generals, and other officers of other units, like travelling to the areas, and being who ever we are in control of in the game, and talk to the generals, and officers on the field of battle, that would be interesting. Making the feel of battle and everything more real. Plans for battle screens, lining up units or reinforcing the weak ones. Make the game interesting is far more better, and making it better on other DLC or newer version.Paradox needs to think about it more. Its like this, more interesting features, more interaction with Generals on and off the field, and even some areas, to give out medals to those soldiers, some kind of interesting areas to think off.

												I'm on a reviewing spree tonight (I just got done with reviewing Long Live The...Queen), and I just had to do this one.Where to start?This is...the BEST game that Paradox has EVER made, and I hope they follow the same ideas that they laid out in this one for Hearts of Iron IV when it comes out this year.This is a wargame, pure and simple, so if you want to do societal stuff and other stuff, GTFO! This is for Jingo Reactionaries only (Vic2 reference).In this game, you play as a country in the years leading up to, during, and a little after World War II. How well that country does during the war is ENTIRELY UP TO YOU. You can let the AI screw everything up and build ten million escort carriers and stacks of infantry, or you can manage literally everything that would have any influence on the war, from the way your economy works (war economy vs. lassiez faire, consumer goods emphasis vs. heavy industry etc.) to what you actually produce, like tanks, planes and the like.You can even send spies to other countries to sabotage and assassinate, as well as lower the other countries' national unity to make them more likely to surrender once you start occupying their important territories.However, the best part of this game is definitely the Research and Development. Oh My God. This is Nerd Heaven.Ever wanted to see what the Germans could have done with King Tigers in 1941? Go ahead, try it.Ever wanted to design your own armies, down from the very guns that the regular infantrymen use to the tactics (obviously not completely, you just research the type of doctrines you want them to use) as well as the composition of your armies?You can have anything from a massive human wave of infantry to a highly efficient combined arms force of tanks, mechanized infantry, self-propelled rocket artillery, engineers and tank destroyers (this happens to be the type of division I always build at the last part of the game).Once you've built all you're going to build to get the war going, whether it's ships, planes or land units, it's time to get the war going. Sometimes it starts late or early, and you can choose to start it earlier rather than later (especially if you're Germany).After the boring peace years of accepting/declining trade deal after trade deal and staring at pop ups and sliders, the war part of the game is so amazing it feels like 10 different games are going on all at once. The land combat is flawless. Perfectly realistic and rewarding to the players that put time and effort into preparation and using real life tactics like encirclement, elastic defense, defense in depth and of the course, the most famous one...BLITZKRIEG!Seeing your small, but highly efficient army wipe out larger forces of dumbstacks of 3 infy and 3 tank is always a joy.Seeing your airforce that doesn't rely on bombing cities and instead clears the skies for your planes to do extra damage to their land troops is always a joy.Seeing the navy that you build yourself that has everything it could possibly need, from carriers to battleships and heavy cruisers wipe out massive fleets without even getting scratched is always a joy.The events in the game are here and there, but all of them are both flavorful and (mostly) realistic.You can also select who will run your government and your armies, and making sure that you're running a meritocracy is always fun.This game even has nukes.10/10P.S. Did I mention nukes?			"

												Over all, I reccommend this game. I tell you, though, if you don't LOVE WW2 history you will NOT get into this game. The reason is say this is because it has a learning curve of 90 decrees. I do recommend this game, don't buy it. Wait for Hearts of iron 4 comming out next year. Now that game will be worth it.			"

												There is no read-me and no instructions for this game.  So you don't know what to do.  And I don't mean you're confused by some aspects of the game.  I mean you do not know how to interact with the game or accomplish anything.Here was my experience.  I loaded the game, and it gave me a choice of a few games to play through.  I chose the easiest one that was suggested by the game as the easiest one, for beginners.  So I clicked on that one.The game loads in.  I am looking at a map of Europe.  There are chits all over the map.  I can click on the chits and they make noises.  I don't know what the chits represent or how to interact with them.  I click on everything, push all the buttons on my keyboard, and can't do anything but make noises when I click on chits.I thought it was a bug, so I quit and restarted.  Same thing.  I looked for a how-to-play or a manual or anything.  Nope.  I guess this is a game made for people that already knew how to play Hearts of Iron 1 or 2?So the game is just looking at a map you can't interact with.♥♥♥♥ this game in every orifice with a lava♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Look, it says I've played it for 1.1 hours.

												Hearts of Iron 3 teaches us that the failure of Barbarossa wasn't due to the resolve of the Russian army, the over-ambition of a dictator, or the logistical ♥♥♥♥-ups of the German army; rather, it was because the entire Eastern Front turned back to Poland to deal with a single ♥♥♥♥♥íng partisan that had sprung up.So besides a German AI that can barely make it through the opening stage of the invasion of Russia, the game has a lot of depth, much of which exists in appearance only: unit stats with no physical impact, political aspects that can't be influenced, and a supply system best described as ""a monumental cluster♥♥♥♥"" by leading journalists at♥♥♥♥♥♥Paper Shotgun.Somehow the game was released with unit stats like defence and attack (largely unimportant in a war game) having no function whatsoever, and though they fixed this issue for ground units after one of the expansions, they never did for air units -- their official response being that ""clearly it wasnt particularly important""[forum.paradoxplaza.com] for unit defence to actually have any impact on combat.Can you still have fun with the game? Of course...but you'll often have to lower your expectations far enough to avoid crushing disappointment. Funnily enough, the DLC they're selling is probably more broken than the game itself: two of them were rendered broken by the first expansion pack, and won't even start up, while the rest of it is replete with graphical errors[i.imgur.com]. Meanwhile, the expansions exacerbate an already horrendous memory leak, which will cause the game to cannibalise your RAM until it reaches the 32bit limit and crashes -- usually every 1 or 2 hours.

But really, we are talking about very basic & critical bugs (like unit counters disappearing) which make it unplayable. It's not that the game was just recently released, they had a lot of time to fix these. They simply don't care.To play the game you need LUCK, it might work or might not for you (I got it working on one machine).  A tip: do not buy expansions and DLCs (or at least don't buy those you don't really want to play), it seems at least one of these breaks the game.			"

												This is a very good WW2 strategy game, but requires a bit of tinkering you can get the game to look fairly decent - the vanilla game is quite dark and dreary I found so I lightened the fog of war a bit, added coloured airbases etc and now it looks great - look for Nats Mods on the HOI3 mods forum:https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/nats-mini-mods.643065/ Some of the DLC for this game conflicts with each other/doesnt work properly and it took me ages for me to get the game set up properly. Some of the German troops still dont have guns. I think it is some of the sprite packs that are at fault. You will need to go here to sort that:https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/hoi-3-tfh-spritepack-fixes.644947/For those with less time on their hands I have found Making History: The Great War to be very good alternative to this Paradox game but I have to admit that this game is far more detailed. The scenarios are fun where you can concentrate on the warfare, but the overall gameplay of a country in the main campaign is a bit overwhelming. I think Heart of Iron 4 will be much better and easier to manage when it comes out in a few months. I would wait for that is you are looking to buy a game like this.[Edit: Having said all that I've just played the Japanese scenario and had a lot of fun taking Singapore etc I think I am actually ready to dive into a full Japanese campaign whilst I wait for HOI4. Wish me luck!! It will be my first campaign ever tried properly - so far all my time has been spent on modding and playing the scenarios lol.]			"

												*Finished Tutorials*""How the hell do I play?""*Rewatched Tutorials* // writing main points in a notebook""I think I get... Kinda..""*Tries A Skirmish Game*""Oh god. What am I doing?""*4 hours of gameplay later*""How the hell do I play this game?""Extended Version: This is probably the most realistic WW2 rts game ever created, there is so much to learn in order to play it properly. In some games i.e. Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne, you can just build anything and chances are you'll figure it out what everything does without playing the tutorials. This game on the hand, wow. I finished the tutorials and still couldn't figure it out.. Feeling stupid, I searched up ""how to play Hearts of Iron 3"" on Youtube and found some useful guides.. Guess how long they were? Most of them over half an hour.. That's crazy!! ^^ I really want to learn how to play this game because it reminds me of RISK (my favourite board game). Graphics - 5/10: No commentGameplay - 5/10: So far, I have been able to learn every game, dfferent to the ones I have played or not, I can still pick them up. This game though, wow. I think they should've made a more interesting tutorial and explained everything more clearly with better examples. Audio - 7/10: Very nice music.Overall: 6.8/10			"

												This is a Great game for anyone who likes modern strategy (ww2) games, The game looks overall complicated but after a few hours of gameplay its very easy to understand. The game is somewhat biased towards Axis nations as of the ""Neutrality"" feature however this isnt game breaking as it eventually goes away, The AI can be a bit stupîd at times and the game is unplayable for me without All DLC.However with incredible flexibility, freedom, and depth, this is a history buffs dream and should not be passed up if you are a fan of the genre theres almost endless possibiltys and is a Must-buy if you enjoy this era of Strategy games I Have 150hrs on this game which is nothing compared to the amount of time this game offers with being able to play as every nation during WW2 and not to mention the Multiplayer of the game which can be tricky to set up. I Would highly recommend this to anyone who has played other strategy or ww2 games			"

--Did what the Duke of Medina Sidonia could not do 427 years ago and conquered Great Britain as Nationalist Spain.--Conquered the Bolsheviks as Hungary.--Acquired Portuguese territories as South Africa.--Annexed half of Europe and kicked the British out of the Middle East as Romania.--Got drilled in my fine NatChi ♥♥♥ by Japan in 1938; drilled them right back four years and dozens of armoured car divisions later.11/10, would change the course of history again.I made this incredibly original review well over a year ago now. Yes I was trying to be funny but, looking back, I did injustice to a game I have come to love so much so that it ranks highly on my own list of best games of all time. Time to right a wrong.HoI3, as it is now well known, is a game of waging war at the operational level. The game is played out over a 2D global map, a classic trope of Paradox games (see Europa Universalis), and on it are represented all the world's major and minor countries at the beginning of the year 1936. You can select any one of these nations with the intention of controlling its diplomatic, economic and military development. The former two aspects are largely abstracted; you can select another nation to do business with but your options will usually be severely restricted unless you're playing multi-player or playing as a major power in single-player (Germany for instance). The latter aspect is much less so.Building up your military forces requires direct involvement on your part and you will need to make the critical choices to decide the makeup of your military forces long before war arrives, due to the nature of building units. The smallest land unit you can build is the brigade or regiment: a tiny fighting force of around 3,000 troops. The equivalent air and sea units are squadrons and flotillas. When you have concrete ideas on what you want to do, you then need to check that you've got the technology to do it. The technology tree in HoI3 is split into various areas of interest, including civilian technologies to assist in producing certain resources and doctrinal advancements concerned with improving the training and capabilities of your fighting forces. It follows a largely linear path, so to get to more advanced projects you will need to research the earlier versions. This process is based around game time, with inefficiency penalties for researching late-war techs earlier in the game. Trying to get to stage eight of Small Arms in 1938 for instance might present some issues.Leadership plays a critical role in tech research. Each nation begins with a certain number of leadership points, which can be thrown into slider adjustments depending on how many technologies you want to research at any one time. This needs to be balanced with three other aspacts on the scales, again depending on what your strategic choices are, which I will leave you to discover. People who play war-game board games will probably be quite familiar with HoI's primary resource pool: Industrial Capacity. This is literally what it says on the tin and decides basically everything in terms of strategic decisions. IC is used for such things as producing military units, delivering supplies to them and producing consumer goods to keep the common rabble happy at home. You will quickly learn that early game production is a balancing act, between keeping everything ship-shape and actually building the military forces that you want in quantity. You may often find that you don't have the necessary IC to build many different units at one time. The answer, of course, is to start a WAAARGGH!Before you start salivating, you should know that this is not simple. Neutrality governs the vast majority of nations at the beginning of the game, and you will have to start getting rid of this very early on if you expect to start annexing the neighbours before 1939, when the global conflagration begins. This process is a good deal easier if you're playing an Axis-aligned nation, since members of that faction get the option to begin wars with other nations quite a bit before neutrality hits zero. It really is possible to ""conquer the Bolsheviks as Hungary"", provided that beforehand you can absorb the resources of several of the other central and eastern European states that surround you.Which brings me back to combat. True to Paradoxian form, this aspect is also mostly abstracted: you drag a box over the military units you want to go on the attack and you right-click the enemy province(s) that you want them to hit. Control is still left up to you as to where you want those units to go however, and thus comes the pleasure of the operational nature of the game. Do you advance on a long front across Yugoslavia, taking each line of provinces slowly yet inexorably? Or do you punch through on three different sectors, in a miniature copy of Operation Barbarossa? Alternatively, do you concentrate your armies in one sector, smash through then expand outwards in a mushroom hoping you can cut off enemy forces heading for your undefended provinces? Such decisions rest solely with you.HoI3 definitely requires a measure of patience and actual cerebral work. If you are an FPS player, or stick only to tactical-level games such as Company of Heroes and Wargame, then you might prefer to steer clear. But, and this goes double for military history buffs and fans of other operational-level games, there are few other titles out there which could quite so effectively satisfy the need for a wargasm as much as this one can. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it.			"

												Hours aren't accurate, since on Windows 10 I had to run in compatibility mode.Anyways, in total I've probably spent 10-15 hours with this game and had hardly scratched the surface. I'm a former Starcraft Player, and while not competitive, Ive had a history with strategy games. In comparison to strategy games I've played (Civ5, Age of Empires, SC2), Hearts Of Iron blows it out the water. This strategy game isn't for the casual and faint of heart however, since it is slow at the beginning and has a steep learning curve, hell I can hardly play the game without AI. The game's tutorial isn't much help, especially because I hate reading. I hope a new video/visual/interactive tutorial will be in IV to help new players and casuals like myself. I found the game extremely challenging, which in my case is a good thing, I liked the steep learning curve and time taken to actually be able to play. It makes the game play a lot more satisfying and interesting to play.Overall this game is a 7/10, if it wasn't impossible to learn and had a better in game tutorial.			"

You run the economy, the politics, everything. If you want to own the game, make sure you've got the time, because it will require a lot of it.			"

They just give you a stripped down, barebones version of the complete game and offer to sell you the rest of it for a much bigger price.The worst thing is, people are happy with this just because of the particular company.

												I do not like these kind of games, or like to put a lot of hours into them, but well the reason i have played 7 is because the game is so d*mn complicated that was after just about 5 hours of the totorial (To Grasp them and understand what its saying... real totorial is only 15 min all together depending on if your a fast reader)... when i decided to play the real game today and i said man this is reallly cool! finding out that all my preperation for the war was for the past 3 to 2 hours was complete sh*t, i got over ran within DAYS... which in game can be about 5 seconds at max speed.. that is without haveing the 321 pop ups that say how many battles your losing... so i finaly decided that this is not the game that i thought it was it has the most complex gameplay ive ever seen and now i know that im not growing up to become a genral anytime soon, But really if you like your brain explodeing due to info overload then this is the game for you, if you like in depth war simulators to the point where your sh*t comes out of your ears, well this is the game for you. And last but not least if you like killing jews and getting f**ked in the a*s surprizeingly then.....THIS IS the game for you....Such an amazing game, too f**king complicated for me.~Beast			"

Now the game wont launch, again I figured contacting Paradox and they could help me, no such luck. Their helpful forums are blocked behind being able to prove you purchsed the game which some people have figured out how to fix but I certainly havent.Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes I do, afterall not many games let you nuke 1947 Berlin as Canada. But I only recommend it if all the stars align, and you have a Voodoo preist blessing your computer every 30 seconds or so. Screw crashes, screw hoi3.exe, screw hoi3tfh.exe			"

												Probably wasted my money.#1, Takes forever to load.#2, When it does load it crashes on you after a few minutes.#3, Even when it doesn't crash the HUD and everything gets as buggy as cancer.#4, When I tried the tutorial, I DIDN'T GET WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING ON. It was all: ""da little man sat down and smoked"" No, literally. I'm not joking. It was as if the tutorial was teaching you how to roplay. (Spoiler alert, the man who's teaching you commits suicide) You have to replay the tutorial over and over, which wastes your time even further. And it will sometimes leave out stuff you NEED TO SUCCEED. Jeesh, if you're gonna make a tutorial, MAKE IT RIGHT.Look, if this wasn't buggy and didn't have all the crashes, I might consider playing this. But I don't get it, I don't understand it, I don't play it anymore. Please, to save your money, your time, and your sanity, don't buy the game... >:)			"

												Feels to slow paced, and allies can't declare war. If they sped up the game and made it where everyone can declare war, regardless of what conditions, then this game would be rated up but sadly I can't because it feels too bland and you have to wait around forever to actually do something (unless you jump into the later days where war is already occurring but that isn't fun for someone who wants to do alternative history without waiting forever).

												Paradox returns again with their newest WW2 Clunky Interface Simulators, bringing you the latest in paying money for minor graphical changes to the game.I have not gotten into the depths of this game quite yet (Though I have more than my fair share in Darkest Hour multiplayer matches), but from what I have seen it is not too bad. A graphical update from Hearts of Iron II, Oil needs to be converted to Fuel, diplomacy affects trade, and automation out the wazoo.The biggest change that this automation brings around is your theatres. You create a hierarchy of troops, and can give each part of the hierarchy a goal to accomplish, and the AI goes about doing it. The AI isn't too bad at this, but if you feel like you could do better, you can still manually select and control any divisions. My biggest problem with this system is how damn clunky it is to create the hierarchy. It could really use its own window to manage or something because individually selecting EACH AND EVERY DIVISION is ridiculous. However, once you have spent half your day organizing your armies, its pretty fun to manage. It makes it feel a lot more like you are a general of some form, assigning officers and giving them generic orders, and letting them do the micromanagement. But because its not required, you can still take care of any details you want and just let the AI deal with the rest.Overall, I would definitely reccomend this game to someone who is interested in hearts of iron in general, and especially if you liked Hearts of Iron 2. However, if you feel like you are completely burnt out on Hoi2, this may not be for you. The way you manage government, technology, and diplomacy has changed a bit for the better, but the base game is still very similar.Note: I have not played enough to say anything definitive about the AI.

												This is another one of those games that you don't actually “play”. You move some things on a board, look at some charts and make a decision of where you want to place things or get into a fight with. It gets boring after a while but if you enjoy this sort of game than this is for you.			"

												Not a fan of this iteration of HOI. I was turned off by the lack of information in the tutorials and hesitated even starting a play-through. My first foray into this newest version of HOI was as Switzerland simply to learn the game mechanics/dynamics. I did gain some understanding about those elements, but I also didn't gain as much knowledge as I was hoping. Not a fan of the ""new"" graphics; tech development; intel gathering and diplomacy aspects.The command structure overhaul is a good representation of an Army's TO&E and peanalties for being beyond effective command and control range are about the same as HOI II.  Tried to use a few of the mods out there as well.  The result: CTD repeatedly.Here's to hoping HOI IV is better than this one			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I bought with all the expansion packs in all its glory because it truly seemed right up my alley. (Wargaming since the 80's) It was not. It was clunky to me as well as overwhelmingly non-intuitive to ME.  I decided to try again another day since it seemed like the mega strategy game I might be looking for. I revisited it a few months later, just recently and gave it a good go. Oddly enough, I played as Sweden originally and moved on to Italy and did learn some good basics in infrastructuire between crashes. All in one day I would have to say it crashed on me 5 times. SO, out of my logged 10 hours, you do the math. It was not tolerable to me on top of the learning curve to deal with crashes so I uninstalled and requesetd a refund...  LOL.. There is a 2 hour play refund policy... so if you ferel inclined to feel sketchy about a game ya better refund FAST. IN this case, I was not even able to learn if it was playable...and Lost my minimal investment because refund or not.. It is now removed like a bad taste.Reasons for thumbs down: Non-intuitive even for a Grand stategy game which are notoriusly complexCrashes more than tolerable to me (I did not try to resolve since I was alreasy turnd off of the game)			"

												Hearts of Iron III is like a once-beautiful Victorian mansion that's been abandoned for twenty years, and haunted. It's a beautiful, well put together game with a robust simulation, but it is aging poorly, and there's nothing Paradox can do about it, having somehow managed to lose the source code and with it, their ability to fix bugs. For instance, this fullscreen-only game has extreme difficulty making connections via multiplayer, crashes when you alt+tab, and frequently crashes in the middle of gameplay as well.This, combined with a somewhat outdated, clunky interface and a very poor tutorial, results in a game where you can't tell what's a bug, what's a feature, and what's user error. And it's never going to get better. It can't. Paradox can no longer fix or develop this game, because again, they managed to somehow lose the source code.I've never given a negative review for a Paradox game before. Do not let this dissuade you from buying games from them in the future. The bizarre and apparently unique blunder that led to HoI3's problems are very atypical for who are otherwise developers of VERY high-quality grand strategy games.Get Hearts of Iron II or IV instead of III.I really don't want to thumbs down this program, it would be amazing if it worked the way it's supposed to and had a better tutorial.

												Great strategy game, horrible tactical game.Every gameplay element in the strategic gameplay is awesome from how you advance up the tech tree, your industrial options, and diplomacy.  The biggest problem is a tutorial that is just a slide show with text boxes explaining what everything in the UI does.  This makes it difficult to know what to do.  You will start off not knowing how to even go to war.Eventually the computer player will take you to war, and this is where the lack of tutorial and a complete lack of understanding how the game handles combat will come into play.  I had an entire pacific fleet almost destroyed and had no clue the Japanese were bombing me into destruction.  In Europe the germans used 2 divisions to wipe out my entire Expeditionary force.  I have no clue why the PC composition of units was able to wipe out a single division in an afternoon despite me deploying entire airwings and battleships to defense, but sure enough they just walked through like I wasn't even there.  Watching Youtube videos indicates that you should depend on the AI to control your unit deployments optimally while you just set objectives.  You also have an optimal build for your divisions that you can only learn about online...Nothing I hate worse than a game that demands you play optimally.			"

I love war games and tactics but this game is to bulky and over complicated.  I watched hours of videos and read instructions.  Would rather play civ or g-civ.  Plus the graphic representations actually take away from the game and the information to play it, to bad I found this out after spending another 20 dollars.  What a  rip!

												Well I found flatpack hamsters review the most helpful. Having first bought the game, I thought GREAT! unlike all the Zionist publishers out there, we can have a bit of historical realism instead of a politically correct re-write of history. But then the complexity! Oh the horror. If you are some sort of grand master savant of RTS then this is the game for you. If you use your brain for work & switch it off for leisure, stay away, it will mess you up.The constant crashing may have more to do with those imbeciles at Microsoft who get away with figurative commercial murder on a daily basis. Screw North Korea, it's Seatle you need to worry about! Unbelievable complex & difficult to play for a relative novice (been gaming over 30 years!) such as me. When you do reload after a crash, you find there is data corruption on the save, such as wiping out a nations units or forgeting the power block status. As I say, I do not necessarily blame Paradox, Microsoft has a well proven record of unreliability, and get away with this because of the state endorsed attitude towards their total monopoly.If you love it, I can see your point of view, go ahead you genius! If you like a dip your toes in, switch your brain off and enjoy a leisurely world conquest, look for entertainment elsewhere.PS. Victoria II & Crusader Kings II are practically clones of this game, you either love or hate the whole Paradox RTS family			"

												okay, if you're not prepared for a learning curve that will slap you in the face, then this game is not for you. i spend probably 2 hours carefully reading the tutorial when afterwards i still had no idea what to do. after another hour or two watching tutorials on youtube, i finally could somewhat get going in the game. i still haven't undertood it all. and still don't know if what i'm doing makes sense. but preparing for war, building division, managing and connecting the different parts of your army, and eventually going to war after intense preparation is tons of fun!if you're willing to spend quiet a bit of time to understand a game, instead of just jumping in and playing, then you can't do much wrong here.mny people said something about crashes, but the game runs perfectly on win7. didn't had one crash yet!

												Hearts of Iron 3 is a solid step back for the game.  Hearts of Iron 2 allowed you to control division level units very effectively.  Provinces are larger and easier to manage.  Hearts 3 decreases the province size and moves down to brigade level.  While this may sound good, in practice it's simply not fun.  There's so many units across a wide front you're almost required to use AI to control your units, the result is watching the AI move and fight for you.  Sadly, the game is too slow to even do that due to the large amount of processing needed for large front battles.Very disapointed with the game.  Hopefully Hearts of Iron 4 will be better.			"

												The game covers a period of about 15 to 20 years, and includes all the major, minor and even a lot of micro powers during the period of 1936 and 1960 something. You can research pretty much everything.Sounds great right?BUT WAIT! TIME IS MEASURED IN HOURS WITH A DAY NIGHT CYCLE AND YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING MAX SPEED IS AN HOUR A SECOND!Do you know how many hours are in 25 years? That's how many seconds the game takes to finish if you simply run it at max speed and go to work then sleep without looking. Then divide that by 360. That's the number of hours just to finish the game doing nothing.Basically. It's torture. Go play any other Paradox game where you can pass by years every 10 minutes or something if you feel like it.Most of the game isn't even war. At least not for first few years.I don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about what content and complexity and skill is in a game, if it takes me 8 hours of sitting down watching time trickle by ON ♥♥♥♥ING MAX SPEED YOU MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING IDIOTIC GAME DESIGNERS!

Posted: September 8, 2016
												Strategy is my genre. I don't have any problem with Paradox. If you look at my hours played on Crusader Kings II, I've put more than a thousand hours onto the game. I've been playing grand strategy games for a long time, and Hearts of Iron III is just unplayable as far as I'm concerned.I picked this up during a Steam Sale, though I've since forgotten when I bought it exactly. I've attempted several playthroughs as different nations, and it's a long hard monotonous grind until Germany makes you take it up the pooper. Maybe I just suck at this particular game in general, but it's just not fun. To illustrate this, let me give a timeline of events for each of the factions that I've attempted to play as.1. Sweden - The biggest problem that I have with playing Sweden is that it's basically balancing on a knife's edge. You can't make Germany mad, because they'll invade, and you can't friends really very quickly at all. I spend a lot of time building up border defenses and units only to have the Third Reich plow over all of my carefully laid plans by about 1943... usually it's earlier than that. My earliest loss occurred in 1939. As best as I can tell there was no way to overcome Germany's technological/numerical edge, so after four or five plays through as Sweden, I thought to myself: ""Let's try another nation and see if we can't change things."" 2. Belgium - I was kind of going for a vaguely historical playthrough here. Maybe I could hold out a little bit longer than Belgium and France did in the real world... turns out... no. You can't. I assembled gobs and gobs of troops and fortifications, but the Jerrys were able to pull off the Schliefen Plan even earlier than in the real world. Yeah, I knew that I would probably get taken pretty early, but the fact that I didn't even put a dent in things on ""Very Easy"" difficulty was just frustrating and ridiculous.3. Brazil - If you're noticing a trend here, it's that I like to play factions that aren't particularly strong so that I can build them up to face bigger obstacles. While I didn't get invaded or anything like that, I got to a point where it was just a multi-decades long stale-mate. It finally ended when I attempted an invasion of Southern Spain only to have my massive army repelled by a dozen or so German infantry units.I'm so done with this Hearts of Iron III, it's just not a worthy playthrough. The graphics are just a map with strategic unit cards that look like Xs for infantry and Os for tank units, so you're not missing anything there. The only exception that I can think of on that score is that in the production screen they have some black-and-white photos of WW2 era ships and vehicles. If it weren't for the fact that I could literally do a google search for the same pictures, that might be passable.The game has great potential to just drag on forever while not allowing you to actually do anything to cause change in the gameworld. The intelligence system is a hindrance because if you want to attack anyone that's not already at a high threat level you have to sink all of your leadership into spies while sacrificing research and officers and diplomacy. All four of these things cause a trade-off that makes exactly zero sense.You start the game not knowing what tech that you need to research... then thirty hours into game play, and you still don't have a flipping clue as to what you need to research. The tooltips don't really explain what the different techs do very well, and there's not any way to divine exactly what you need.You can assign your units into AI groups. The problem here is that the AI that helps you coordinate troop movements is about as smart as a bag of sand - which is funny because the Enemy AI easily encircled my troops without a second thought. The end result is that if you want to keep track of a massive invasion of Fortress Europe, you have to monitor the movements of every unit card and every transport... you could spend several hours just lining up an attack only to have the Germans tear your carefully laid plans into very tiny pieces without much effort on their part. Your AI will force you to orchestrate an invasion by yourself, because it can't figure out how to boating.I spent the last 6 hours of my gameplay trying to get my Strategic Bombers to work to no avail. They just sat on the runway taking up space. I'd order them to bomb targets in mainland Europe and they'd just hang around... I kind of wish there was a mini-game where you can guillotine disobedient flight crews.I played through the tutorial of this game 2 times that I can remember. The second time I very carefully read every single word of the tutorial and it's complete BS. It's absolutely unhelpful. You get an idea of how to move your units manually, but there's no instruction on some of the more difficult things... it may be because the devs didn't even really understand it.There was a period about ten years ago where every First Person Shooter that you could pick up was set in WW2. Some were passable - most notable is Battlefield 1942 - but most of the rest were basically like video games of movies were during the 90s: just a ploy to make a quick buck off of parents that were looking to buy a game for a kid, and they thought ""Hey, Jurassic Park, that was a cool movie. I bet my kid will love this game!"" <cue sad trombone sound> There may be a decent WW2 grand strategy game out there, but this one is not it. I'm a little curious about Hearts of Iron 4 (just because I love Paradox), but if HoI3 is any indication... I just don't want to think about it. Save your money and avoid this one unless your cash is just burning a hole in your pocket.			"

												I love Paradox Games. I have nearly 300 hours in eu4, 150 hours in CK2, and 90 hours in HOI4. Yeah, about that whole HOI4 thing. Buy that instead. This game's terrible interface makes in nearly unplayable. I'm fine with  functionality being prioritized in a strategy game, but this one is inexcusably ugly. Buy HOI4. Yes, it costs more. Yes, it's not as comprehensive a game yet (give it time, it's new and there will certainly be patches and more mods). Buy it anyway, it's simply a more enjoyable experience.			"

For the most part the game will NOT run.So it seems that Steam has taken a working title, broken it and then sold it to us.Thanks Steam.I have visited the forums at Paradox and downloaded the latest patch for HoI3, but when I try to run the patch I am informed that the program is not present on my machine?

												Although the game is fun to play the load time to play it is ridiculous and there are to many crashes which makes it a further pain.  Graphics on unit counters could be a little more imaginative than standard nato counters.  On the plus side there are a few mods which though somewhat difficult to implement do make the game more visually appealling than its vanilla format.  I give this game a 7 out of 10 on gameplay, a 6 out of 10 in visual allure and a 4 out of 10 in technical programming			"

												I've been waiting for this game for more than a year, alas - all for $ 40.00 wasted Now I've been waiting for this game with great anticipation for more than a year. But all along, in the back of my head, the tiny voice of rationality kept telling me that there really is nothing else to add to the Hearts of Iron II series.Regardless, I pre-purchased the steam version a week before the release. I left work earlier and even skipped college just to get the first glimpse of this grand strategy - instead I got a stinking pile of $hit.Loading times, with my Quadcore 3Ghz was insanely long. Gameplay:Unplayable. Instead of the fast way to link or separate divisions by the easy use of a ""SHIFT"" button, we get a whole other display of the selected army on the upper left side of the screen. And for each division, we have a cute button all the way at the end that says ""SELECT"". Which means that we cant highlight divisions anymore, we have to ""SELECT"" each one of them. My favorite scenarion of all time was, of course, Gotterdamerung 44, playing as Germany. Now, with the HOI II series, it took me around 20 minutes at most to set up the right leadership, divison production, etc. With this game, it took me an hour, and not because I didn't know how to manage the game, but because of the tedious ways in which the game works. The leader icons are miniscule, you can barely see other icons indiciation either the ESP, or even ORGANISATION level. I mean seeing your organisation level is one of the most important thingsBugs:Quite often, you aren't able to select leaders for your armies, instead you might end up leading a leaderless army. Second, why in the world would we need a whole separate window for the Army leaders? what was wrong with the easy accessible leader-board on the left side of the screen? and what's with all down-grading generals? We can actually downgrade 5 star generals to 2 star generals? why is that an option? that makes promoting leaders just a silly joke. Promotion should involve long-term investment into the leader if you want him to lead either a 6 or 12 divison army. There might be more bugs in the game, I only played it for around 4 hoursProduction and Technology:The tech tree is $hit, plain and simple. Upgrading your infantry division with a couple dozen tiny upgrades, like better river crossing, better land fortification assaults, better mortar fire, etc over the YEARS is tedius and unmemorable. We all know that feeling when we get ""infantry divison 1941 developed"" or ""Medium tank 1941"" developed, instead of a max of 5 techs that we used to develop, we can now develop up to 20 mini techs. Do we really need ""mountain equipment"", ""desert equipment"", ""jungle equipment"" etc? or can we just get a nice 1941 division and add just ONE brigade to characterize the division's mission? And what's with these damn brigades comprising divisons? We all know that a panzer divison doesn't just consist of tanks, but of hundreds of trucks and thousands of personel and infantry. So why, would we need to customize our divisions by adding either extra artillery brigades, motorized brigades, etc? That just gives us more options which are confusing and time consuming.And I guess the ships are upgradable now. May I ask why? Dont we all remember playing as Japan and bracing for that ""Carrier 1941"" tech to deveop in order to start catching up with the US while we prepare for Pearl Harbor?The MAP:12000 provinces...really? why do we need thousands of provinces in South America? or Africa? or endless Siberia? Is anyone actually going to wage war there? wouldn't it be better if they just added more provinces in all the theaters of WW II? Since that what the game is about? Some people complained about the scrolling speed, I personally cannot complain because my PC can take this game easily. However, I thought the 3d water effects were pretty useless. And why don't we see armies sort of exchanging fire with one another like in HOI II?The good:Finally, they have introduced this following feature - casualty list. After each battle, you will get the amount of casualties on both sides. And I gotta admit, its pretty effective, it makes you want to immidiately research tech on reducing attrition, improving medical equipment etc. And so far, that feature is the ONLY one I enjoyed having while playing the game. If they could put that in HOI II, I would play it even more.There are definitley more things to say about this game. And I would be glad if more people tried enjoying this game. I tried desperate to enjoy it. I didn't want to spoil it for those who already bought it, but for those who are undecided, just think a little more before buying the game.			"

												Hearts of Iron III may had been great in its time, but nowadays it just feels very unfinished unless, of course, you decide purchase all the DLC's.The game looks like a board wargame glued inside your computer's screen, and if you want to see the unit model skins instead of those overwhelming tokens scattered all around the map you need to spend on them. There are even new Music tracks exclusive only on some DLC's!Since I hate to have those ""paywalls"" to be able to get the entire game's experience, I would definitely not recommend it. Maybe ""Hearts of Iron IV"" will be more complete at its release at the start of 2015. I'd really be looking forward to the next title rather than this one, unless you have the money to give it a try.			"

												This game is just an entirely broken mess of illogical game design. The long waits at reducing neutrality to zero in order to attack anyone is horribly thoughtout, and the fact that a cheat was built in to reduce your neutrality to 0 kind of makes me wonder what the devs were thinking. The diplomacy section is useless beyond belief. I attack Brazil (Axis) as Canada (Neutral) which sparks war with the USA (Allies) because for some unknown reason Axis and Allies don't automatically go to war. Who do I negotiate peace with in this weird situation? Not the US or Brazil...that would make the most sense...but Germany, the country I never attacked at all. I guess the glorious Fuhrer managed to pull a Cobra Commander and replace FDR. A+ for the weird alliance system that caues this to make abolutely no sense.I was interested in this game solely because it allowed people to play as some other country other than the top dogs in WW2, and for that I give two thumbs up. But to have broken systems where said countries can do absolutely nothing in the game of any importance, and when they pull off a miracle and somehow do (taking GuanZhou from the enemy) said minnow has to give all the glory aka resources to the top dog because the UK is the Allied leader and they get all the territory.If you want to be the top dogs, pick a different game. There are hundreds of them.			"

												Confusing, inaccesable, long, and tiresome. I have little knowledge in WW2 which ruins the experience for me. If you're a Grand Strategy Player and WWII nerd this game may be perfect for you, that said, I can't say I've enjoyed it.			"

												The best strategy game ever when it comes to WWII .. If you could only play it.The steam version won't work. I have all the expansions etc and it crashes every 15 to 30 min. Last year I thought it was my pc but now i have a super gaming pc (an Alienware) and it does exactly the same. Its a petty its supposed to be an awesome game but with so many interruptions its unplayable.			"

												Just to add a bit of backstory, I was actually gifted this game by a friend who loves it.  He got it for me so that we could play multiplayer together.  Unfortunatly we never got it to work because he owned a piece of DLC that I didn't.  But that's not why I'm not recommending this game, that's just a warning for those who plan on getting it to play multiplayer.  The reason is because this game is VERY difficult to learn.  The previous Paradox games I've played were very fun and somewhat user-friendly, so I was surprised that I couldn't say the same about this one.  It does come with a tutorial, however it is VERY long, and for some reason they tried to encorporate a small story into it making it much longer than neccessary, and honestly very off-putting and more boring than your average tutorial.  I enjoy a good story, but it's surprisingly difficult to pay attention to when you're also trying to memorize what all the complex options under the technology menu. Speaking of menus, this game has menus.  Lots and lots of menus.  Granted, it is organized very nicely, but it's still a lot to take in.  It takes some getting used to, but if you're dedicated enough you can learn it.  In fact, I think that applies to the entire game in general.  It's quite difficult to learn and even harder to master. While I know a lot of ""grand strategy game"" fans will love it, I would NOT recommend this game to the average player.  However, if you've got a lot of time and you're looking for a complex strategy game, you might love it.			"

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

												I can't even get this game to start.  I just bought the 4th of July package deal at 75% off for $11.24.  Good deal if the game actually works.  Installed it last night.  Been spending 5 or 6 hours trying to get help from forums and the Paradox company website.  No luck so far. How many more hours do I need to be frustrated and aggrivated?I had proplems getting Age of Empires II to work too, a year ago, when I first bought the game.Seems like Steam is in the habbit of selling problematic games and providing no support for them.  No quality control.  No tech support.  Customers are left on their own to figure it out.People shouldn't have to go through all this crap every time they buy a game.  Games should just work after you buy them and install them.  Is that too much to ask?  If not, at least provide some support for them with links to patches and easy fixes.  Customers shouldn't have to do searches and rely on other gamers who may or may not know what the heck they are talking about.Steam SUX!			"

												Who the hell likes these games enough for there to be more than one? I've never felt the need to write an obnoxious review before but really, are you that boring that you like to sit and watch numbers move around. I love history, I love the two world wars. But what this game is, is a numbers game attached to some flags. You could literally replace the names with red team, green team, etc. and no one would notice. It's so convoluted that even the tutorial is disguised in some stupid story about a madman with a moustache you've been sent to see, and it's all in text with no practical application. So a quick trip to youtube and they're basically telling you to put everything on ai mode and sit back and watch as your number flags move around a bit and your resources mysteriously disappear. I had a ww2 grand strategy game on floppy disc for win95 that was more involving than this game. And it's not a game, it's some kind of algoryithm you run with repeptative music.As I type this the game is running in the background, so i can collect the cards, it's at max speed since I started typing, has moved from 1939 to 1941 in Belgium. Nothing has happened! Nothing at all! no nazis and no war. Perhaps this game isn't for me but if you have anything to say about this review then please don't because the sort of person who wants to defend this game is certainly not someone I ever want to converse with. So stop your comments, I don't like your favourite game I consider it boring and unplayable, you're going to have to get over it, i know I have.Oh and the crashes alone render it almost unplayable, consider that too before you buy.

Issues with the game: Interface takes some getting used to.  Has an unfortunate tendency to overestimate Germany's actual '39 military power, though this might be just me.  Not as much chance for a big alternate history unless you get a major glitch, and you really have to look for those (this is a good thing in that there are few glitches, but a bad thing unless you like reliving history over playing a real sandbox).  9/10 would kick dictators in the nuts with good Finnish justice again.

												This is for those that enjoy reading nitpicking reviews, and 'game theory' (in the context of video games, not economics).  It's NOT for people that are simply looking for a game that's fun.  If you value your free time, and value things like 'how long will it take me to learn the game?', then it's useful to read on.----------Right off the bat, the tutorial is horrendous.  It contains walls of text and a few spelling errors (that I only noticed because I was bored), portrayed in the context of a story (an interaction with a 'crazy man' that looks and acts like Adolf Hitler), that feels unecessary (he's only crazy because they keep mentioning that you, the player or character you're portraying, think he's crazy; so part of that is poor writing, if they need to remind you that he has that character trait...).  The only real reason it was done was to tell some jokes, but it clutters up the actual parts of the text that contain information on how to play the game in the first place.  However, the wording of the info is confusing, and I had to re-read the tutorials more than once to actually learn how to play the game.  This is pretty terrible, because a much clearer tutorial could probably be coded up in a work day, but they didn't do that.  Even though paradox is a massive company with many successful titles in this exact genre - so, it's not like they've never done this sort of game before, or had to write tutorials for these sort of games before.  It also sets the scenery poorly - like you have to infer that, for the sake of the tutorial, you're playing as germany.  Just because a grand strategy is basically a digital board game, doesn't mean that you don't have to scrap all attempts at presentation.  You don't lose out on the game for presenting it a little better.  I'm not asking for lens flares and all the faggy pizzaz that goes on in modern games, purely meant to catch the eye and be distracting as♥♥♥♥♥♥  I'm not asking for that.  I'm just asking for proper presentation that facillitates quick learning.  The tutorial doesn't even highlight the parts of the screen you're supposed to be reading very well, but that's a much more minor point.Here's an example of wording - 'You can build divisions in the production menu.  Divisions are made up of brigades.  You only get 4 (brigades?  divisions?), but our troops are so good that you only need 4 (brigades?  divisions?)'.  It's that sort of 'short hand' tone that can make everything else unclear.  If you don't know whether ol' Adolf is talking about divisions or brigades, then it's hard to figure out what the actual rules are.  In order to play a game, you need to know the rules - in order to get good at a game, you need to know how to play within the limits, so that you can tweak your style and discover an optimal level.  A game can have a steeper 'learning curve' effectively by obscuring the player's ability to percieve what is optimal - but there should be a point, I feel, at which the player can see everything that needs to be done to reach an optimal level (maybe after 100 hours of playing the game or so).  I think most players like organization - a game can only be chaotic if the means of playing it is simple.  It's a replayable game when the player can continue to have fun, riding the point of optimization (insert sexual metaphor here).  It's a confusing game, however, when the point of optimization is too obscure, or the goal posts keep shifting.  Unless the point of optimization is growing accustomed to the shifting goal posts, but it shouldn't take more than 100 hours to be able to see where that point lies.  It can take much longer than 100 hours to reach that level, but if the player can see how close they're getting there, they can still be hooked by the game.  Does this make sense?  It's my opinion that some devs have figured this out, and others haven't.------Second issue thus far:- The game crashes when I alt-tab out and try to go back into the game.  I don't understand what causes any game to do this.  Is it the display coding?  I've played several games that don't experience this problem (maybe because they're all capable of windowed mode), but there's plenty of others that can't handle alt-tabbing.  It's one of many software conundrums.  --------Other than that, I haven't had much problem, so I'll recommend the game because grandtards like northern lion love it, so y'know.  Who'm I to judge?  I might get into the game, but it'll probably take another 10 hours re-looking at the tutorials and ♥♥♥♥ing up in the regular game.			"

												Now this game, even though I'd recommend it, has very important issues people would really need to take into account before spending money on it. The game itself is very difficult, trying to control every aspect of your nation, including troop movements, and attempting to further your domination across whatever continent you are on is very very very difficult. It took me a while to learn all the tips and tricks, you can give your HQs objectives, and automate a lot of things, but learning that is difficult, and no to mention, not very fun for the 'Grand Strategy' fans out there. Overall the game is good, graphics are low key and not very hard on any PC. The biggest problem technically, is the buggy and glitchiness of the games start-up, you can't really buy the DLCs and enjoy all of them, or even some of them without having some start-up failure of some type. You can't really run into problems with the base game, which I enjoy, and the DLCs, might just be a me problem. All in all get the game, if you don't like it, its just 10 bucks, wait for Hearts of Iron IV to be released sometime in 2016 and that, I can promise you, will not be a disappointment.			"

												I really loved the game but it was unstable as hell. Started with crashes to desktop every 30m, paradox fixes made it to 2h. I never was able to fix some minor random graphical problems like some tooltips disappearing or random colors appearing, but a game restart fixed so i kept playing. Technical support basically ignored me after their first 2 suggestions didnt work.Finally gave up playing after my second save game corrupted and couldnt be played past a certain date.Summary: The game is awesome, but be prepared to lose a few hours installing some fixes and patches which were never made automatical and be aware that even then there's a risk that the game wont work properlyps: all these problems happened with all dlc's and patches, which means that paradox never fixed the game properly			"

												Spend several days staring at a map,and have fun doing it! Not for the faint of heart,I reccomend playing other paradox games first. My suggestion is to play the games in this order: Crusader Kings 2 (then Europa Universalis 3 or 4 if you feel like it.) CK2 will help you get a feel for the Clausewitz engine,Victoria 2 so you can master diplomacy and get a better feel with a more 'realistic' warfare system,THEN play HoI3. The learning curve is about as steep as a ♥♥♥♥in' cliff,but the game has AI that can help you with your first few playthroughs and there's a few tutorials online as well.			"

												For 99% of ""Strategy Games"" out there the word ""Strategy"" is shamefully misused.  I assure you nearly all strategy games have nothing to do with strategy, they are just ""Tactical"" games that are deluding themselves.

												HOI 3 is more restrictive than HOI 2 in that it is more historically accurate. In HOI 2 it was easier to be ahistorical. In HOI 2 I was able to bring the USA to war against the axis in 1939, have China declare war against Russia in 1942 eventually taking them all the way to the France. In HOI 3, ATM at best I could bring the USA to war with the fall of Yugoslovia, could have China invade Russia but the germans took to long in France and by the time war broke on in russia they were already losing. Playing France I was able to hold out against the Axis, but don't think I can hold mainly because my AI Allies are being noobs. Invading Germany and getting their divsions wiped out or having 20+ divisions sitting way behind the front line, while the Axis breakthrough in France. The AI is still kind of weak or stupid. In Japan vs China, Japan should invade the coast, but in all the games I played it hasn't and for some reason more often then not they can't push beyond their frontline. Espionage and Diplomacy are still weak, though I did somehow get Australia to join the Axis. Political options are less than in HOI 2 so lack the ability to shape your nation. Research team is more personalized in HOI 2.  Easier to figure out your supply lines in HOI 2. Currently, having a severe supply problem when invading oversea, so my offensive eventually stalls out. So basically I think HOI2 is better than HOI 3, but this is still a fun game.			"

												I highly recommend this game, especially for those who enjoy studying history and enjoy alternate history scenarios. However, this game is all about micromanaging and is not for those who wish to jump in and play like in Call of Duty or other examples. The learning curve is very large but it worth leaning in order to gain hundreds of hours of enjoyment from this title. I would recommend starting off from a less in depth Grand Strategy game if you are not experienced, something like Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis IV, and then moving on to this game. but once you know how it works inside and out, you are bound for some very fun times. Want to see what would happen if France had stopped the Germans, if Japan had invaded the west coast of the United States, if Russia had not been able to push back Germany, or even if the United States had never joined the Allies? Then you will love this game and enjoy it for years ahead.			"

They released the game about 2/3 complete, then sold the remaining third in a series of expansion packs implemented as DLC.

												I play Hearts of Iron 2: Darkest Hour much more than this because of my older laptop. As far as I can tell, this version does not utilize dual core processors. That being the case, be sure that your system can comfortably meet the requirements -- especially if you will play campaigns with large a amount of units/provinces or utilize the high speed function.Compared to HoI2:DH, HoI3 features a more refined map aesthetic, more playable countries such as Siam, an in-depth Order of Battle system utilizing visual supply flow displays, and an Ally/Axis/Comintern graph for easily sizing up country alignments. When combined with The Finest Hour, HoI3's espionage system becomes an elastic warmaking tool thanks to the scouting and covert missions. It's a shame, however, that covert points are so slowly accumulated. If I could run it, I'd probably be playing this instead of HoI2: DH.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is the best yet in the series. The political options are far more immersive, allowing realistic options to be made. You can play ANY country in the world at different periods of time before or during World War II. You have freedom to do anything at anytime, to anybody. Heck, I played as the U.S and conquered Mexico and South America. The U.S now makes the Soviet Union look small in my save game :D The customization options for each and every individual division you train, is just legendary. I can conscript a division and choose between 4 or 5 different brigade types to put in it. Perhaps you want this division to participate in the frontlines most major offensives. So you put an infantry brigade, maybe an armored brigade, a paratrooper brigade, a self-propelled artillery brigade, and maybe an engineer brigade or motorized infantry brigade. It doesn't matter, because there are tens of other different brigades. And you also research new technology to choose what model weapon they are equipped with. It's just absolutely amazing. You can also use aggressive action by one country to justify aggressive action of your own. Let's say, I'm the Soviet Union. Germany declares war on Poland. I can now justify mobilizing my entire army (this will bring all reserve units to full strength, and brings your normal divisions to full combat alert) because Poland is next to me. Let's say by chance, the U.S invades Cuba for no reason. I now declare an embargo on the U.S. All of a sudden, Canada may declare an embargo on me (not likely unless the U.S are their allies) It's a very realistic economical, industrial, military, political strategy game that anybody like myself can grow to love. P.S I also chose to be Brazil on a different save game, and I conquered and annexed all of South America, and I'm currently engaging in thermonuclear war with the U.S. Such fun :D at least 50 million people have died, and Germany and the Soviet Union are still going at it. (It's so fun!) I usually choose the time period of 1936, because it allows me to bring what country I lead up to full war preparations. Otherwise if I start during the war as belgium, I most likely am going to be turned upside down and gang banged to death by hundreds of German soldiers, and I won't have anything to stop them. However if I start two years earlier, I can annex the Netherlands and maybe Denmark, and then have so much fortifications and troops ready, that the German invasion won't go anywhere, even though it's highly unlikely it would be possible without cheats. But at any rate, I highly recommend this to anyone. The first hour or so of figuring everything out, might be depressing because it seems like alot to learn, but the wait is worth it. Buy this, and I'll give you a cookie. :) But then I'll declare war on your country in this game, and specifically nuke your hometown for the heck of it, cuz.... why not? :D "

I think that speaks for itself, but to give a brief summary of my thoughts, well, I can only say this: This is a game that will not appeal to many people. It takes a lot of practice, patience, and a love for long term planning and geopolitical strategy over combat and fast paced action. It also takes a love for history, the detail and the intrigues, and lastly, a large amount of, well, 'geekness'. For those of you who are history buffs, or who want to play a genuinely different type of strategy, pick this up, now. It is worth noting however that Hearts of Iron 2, and in particular Darkest Hour: A hearts of iron game, are in the political and detail senses generally superior games, but if you like any one of these games, you will like all of them for what they are, and that is a solid experience produced by an equally solid and player-focused developer.

												As a strategy player and board gamer they dont come much better then this at the present time. I used to play squad leader and diplomacy but this is detail and historic content beyond compare. If you like strategy and diplomacy as well as marketing and research this is the game for you. Ok it does not have the graphics of total war but then this is basically a board game. I have played ww2 board game and this is as good without takeing up the living room table and packing it away every night and spending hours setting up.  The scenarios are good learning steps toward the grand game and the freedom to do and create as well as destroy are terrific . Seelowe actually can succeed and sicily not happen at all when Rommel captures Cairo and the Suez . So give it a try and I think you will be hooked patience is a virtue and imagination an asset.			"

												You're holding out against the Allies who are constantly amassing on your western front, and on your eastern front, where most of your forces are, your forces are pushing through the comintern forces who are constantly running out of supplies due to your strategic bombing runs, broken from the nightly bombings, and slaughtered through your superior tactics, combat experience, generals, and timing.This game is extremely complex, many decisions ranging from managing your country's economy, historical events such as the olympics and the spanish civil war, deciding where you should place more factories to fuel your war machine, to researching technology such as radios and even the nuclear bomb. The combat is very rewarding and fun, favoring those players who take their time to plan and pay close attention to details such as the weather, wind, climate, and landscape. YOU choose how you want to play. You can play as Germany and decide to play defensively on the western front, while you focus on the eastern front, crushing the russian forces, or play as Mexico and join the Axis, destroying weakening the U.S economy and splitting up their forces so Italy and Germany can more easily take over all of Europe. You can play as ANY country such as Japan, Swizterland, Turkey, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Communist China, Nationalist China, etc.TL;DR: Best strategy game ever.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is easily one of my favorite games if not my favorite. In my opinion it's definitely the best strategy game I've ever played and with the setting being in WWII, it makes it even more amazing being that I love WWII history. It's a HUGE game with so many options it's ridiculous (in a VERY, VERY good way). With so many options, you'll never get bored and it will take forever to master so there's always room to improve. The game offers so much freedom that no two games will ever be the same. Whether it be $10 or $100, I'd still recommend it. It's DEFINITELY worth the money and if you don't get it, you're seriously missing out.			"

												Great series Europa-3 (and next EU-IV), Victoria-2, Hearts of Iron-3.I am awaiting HOI-4 and I hope that Vic-3 will be made soon.But, 1) playing this game I was extremely surprised and annoyed by the fact that there is no way to capture enemy's ammo, tanks, artillery, warships and so on... My war forces won a battle and tooks a country... some resources (in HOI-3)  - thats all you can get :( 2) it would be great to get converters for ""long-play"": from EU-4 to Vic-3, from Vic-3 to HOI-4... I know about some versions of converters... But these things do not really work well, and each time when you use a converter, you HAVE do many-many corrections...Anyway, I strongly recommend HOI-3, upcoming HOI-4 and the all of Paradox strategy series from Crusader up to HOI :)			"

												Strategic game where you take WW2 by the horns and ride it down some other path. Spread communism all the way to France, or spread facism all the way to the USA. You can also save Poland from those darn Soviets, or perhaps fight back the Japanese and unify China. Don't expect mind-boggling explosive action, the entire game is a map with menus, but if you enjoy pure strategy and history, don't have a small attention spam, and are awesome, then the action will come by itself on the well-made menus of Hearts of Iron III. Probably the greatest historical game ever, and is also definitely silly as well, as you can do things such send your army of Lithuanians to invade Estonia and Latvia, or send your elite Luxembourish troops to invade the Netherlands. Great fun.			"

												This is a great WW2 strategy game. It acts as a half sandbox half historical game. Letting you change the course of history in realistic ways. Look I have over 450 hours banked into this game. Primarily because every time you play, no matter what your style is and who you play as, every game will have a different outcome. Anouther awesome fact about this RTS strategy is that it allows you to play ANY country, and sometimes make friends (even if they were enemies before) ie. Germany and Holland. With a modding community that is organized, ambitiuos, and helpful to new players, this game will never get as old as the 1930s and 40s. Disclaimer: there is ALOT to understand about the game before one can play perfectly, heck I am still learning a few things.			"

												Hearts of Iron 3 is what I would discribe as a semi-real time strategy game. It is semi RTS because unlike games such as Men of War, R.U.S.E, Theater of War, etc, doesn't take place in a 3D battlefield where the player commands groups of artillery,troops, tanks, and so-on. In HoI 3 one takes command of the nation of their choise and can start anywhere between 1936 - 1945 and the game can go on until at least the 1948, and the player can control what go into their military, economy, diplomatic relations, tech, intelligance, and politics to an extent. As for air, land and sea battles the outcome of those are dependent on the exp of the units leader, the leaders traits, what type of units make up the whole unit, the exp each individual unit, total number of men in the unit as a whole, weather, supplies, time of day, terrain and so-on. Recommended Mods: DiDays I.C.E Mod. Current version: 3.3.4Black ICE FTM Mk VI. Current version: 6. Not recommneded for XP users.			"

												HelloI used Google translate to translate this text.I m customer of Paradox produtcs since their beginning, EU1 specifically, so I know their habit of selling unfinished products such blatant example: i bought SOTS2 and hoi3 when it debuted .The HOI series has always been my favorite since HOI1I bought version 1 hoi3 when it premiered incomplete and it was not possible to play .when I saw he was going out HOI4 ,i thought hoi3 should be playable and stable so I got the latest version.but unable to play , since I have CTD after a few minutes .was expected even for Paradox that after several years the game will be stable !The computer I use is recent and quality has given me no trouble with any other game ( the last and only paradox game i play in this PC was EU4, but i don´t play much, because i don't like the game).I tried to go to their forum, to have technical support ,after several attempts due to bugs of your site ( usual Paradox ) I could register ( I value my time being 30 minutes to let me register, let me discontent ) .After time consuming to register to their Site i Have no effective support and can´t use the product i bougth twice.So my recomandation is, don´t Bye Paradox produtct, their are not indy anymore, so they don´t have excuse for their lack of respect to their customer.

												i unravelled the mystery and fun of victoria and like victoria 2 .. i played europa universalis 2 and 3 and all expansions to death and crusader kings is neat.. this game however is abotu a period that doesnt lend itself well to grand strategy game sand quite frankly the learning curve scares me (only because it took me years to master victoria and vctoria 2 do i fear learning this) if u have time and motivation i have no doubt this is more of paradoxes master pieces in strategy gaming. but be prepared to learn.if ur new to paradox. play europa universalis 3 or for the glory first. trust me.

												Excited about HoI4? Me too, that's why i finally caved in and bought this game.It's complicated, it's complicated like ♥♥♥♥ and you're gonna spend a lot of time on youtube tutorials, but when you finally pull off a successfull invasion of France, it feels worth it.I'm not gonna keep playing it tho probably. This is the reason: You can automate pretty much every aspect of the game, one of those is to automate the army, just give them general goals like say ""Take Paris"" and watch them spread out across the frontlines and start waging war. This appealed to me SOOOOO ♥♥♥♥ING HARD, i loved the idea of watching the AI capitalize on the groundwork i laid out and executing my war plans. Unfortunately that part of the game is very buggy and the AI can't actually handle it.So it's up to me to micromanage all my forces and it's just too much, there can be hundreds upon hundreds of units to boss around, not for me.But i still enjoyed my little time in HoI3 and it made me more excited for HoI4.If you decide to get the game, do not buy the cosmetic unit DLC! Eventually you are gonna decide you want to use the ingame NATO (i think?) symbols for your units due to all the information they provide, and you will never actually see the DLC you paid for.			"

												Honestly? HOI3 kind of kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ On first impression, all of that Paradox complexity is packed into the military aspects of the game, but a few hours of play will reveal that each other subsystem is full of things you need to know - so in short, it blows other Paradox series out of the water complexity wise and even leaves stuff like Dwarf Fortress in the dust. In short, HOI3 is ridiculously hardcore even by this company's standards. I haven't had much luck; a few games with middle/minor powers are about all I can claim, like the time I irritated the Japanese as Australia by screwing around in the Pacific archipelagos, or my semi-successful Axis Turkey campaign where I managed to conquer a decent swath of former Ottoman territory before Germany and Italy decided to invade India (and succeeded), before the Soviet Union decided to backstab them and wipe me off the map in the process with sheer numbers.I'd still recommend it to strategy fans, but you have to be willing to handle a good deal of micromanagement and get good at building overarching war strategies to do well. Master this, and you could probably get a good start on an actual military career.			"

												After 840 hours, I still enjoy playing this game...the playability factor is off the charts.  I've never really had the same experience twice, despite being someone who rarely changes my tactics.  However, when I do, it's refreshing to see how the UI responds and adapts to my new playing style.  Of course, many of the events are pre-programmed and there is little or nothing you can do to change the course of history leading up to the final conflict, unless you play as Germany or Japan and decide to make decisions different from those made in real life.  However, once the game really gets into the heart of the war, it is immersive, challenging, and detailed.  I love this game, and will continue to rack up hours on it.			"

It is really indepth I remeber having the game pre-ordered and when it arrived in the mail it had the thickest instruction manual I had ever seen, the game requires alot of indepth thought about production, resources, etc. And the other expansions continuelly add onto this. But if you are looking for a true indepth experince after installing the game get the BLACK ICE mod which can be found on the Paradox Forums on their website. Adds over 400 units and adds more depth to an infinitely indepth game.			"

												Hearts of Iron 3 is a very good attempt at WW2 Grand Strategy. Generally, It's well put together, although at times, it can be hurt by the very things which make it so good. Sometimes, the fact that the game has so much depth and is, to be honest, slightly too big for it's own boots is a bit of an issue, although as I said before, it's still a very good game. The learning curve is occasionally brutal, and if your not careful then it can be quite hard to recover from things such as your dissent getting too high, which causes your entire economy to collapse. One main frustration that I have found is that the game does seem to struggle with transporting soldiers, in big numbers, to wherever your theaters of war are. For instance, I was playing as USA during the Pacific War. Because the game provides you with so many pop ups, and there's so much else going on aside from just what your looking at, it quite literally took me 10 minutes to get through all the popups, 90% of which were informing me that the Japanese had repeatedly ""won"" an air battle that I hadn't even known was taking place. However, once you've taken some time to get used to the game, figure out whatever faction and nation works for you, and work out the strategy that that country needs, then it can be, I feel, one of the most rewarding and generally excellent Grand Strategy games out there.

												Great series Europa-3 (and next EU-IV), Victoria-2, Hearts of Iron-3.I am awaiting HOI-4 and I hope that Vic-3 will be made soon.But, 1) playing this game I was extremely surprised and annoyed by the fact that there is no way to capture enemy's ammo, tanks, artillery, warships and so on... My war forces won a battle and tooks a country... some resources (in HOI-3)  - thats all you can get :( 2) it would be great to get converters for ""long-play"": from EU-4 to Vic-3, from Vic-3 to HOI-4... I know about some versions of converters... But these things do not really work well, and each time when you use a converter, you HAVE do many-many corrections...Anyway, I strongly recommend HOI-3, upcoming HOI-4 and the all of Paradox strategy series from Crusader up to HOI :)			"

												Great Grand Strategy game, very in depth great for people who want the challenge of maintaining a war machine.I recommend you try it with a mod, like Black Ice, with third reich event's if you plan on playing Germany. A bit complex especially with mod's but well worth it if you are a fan of historical accuracy and realism. This game is a micro-managing kind of game, however there are options incase you want the AI to take over, you can even assign a certain front in a war to be AI controlled. A word of Advice, the Soviet's are beastly, be sure that when you engage them you have enough manpower left over to fill in for the causalities you sustain. I have myself and other's found out the hard way, that 600+ manpower wasn't enough to sustain the casualities, my well armed, well oiled war machine collapsed due simply to the number of casualties sustained fighting the Soviets.

												Spend several days staring at a map,and have fun doing it! Not for the faint of heart,I reccomend playing other paradox games first. My suggestion is to play the games in this order: Crusader Kings 2 (then Europa Universalis 3 or 4 if you feel like it.) CK2 will help you get a feel for the Clausewitz engine,Victoria 2 so you can master diplomacy and get a better feel with a more 'realistic' warfare system,THEN play HoI3. The learning curve is about as steep as a ♥♥♥♥in' cliff,but the game has AI that can help you with your first few playthroughs and there's a few tutorials online as well.			"

												I have lost count the amount of my life I have lost playing this game because its that good :-)Although I wouldn't give it 10/10 because there are some major flaws that give this 10/10 but I would say 8/10 would be a fairer assesment.  The game has become more complex but in some ways better for it, the creation of armies has now come more structured so you can spread your specialisation abit more. For instance an army could have a corp dedicated to attack fortifications via their generals or brigades. Its lost some of its military accuracy and some of the pictures do not represent the item you can build, for instance a Tiger tank shows a British heavy instead.However I will advise on what I think is wrong and why it looses 2 points.1: Alliance features.Wheather you decide to be the Allied powers or the Axis powers, they never seem to work together except use the ability to use friendly territory. A negative review below puts it correctlly, in this game they added the ability to create battleplans or use historical ones, but they do not work, the allies required do not follow though with the plan and do not offer units. An example of this would be Operation Torch and Husky. I played as the US yet the Brits did not help out in either operation. That being said if I was to counter argue this, one could say that because this game is unique that history never really plays out as it does historically, its possible that the Brits had all their transport ships sunk and are struggling to build more, also the fact that  they lost Africa doesn't help either. But that in its own way is a vilification that the game AI lacks the ability to think strategically and historically.2: The airforceI encountered this same problem in HoI2, were you could have top airforce training for your fighters and interceptors, and even good research, yet go up against anything, intercept bombers or even go fighter hunting, it seems to struggle to work correctly and always leaves me requiring to heal my fighters more often then anything else. Air attacks against ground forces is either hit or miss, either they do what there supposed to do or do nothing at all. I find the only really effective options is strategic bombing, which actually do damage to cities and cause some really nasty problems. But there is a negative there also, if you were to focus historically on WW2, Germany and Japan where on their knees near 1944 and 45 due to the effectiveness of stragegic bombing. New equipment could not be built quick enough and resources became low as factories became ineffective due to either lack of resources or their own destruction. Yet in HoI3 a country can overcome a bout of bombing very quickly and shake it off like a light bang on the head. This makes things a little boring and in the end you focus your efforts elsewhere.Inspite these issues I love this game and always revert back to it when I am bored of other games which is becoming often. There is so much to do in this game that offers new challenges, and more uncertain outcomes. As HoI4 in well into its development I will eventually get that, hopefully it will improve the areas I have gripped about, but we will see.			"

												It looks awesome but there are no tuturials or anything. You have to guess a lot to figure this game out. I have tried some time, watched some online tuturials, but have ended givin up. You don't know when something is build or what happened in a battle because it is so visually confusing to look at. I thought it was going to be like axis and allies board game, but everything is just to confusing and doesn't feel rewarding when something in the game happens. I hope the next one will be better. If you haven't played some of the others, don't buy this one, wait for the next game.			"

												I recommend this game immensely. Picture yourself at the helm of an alliance of like-minded nations wanting nothing but peace. A piece of this country & a piece of that country. This game is very in depth & while that may turn you off, I would suggest sticking to it no matter how tough it gets. Be more stubborn than Hitler in his bunker. Depending on how your game goes, you may find yourself having the same temper. This game means you can play as the Nazis guilt free & when things may go wrong you may find yourself shakily removing your glasses, politely asking most people to leave your bunker & verbally lambasting everyone left inside for not obeying your very sane orders to drain the Atlantic as a viable way to invade the USA. ;)There are many great things about this game. The plan making makes you feel like an evil genius, the research trees mean you need to prioritise & the diplomacy can mean you need to tread carefully with which tyrant, dictator or empire you annoy. All in all, this game will leave you begging for more whether you are driving your panzers past the Eiffel tower, leading a Banzai charge across the Pacific, getting bombed by Stukas as you leave Dunkirk, join the war late & claim all the credit or wave a white flag within weeks of getting invaded.

												Once you understand that HOI3 will never work properly this is a great game. Would highly recommend it to any paradozx lover/ player but UNDERSTAND this you will never be able to get it to work all the time.Other than that when you have exausted the singleplayer there are a few people who want to play multiplayer but it can be hard to organise at first but once its set up its easy. just kill everyone. thats the only help im gonna give you. KILL THEM ALL!!!!! :abomb:			"

												Absolutely love this game and can easily lose a weekend to playing it. As a WWII history buff, I appreciate the amount of detail and work that has gone into this game! I particularly enjoy the randomness of starting off with one of the preset scenarios (1936, 1939, etc) as a Major actor in the war and watching it evolve differently than recorded history with just a few policy or diplomacy changes. For example, playing as the U.S. starting in 1936, I placed a large focus on my naval and ground power and gave mere lip service to production and development of my air assets. Though I was able to win the battle in the Pacific against Japan by 1944 forcing surrender without using Nukes, and able to neutralize Italy in marching from Sicily to Switzerland, I was mired in the battle for Fortress Europe as I learned quickly that not having adequate air power against the German Luftwaffe in France as well as the Low Countries was not a great strategy. My bombers were pummeled every time they lifted off, air support that I sent as escorts were being swatted out of the sky like flies and the Luftwaffe bombers made me pay for every square I took in battle. My only wish was that there were a proper way to co-ordinate with the AI/Allies to achieve objectives to more closely simulate real operations (Dragoon, Torch, Overlord, etc.) as the one that is currently in place is pretty ineffectual. Aside from that, I will continue playing this until the next iteration hits the market.Absolutely recommended!			"

												Not that I don't like the control I get over an economy, industry, diplomacy, military of a WW2 nation, but it's not for me. For one, you don't really ""manage"" intelligence and politics, you just set a couple bars and hope it works out. For another, not everything is explained...at all. Watch Youtube videos to better understand some of the mechanics.Personally, if you want to just jump in and get experience, play America to practice controlling an economy and industry, then go Italy for some military experience. Diplomacy matters more to Italy than America, but mostly it's just historical events. DO NOT GO AS GERMANY IF YOU ARE CLUELESS! THE WAR STARTS, AND LARGELY FOR THE FIRST 2 YEARS, RUNS ON THEIR SCHEDULE! YOU WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY HOW MUCH STUFF HAPPENS AT ONCE!Also, managing armies isn't always straightforward. Note: if you're army has no supplies, it can move, but it cannot attack an enemy army (can still occupy territory I believe). You will take longer to move over rivers and in mountains without engineers (train lots). Finally, you cannot post any troops in terrritories with less than 2 infrastructure. Seriously, they are foot pounders...WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A ROAD SYSTEM!?Also also, while commanders give bonuses, it's not an easy system to understand. FYI: you set the stars, or ""seniority"" of commanders (just dictates how high a command they CAN take). Higher level: higher command since it'll take awhile to level up...unless they have an ability that's really handy to a particular army right now. Lower levels: tend to be front-line leaders, but not all abilities are useful (ie. supplies reduction is likely useful in Theatre (highest) command, since the most troops will be effected (even if the general is a lower skill level)Overall, while the sheer ability to command all major aspects of a WW2 nation is nice, not all commands are created equal, not all features and mechanics are explained in useful detail, and at times there is simply too much micro-management for someone like me to enjoy. Good effort, but improvement is definately possible and I'd argue nessecarry for this series.			"

												I'll give a review about this game in my experience in it. First of when you play this game YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING unless of course you've played the old Hearts of Iron games. The tutorial in this game is just terrible, it doesn't show you how battles work and doesn't explain alot about the game. Which will be really hard, especially when you start picking a country to play. Only way I managed to properly play was to go to youtube tutorials on ""How to play HOI3"", and that was pretty much it. Not to mention the terrible AI control which led to my downfall sometimes, and also on how HARD the game could be even when its put on easy. Of course you'll have to learn to become good at it. And that's for the cons in my opinion.When you get into more of the game it starts to get addicting, the game mechanics are great. I love how the enemy AI plays against an invasion from me. And also the intensity it can get once you start loosing. It's really enjoyable if you get to know how to play. The timeline and decision making is really cool and I also really like how realistic the battles could be, especially when you download mods like Black Ice in which I would recommend you. DLCs added with the game gives  the game more features which I like about it. And their really cheap. And thats what I can give you for the pros.AND DON'T INVADE RUSSIA... I regret alot.			"

												This game is not for the faint of heart, but is hugely rewarding.  If re-fighting World War 2 at Divisional/Brigade level is what you're after, then you have very niche interests.  However, this is also the game for you.I recommend the ICE (Iron Cross Edition) mod, available from the Paradox forums.

												The greatest WW2 Grand strategy game comes back  again with greater depth than ever before! Want to change history? Control the politics yourself to avoid or speed up key events! Want to NOT do the same mistakes as the previose rulers? Where they focused more on tank armour rather than speed? YOU decide what the research teams focus on, sacrificing armour for speed, or the other way around. Need to bomb a city an ocean away but your heavu bombers cant make it? research bigger fuel tanks! sure they become more vulnerable to fire but hey, you hit that target!To give you an example:Played as Japan,Didnt let generals go nuts and force a war with chinaConvinced Nationalist China to join the alliance and attack the USSRUSSR Surrenders to the AxisDONT attack Pearl Harbour, instead focus on industry to fight the embargoesTake the French and British coloniesInvade Australia, take AustraliaEstablish Japanesse empire in East Asia, bringing the pacific into a time of industrial expansion.This is how you can change history, for better or for worse, its all up to you and your allies			"

												Able to play any country from 1936-1948, hour by hour with adjustable speeds even in multiplayer, though only major powers and some regionals are worth playing.  Game really rewards thinking ahead, as in months and years (game time) ahead.  Multiplayer is recommended, AI is easy to beat, though it'll still put up a good enough fight for you to enjoy singleplayer.  All 3 expansions are REQUIRED, they add and fix so many things, the game is not worth playing without them.  (Expansions are Semper Fi, For the Motherland, and Their Finest Hour, do NOT bother with any other DLC, except the music packs if you want those.)This is a war game, don't expect any diplomatic, cultural, scientific, or economic victories.  The only thing that matters at the end of the day is whose troops are in the capitols of their enemies.Air operations are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to manage.Naval operations are simple but get the job done.Ground operations are where this game ♥♥♥♥ing shines.The Order Of Battle can be a little annoying to set up.Diplomacy is very simple, as is Intelligence and Internal Politics, generally allowing you to set and forget.Research and Production are where you have the most freedom to do as you wish with your country.Your basic air units are Air Wings, which you group up into 2s, 3s, or 4s, and have them perform whatever role they're designed to, Interceptors will generally be flying air superiority or interception, Close Air Support will generally be bombing enemy ground units, etc.Ships larger than a destroyer are produced individually and grouped together to form task forces which perform whatever mission they can from the ships assigned.  Carriers can be sent to bomb enemy ports or fleets, Battleships are generally used to form the fighting line of your fleets, engaging other battleships, bombarding, etc.  Destroyers are represented by Destroyer Flotillas, each Destroyer Flotilla in game is supposed to represent about 3 Destroyers, they are used to screen your larger ships.Your basic ground unit is the Division, which is made up of individual brigades of your choice, anything from your standard Infantry brigade to Artillery brigades or Heavy Armour brigades, there are a lot of choices.  The brigades all add certain bonuses and maluses to the division as a whole and this determines how effective it is in combat in the various terrains against other divisions.  There is a lot that goes into what makes a good division, terrain, cost (in industrial capacity, supplies, and manpower), tech level, your enemies, and more.  Countries like the USA can afford to go heavy on support units and armour because of their abundance of everything, while other countries like Japan may find itself not being able to make a lot of support or armour because of their shortages of everything, nor would they normally want to make a lot of armour because of all the low infrastructure mountains and jungles they'll usually find themselves fighting in (not the best tank country).  You'll find yourself fielding a number of different types of divisions for all the situations you'll be dealing with.Most games against the AI will play out historically until 1941 or 42, it will not deviate from the script, though sometimes it can make a mistake against the other AI and get bogged down taking longer to do what it historically did.  After 1942 it's all up in the air depending on how you and the various AI are doing.  Against other players, this game offers a lot of different routes to alternate history scenarios.Definitely worth picking up on a sale if you're into WW2 games or grand strategy games in general.

												Takes a while to get into, but once you understand it, its probably the easiest modern paradox title.  I thought it was pretty damn fun.  Maybe a little too complicated.  There doesn't need to be this many provinces.  Also manually setting up your OOB at the beggining of every game can be a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥.  However, watching GUATEMALA just appear over the entirety of Europe makes it all worth it.			"

You also control your country's espionage, technology, production and politics. You can micro-manage or automate to your hearts content. If a country existed in this time period, you can control itWould stay up way too late into the night again.			"

												This is a Grand Strategy Game at its finest, you take complete control of a country before and during World War 2. Now this means making sure you have the manpower and reasources to commit to a campaign, now to start with I'd play a larger country to get the hang of it but do yourself a favor and start in Europe or close to it. Everything matters, researching technology, politics, spying, and especially Alliances. If you start as a weaker country you want to build strong relationships fast because soon you could be a target. The worst country to start with is Luxembourg, it is super tiny (One province) and not worth the hassle of taking on the larger countries beside you. Overall it is a great game and it is definitely worth $10, give it a try you won't regret it.			"

												Hearts of Iron III, simply put, is a spectacularly good grand strategy game. Though players will initially find it daunting due to the number of mechanics in play at once (your first war will most certainly be confusing), if you take the time to learn the gameplay mechanics, either by playing or searching online, you'll eventually get to grips with it - it took me no longer than about 5-10 hours to understand most of the important game mechanics, though I still occasionally find myself learning something new. That said, I have some friends who haven't been able to understand the gameplay (which turned multiplayer into a bit of a hand-holding scenario), so it won't be for everyone. Once you've gotten into the real meat-and-bones of the gameplay, Hearts of Iron III has a lot to offer. The number of nations available for the player to choose is simply amazing - you can choose anybody from the mighty USSR down to Luxembourg or Costa Rica, and this really allows the gameplay to evolve with every new game. This, along with the ability to completely alter the history of the world in the 1930s and 1940s, is what really makes the game shine. Freedom is granted to the player to make an aggressive superpower out of Sweden, or to launch an invasion of the U.S.A as Nazi Germany. The scope of the game is immense, and the detail on the campaign map is brilliant. The combat, once you've got the hang of it, is fun, and the wars you will find yourself in can take anywhere from a minute to several days of gameplay to bring to a conclusion. The AI is occasionally partial to moments of pants-on-head stupidity though, which sometimes let the game down a bit. Multiplayer, although I haven't played much of it admittedly, was good for the most part. Gameplay is, of course, identical to the campaign, but the new elements that a human player, as opposed to an AI, bring to the game make it downright entertaining. Player politics in the multiplayer can be treacherous (indeed, a good comparison for the player politics in the multiplayer would be to Risk, or Civ 5), but it also allows for some interesting co-operation between historical rivals (the USSR and Nazi Germany in one of my games, for instance - though admittedly this came with a great deal of backstabbing on my behalf!). Overall, it's a wonderfully well presented Grand strategy game. The world is your sandbox, and history is ripe for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation. If you have the time to spare to get to grasps with the gameplay, I'd fully recommend it. It is, however, a real time sink, so if you don't have that much free time, it may not be for you.			"

												The most realistic depiction of warfare that I have ever seen. You organise divisions, corps, armies, army groups and theaters as if you were the actual leader of a nation. You have to grapple with  submarine raids on your convoys, bombers turning your factories to rubble and nations that are drifting towards the enemy. You can dabble in all of the crazy stuff that WW2 produced. Jet fighters, superheavy tanks, rockets, and eventually the terrifying power of nuclear weapons can all be yours to command.Fight for freedom as the Allies, conquer the world as the Axis or lead a worldwide revolution as the Comintern.Just don't try to understand the supply system. Even the developers can't understand the supply system.			"

												Now this game, even though I'd recommend it, has very important issues people would really need to take into account before spending money on it. The game itself is very difficult, trying to control every aspect of your nation, including troop movements, and attempting to further your domination across whatever continent you are on is very very very difficult. It took me a while to learn all the tips and tricks, you can give your HQs objectives, and automate a lot of things, but learning that is difficult, and no to mention, not very fun for the 'Grand Strategy' fans out there. Overall the game is good, graphics are low key and not very hard on any PC. The biggest problem technically, is the buggy and glitchiness of the games start-up, you can't really buy the DLCs and enjoy all of them, or even some of them without having some start-up failure of some type. You can't really run into problems with the base game, which I enjoy, and the DLCs, might just be a me problem. All in all get the game, if you don't like it, its just 10 bucks, wait for Hearts of Iron IV to be released sometime in 2016 and that, I can promise you, will not be a disappointment.			"

I think they must be around 500 hours by now.Hearts of Iron III is the peak of the Paradaox games. It's fantastic (especially with the add-ons, vanilla soon turns out to be repetitive), challenging and hard. I don't deny one needs some autism to actually enjoy games like this, but if you love ww2 era history, you'll love this nonetheless.			"

I never was able to fix some minor random graphical problems like some tooltips disappearing or random colors appearing, but a game restart fixed so i kept playing. Technical support basically ignored me after their first 2 suggestions didnt work.Finally gave up playing after my second save game corrupted and couldnt be played past a certain date.Summary: The game is awesome, but be prepared to lose a few hours installing some fixes and patches which were never made automatical and be aware that even then there's a risk that the game wont work properlyps: all these problems happened with all dlc's and patches, which means that paradox never fixed the game properly			"

												This is for those that enjoy reading nitpicking reviews, and 'game theory' (in the context of video games, not economics).  It's NOT for people that are simply looking for a game that's fun.  If you value your free time, and value things like 'how long will it take me to learn the game?', then it's useful to read on.----------Right off the bat, the tutorial is horrendous.  It contains walls of text and a few spelling errors (that I only noticed because I was bored), portrayed in the context of a story (an interaction with a 'crazy man' that looks and acts like Adolf Hitler), that feels unecessary (he's only crazy because they keep mentioning that you, the player or character you're portraying, think he's crazy; so part of that is poor writing, if they need to remind you that he has that character trait...).  The only real reason it was done was to tell some jokes, but it clutters up the actual parts of the text that contain information on how to play the game in the first place.  However, the wording of the info is confusing, and I had to re-read the tutorials more than once to actually learn how to play the game.  This is pretty terrible, because a much clearer tutorial could probably be coded up in a work day, but they didn't do that.  Even though paradox is a massive company with many successful titles in this exact genre - so, it's not like they've never done this sort of game before, or had to write tutorials for these sort of games before.  It also sets the scenery poorly - like you have to infer that, for the sake of the tutorial, you're playing as germany.  Just because a grand strategy is basically a digital board game, doesn't mean that you don't have to scrap all attempts at presentation.  You don't lose out on the game for presenting it a little better.  I'm not asking for lens flares and all the faggy pizzaz that goes on in modern games, purely meant to catch the eye and be distracting as♥♥♥♥♥♥  I'm not asking for that.  I'm just asking for proper presentation that facillitates quick learning.  The tutorial doesn't even highlight the parts of the screen you're supposed to be reading very well, but that's a much more minor point.Here's an example of wording - 'You can build divisions in the production menu.  Divisions are made up of brigades.  You only get 4 (brigades?  divisions?), but our troops are so good that you only need 4 (brigades?  divisions?)'.  It's that sort of 'short hand' tone that can make everything else unclear.  If you don't know whether ol' Adolf is talking about divisions or brigades, then it's hard to figure out what the actual rules are.  In order to play a game, you need to know the rules - in order to get good at a game, you need to know how to play within the limits, so that you can tweak your style and discover an optimal level.  A game can have a steeper 'learning curve' effectively by obscuring the player's ability to percieve what is optimal - but there should be a point, I feel, at which the player can see everything that needs to be done to reach an optimal level (maybe after 100 hours of playing the game or so).  I think most players like organization - a game can only be chaotic if the means of playing it is simple.  It's a replayable game when the player can continue to have fun, riding the point of optimization (insert sexual metaphor here).  It's a confusing game, however, when the point of optimization is too obscure, or the goal posts keep shifting.  Unless the point of optimization is growing accustomed to the shifting goal posts, but it shouldn't take more than 100 hours to be able to see where that point lies.  It can take much longer than 100 hours to reach that level, but if the player can see how close they're getting there, they can still be hooked by the game.  Does this make sense?  It's my opinion that some devs have figured this out, and others haven't.------Second issue thus far:- The game crashes when I alt-tab out and try to go back into the game.  I don't understand what causes any game to do this.  Is it the display coding?  I've played several games that don't experience this problem (maybe because they're all capable of windowed mode), but there's plenty of others that can't handle alt-tabbing.  It's one of many software conundrums.  --------Other than that, I haven't had much problem, so I'll recommend the game because grandtards like northern lion love it, so y'know.  Who'm I to judge?  I might get into the game, but it'll probably take another 10 hours re-looking at the tutorials and ♥♥♥♥ing up in the regular game.			"

												This is a re-write of my previous review of Hearts of iron 3. My last review of this game was very high, but time goes by and things tend to change, dramaticly sometimes. for some reason this game has not aged well, This game was in it's time a masterpiece with micro management down to squad level, with the operating systems of today, the developers have not been updating it prooperly. it constantly crashes to desktop, and nothing is being done about it. the game menu is very sloppy made (or updated) like white text on white background, so that you can not see what it reads on the buttons, you also can not chose wich mod to start because of this. because you cannot see what it says, this is poorly updated or just sloppy,I am sure that would be a small task for the developer to just change to black text, well Im guessing that, I have about zero knowledge about programing. but overall, it seems the game is not updated to newer operating systems, well, I run Windows seven and Win8 has been out for years atm. Hearts of iron 3 do not use a hexagon grid, for a game of this size I really wish it would have, the gameplay would have been so much better, with not using a grid, the result is that enemy forces can just slip behind your lines just like that, and there is no real way to block them. it is really a mess. this is something paradox uses in most all their games. however, HOI3 have been a very good game and it still is if you are able to run it, it is a shame to see that  such a great game as this go waisted, the crashes are really annoying because you put in a lot of time in it, you build your country improves production, all this takes hours and then suddenly it crashes and all is lost so you have to start over again, sure you could save often but still you can not save every minute because this is a real time strategy game, so it is easy to forget your self in the midle of strategic planing, if it where turnbased it would not have been such a problem, with all that said, I can not recommend this game at the current date because of these problems, I assume there is not many guys out there running XP today, so they should fix this, but if you DO run Windows XP, poor guy, then go ahead and buy it right off the bat, it will probably work just fine for you,but I can not guarantie it because as I wrote earlyer, I run Win7. keep in mind that at his time there are allmost only good reviews of this game on Steam, so if you manage to find this review, like a needle in the sand, be rest assured that the good reviews are presumably old and from the time when the game worked, therefore you should possibly give this review more weight. the date of writing this review is 2014-09-21, if there would be a patch fixing this in the future, I will rewrite this review. but until then, the game is totally unplayable and I can not give it more than 1/10 because of that, and I recommend that you do not buy this game.

												This game seems to have a steep learning curve.

												If there are other games of this genere that do what this does better I do not know what they are. It is a real mans game of a strategy based war game. The attention to detail is great even down to having real names for the politians and generals for your country and I have not seen poltics modeled so well before as a nice subtle sub-game. As with all the managment type parts you can manually manage them or get the AI to for those times when you want to focus more on moving your troops.			"

												You're holding out against the Allies who are constantly amassing on your western front, and on your eastern front, where most of your forces are, your forces are pushing through the comintern forces who are constantly running out of supplies due to your strategic bombing runs, broken from the nightly bombings, and slaughtered through your superior tactics, combat experience, generals, and timing.This game is extremely complex, many decisions ranging from managing your country's economy, historical events such as the olympics and the spanish civil war, deciding where you should place more factories to fuel your war machine, to researching technology such as radios and even the nuclear bomb. The combat is very rewarding and fun, favoring those players who take their time to plan and pay close attention to details such as the weather, wind, climate, and landscape. YOU choose how you want to play. You can play as Germany and decide to play defensively on the western front, while you focus on the eastern front, crushing the russian forces, or play as Mexico and join the Axis, destroying weakening the U.S economy and splitting up their forces so Italy and Germany can more easily take over all of Europe. You can play as ANY country such as Japan, Swizterland, Turkey, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Communist China, Nationalist China, etc.TL;DR: Best strategy game ever.			"

												Fantastic game. One of my all time favourites. Grand Strategy isn't for everyone but HOI3 is a great place to start, especially if you love World War Two history, deep and complex game play and building the ultimate war machine. Just don't be surprised if you have to spend a little more time learning the ropes then in most games. Graphically this 5 year old title holds up pretty well, largely due to a fairly simplistic yet functional graphical style. As for the audio, the sound effects are just 'ok' but the sound track is very well done. The game itself is largely bug free although the AI is at best competent. Thankfully there is still an active modding community that provides everything from graphical to AI to complete overhaul changes. Definitely consider this title if you're looking to try something new and are passionate about history and strategy.			"

												This is certainly a game I recommend everyone who likes strategy games try, but keep in mind that less hardcore strategy gamers wont enjoy it nearly as much due to it's in depth nature. The learning curve of the game is steep, to say the least, and many people will find it needlessly complex. People like me, however, love the extra depth to the game, the ability to micromanage and customize armies, politics, research, and relations with other countries. It doesn't take too long to get a hang of how the game works if you hit pause and play around with it a bit, or you could go through tutorials or online guides on how to play the game. Overall a wonderful game, if a bit slow on lesser-end computers.			"

												For 99% of ""Strategy Games"" out there the word ""Strategy"" is shamefully misused.  I assure you nearly all strategy games have nothing to do with strategy, they are just ""Tactical"" games that are deluding themselves.  NOT THE CASE with this game.  this is likely one of the only Genuine Strategy Games i have ever played.  you ACTUALY control a nation at war.  it has a wide veriety of variation for a game that takes place in an actual historical time.  and i loved it.however, it is very dificult to play, the in game tutorial is about as helpfull as fabric softener in a steal mill, the is NO in game help WHATSOEVER.  and the games Manuel is often misleading about the games actual functionality if not flat out WRONG.  (i know this because im a modder monkey and have taken a look at the games AI and Combat code.  trust me, the games manual is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥you likely will not like this game.  I love it... than again im more screwed up in the head than a Gay, Jewish, Black man wearing a Shwastica Arm Band.  just keep that in mind.			"

												If you like better to have the full control over your own nation than just building your whole armies and sending them on the front like in coh2 then this is the game for you. Its kinda hard to get started because there are so many things do constantly do but when you have played it a view hours then u get used to it and maybe even conquer thw whole wide world. There is even a mod for WW I if you like it more. With the DLC's the game expands even more there are new events and a gigantic number of random scenerios. To say it short it is a really BIG game with many DLC and possible ways to do it and one of the best games when you come home after a long day at work just to relax and watch ow the Sowjets kill everyone for some reason :D			"

												Hearts of Iron lll Review:-Short Summary:It's badass. Get it now and play it. 9/10-Longer Summary:Hearts of Iron lll is a simulation of the World War 2 era. You can play ANY country during the time and lead it to victory by join the Allies, Axis, or Communists. While it sticks to history semi-realistically (Germany may become too OP) you are allowed to freely change it and see what would happen. What if the U.S joined the Axis? It's an interesting period of history and you get to change it. Lead your army, navy, and airforce on a massive scale. However, it can become too overwhelming at times and that can be a turn off. Also, periods of doing nothing but building up can be boring at times. However, it can be tense, and when the going gets rough, it can get really hard this game, even on easy. However, this game is unique in it's nature and gets even epicer with mods and the dlc provided, which sadely is needed to make the game much, much, better and adds needed features to the game. When it's all there though, it is a pretty good game.			"

												What drew me into this game was the simple fact that it was the only game that promised to actually let me win WWII with Germany. Something no other game I know of (except for HoI I & II I guess) dares to do. I was quite surprised at the level of depth in this game. While the graphics are practically nonexistant this game really simulates all of the details of leading a country to war. From economy, to espionage, to arms production to propaganda. Everything. Now let's wait until Creative Assembly dares to develop ""Nazis Total War"" (I would pay sooo much money for that)  ;).			"

												Hearts of Iron III, simply put, is a spectacularly good grand strategy game. Though players will initially find it daunting due to the number of mechanics in play at once (your first war will most certainly be confusing), if you take the time to learn the gameplay mechanics, either by playing or searching online, you'll eventually get to grips with it - it took me no longer than about 5-10 hours to understand most of the important game mechanics, though I still occasionally find myself learning something new. That said, I have some friends who haven't been able to understand the gameplay (which turned multiplayer into a bit of a hand-holding scenario), so it won't be for everyone. Once you've gotten into the real meat-and-bones of the gameplay, Hearts of Iron III has a lot to offer. The number of nations available for the player to choose is simply amazing - you can choose anybody from the mighty USSR down to Luxembourg or Costa Rica, and this really allows the gameplay to evolve with every new game. This, along with the ability to completely alter the history of the world in the 1930s and 1940s, is what really makes the game shine. Freedom is granted to the player to make an aggressive superpower out of Sweden, or to launch an invasion of the U.S.A as Nazi Germany. The scope of the game is immense, and the detail on the campaign map is brilliant. The combat, once you've got the hang of it, is fun, and the wars you will find yourself in can take anywhere from a minute to several days of gameplay to bring to a conclusion. The AI is occasionally partial to moments of pants-on-head stupidity though, which sometimes let the game down a bit. Multiplayer, although I haven't played much of it admittedly, was good for the most part. Gameplay is, of course, identical to the campaign, but the new elements that a human player, as opposed to an AI, bring to the game make it downright entertaining. Player politics in the multiplayer can be treacherous (indeed, a good comparison for the player politics in the multiplayer would be to Risk, or Civ 5), but it also allows for some interesting co-operation between historical rivals (the USSR and Nazi Germany in one of my games, for instance - though admittedly this came with a great deal of backstabbing on my behalf!). Overall, it's a wonderfully well presented Grand strategy game. The world is your sandbox, and history is ripe for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation. If you have the time to spare to get to grasps with the gameplay, I'd fully recommend it. It is, however, a real time sink, so if you don't have that much free time, it may not be for you.			"

What really interesting about the game is the ""endless"" possibilities in re-writing history as one of major (or minor) Nation that fought on WW-2. You can Play as Germany and win the war, or stand quietly as a minor nation that try to stand still during this horrible conflict. Rise and fall of a nation is at your disposal, and if I may, ""fate of the world?"" *Beware that this game takes time to play. Endless instruction to read and practices.

												I have lost count the amount of my life I have lost playing this game because its that good :-)Although I wouldn't give it 10/10 because there are some major flaws that give this 10/10 but I would say 8/10 would be a fairer assesment.  The game has become more complex but in some ways better for it, the creation of armies has now come more structured so you can spread your specialisation abit more. For instance an army could have a corp dedicated to attack fortifications via their generals or brigades. Its lost some of its military accuracy and some of the pictures do not represent the item you can build, for instance a Tiger tank shows a British heavy instead.However I will advise on what I think is wrong and why it looses 2 points.1: Alliance features.Wheather you decide to be the Allied powers or the Axis powers, they never seem to work together except use the ability to use friendly territory. A negative review below puts it correctlly, in this game they added the ability to create battleplans or use historical ones, but they do not work, the allies required do not follow though with the plan and do not offer units. An example of this would be Operation Torch and Husky. I played as the US yet the Brits did not help out in either operation. That being said if I was to counter argue this, one could say that because this game is unique that history never really plays out as it does historically, its possible that the Brits had all their transport ships sunk and are struggling to build more, also the fact that  they lost Africa doesn't help either. But that in its own way is a vilification that the game AI lacks the ability to think strategically and historically.2: The airforceI encountered this same problem in HoI2, were you could have top airforce training for your fighters and interceptors, and even good research, yet go up against anything, intercept bombers or even go fighter hunting, it seems to struggle to work correctly and always leaves me requiring to heal my fighters more often then anything else. Air attacks against ground forces is either hit or miss, either they do what there supposed to do or do nothing at all. I find the only really effective options is strategic bombing, which actually do damage to cities and cause some really nasty problems. But there is a negative there also, if you were to focus historically on WW2, Germany and Japan where on their knees near 1944 and 45 due to the effectiveness of stragegic bombing. New equipment could not be built quick enough and resources became low as factories became ineffective due to either lack of resources or their own destruction. Yet in HoI3 a country can overcome a bout of bombing very quickly and shake it off like a light bang on the head. This makes things a little boring and in the end you focus your efforts elsewhere.Inspite these issues I love this game and always revert back to it when I am bored of other games which is becoming often. There is so much to do in this game that offers new challenges, and more uncertain outcomes. As HoI4 in well into its development I will eventually get that, hopefully it will improve the areas I have gripped about, but we will see.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is a great game.  If you want a WWII simulator with free reign to try almost anything with any country its is fantastic.However once you install the later DLC its stop working.  I dont know if its for the motherland or Thier finest hour that breaks it, but it breaks.  It runs for about 18 months and simply stops and the program closes.  I have tried this with 2 machines runnign two different installs (one from Gamers gate and one from steam) and had exatly the same problem!There are a lot of complaits about this  on the forums which Paradox seem to ignore. I assume its a Windows 8 issue and they're obviously busy trying to write the next big thing they want us all to buy.In summary - its fantastic, but be carefull with the official DLC.			"

												Hmm first off before i write this review, ignore my hours on this thing because i have an excuse revolving around it.To my fair view i've done research about the game, gotten to watch many tutorials, videos, picture and much more things that the game has to offer. One thing is this game is something that isn't made much or common really, it could be seen as quite a treat to have this due to lack of strategy, planning WWII games.The game has a lot of nice concepts, a not-bad community (Kinda is, but i'll ignore that for now), pretty realistic in someways. The planning and strategy are quite unique adding another feature to this game. The game so far isn't too bad, it's quite good actually. I'm sure many people would still love to play it, especially those who're big fans of WWII genres and alike. The graphics are satisfying enough to extent, the music isn't half bad, quite nice actually at times. Voices meh. And overall it's pretty nice.Now to go into cons (For me, one too many!)This game isn't too bad actually to be honest, if the company wasn't so lazy around it. I have gotten this issue, and through researching and looking through the web a bit i've found out that many people, besides me. Also have been getting this issue, it's not just one. But many. The severity also ranges.This issue is that the game doesn't start, or is extremely odd when starting, no pictures, maybe a black screen, no loading into game etc. You name it, seriously this is one thing you shouldn't EVER! have in a game.  You should make sure you don't need any specific programs no one tells you about or has to run the game. Some people can run it perfectly fine, you know what great? But then there's about thousands of others, me included who have this issue. Now let me tell you a bit more about my personal experience with this pile of S%#T.I first start the game, great. The screen doesn't show, and the cursors there. I go to task and close it, i then relaunch. This time, it takes up the whole screen with the range i can move the cursor, i launch task manager, i cannot click anything with the cursor or disable it. Now i restart the pc, i go on it. My pc is going messed up and slow and programs are going on and off. (I have a good pc too) I then tried a virus search incase i got something earlier, only one result came up. It being from the game itself -_-. It isn't a virus, but really?... I removed it, restarted my pc it, the pc starts to work again -_-. I uninstall the game then go online for solutions, i've tried downloading, reinstalling, uninstalling a mix of many programs. C++, DirectX9 Etc many things, NONE have worked. I'll tell you what i just did, i just went and spend 5$ on a game, a game that isn't usable and messes up your pc to sH$@. Now i'm not saying the game is overall bad due to this, but really? Be honest here, is it that hard to make the game playable? It's seriously annoying, even more when i see thousands of forums with the same questions and issues. Fix this!The game itself, the gui's are messy and non-neat, they don't look like any hard works put in at all! I understand if you want a bunch of buttons or options under one thing, but it doesn't mean you gotta make it look like crap. The maps itself can be glitchy at times, the game can experience extreme crashing if you do more than 1 thing at once -_-. These are basic issues you can fix EASILY! So you know what i'm telling this company to do? FIX THEM!!! Otherwise this game would actually be worth it.In my opinion this game isn't really recommended, unless you're a WW2 strategy hog. Besides that run away from this piece of crap.			"

												Very fun Paradox game , I cant wait for the 4th one and i feel like this one isnt as hard if u worked up the ladder of paradox games  i started form eu4 to victoriea 2 to this  , its is still complex and very historical , however in my experiences so far nukes arnet a god like weapon and dont seem that effictive agaisnt any country with well ic and resources , also  i played a game as japan , whihc was fun , i waited to fight the us and we mangaded to win , but never fought the us which is what the high light of japan is , as england i built a wall around my country of aa guns and went heavily on aa  battle of brittian ended in a day, i won and now 1944 germany caught up to me in jets and tanks yes i was beating them i just didnt have the industry to mass produce , and i nuked them 5 times in occupied paris (only place in range, and me and my friend playing us tried d day beore killing italy or tkaing africa and then i nuked hamburg  two other german citeies and berlin so the highlights of this game was watching the soviets lose the war in 1942 mass bombing france , blockadeing the enteire german fleet apart form 2 subs and transports  where i eventually sunk them and now im just waiting for something to do also the best ally who held off the germans was luximburg (hopefully splet right ) with 2 brigades of about 6,000 men held of germany for almost 2 mounths  poland 5 days france 2 weeks and 3 days neitherlands 3 days beligum a week denmark 1 day norway 3 days , i guess they ha to get there  so overall i think the axis are just better to play as u can plan to conquer the world and you decide the pace of the war , when to be agrissive before the war and some people can take all of poland in a war without the world war firing  so it can be repettive but there is ways to chage the game fomr doing certian things id say 9/10 but navies are odd so hopefully hoi4 will fix it			"

												After 840 hours, I still enjoy playing this game...the playability factor is off the charts.  I've never really had the same experience twice, despite being someone who rarely changes my tactics.  However, when I do, it's refreshing to see how the UI responds and adapts to my new playing style.  Of course, many of the events are pre-programmed and there is little or nothing you can do to change the course of history leading up to the final conflict, unless you play as Germany or Japan and decide to make decisions different from those made in real life.  However, once the game really gets into the heart of the war, it is immersive, challenging, and detailed.  I love this game, and will continue to rack up hours on it.			"

												For 99% of ""Strategy Games"" out there the word ""Strategy"" is shamefully misused.  I assure you nearly all strategy games have nothing to do with strategy, they are just ""Tactical"" games that are deluding themselves.  NOT THE CASE with this game.  this is likely one of the only Genuine Strategy Games i have ever played.  you ACTUALY control a nation at war.  it has a wide veriety of variation for a game that takes place in an actual historical time.  and i loved it.however, it is very dificult to play, the in game tutorial is about as helpfull as fabric softener in a steal mill, the is NO in game help WHATSOEVER.  and the games Manuel is often misleading about the games actual functionality if not flat out WRONG.  (i know this because im a modder monkey and have taken a look at the games AI and Combat code.  trust me, the games manual is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥you likely will not like this game.  I love it... than again im more screwed up in the head than a Gay, Jewish, Black man wearing a Shwastica Arm Band.  just keep that in mind.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is easily one of my favorite games if not my favorite. In my opinion it's definitely the best strategy game I've ever played and with the setting being in WWII, it makes it even more amazing being that I love WWII history. It's a HUGE game with so many options it's ridiculous (in a VERY, VERY good way). With so many options, you'll never get bored and it will take forever to master so there's always room to improve. The game offers so much freedom that no two games will ever be the same. Whether it be $10 or $100, I'd still recommend it. It's DEFINITELY worth the money and if you don't get it, you're seriously missing out.			"

												Hearts of Iron III is a massive WWII Real-Time simulation. Play as the Germans and storm through Europe or as America building a massive army to prepare for the unavoidable war. The game itself has a bit of a learning curve as each unit has multiple stats you must consider, mixed combination make it even more complicated, but the core come down to the strategy involved in your invasions and pre-planning. Do you take the time to secure a nearby ally to support your invasion or do you take them over instead to use as your own? There are many ways to play the game, I'm partial to using Germany to take over Italy just because they are only good for bugging France some. If you get a chance and you love strategy games you should get it.			"

												Having finally gotten over the steep learning curve (made a lot faster by watching Michael Broschek's tutorials), I can say this game is a lot easier than it looks at first glance. Similar to Dwarf Fortress, when I first started playing, it looked to be an impermeable mess of menus and overcomplicated gibberish, but once you finally dove in (perhaps after watching a let's play or the tutorials as I mentioned above), everything slowly pieces itself together. The first game you play, you can expect to make a TON of mistakes, but after your first playthrough, everything should start becoming more natural to you, and you'll improve with every subsequent playthrough (learning where to focus first, what your strategy should be, how to actually use the AI for handling theatres, and so on).For anyone who is looking for a very in-depth grand strategy experience, I'd say look no further than Hearts of Iron 3 (although I do suggest you try out Paraodox's easier grand strategy games like Europa Universalis IV and Crusader Kings 2 to acclimate yourself to the engine). Every country in the world that exists during this time period is playable (although good luck as El Salvador...), and you aren't limited to just the major powers. However, if you do pick up Hearts of Iron 3, I highly suggest getting all of the expansions with it, as well as using large address aware (LAA) on the game's .exe (the lack of LAA practically broke the game on my system).

												This isn't your typical grand strategy game, and even by Paradox standards, the learning curve is incredibly difficult. The game is the most historically accurate portrayal of the Second World War one could imagine and the attention to detail is astounding. History buffs will be captivated. Once you get the hang of the game it is quite entertaining, but commanding units and armies is incredibly fustrating. Unlike in EU or Crusader Kings, your units don't always seem to follow your commands, and in order to carry our your commands you have to do some awkward work arounds. I honestly found Making History: The Calm and the Storm to be a lot more fun.			"

												This is a great game, it is so much fun! The only downside is the diplomacy systems broken, but i guess that was kinda realistic because during ww2 it was basically join a faction and that was it (even though thats kinda annoying playing as a smaller state who can be forced into an early allanice with someone you dont nessicaraly want to join. For example, I was playing as austria and had taken over most of the eastern europen countries, but its almost impossible to take on germany and italy at there peaks and i  had to join the axis which ended up losing in the end.ALSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ability to administer a division, corps, army, army group or theatre and connect the whole lot through a chain of command is a great addition to the game. Really makes the military aspect feel more authentic. The 'custom game' feature on TFN really revolutionises the game for me. Being able to set up your game picking the tech's and units you want make playing middle powers like Canada or Australia much more fun and make France a real possibility in most games. The only issues I have with it is some stability issues on my PC, but that's par for the course for HOI, and the fact that after a while you end up playing the same five or six powers over and over. Still, a great game for $10.			"

												I highly recommend this game, especially for those who enjoy studying history and enjoy alternate history scenarios. However, this game is all about micromanaging and is not for those who wish to jump in and play like in Call of Duty or other examples. The learning curve is very large but it worth leaning in order to gain hundreds of hours of enjoyment from this title. I would recommend starting off from a less in depth Grand Strategy game if you are not experienced, something like Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis IV, and then moving on to this game. but once you know how it works inside and out, you are bound for some very fun times. Want to see what would happen if France had stopped the Germans, if Japan had invaded the west coast of the United States, if Russia had not been able to push back Germany, or even if the United States had never joined the Allies? Then you will love this game and enjoy it for years ahead.			"

												924 hours. That is my total playtime of this game on steam, not counting my playtime via the gamersgate version which I also now own. I think that speaks for itself, but to give a brief summary of my thoughts, well, I can only say this: This is a game that will not appeal to many people. It takes a lot of practice, patience, and a love for long term planning and geopolitical strategy over combat and fast paced action. It also takes a love for history, the detail and the intrigues, and lastly, a large amount of, well, 'geekness'. For those of you who are history buffs, or who want to play a genuinely different type of strategy, pick this up, now. It is worth noting however that Hearts of Iron 2, and in particular Darkest Hour: A hearts of iron game, are in the political and detail senses generally superior games, but if you like any one of these games, you will like all of them for what they are, and that is a solid experience produced by an equally solid and player-focused developer.

												Hearts of Iron III, simply put, is a spectacularly good grand strategy game. Though players will initially find it daunting due to the number of mechanics in play at once (your first war will most certainly be confusing), if you take the time to learn the gameplay mechanics, either by playing or searching online, you'll eventually get to grips with it - it took me no longer than about 5-10 hours to understand most of the important game mechanics, though I still occasionally find myself learning something new. That said, I have some friends who haven't been able to understand the gameplay (which turned multiplayer into a bit of a hand-holding scenario), so it won't be for everyone. Once you've gotten into the real meat-and-bones of the gameplay, Hearts of Iron III has a lot to offer. The number of nations available for the player to choose is simply amazing - you can choose anybody from the mighty USSR down to Luxembourg or Costa Rica, and this really allows the gameplay to evolve with every new game. This, along with the ability to completely alter the history of the world in the 1930s and 1940s, is what really makes the game shine. Freedom is granted to the player to make an aggressive superpower out of Sweden, or to launch an invasion of the U.S.A as Nazi Germany. The scope of the game is immense, and the detail on the campaign map is brilliant. The combat, once you've got the hang of it, is fun, and the wars you will find yourself in can take anywhere from a minute to several days of gameplay to bring to a conclusion. The AI is occasionally partial to moments of pants-on-head stupidity though, which sometimes let the game down a bit. Multiplayer, although I haven't played much of it admittedly, was good for the most part. Gameplay is, of course, identical to the campaign, but the new elements that a human player, as opposed to an AI, bring to the game make it downright entertaining. Player politics in the multiplayer can be treacherous (indeed, a good comparison for the player politics in the multiplayer would be to Risk, or Civ 5), but it also allows for some interesting co-operation between historical rivals (the USSR and Nazi Germany in one of my games, for instance - though admittedly this came with a great deal of backstabbing on my behalf!). Overall, it's a wonderfully well presented Grand strategy game. The world is your sandbox, and history is ripe for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation. If you have the time to spare to get to grasps with the gameplay, I'd fully recommend it. It is, however, a real time sink, so if you don't have that much free time, it may not be for you.			"

												What drew me into this game was the simple fact that it was the only game that promised to actually let me win WWII with Germany. Something no other game I know of (except for HoI I & II I guess) dares to do. I was quite surprised at the level of depth in this game. While the graphics are practically nonexistant this game really simulates all of the details of leading a country to war. From economy, to espionage, to arms production to propaganda. Everything. Now let's wait until Creative Assembly dares to develop ""Nazis Total War"" (I would pay sooo much money for that)  ;).			"

												This is still arguably the best strategic WW2 sim available, despite its flaws. The one chief complaint by many seems to be the inherent level of micromanagement contained within this game and its predecessors, but if you're someone that dislikes micromanagement, then why are you even looking at this game in the first place?This is a game for someone that loves history, loves hardcore simulations, and loves to manage things down to the lowest possible level. Sure, you certainly can automate some game functions to a degree. But HOI3 gives you the power to take control directly, and the possibilities are endless because of it. And with the latest 'Their Finest Hour' expansion, your inner field marshal will shake with joy at the addition of battle plan editing, which allows you do do your own operational-level chief of staff work and create battle plans complete with movement arrows and other annotations, just like something out of Manstein's 'Lost Battles,' or Patton's memoirs. So the bottom line is that if you love love WW2 history, historical simulations, and don't have a short attention span, then this game is most certainly for you!			"

												This isn't your typical grand strategy game, and even by Paradox standards, the learning curve is incredibly difficult. The game is the most historically accurate portrayal of the Second World War one could imagine and the attention to detail is astounding. History buffs will be captivated. Once you get the hang of the game it is quite entertaining, but commanding units and armies is incredibly fustrating. Unlike in EU or Crusader Kings, your units don't always seem to follow your commands, and in order to carry our your commands you have to do some awkward work arounds. I honestly found Making History: The Calm and the Storm to be a lot more fun.			"

												This is a great game, it is so much fun! The only downside is the diplomacy systems broken, but i guess that was kinda realistic because during ww2 it was basically join a faction and that was it (even though thats kinda annoying playing as a smaller state who can be forced into an early allanice with someone you dont nessicaraly want to join. For example, I was playing as austria and had taken over most of the eastern europen countries, but its almost impossible to take on germany and italy at there peaks and i  had to join the axis which ended up losing in the end.ALSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS MOSTLY FOR EXPERINCED STRATEGY GAME PLAYERS AND REQIRES ALOT OF MICROMANAGMENT.But all in all its a fun game!			"

												One of my favourite games, this game is highly detailed and yet not too complex to play and is a great outlet for those who are OCD about organising things. Expect to set aside a good portion of your life when you start a campaign, there are no quick in and out missions. Fortunately you can hand over some of the trickier or dull gameplay elements to the AI (like managing politics and diplomacy zzzz) with that the AI does an ok job. I have not encountered any bugs and the game flows smoothly with the enemies doing what you would hope they do. I recommend if you love smashing nazi's with the red army or carpet bombing the emperor and his gang of criminals.			"

My only complaints are as follows:Unstable, at least for me, and seems to be a memory leak, considering it's very regular, approximately every hour it goes down.The sprites I paid extra for? Some of them are all kinds of screwed up. That's bad business. Did nobody check to make sure they actually worked before slapping a pricetag on them?In all, I consider these minor issues in what is otherwise a fantastic game.

												(Play time is considerably higher than displayed on steam. Game can be played without running steam.)I can't recommend HOI 3. Being a fan of the predecessor, with undreds of hours of playtime, I've never felt at home with the third installment.I looked forward to see the concept enhanced and refined, receiving a sandbox game giving me even more options to play out all the crazy ""what if"" scenarios.Instead I got a pretty clunky piece of software which ran at a considerably lower speed without making any real use of the 3D graphics engine, apart from introducing tons of micro DLCs for unit types.But what annoyed me most, is the fact that the game is way less transparent than the predecessor, offering even less freedom of choice. It mediates the player: Instead of giving him more control, it forces him to follow the pace of the predestined alliances if he wishes to actually take part in the game. While this can be circumvened with lots of ingame time, th fact that you are resigned to watch the computer play persists.Moving your armies, executing certain troop movements like a grand encirclment is not what you are supposed to do. You just watch time tick away, while the computer is moving the troops. HOI 3 was a huge disappointment for me. I really tried to get in touch with it, but even after several playthrough as minor and major powers I didn't feel involved the way I did with HOI2.Funny enough I discovered ""Arsenal of Democracy"", a modification to enhance and refine HOI2, months later. And it was exactly what I hoped HOI3 would offer me. All it lacks is the larger amount of provinces which are provided by HOI3. Playing Arsenal of Democracy, I don't see a reason to return to HOI3.So, no recommendation. Sorry, Paradox. Hope you'll do better with HOI4.			"

												Having finally gotten over the steep learning curve (made a lot faster by watching Michael Broschek's tutorials), I can say this game is a lot easier than it looks at first glance. Similar to Dwarf Fortress, when I first started playing, it looked to be an impermeable mess of menus and overcomplicated gibberish, but once you finally dove in (perhaps after watching a let's play or the tutorials as I mentioned above), everything slowly pieces itself together. The first game you play, you can expect to make a TON of mistakes, but after your first playthrough, everything should start becoming more natural to you, and you'll improve with every subsequent playthrough (learning where to focus first, what your strategy should be, how to actually use the AI for handling theatres, and so on).For anyone who is looking for a very in-depth grand strategy experience, I'd say look no further than Hearts of Iron 3 (although I do suggest you try out Paraodox's easier grand strategy games like Europa Universalis IV and Crusader Kings 2 to acclimate yourself to the engine). Every country in the world that exists during this time period is playable (although good luck as El Salvador...), and you aren't limited to just the major powers. However, if you do pick up Hearts of Iron 3, I highly suggest getting all of the expansions with it, as well as using large address aware (LAA) on the game's .exe (the lack of LAA practically broke the game on my system).

												it had been 200 hours almost and i couldn't finish the game in any country that i played.a part of it caused by rapid crashes a part of it is because it took me a while learning everything so that i could play a game that i would be satisfied about the resoult. but it is the most intense and good strategy game for me. my game crashed like 40 times in 190 hours (which i still think i am lucky usually because i got 6-7 hours not without any crash) and yet i could feel that i am realy operating the whole country in that game from airforce command to minister of defence and president. research commissoner actually its way more than tyranny while i play i am the country with all its people lol i don't trust my ai officers so i manually override everything even the supply routes or convoys (well you can never know that there were no cyclones developed and ready to raise against humanity) ...Anyway its a great game even with crashes and texts dissappearing And its better than new hoi game in my thoghts so far			"

												Best World War II Grand Strategy game ever made, but I will say vanilla is kind of boring so once you learn the game get the Black Ice Mod it overhauls the entire game ( I mean every file was changed ). Sub mods-Third Reich Events-Re-texured Map-Black Ice Sprite Project-Units of The Third Reichhttps://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/black-ice-tfh-download.637689/If you want a historical playthrough get the Black Ice Mod for the Finest Hour expansion.By the way the game is alot more complex than Hearts of Iron IV, but both games are really good for different reasons.Also the game may seem overwelming at first, but I promise if you get past the steep learning curve you will fall in love with the game.Watch this turtorial.

												I would not recommend this game until Paradox fixes a bug where the game freezes when the time ticks over from 23:00 hours to 00:00 hours on a random date after the year 1939.  Unfortunately, i didn't discover this error until i was dozens hours into a game playing as UK.  I tried it as France and the same issue.  I did some research on the Paradox forums and discovered this was a known issue with Windows 8.0 and higher so why wouldn't they indicate this?  At this point this game is unplayable for me so I requested a refund from Steam which i was promptly denied.  I am very skeptical of the integrity of Steam and of Paradox.			"

												DISCLAIMERThe hours mentioned in this review reflect only a portion of the hours invested. I bought this game originally in the discount store as the Vanilla disk version. Have played every standard version as each expansion was release. Also played each version of The ICE mods. DiDay , BlackIce. All in all one of the best strategy games ever developed but only 80% of the credit can go to Paradox. The community mods make this game something get lost in. Shout out to the mods of BlackIce. Please make sure you register your game thru the Paradox forums as to gain acess to the proper mod channels. You can micro manage your life away or see what the AI can pull off. You can mod the game yourself if you get really bored, HoI 4 is in view and I look forward to it.			"

												Not that I don't like the control I get over an economy, industry, diplomacy, military of a WW2 nation, but it's not for me. For one, you don't really ""manage"" intelligence and politics, you just set a couple bars and hope it works out. For another, not everything is explained...at all. Watch Youtube videos to better understand some of the mechanics.Personally, if you want to just jump in and get experience, play America to practice controlling an economy and industry, then go Italy for some military experience. Diplomacy matters more to Italy than America, but mostly it's just historical events. DO NOT GO AS GERMANY IF YOU ARE CLUELESS! THE WAR STARTS, AND LARGELY FOR THE FIRST 2 YEARS, RUNS ON THEIR SCHEDULE! YOU WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY HOW MUCH STUFF HAPPENS AT ONCE!Also, managing armies isn't always straightforward. Note: if you're army has no supplies, it can move, but it cannot attack an enemy army (can still occupy territory I believe). You will take longer to move over rivers and in mountains without engineers (train lots). Finally, you cannot post any troops in terrritories with less than 2 infrastructure. Seriously, they are foot pounders...WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE A ROAD SYSTEM!?Also also, while commanders give bonuses, it's not an easy system to understand. FYI: you set the stars, or ""seniority"" of commanders (just dictates how high a command they CAN take). Higher level: higher command since it'll take awhile to level up...unless they have an ability that's really handy to a particular army right now. Lower levels: tend to be front-line leaders, but not all abilities are useful (ie. supplies reduction is likely useful in Theatre (highest) command, since the most troops will be effected (even if the general is a lower skill level)Overall, while the sheer ability to command all major aspects of a WW2 nation is nice, not all commands are created equal, not all features and mechanics are explained in useful detail, and at times there is simply too much micro-management for someone like me to enjoy. Good effort, but improvement is definately possible and I'd argue nessecarry for this series.			"

												Absolutely love this game and can easily lose a weekend to playing it. As a WWII history buff, I appreciate the amount of detail and work that has gone into this game! I particularly enjoy the randomness of starting off with one of the preset scenarios (1936, 1939, etc) as a Major actor in the war and watching it evolve differently than recorded history with just a few policy or diplomacy changes. For example, playing as the U.S. starting in 1936, I placed a large focus on my naval and ground power and gave mere lip service to production and development of my air assets. Though I was able to win the battle in the Pacific against Japan by 1944 forcing surrender without using Nukes, and able to neutralize Italy in marching from Sicily to Switzerland, I was mired in the battle for Fortress Europe as I learned quickly that not having adequate air power against the German Luftwaffe in France as well as the Low Countries was not a great strategy. My bombers were pummeled every time they lifted off, air support that I sent as escorts were being swatted out of the sky like flies and the Luftwaffe bombers made me pay for every square I took in battle. My only wish was that there were a proper way to co-ordinate with the AI/Allies to achieve objectives to more closely simulate real operations (Dragoon, Torch, Overlord, etc.) as the one that is currently in place is pretty ineffectual. Aside from that, I will continue playing this until the next iteration hits the market.Absolutely recommended!			"

												I'll give a review about this game in my experience in it. First of when you play this game YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING unless of course you've played the old Hearts of Iron games. The tutorial in this game is just terrible, it doesn't show you how battles work and doesn't explain alot about the game. Which will be really hard, especially when you start picking a country to play. Only way I managed to properly play was to go to youtube tutorials on ""How to play HOI3"", and that was pretty much it. Not to mention the terrible AI control which led to my downfall sometimes, and also on how HARD the game could be even when its put on easy. Of course you'll have to learn to become good at it. And that's for the cons in my opinion.When you get into more of the game it starts to get addicting, the game mechanics are great. I love how the enemy AI plays against an invasion from me. And also the intensity it can get once you start loosing. It's really enjoyable if you get to know how to play. The timeline and decision making is really cool and I also really like how realistic the battles could be, especially when you download mods like Black Ice in which I would recommend you. DLCs added with the game gives  the game more features which I like about it. And their really cheap. And thats what I can give you for the pros.AND DON'T INVADE RUSSIA... I regret alot.			"

												Hearts Of Iron is a great game with good game mechanics that are hard to understand at some points in the game but become real easy once understanding it. One key feature you need to know is the chain of command that is how you get supplies to your units without wasting a lot of them. The chain of command works like this you make a division then click on it press the 3x's that will make a corps then click the corps and click the 4x's that makes an army then click the amry and press the 5x's this will make and army group. now you thinks its over right well no now click the amry group and press the button with a green arrow and 3 bars. this will allow you to connect this to a theatre. connect it and their your done, but remember the magic number is 5. 5 divsion under 1 corps. 5 corps under one army. 5 armies under 1 army group and 5 army groups under 1 theater. thats the chain of command.

The only downside is the diplomacy systems broken, but i guess that was kinda realistic because during ww2 it was basically join a faction and that was it (even though thats kinda annoying playing as a smaller state who can be forced into an early allanice with someone you dont nessicaraly want to join. For example, I was playing as austria and had taken over most of the eastern europen countries, but its almost impossible to take on germany and italy at there peaks and i  had to join the axis which ended up losing in the end.ALSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												I highly recommend this game, especially for those who enjoy studying history and enjoy alternate history scenarios. However, this game is all about micromanaging and is not for those who wish to jump in and play like in Call of Duty or other examples. The learning curve is very large but it worth leaning in order to gain hundreds of hours of enjoyment from this title. I would recommend starting off from a less in depth Grand Strategy game if you are not experienced, something like Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis IV, and then moving on to this game. but once you know how it works inside and out, you are bound for some very fun times. Want to see what would happen if France had stopped the Germans, if Japan had invaded the west coast of the United States, if Russia had not been able to push back Germany, or even if the United States had never joined the Allies? Then you will love this game and enjoy it for years ahead.			"

I dont know if its for the motherland or Thier finest hour that breaks it, but it breaks.  It runs for about 18 months and simply stops and the program closes.  I have tried this with 2 machines runnign two different installs (one from Gamers gate and one from steam) and had exatly the same problem!There are a lot of complaits about this  on the forums which Paradox seem to ignore. I assume its a Windows 8 issue and they're obviously busy trying to write the next big thing they want us all to buy.In summary - its fantastic, but be carefull with the official DLC.			"

												Hearts of Iron lll Review:-Short Summary:It's badass. Get it now and play it. 9/10-Longer Summary:Hearts of Iron lll is a simulation of the World War 2 era. You can play ANY country during the time and lead it to victory by join the Allies, Axis, or Communists. While it sticks to history semi-realistically (Germany may become too OP) you are allowed to freely change it and see what would happen. What if the U.S joined the Axis? It's an interesting period of history and you get to change it. Lead your army, navy, and airforce on a massive scale. However, it can become too overwhelming at times and that can be a turn off. Also, periods of doing nothing but building up can be boring at times. However, it can be tense, and when the going gets rough, it can get really hard this game, even on easy. However, this game is unique in it's nature and gets even epicer with mods and the dlc provided, which sadely is needed to make the game much, much, better and adds needed features to the game. When it's all there though, it is a pretty good game.			"

												This is a Grand Strategy Game at its finest, you take complete control of a country before and during World War 2. Now this means making sure you have the manpower and reasources to commit to a campaign, now to start with I'd play a larger country to get the hang of it but do yourself a favor and start in Europe or close to it. Everything matters, researching technology, politics, spying, and especially Alliances. If you start as a weaker country you want to build strong relationships fast because soon you could be a target. The worst country to start with is Luxembourg, it is super tiny (One province) and not worth the hassle of taking on the larger countries beside you. Overall it is a great game and it is definitely worth $10, give it a try you won't regret it.			"

												If you like better to have the full control over your own nation than just building your whole armies and sending them on the front like in coh2 then this is the game for you. Its kinda hard to get started because there are so many things do constantly do but when you have played it a view hours then u get used to it and maybe even conquer thw whole wide world. There is even a mod for WW I if you like it more. With the DLC's the game expands even more there are new events and a gigantic number of random scenerios. To say it short it is a really BIG game with many DLC and possible ways to do it and one of the best games when you come home after a long day at work just to relax and watch ow the Sowjets kill everyone for some reason :D			"

												Able to play any country from 1936-1948, hour by hour with adjustable speeds even in multiplayer, though only major powers and some regionals are worth playing.  Game really rewards thinking ahead, as in months and years (game time) ahead.  Multiplayer is recommended, AI is easy to beat, though it'll still put up a good enough fight for you to enjoy singleplayer.  All 3 expansions are REQUIRED, they add and fix so many things, the game is not worth playing without them.  (Expansions are Semper Fi, For the Motherland, and Their Finest Hour, do NOT bother with any other DLC, except the music packs if you want those.)This is a war game, don't expect any diplomatic, cultural, scientific, or economic victories.  The only thing that matters at the end of the day is whose troops are in the capitols of their enemies.Air operations are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to manage.Naval operations are simple but get the job done.Ground operations are where this game ♥♥♥♥ing shines.The Order Of Battle can be a little annoying to set up.Diplomacy is very simple, as is Intelligence and Internal Politics, generally allowing you to set and forget.Research and Production are where you have the most freedom to do as you wish with your country.Your basic air units are Air Wings, which you group up into 2s, 3s, or 4s, and have them perform whatever role they're designed to, Interceptors will generally be flying air superiority or interception, Close Air Support will generally be bombing enemy ground units, etc.Ships larger than a destroyer are produced individually and grouped together to form task forces which perform whatever mission they can from the ships assigned.  Carriers can be sent to bomb enemy ports or fleets, Battleships are generally used to form the fighting line of your fleets, engaging other battleships, bombarding, etc.  Destroyers are represented by Destroyer Flotillas, each Destroyer Flotilla in game is supposed to represent about 3 Destroyers, they are used to screen your larger ships.Your basic ground unit is the Division, which is made up of individual brigades of your choice, anything from your standard Infantry brigade to Artillery brigades or Heavy Armour brigades, there are a lot of choices.  The brigades all add certain bonuses and maluses to the division as a whole and this determines how effective it is in combat in the various terrains against other divisions.  There is a lot that goes into what makes a good division, terrain, cost (in industrial capacity, supplies, and manpower), tech level, your enemies, and more.  Countries like the USA can afford to go heavy on support units and armour because of their abundance of everything, while other countries like Japan may find itself not being able to make a lot of support or armour because of their shortages of everything, nor would they normally want to make a lot of armour because of all the low infrastructure mountains and jungles they'll usually find themselves fighting in (not the best tank country).  You'll find yourself fielding a number of different types of divisions for all the situations you'll be dealing with.Most games against the AI will play out historically until 1941 or 42, it will not deviate from the script, though sometimes it can make a mistake against the other AI and get bogged down taking longer to do what it historically did.  After 1942 it's all up in the air depending on how you and the various AI are doing.  Against other players, this game offers a lot of different routes to alternate history scenarios.Definitely worth picking up on a sale if you're into WW2 games or grand strategy games in general.

I never was able to fix some minor random graphical problems like some tooltips disappearing or random colors appearing, but a game restart fixed so i kept playing. Technical support basically ignored me after their first 2 suggestions didnt work.Finally gave up playing after my second save game corrupted and couldnt be played past a certain date.Summary: The game is awesome, but be prepared to lose a few hours installing some fixes and patches which were never made automatical and be aware that even then there's a risk that the game wont work properlyps: all these problems happened with all dlc's and patches, which means that paradox never fixed the game properly			"

												Well, Hearts of Iron 3. Most people don't like it because its too complicated. I didn't know what I was doing as Greece in my first game. I held back Italy for 7 Months until Bulgaria ♥♥♥♥ed me up. Second game I was Axis Brazil, invaded Uraguay, realizes Monroe doctrine is incorrectly represented and USA is guarenteeing all independence in South America insead of only against Europe RIP Brazil. 2rd game I played as Persia, annexed Afganistan and joined Axis. Invaded Iraq and India, was winning in India until British soldiers retook Iraq and invaded me. All I had to control for 3 years of war was 3 Militia brigades, 1 division of Infantry, one division of light tanks, and 2 tactical bombers. I recomend reading a wiki or two to get an idea for what you should do. What else do you need to do? You need to not get frustrated when the Axis lose just like history, it is difficult. That this from a player who took Great Britain and pushed Russia back beyond Stalingrad, Moscow and Leningrad only for Japan to agitate America and suddenly American soldiers stormed France. And I didn't have anything more than a skeleton crew to stop revolts. I then quit that game and played America in an attemtpt to become Fascist. I needed 1% less neutrality to Join the Axis and then Japan attacked me and I was forced into Allies, Save deleted. Tried Russia, Germany invaded me in February 1940, I hadn't even adjusted my lines to defend Poland. Save deleted. Tried Britain. France fell even though I sent all of my home army. Save deleted. Tried Germany again. Failed to sweep through Switzerland effectively to get around the maginot. Save deleted. Played soviets round 2, invade German Poland (I declined Molotov pact) and pushed into Germany and also took Korea, Japan and Germany were annexed and I invaded the west easily winning. Game completed!			"

Otherwise, the game itself is entertaining once you get used to it (although it crashes every two hours--save frequently). And as others have said, the in-game tutorial is useless, I'd suggest looking up a write-up of someone's play-through and following along.			"

XDIron and steel ambition 3 is a World War II simulation strategy game.As a simulation game, nature should simulate the history of the truth rather than a one-sided portrayal of the war. The game history of iron and steel is largely based on the history of World War II. Although it is possible because the player's intervention led to some of the things in advance or delay, but basically the release is to occur. It's hard to change the player's will (it's hard, but it's not that you can't do it).			"

												Oh man, where to begin?Ever felt like video-games are too shallow and bring nothing new to our zeitgeist? Ever wished you could go back in time and relive the tension and world-defining moments of World War 2? Ever thought you could do a better job than the Führer or Il Duce? Were you one of those insufferable kids that would take Risk as serious as a real world conflict? Well, you can stop reading right here and get this game already.In case you need reassurance, here's a proper review of the game just for you: Hearts of Iron 3 is the august title of what's called grand strategy games. In these, you control large, complex portions of a nation state's resources to wage war, conquer, thrive and, well, win. Hearts of Iron 3 is set in the specific timeframe of the Second World War: You'll be able to choose where and how you start, in any year ranging from 1936 to well into the end of the war. It is possible to play the game until the mid 50s, depending on how things play out. You can play as any country that existed in the world during the thirties and forties, literally any. A good deal of those countries will have events and decisions designed specificaly for them. Once you choose your country, its time to dive into the game: Politics, diplomacy, industrial production, army, naval and air force management, intelligence, espionage, economy and everything else you can fathom will be under your control. Make sure the right political party is ruling your country, choose the best government approaches, decide whats going to be build where, move your divisions to key locations and make sure those are well commanded and well supplied, make allies and enemies and rewrite some ♥♥♥♥ing history.I ain't gonna lie: It's difficult. First few hours playing are spent in tutorials and learning by trial and mistake. There so much to do and so many things to decide that you are bound to ♥♥♥♥ something up, and that's probably going to send your dreams of winning World War 2 crashing down to the ground. But nevermind that, because Hearts of Iron 3 is the kind of game where even losing can be fun. I remember fondly my many last stands against impossible odds, in fact those seem to stick in my memory more than any victory.Try playing as Poland instead of Germany and see how long you can last against the  blitzkrieg	. Play as Turkey and hold on to your♥♥♥♥♥♥while joining the Axis and declaring war on the USSR. Maybe pick China and show those japanese filth it won't be that easy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Nanking this time around. First time I played the game after learning the basics, I joined the Axis as Brazil and nuked London to open the way for Operation Sea Lion. Good times, man. Good times.Don't be afraid of tackling the learning curve of this game. It'll be worth.Gameplay - 10/10Soundtrack - 9/10Graphics - 5/10Content - 9/10Challenge Level - 9/10Replayability - 10/10			"

												If you're looking for a starter RTS, this might not be the game for you. On the other hand, if you have experience with a Hearts of Iron game or an RTS, this is a really good classic. I wish they would've added a few more single player mechanics and some more DLC, but a great game. Complex for a new player compared to Hearts of Iron 4 or Europa Universalis IV.			"

												Best strategy game ever. Micromanagement XXLA great way to sink time. Not hard at all once you get over the initial learning curve.Supplemented by good DLCP.S. suggest getting the exe patch from the net that allows the game to use up to 4gigs of ram.			"

												Fantastic game, probably one of the best RTS/TBS games on the market for this genre.Good:In-depth combat systemGreat, complicated supply systemDecent spying mechanicsLots of opportunities for interesting alternate history outcomes.Bad:Somewhat dated graphics and interface.Lots of micromanagement, even for things that really shouldn't require it. (Organizing the OOB of Soviet Union can take hours)Lack of interesting minor countries, they lack interesting flavor and playing any minor feels the same.			"

												I can't recommend this for Mac Steam users: on Steam the DLC pages (at least, the non-cosmetic ones) say they won't work on Mac, while the version on Apple's App Store apparently includes the DLC to begin with. Otherwise, the game itself is entertaining once you get used to it (although it crashes every two hours--save frequently). And as others have said, the in-game tutorial is useless, I'd suggest looking up a write-up of someone's play-through and following along.			"
