 Review For Valkyria Chronicles PC Review by : Joell Joelly & Meguca 2.0Pros- Great story.- Lovely anime art style.- Great voice acting. (English and Japanese)- Unique blend of real time and strategic gameplay.- Challenging.- Tons of management/upgrade options. Cons- Matches can take a long time. (not necessarily a con)- Frustrating menu system.- Enemy turns are not skippable, or able to be sped up.- Some 'strategic' choices have to be made without the necessary information.- No mouse support in menus.Review :Valkyria Chronicles is a largely story based, turn based strategy game. The story itself is extremely enjoyable, with well written characters and a compelling world.The story is set in the 1930s, in the continent of ""Europa,"" with two super powers (The Imperial Alliance & The Atlantic Federation) who are at war with one another over a mineral called ''Ragnite'' which is used to power all technology in this world.The Imperial Alliance makes the decision to invade the small neutral country of Gallia during this conflict, because Gallia has a lot of the Ragnite under its soil.During the story you will follow Welkins (protagonist), Isara (Welkins's sister) and Alicia.  All 3 were just normal people living in Gallia, but were conscripted to defend Gallia upon the Imperial's invasion.The game features rich character development, or background information for both the main characters and for side characters. Every character has entries to read indicating their  backstory, strengths, weaknesses, people that they work well with, and more. This information helps to make each character feel more 'real,' and can give you a sense of connection to them, making things such as their deaths far more significant.The army is made up of both soldiers by profession, and by militia. As a result, there are people of all ages, races, genders, social standing, etc which causes some interesting interactions. In terms of gameplay, you control a relatively small squad in turn based strategy missions, somewhat comparable to XCOM Enemy Unknown. Each turn you get a limited number of 'command points' which you can use to move your units, make them attack, and a range of other things. When you use a command point on a unit, you take control of the unit and control them in real time. Enemies with a line of sight to your character will open fire if you are in range, you will need to aim and take your shots yourself, and so on. This makes the game feel like small segments of real-time action, limited by ammunition and by the number of command points you use. For a good rank at the end of a mission, you need to minimize the amount of commands that you use.This game features permadeath, so any character of yours which dies remains dead forever. There are limited story central characters who you will be required to keep alive, but the rest are expendable.The game starts off feeling rather easy, with limited options, but it opens up and increases in difficulty as you go.  This involves larger battles, more variety in your squad, leveling up unit types, researching upgrades for your army, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of each unit, and so on. This allows for you to learn new mechanics slowly as they're introduced, rather than being overwhelmed at the start of the game. Along with the interesting story and the character development, this results in you becoming quite addictive, with you constantly wanting to try out new things. Additional information :This game was originally released in 2008 on the Playstation 3, but on the PS3 it was locked at 30FPS  and 720P Resolution.The PC version is a port, but was upgraded to 60FPS with HD resolution, remappable keybindings, adequate mouse and keyboard support, and anything else that you could need. An excellent port, which stands out amongst many sub-par ports in recent years.For the price of €19.99 it is quite worthwhile, especially since SEGA bundled all the DLC in to the PC Version for free (2 extra stories to play, and a hardmode for the main story).Developer : SEGAPublisher : SEGAGenre : Singleplayer, Strategy, RPGWebsite : ''Look @ Sega Blog''Released on Playstation in 2008Released on Steam in 2014Follow my Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/ This review is written for : The Panda's CornerAlways do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.Thanks for reading!

												Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, the best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review. Valkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? The story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. The character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. The gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). With the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). The game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). The game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.			"

												I have played this game fully several times on the PS3 and feel it is one of the best turn-based, strategy RPGs of the last generation. This game is a must own.They have included full 16:9 resolution support (up to at least 4k I believe), japanese voices and monitor refresh rate matching FPS. Unfortunately the videos are PS3 quality but that is a small complaint for an amazing game.The story is based in an alternate history 1930's Europe where a mineral called ragnite is used to power vehicles and other items. You are members of the militia of the small, neutral country Gallia which is rich with ragnite and sandwiched between 2 superpowers. You are forced to defend and try to reclaim your country after one of these superpowers invades Gallia for its ragnite. The story is told through cell shaded cut scenes and missions and advances beyond this basic plot as time goes on.At the start of each mission you pick and place your team on the map and then are provided with command points at the start of each turn which allow you to take direct control of your units. You then move them throughout the map to achive your mission. The mix of strategy and third person controls works very well.Buy if you would like to see VC2 and VC3 (VC3 unfortunately has never had and english release) come to PC.9/10			"

												Amazing Game. Idk why they didnt release this on pc sooner.Reasons to get this game:-Fans of the Battalion Wars games may enjoy the artstyle of the game. Although the gameplay is very different.-Amazing, hand drawn art. -Good music-Great, although cliche story-Customizable armies-Challenging, but fair missions-Old game, but has aged well-great quality for a playstation port-English voiceacting is so cheesy its kinda funny-Japanese voiceacting is well doneReasons to NOT get this game:-The game is very anime-ey, if you're bothered by ""why is this girl wearing pigtails and not a helmet"" you are gonna have a bad time. -If you don't enjoy the story, or long cutscenes, you will literally be skipping half the game.-The tank driving controls are really awkward to get used to, and even then, bug out sometimes.-The fps can rise or drop really weirdly and dramatically. Since this is mostly turn based strategy it isnt that much of an issue, but still -The game can get bs difficulty spikes at some point(s) (you all know which point)Overall, I give it a 9/10. It has some weird quirks, sure. But a really uniquely beautiful, powerful game.			"

												It’s hard to figure out where to even begin talking about Valkyria Chronicles; there’s so much to say. Sega’s brilliant take on turn-based tactics is one of my favorite games of the genre, but beyond that I think it’s a very important game. It’s important because the story touches on some of the darkest moments in human history – moments no other game has dared to touch – and does so in an intelligent and sensitive manner. It’s important because of the innovative ways in which it manages to systemize its characterization and themes. It’s important because it marks the last time that Sega put in the care and effort needed to make something unequivocally excellent.Fans of Japanese games have been let down time and again by PC releases, and when Sega announced that Valkyria Chronicles would be coming to steam we had every reason to expect a buggy, slapdash port. And that would have been a real shame, because with its sketchy watercolor aesthetic the PS3 version is one of the most enduringly beautiful games of the last generation. Fortunately, not only does the PC version of run at 60 frames per second in high definition with nary a hiccup, it also makes several significant enhancements to the original game’s effects. Even better, it condenses the PS3 version’s excruciating loading times to a fraction of a second. Valkyria Chronicles has a very dense narrative, but to sum it up it’s a steampunk fantasy take on World War II set on the fictional continent of Europa. Europa is embroiled in a conflict between two superpowers – the Atlantic Federation and the Imperial Alliance – over a miraculous mineral fuel called Ragnite. The small, neutral principality of Gallia is invaded by the Empire for their rich deposits of this precious resource.  The Empire is also running a campaign of extermination against the Darcsens, a race of pale-skinned, dark-haired people who have become scapegoats for the bulk of Europa’s ills. They kill them indiscriminately and even – here we get to the part of the war that no other game talks about – toss them into concentration camps and work them to death. It’s a little ridiculous that an anime fantasy game is the only AAA title in history with something to say about the Holocaust, but to this game’s immense credit it speaks with the care and respect such a sensitive topic deserves. Furthermore, it covers all of its subject matter with that same care.If Valkyria Chronicles can be said to have a single overarching theme, it’s that we are all human. The characters under your command, who together comprise Squad 7 of the Gallian Militia’s Third Regiment, are among the best-realized and most likeable characters in gaming history. Squad leader Welkin Gunther is a little socially awkward and obsessed with nature – a trait that sometimes gives him ingenious philosophical and strategic insights. Alicia Melchiott, his second-in-command, is steadfast, caring, and strong-willed. The way that her relationship with Welkin blossoms into romance over the course of the story is positively heartwarming. But the game doesn’t let us forget that there are people on every side of the conflict. Early scenes in the game which depict the Empire rolling through Welkin’s idyllic home town are framed almost as propaganda, but as the story unfurls we see more and more humanity in the enemy forces, and more evil outside the Empire. When the Federation gets involved in the conflict it causes no end of trouble, and some of the more officious ranking officers in Gallia’s own military pose as much of a threat as the enemy generals. Instead of seeing this conflict as it happens, we view it through the eyes of historian Irene Koller in her book “On the Gallian Front,” which covers the war from Squad 7’s perspective. Interestingly, Irene’s writing is a little biased, and the game leaves you to wonder how reliable a narrator she really is. Not only is this book a solid framing device for the game’s narrative, it also serves as its interface. A good interface and good story wouldn’t matter if the game itself was not good, and Valkyria Chronicles is great. On a surface level the game has a lot in common with XCOM. You take command of a military unit comprised of different classes – scouts, engineers, shocktroopers, snipers, lancers, and one tank – and take responsibility for their training as well as their mission performance. On the battlefield success is all about making strategic use of cover and positioning soldiers for the best shot or an effective ambush. In Valkyria Chronicles soldiers are always on “overwatch,” so they’ll automatically fire on any enemy that enters their range outside their own turn. If you’re smart you can set up ambushes on the enemy’s turn, taking soldiers down before they have a chance to attack and costing the computer an action in the process. Of course if you’re careless the same thing can happen to you. This dynamic makes each of your turns feel almost like an action game. Anyone who’s played XCOM knows how aggravating it can be to open fire on an alien with a 95% hit chance only to miss entirely. Valkyria Chronicles handles accuracy by putting a circle around your crosshairs representing margin of error, and on top of being more intuitive this creates a wider potential range for success and failure. Instead of assigning a binary hit/miss condition to an entire burst of gunfire, Valkyria calculates each shot individually, so even if you don’t hit enough times to take an enemy down you’ll probably take a chunk out of their health. Painstaking effort has gone into crafting every aspect of Valkyria Chronicles’ world. This comes across in obvious ways, like the pages upon pages of lore in the glossary that flesh out the setting’s ecology, cultures, and economy, but it also deeply informs the mission design. Every single level is full of little details that help to sell the reality of the world. This isn’t all that surprising considering that the same team created Skies of Arcadia but it’s appreciated nonetheless. Acting and sound design are just as great as the music. More strict fans of JRPGs will be happy to know that the game includes both English and Japanese voices, but this is one of the few games where the option doesn’t feel needed.  The performances for every member of the cast – including all 49 unique, non plot-essential members of Squad 7 – are of the same caliber as you’d expect from the core cast of an Atlus game.  Sound effects always make it clear what’s going on and where it’s happening, even if you can’t see it. The art style in Valkyria Chronicles isn’t just beautiful, it’s enduring. Valkyria Chronicles has aged remarkably well, and in a world where computer graphics advance every other month that’s quite an accomplishment. Another big contributing factor is the game’s animations, which are smooth and very well-crafted, conveying personality through subtle body-language and facial expressions while giving every object and character a correct sense of weight and presence in the world. In its music, writing, art and acting ,Valkyria Chronicles is brimming with the emotional potency to bring a man to tears. It would make an excellent movie if that were all it had going for it, but the story is told in a way that could only work in a video game, and built on a rock-solid framework of deep and challenging tactical gameplay. Valkyria Chronicles is a timeless classic, and this exceptional PC port only manages to improve upon it.			"

												A port much deserved and actually kind of late which offers the player the ability to lead a squad into battle. If you've enjoyed squad based tactical games such as XCOM, The Fire Emblem Series, FF:Tactics and etc. you will no doubt enjoy this. It brings to the table a very interesting gimmick which allows the player to move their pawns in something called Action Mode. Action Mode puts the player in a third-person perspective control of the pawn allowing the to move them freely as if controlling a character in a third-person game. Despite this it still sticks to turn-based tactical game laws such as a limited amount of movement points and actions within a usage of a 'command Point'. You're offered these 'command points every turn and they can be saved up (there are also ways to get more from the beggining).There are a large range of characters to add to your squad and it's a pretty large variety, not only in terms of classes but also specific personal traits that affects them on the battlefield(e.g. Pollen Allergy slowly decreases the HP of a character when standing on an are filled with plants; country born gives them more confidence when fighting in the country side; hatred of men discourages them when near male characters in your squad; and so many more). They may also all be equipped with various uniforms and their weapons can be upgraded (but all weapons of that type are upgraded at the same time). Armours adn uniforms too can be upgraded and your squad's tank may also be outfitted with new gear and upgrades. To take out needless hassle the game's level up system is class based. What I mean is that it levels up the entire class and all the characters of that class rather than you having to upgrade each and every one of them. This also means that you won't have to deal with new recruits being underleveled once you've progressed far into the story. To get extra money and experience points when you feel underleveled in the plot missions the game also offers you the option to do skirmishes. Skirmishes are missions that are not attached to the plot and can be done and repeated any time at a difficulty set by the player (soldiers that die in skirmishes will also be out forever just like in story missions so you might want to be careful).The plot is definitely quite interesting and takes a lot of inspiration from our world's second world war, covering topics such as life during war time, desire for resources and even racism. I won't talk too much about the plot since I'm still going through it and it's usually more interesting to head in knowing as little as possible.I might return to this review and edit it later on once I've completed the game but from waht I've experienced so far I do not regret buying this at all and wish to see more titles like this be brought to the PC platform in the future.

												Valkyria Chronicles is a pseudo Turn Based Strategy game with real-time action while you move and attack with your units in third-person view. These units can be moved multiple times a turn by spending extra Command Points, but the efficacy of the movement a unit can do decreases each time until the following turn. Units are free to move after they fire, but will be receiving counter fire whilst their turn is active.Although similar to XCOM, it doesn't share the true ""dice roll"" for hits/misses; it does random bullet distribution range on the cross-hair reticule. This range gets smaller as your units are better trained or procure better equipment. Units can take advantage of flanking by attacking units' flanks or the environment. An example of this is destroying sandbags to prevent cover bonuses, leaving enemy units exposed.You will carefully decide what units to recruit to suit your battles since all of your units are unique to their class type. There are five class types: Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, and Sniper. This is further refined by each unit having their own characteristics that define them from other units within the same class. Some units may not like being near the opposite sex or even prefer being the lone wolf; these nuances provide detriments or bonuses depending on these varying traits. Each class type gains experience through distribution of experience after battles and the entire class type levels up. Therefore, newly recruited units in the game will be of the same strength regardless of when you recruit them. Individual units are further enhanced by ""Potentials"" which are unique to each character. They may suddenly gain valor and take less damage from interception fire or even become a dead shot at critical moments. These quirks add to the individual characters and make you either love them or hate them.After your initial unit deployment, you can even bring in reinforcements should you need a specific class type you may not have deployed or retreat excess units if they aren't doing anything. Certain class types perform better against certain enemies. Another tool in your array is the use of ""Orders"" that can turn the tide in some battles or rescue a wounded unit. Orders are very useful, but aren't necessary to win any battles. Your squad units can be permanently killed should you not rescue them when they fall in battle. This game doesn't have auto-save but you are free to save in the middle of a battle and you can have multiple save files.The game is moderately challenging and has extra bonuses to shoot for, like better grades or even procuring bonus weaponry. There are elite enemy units with unique names that when beaten can drop superior weaponry for you to loot and distribute to your favorite units. The story is very enjoyable and has light-hearted moments besides the usual despair and realities of war. For extra value, there are skirmishes and side-story missions for many characters you can take on at your leisure, not to mention the included DLC which adds more of these bonus story bits.			"

SummaryIt maintains by having a lasting appeal with a diverse set of memorable and unique characters, a satisfyingly emotional and well thought out story with simple, yet strategic gameplay that offers freedom through various tactics. Despite all of this, there are certainly questionable flaws, yet they're completely smothered with the games overarching enjoyment and charm which ultimately pushes the game in a familiar but fresh direction.StoryValkyria Chronicles takes place in a fantasy setting similar to Earth which introduces the story with two waging superpowers, the autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance and the loosely-united democracies of the Atlantic federation. This engagement is known as the EW2 or the Second Europan War. Both powers are reliant on a resource called Ragnite which fuels and controls both factions economies. Overtime, the Ragnite lessened and became more scarce causing the Empire to declare war against the Federation, sparking the EW2. In the midst of all this, the neutral state of Gallia was invaded due to its unfortunate but overflowing of rich Ragnite deposits as the Empire came crashing down with its invigorated momentum. In the initial invasion of Bruhl, where we meet our notable and well-meaning hero, Welkin Gunther as he's forced to take up arms and put aside his interests as a teacher in order to survive alongside the towns captain, Alicia Melchiott. The two end up joining the militia and Welkin unwittingly becomes the leader of his now profound group, Squad 7. The squads involvement through the story is told through cut scenes in episodes and chapters as you progress throughout a book. While it's effective and different, it has a disjointed narrative that emphasizes visuals throughout the book. Here, for someone who loves backstory and reading, you can learn about each distinct character you meet and their personal history through various tabs, a weapons and machinery tab as well as some background if you're curious about past and present missions. It's sophisticated and quite delicate but you will start to understand how the plot slowly unfolds and progresses through various chapters and cutscenes. There are also emotional and genuinely heartfelt moments within the game (no spoilers, of course) that made me realize I've come to adore and appreciate these particular characters.VisualsThe art has a watercolour painting style that suits with some crosshatching textures and smooth edges, it without a doubt ensures to look like no game you've seen before with outstanding quality as if it fits right with the theme and driven storyline. I believe you'll actually recognize and enjoy the beauty as you delve further into the game. The game so far runs very fluidly and can maintain a high frame rate no matter the occurance on screen. The pastel color palette is light and lucid, much of it looks gorgeous and in particular charming due to it's onomatopoeias that splatter your screen during combat and events such as lobbing a grenade, you'll probably see something like ""Blam!"" to go up acknowledging that your grenade has detonated. Little things like this makes the game much more action-packed, similar to comics.AudioGreat sound design with various sound effects, the brilliantly composed music and a well established soundtrack that impacts emotion and bringing an understanding, all fits into the theme of the game from storming the enemies fortifications, to enduring the loss of someone close or even having special moments and interactions with characters. It makes the world not only more lively but built upon by setting the tone, a place that you care about based on what's playing in the background.GameplayLike with other tactical role-playing games, Valkyria Chronicles has a similar but different formula and separates itself among many others that pigeon hold you with a much more demanding and limited playstyle of map grids and restrictive movement. As such, you start by deploying five of the different classes into the field, dependent on what the current objective is. For example, taking out a tank would be the Lancers job due to their resilient armor and slow but heavy firepower while the fragile Scouts tend to be your bread and butter as offense or defense since they have lot of versatility, both individually and in groups. Once you're deployed, an overhead map displays with all your troops (Command Mode), but the camera zooms into third-person control (Action Mode) for each individual unit you decide to move on. From here on out, once you're in third-person, you now have a gauge bar that determines how far you can move as well as one form of action, whether it be healing another ally, shooting an enemy or repairing your Edelweiss (your only tank).It certainly retains much of the challenge of tradition of the genre while at the same time, expelling limitations we've come to know such as forced grinding and overpowered fights that you must complete otherwise there'll be a lack of progression. You're able to reuse character as many times as you'd like though movement will be hindered each time and ammo may also come in slowly if you're using Snipers and Lancers (prevent obvious exploiting). Some maps also bring fresh ideas hurled at you like sandstorms (reduced viewing distance) and searchlights (mortars land in the area once spotted), which leads to considerations, such as unit weaknesses and cover (you can hide behind sandbags). There's a variety of special character specific missions that require you to use the environment with various obstacles in your way such as trenches or scattered landmines.The most forgiving part is it isn't difficult to get into because of how uncommon the user-friendly features are. You can save throughout battles as it helps immensely if you made a mistake like misplacing a shot or if someone unexpectedly gets killed, you still have within three turns to either reload a save or simply calling a medic. It's possible to lose anyone considering but it's best not to as each member of your squad has their own background and individuality that separates each one with different potentials, status bonuses depending on certain situations and abilities based on their character or personality which makes for a very diverse and interesting team of Squad 7. This is due mainly to spark some interest and drawing narrative into elevating and unique individuals.Final ThoughtsIt's praised individuality and sense of similarity but different and fresh direction, the smart care and passion of the developers, make this as one of the most delightful and unique experiences. Despite its few flaws such as having questionable AI or crashing on an earlier mission (was forced to turn off steam overlay), it's more than enough to make it forgiving and looking past them. It's a fantastic game that has a lot of heart and shouldn't be passed up.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a modern JRPG with a rich story that features life-sized characters, full-animation, and voice acting.Valkyria Chronicles is a unique, yet familiar turn-based strategy game. You have access to a map where you can view and select your units. When you select a unit, you have to control that unit from a 3rd person perspective and manually aim your shots at the enemy units.We need more games like this!			"

												To start off, Valkyria Chronicles is a great game! It's good to see Sega starting to take an interest in putting some of their former console exclusives on Steam.STORY:The game takes place in a fantasy version of World War 2 Europe. This is a pretty interesting setting, and one I think is vastly underused in RPGs in general. A brief synopsis is that a small neutral country called Gallia is invaded by The Empire (read: fantasy Germany) during the Empire's war with the Federation, and the game follows the experiences of a junior Gallian officer and his squad as they fight to ensure their country's freedom. Overall, the various characters are written in a way that is relatable and engaging, and the game avoids relying too much on stereotypical Anime character tropes. I particularly like the way the game handles the villains. The game takes the time to portray characters from the Empire- both leaders and common soldiers- as humans, with their own motiviations, flaws, and even some redeeming qualities, and it manages to do so without whitewashing the villainous acts they do.This nuance in character portrayal is very important, as the game does not shy away from some of the awful stuff that happened in the real war. The game portrays both the pervasive racism and bigotry that characterized the countries involved in WW2, and it even touches on concentration camps and racial cleansing. The game mostly handles these topics with the amount of gravity and seriousness they deserve, and only rarely seems melodramatic or clumsy. However, the decision to cast the Japanese-looking 'Darcsen' as the game's stand-ins for the oppressed minorities of World War 2 Europe does have a few unfortunate implications vis-a-vis the victim complex that a certain real-world segment of Japanese society has about WW2. Overall, though, I'm still glad the game had the courage to address some of the more uncomfortable aspects of war, and I think its successes in this regard outweigh its failings.Now, this IS still a JRPG, and some elements of the story and setting will seem hilariously out of place to you if you're not intimate with the genre. For starters, the magic rocks that power all Europan technology should clue you in that the game doesn't stick particularly close to history. The first half of the game mostly presents combat in a believable manner, but later story missions can't help but start to throw in some over-the-top Anime style bosses, and the introduction of a certain techno-magic later in the game's story might stretch suspension of disbelief for some.GAMEPLAY:The game is basically broken up into two different types of play: 'book mode' and battles. In book mode, the player basically just watches cutscenes that advance the story; each scene is fairly short, about 2-4 minutes, and there are about 10-12 scenes per chapter in the game. Each scene is self contained, and there is a mostly linear progression through the scenes, where you have to watch each scene to unlock the next one.At least once per chapter, you will unlock a battle that must be completed sucessfully to advance the story. Each battle is basically a set-piece engagement where you deploy your units at a starting point on a map, and then take turns with the enemy until you meet your objectives (or lose, I guess, but the game isn't that hard in most cases). Each story mission can only be played once, but you will periodically unlock skirmish battles that can be played any number of times to farm experience and cash. Combat is basically like a turn-based strategy RPG, but there are a few major differences from other tactical JRPGs you may have played. First off, unlike most other RPGs where each unit you control gets to take one action per player turn, instead you get a set amount of ""command points"" every player turn, which you can then distribute to your units at will, to take actions, give buffs (called 'orders'), or call reinforcements. One 'action' consists of both a move and a shoot- the shoot can be taken at any time during movement. This is all fairly straightforward except for one major caveat: you can give more than one action to a given unit per turn! In fact, if you want, you can give ALL your action points to a single unit to move/shoot a whole bunch of times. Getting A-ranks on missions often requires pooling most of your actions on just a few units, to quickly penetrate deep behind enemy lines and achieve objectives.This approach to combat is more realistic than average for JRPGs, but still, don't expect it to feel at all like a gritty war simulator like the Company of Heroes games. Cover matters- enemies will take potshots at you if you run around within their range, and enemies can't shoot you if you're behind a wall or a friendly tank (or even an enemy tank). Controlling your own tank feels suitably tanky- big, powerful, and slow as hell.  Actually shooting feels a little simplistic though. Basically, you take aim, then your unit empties their clip at your aimpoint, and then the guy you shot (if you hit him, and if he's still alive) gets a chance to return fire. Headshots are important, at least.Secondly, while it's definitely an RPG and not a straight turn-based tactical game, the RPG elements take a backseat to the tactical ones. Levelling up your characters gives you some nice bonuses- it unlocks some secondary weapons and orders, character bonuses called 'potentials', and gives small increases to HP- but you can easily complete the game without any of the optional stuff, and the exp you earn in story missions will be sufficient to beat the game without grinding skirmish battles.TECHNICAL:This is a very good port. Keyboard controls can be remapped, the game can scale the in-battle/menu graphics to any resolution, and framerate is NOT locked. Unfortunately though, some of the cutscenes are prerendered at the 720p resolution of the PS3, and these cutscenes take up a lot of disk space- the game is a 20 GB install. The game is mostly alt+tab friendly, except when in combat- I sometimes have to start Task Manager to take focus away from the game then. The game is stable, but it sometimes doesn't shut down cleanly. I've never lost any save data that way, but it's a little annoying.The artstyle is obviously very anime-eqsue, it's presented in a sort of washed-out cellshaded style. Maybe not everyone's favorite style, but at least it's unique and visually distinctive. I personally like it a lot! Also, the voiceacting is generally good. The Japanese voice actors are great, as are the English voiceactors for all the main characters. Some of the secondary characters can sound like they just phoned it in, though.OVERALL: 8/10PROS:-Compelling and under-used setting for a JRPG-Interesting story-Good voiceacting-Fun combat-No grind necessary!-Just as much challenge as you want- completing the game isn't hard, getting all A-ranks is!-Great port- runs smoothlyCONS:-Large install-Some cutscenes are only 720p-Some anime/jrpg cliches are present			"

												Unexpectedly great port of an older PS3 title. Silky smooth sixty frames per second, good keyboard and mouse control, and you can even run it at 4k resolution, it even has Japanese audio included if you don't want to subject yourself to the phoned in English voice cast. Very encouraging. With all the DLC included for only twenty dollars it's a good deal for anyone who was interested in the title but didn't want to invest in the PS3 edition of the game.That said, the small problems from the console version are present here. Cutscenes are imported directly and stick at 720p and cannot be altered, so expect jaggies for that. Also cutscenes must be manually selected for some reason, instead of playing one longer scene you will watch three smaller scenes divided equally, bit confusing and unnecessary. Upgrading is mostly a linear path, but does let you enjoy a few small, effective combinations (such as some weapons causing status effects, aiming/handling better and enjoying more firepower). Your giant tank enjoys standard upgrades as well as a seperate 9x9 grid system (small upgrades are 1x1, medium are 2x1, etc). The emphasis on turn systems means you will be rushing every mission to nab XP bonuses, making most missions a simple cut and run affair. Also a minor irritation but there is no auto-save feature, meaning if you forget to save and then lose a battle you'd better hoped you're not in for a few hours of redos.Gameplay is still very engaging and strategic with dozens of playable characters (each with their own likes/dislikes and advantages/quirks) to allow you a large range of freedom about who you want in your team and with how you want to enjoy the game. That said, enemies will never, ever stop shooting you when a character is selected. They are relentless. Meaning as soon as you pick a character in the heat of combat you will probably shatter your keyboard/controller to get to that aim key. (Which makes them all stop shooting you amusingly enough). If a character is downed and then touched by an enemy, that's it, they're gone forever. So plan accordingly! The Tank you command also does not mesh well with keyboard+mouse controls on inclines, causing your tank to spin or fidget in place and waste it's movement. Plot is typical anime-fare but you shouldn't really let that prevent you from enjoying the slick combat and tactical emphasis. It does lead to some hokey and typical 'trope' moments but it's not groan-inducing or irritating. Our protagonist is relateable and most of his team (even the smaller members) have personalities thanks to the personnel tab. Some cutscenes can go on a little much, and expect to hear about how war is a bad thing (Well it is) while a bizarre little 'flying pig' irritates you with it's strangely human oinking. Great game, very well done port. Thumbs up. See you on the battlefield.			"

												I shall now proceed to write unbridled and unambiguous praise for this game. Valkyria Chronicles is a triumph. It is a triumph in gameplay, style, presentation, sound design, narrative, character development, exposition and content. The game combines the illustrious production values of AAA titles with innovative gameplay quirks usually found in more obscure indie titles. Yet, it doesn’t compromise for even an inch. It delivers a style that uniquely its own and that might not appeal to everyone, but it sure has hell makes an exceptionally appealing case for itself. If you’re a fan of turn based rpg tactics like Heroes of Might and Magic or Fire Emblem you will often find yourself in a minority crowd. It is a rather specific genre that many mainstream publishers don’t even want to look at it. Sega however took a bold stance and had Valkyria Chronicles developed and published. Not only is it a turn based rpg tactics game, it also breaks the mold on that genre to become a hybrid of turn based and real time. Part shooter, and part chess. The blend is so unique there is nothing quite like it outside of the series itself. You control a small squad of soldiers. Each turn you’re given a number of action points. By selecting a soldier you expend the point and are given real time control of the unit. You can then move around the map. You only see enemy units on the map if any of your own units currently have a clear line of sight in that area, so you might run into unforeseen threats while exploring. When you’ve found your mark, you can hit the aim button and line up a shot. Your unit will empty a clip and then the enemy might retaliate, granted that you didn’t murder him in the first place. When moving, you deplete a movement gauge. When the gauge is empty your unit will be rooted to the ground and cannot move and you’ll be forced to expend an extra command point to move your unit. You’ll have to take range into account when moving. If you run out in enemy crossfire you’ll most likely lose your unit in the next turn. Additionally, units come in different shapes and sizes. Scouts are fast and nimble, but generally miss the firepower and endurance to break enemy entrenchments. Shocktroopers are the opposite of scouts. They tire much faster, but pack a serious wallop and can take one too. Lancers specialise in destroying enemy armour units, and the engineers provide support to your own tanks and troops. The sniper unit does what it says on the tin; it takes out single units with pinpoint accuracy. However, your units are all unique, each soldier is a character with its own traits and abilities. You develop their talents by letting them perform in the line of duty, and by training them by expending experience points. You also have to equip them with new and better gear. You’re always busy with maintaining your army, be it out in the field or back at base; a commander’s duty never ends. The missions are also very well executed. Most maps feature a unique obstacle that needs to be overcome. This keeps the gameplay fresh as you make your way through the enemy ranks. You’ll fight in the desert, the streets, beaches, forests, canyons and in fortresses. The variety is excellent and you’ll quickly learn to adapt you tactics and squad accordingly. Speaking of the commander, the game’s story focusses on Lieutenant Welkin Gunther and his squad of militia men and women. The small nation of Gallia is caught amidst a continent wide conflict as the eastern Europan Empire invades and begins to violently subjugate the nation. Welkin and his fellow countrymen are drafted into service to repel the invaders. At the same time they discover important clues about the country’s history and its former rulers: The Valkyria; near mythical people with incredible powers. The setting draws parallels with our own Second World War. Complete with ethnic scourges and totalitarian ideologies. Furthermore, the game takes its time to give you exposition. Many of the secondary characters get room to develop alongside the main man and lady. Most stages are bookended, with intro cut scenes beforehand, and an outro afterward. All cut scenes are fully voiced by an anime competent cast, so they’re familiar with the style of material and do an excellent job at conveying the moments the best they can. Even when the natively Japanese expositional style doesn’t exactly suit the moment. I’ve never found a need to switch the voices to Japanese. This is one of the key points where Valkyria Chronicles scores. Its approach to its narrative is not like a Hollywood movie like Saving Private Ryan, but more like a TV series, like The Pacific. It takes its time and lets you experience it at your own pace. The entire game is presented in the form of a journal. Ever chapter takes place on a set of pages, where every ‘photo’ represents a cut scene, and every map equals a stage. You can flip through the journal’s tabs to find the entries on each separate character and other glossary entries. It’s a great way of presenting the story and its lore and mythos. You’re free to explore, or never even look at it.The book is a neat way of presenting the game, but the real captivator are the graphics. The characters and environments are fashioned in an extremely stylish and gorgeous watercolour and pencil sketch manner. Not only does it suit its anime tone, it also stands the test of time. Even now, seven after its PS3 release, the graphics hold up and will probably hold up for a long time coming. Accompanied with the visual package comes a very smart and elegant sound design. Every sort of bullet impact has a distinct noise, so you know when your unit is in direct danger, even if you can’t see the origin of the gunfire. The music is a romantic, tense and sweeping score that really underscores the game’s every moment. From the tense high stakes cover shootouts, to the emotional and heart wrenching moments, that despite of all your tactical prowess, will inevitably befall you. These moments are where game is at its strongest; and where the art, gameplay and sound work together in a perfectly orchestrated and coordinated union that not just elevates the game at hand, but the medium as a whole. Valkyria Chronicles seizes the player for a unique experience that will change the way RPG tactics, narratives and presentation are perceived in video games "

												This game is so focused on the story I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not willing to spend a lot of time watching cutscenes.  That said it is a very nice story about a squad during a war and how they helped to stop it.The battles play out with unit selection and picking where to start them from predesignated spots.  There are several different unit types each with different stats,weapons, and skills.  The game can be very difficult when you are just starting out and trying to figure out what each class can do and when to use them but after a few hours and lots of trial and error this becomes less of an issue.  During my first few hours I found a lot of the combat very frustrating, although after that I began to really enjoy it.  After a battle you earn money and xp which you can spend on training your troops and upgrading weapons and your tank.  I ended up having to grind a bit on the skrimishes but I think that was mostly my issue of just being bad.While the gameplay is solid the story is what really sells the game.  As it progresses the characters are fleshed out really well, especially if you watch the optional stuff.  If you want to learn even more about any individual character other than what the cutscenes show every usable character has a page long back story.  The graphics are unique, cell shading with anime characters, and its pretty pleasant on the eyes.  This game is a solid pc port akin to a story focused xcom.  If you can handle the frustration of some of the more difficult missions and not mind the seemingly large gaps of dialogue and cutscene between action I would recommend you take a look at this.Edit: This is super embarrassing, I recieved a review copy of this game, I disclosed it on my curator page but forgot to here.  Sorry everyone! I don't think it affected my judgement of the game but I like to let everyone know.			"

												The Good- A great port of a fantastic game- Scratches an XCOM type of itch- Good voice acting whether you roll with the English or Japanese dub- Approachable, but challenging gameplay- Every soldier is unique. You'll grow familiar with their traits and abilities and potentially become attached to them. They can die for good if you're not careful- Gorgeous art style, engine, and character designs- Great soundtrack- About 45-50 hours long, a good amount of RPG type progression, and replayable missions. Lots of value hereThe Bad- A good amount of pre-rendered cutscenes (75% of the install is movie files), a few of which look genuinely great and are justified in being pre-rendered, but others are just straight up recorded in-engine footage at 720p, jaggies and all. None of this looked out of place in the PS3 version, but at 1080p and above it can look kinda gross- Some animations during 'conversation scenes' play too fast at 60fps and above. Reaction fire doubles at 60fps, though most view this as a positive change to the balance of the game. Going any higher than 60fps isn't recommended- The trading card art and the profile backgrounds are all horrendous quality, which is a shame given how beautiful the art for this game is- Not every mission in the game is a winnerReview has been updated since there have been a few patches.

												I do not own a console since the early nineties and I never owned a PlayStation in my life. In such regard, I consider myself a PC purist.While I do enjoy Tactical RPG games, I am not really into Japanese made games, let alone anime and manga, is just not my cup of tea. In fact, I never heard about Valkyria Chronicles™ until I saw the game announced here in Steam.Having said that, I am writing this short review to say that I have enjoyed this game a lot, not just for the tactical gameplay but mainly for the story. While not perfect at all, the gaming experience is top-notch.Another outstanding area is the port. I have seen countless ports from consoles to PC that are so bad. I always try to avoid them, but whoever did the port for Valkyria Chronicles™ did a hell of a job. As someone that play exclusively with a keyboard/mouse, this was perfectly made.I am glad this PS3 game from 2008 was ported to PC on 2014 and I am now looking forward to see more ports from PS3 greatest hits.

												Valkyria Chronicles is - or rather, used to be - one of the best and most underappreciated early PS3 exclusives, in the same category as Demon's Souls. I've fully completed the game and its DLC on console, and can't wait to do so again on PC.In terms of genre, Valkyria Chronicles offers a unique combination of turn-based strategy, RPG-like character progression and equipment upgrades, and third person movement in battles. Since apparently that - quite impressive in its own right - wasn't enough for Sega, it also comes with a unique stroke-based art style and rendering engine, and an interesting alternative universe WW1-like setting. Topping it all off is a great and memorable soundtrack and selectable dual audio voice acting.The PC port is solid, with the only major issue being the pre-rendered cutscene videos, which are stuck at PS3 quality. The game performs really well even on modest systems, and scales up beautifully to high resolutions on more powerful ones.Anyone at all interested in turn-based strategy games would do well to check out this title, particularly its very fair price on Steam considering the size of the game and the inclusion of all DLC.

												In Short: This is not only a good game for itself, but also a good port. It has a few flaws, but they're not that bad.As stated on the store page, it already includes all the DLC of the PlayStation 3-Version for free, uses the Steam Cloud for your saves, has Achievements and includes Trading Cards. You can play the game in 16:9 Full HD and 60fps, using either a controller or Keyboard/Mouse. Although you can only navigate the menus using the Keyboard, you can use the Mouse on the Battlefield when controlling a character, which makes it quite comfortable to aim or look around.Sure, the game has its flaws, but the story is wonderful and full of emotions, there are so many characters with their own personality, there's tons of interesting background information, it has nice graphics, a cinematic soundtrack and the gameplay is just a lot of fun. If you're a fan of Strategy-RPGs or wanted the game when it was out on PS3 and did not have the possiblity to play it, you shouldn't miss this game now.By the way, you should really play this game with japanese dub. You can change the voice from english to japanese in the Settings on the Title Screen. The japanese dub just has so much more emotion and improves your experience of the story A LOT.(In-depth review in german is available on my website.)			"

 Viewing From My Profile? Click Comment to See Non-Broken Version  Valkyria ChroniclesGame InfoPublisher:Genere:Personal Verdict: SegaAction Rpg, Streategy, Turn BasedIt's awesome but a bit broken.  So What is Valkyria Chronicles? To put it short I've been waiting for this game to be released ever since I was a little girl. It was a console exclusive game on the PS3 for ages despite having critical acclaim at the time it releases until Sega in their faint moment of genius decided to port this game finally to the PC. And it is glorious.Valkyria Chronicles is a deceptive anime-style  game that boast cute and cherry characters despite the underlying tone being that of the horrors of war and it shows heavily in its many cutscenes.As a game it is a turn based action game where you command your squad each turn using limited number of command point to sally forth and destroy the enemy. Onward boyo.  Port Report Verdict: Good.60 FPS On All Situation.Controls are a bit awkward if you happen to use the keyboard as your primary controller since this is an ex console exclusive game with many of the command scattered throughout the keyboard and having limited mouse support. But it does run and look well enough so I can't complain about that.Good news for japanese voice fans, you can toggle between english voice and japanese voice in the menu. Have fun with that.  Graphics The Graphics in Valkyria Chronicles is a watercolour artstyle utilizing the game unique CANVAS technology that transform everything from scenery to people into paint work of art. Bloody hell even the edge of your screen is white and it might look  off putting and weird to some people but for what it is worth it is incredible art that is unique.Oh I sound also mention any SFX sound gets visualized in comic style which is a good point for me  Sound  For sound well consider that this is a game set in a fictionalize WW2 therefor expect a lot of patriotic music. That said the SFX is pretty good. Character dialog is clear and presented cleanly. No complains here other than the bloody radio chatter while in mission can be awfully annoying to the point you tune yourself out of it.   Gameplay  Here is where Valkyria Chronicles has it's greatest strength and weakness. To start off you have limited command points that you can supplement by putting command unit on the field but for most part it usually isn't enough to move your whole squad in 1 turn. You can use those command points to command a single troop who have an ap meter indicating how far they can go and once it is finish you either have to wait for the next turn or use another command point to use the unit again but with reduced AP. It's best to get your unit in cover and switch out to other.While you could theoratically use all the command point in the turn for 1 unit it's usually best to just switch since some units have limited ammo per turn and item like grenades won't replenish till the end of the turn.Next aiming stops enemies action like giving interception fire to you which is usually deadly if 3-4 of his mates decides to tag along and fire with him but good news is you can do the same! And your units have these things called potential which may be good or bad thing which can trigger if the conditions are met on the field. They are limited by line of side however so putting that stormtrooper right beside an alleyway exit can usually result in dead 3-4 goons if they are stupid. [It happens sometimes]For missions you have a wide variety if objective across missions and they often come with something new in the map. Skirmish mode on the other hand is plain old simple kill all enemies or capture their flag to win the battle.As for unit type you have the standard RPG trope of scout, sniper, tank-buster, and assault classes which you can upgrade their potential with EXP and new gear with money earn from finishing battle. You can also use EXP point to get orders which are basically in-mission buff that at the cost of command point allows you to withdraw unit, heal and other stuff like increasing their damage and so on.As for the broken part. Well.  Basically you can use scout to win in every single skirmish or mission mode, by utilizing their huge reserve of AP and orders that increases their defensive ability you can literally sprint through the enemy and lob a single grenade to push any enemies out of the capture zone of the enemy base and capturing it. That's it, simple and broken since the missions often rely on how fast you are for S rank.  Conclusion A pretty badass of a japanese anime style game with unique artstyle that sadly got sidelined because it was released on the PS3 and thus became a cult favourite but not an instant classic but now that it is on steam you have no reason to not get this Gem anymore. I implore you to buy it.Scoring Methology:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: A-Rank.Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!No drama, Just Reviews "

												This is probably one of the few games that still looks good even though it’s an old game. It felt like a mix of XCOM EU and The Bureau: XCOM Declassified but this game was made 4 years before them, I’m very impressed (with anime storyline and artsyle). I will make this review simple and just put up the pros and cons of itPros:It scrapped the grid by grid system from most similar turn based strategy game and it actually felt great, you have the freedom to move the character anywhere you wantA really good port, no doubt. It runs great and the controls for mouse and keyboard is goodBattles are always challenging and you need to change your tactic to every battle and adapt with the enemies The orders system can help you a lot in a battle Interesting characters (If you’re bothered to read the character glossary but the main characters are interesting enough without reading them imo)Cons:Sometimes the menu felt clunky, for example you can’t change your character equipment in the middle of briefing before battle and you have to exit the briefing and go to headquarters, only then you can change your characters equipment. It’s gets a little bit annoying sometimesSometimes there’s like an invisible wall on someplace even though your sniper clearly have a line of sight on the enemy but thankfully it’s compensated with the crosshair which turns red only when you have nothing blocking youNew game+ for the main storyline lacks challenge since they don’t change the enemy difficulty so that you can just plough through the mission in like a single turn until somewhere above chapter 10 but it’s compensated with hard and expert skirmishes so I guess it’s alrightCrashes randomly at some point (it’s rare but it does happens)Cover systems feels lacking, you can only get into cover on sandbags and trenches It’s amazing that this game was made 6 years ago, the gameplay doesn’t feel dated at all. This game is probably one of the hidden gems of the PS3 era. I weren't a fan of the series but definitely I am now, hope to see the sequels get a proper port on PC as well			"

												The next step for turn-based strategy. Incredibly fun, and absolutely charming.I'd heard XCom's Julian Gollop had sung this game's praises back in 2010, saying that Valkyria's system was almost exactly what he had in mind for his never-released Dreamland Chronicles. Valkyria's combat definitely feels like a big step forward from the XCom back-and-forth, adding an element of intensity and immediacy to the short burts of action that take place during each movement you choose. The moment you make your move, you take command of that unit and execute the move in real time. Enemy units cannot move or attack until it is their turn, but they can REact, laying down bursts of fire if you draw within range. It goes a long way toward bridging the gap between action and strategy you tend to get in turn-based titles.The plot is better than I expected, but it's nothing particularly interesting. I was a little interested in the Darcsen storyline, as it was implied they actually caused an ancient disaster which spurred generations of racism, so that was a pretty good element. I also found myself more interested in the political landscape of WORLD WAR ANIME than I thought I'd be.The characters are the real endearing element here - everyone has wildly different personalities, touched with weird and charming quirks that manifest into battle. The close-range shocktrooper Jane gets an anti-personnel ""sadism"" buff if she kills enough nazis, but runs into a defense-lowering debuff if she walks on a paved road (since she USED to be a nature-loving pacifist). Others have wildly bizarre powers, like an unmotivated engineer whose gun randomly jams because she's too lazy to clean it, or a ditzy valley girl who loses accuracy due to gabbing with nearby soldiers. You find yourself choosing soldiers that have glaring tactical problems, just because you like their personalities so much. For the most part, however, buffs and debuffs are pretty well balanced.It adds a ton of much-needed flavor to a section of turn-based strategy that is usually very calculated and bland. Very fun.I haven't been this taken with a title for a very long time. Very much recommended, and hopefully we'll see Sega release another proper sequel.			"

												XCOM: Waifu editionJoking aside, this game is a true gem. I actually love it more than XCOM: EU or EW and I do enjoy thos games. The game is pretty straight forward from a turn based perspective game.   However, unlike XCOM for example, you level up classes rather than particular characters. Meaning the recruits you get will all be the same strength in terms of firepower and action points and the like. However, different recruits have differen't characteristics. This ranges from being racist and not wanting to be near certain members, or allergies, pretty much every possible pro or con you think would actually influence people's actions.  They all have their friends, and will commonly fight harder to protect those friends. Some of them are panicky, and not everyone has the same amount of health despite being the same class and having the same upgrades. Unlike XCOM where you have to individually give equipment to each squad member, in this it becomes the general issue equipment for each class. So you'll only have to focus on the personalities and characteristics of the characters, and not what their equipment is. The story is extremely good and episodic based, LOTS of cutscenes if you like that, but the combat is rewarding and enjoyable.   The true endearing factor of Valkyria Chronicles is the diversity of characters. Having a character who hates the enemy and is sadistic and gets excited to end their lives for example. Ditzy valley guys or girls who get distracted because they're so chatty in combat. Each character feels unique, you're not leading professional soldiers, you're leading civilians who have to begin to face the horrors of war. These are militiamen, and they begin to evolve into true soldiers as time goes on. Once a pacifist, now a hardened veteran and able soldier.  It feels like you're honestly leading characters with personalities, rather than some copy and pasted hard♥♥♥♥♥grunt who's vast lexicon of responses is ""Roger, Engaging, and Moving"" Whilst I feel those hard soldier types seen in XCOM and other military games are fine. I do have to say I prefer to see human aspects to an otherwise cold hearted soldier type. The game is undeniably human, much like the Metal Gear series, it has a very anti-war sentiment to it. Trying to drive home the geo-political intricacies of racism, history, and human emotions. It's a war story with an anime aesthetic, there's quite a few times where I get hit by the feel train.However, they still managed to fit a pig with wings in here.  Albeit it still can't fly			"

The combat manages to be both deeply strategic and beautiful fun, the gameplay has an absolute unique look to it and every single one of your soldiers has their own fully voiced back story and personalities.This is a gorgeous turn-based strategy/RPG mix I never expected to find from a japanese console port.Highly recommended.

												You're on the tank now...Valkyria Chronicles is an interesting game for sure. Not only it's a weird genre mix making it very hard to describe, but also there are many strong and weak points worth discussing in both gameplay and story.Story excels at world building. Not-Europe at not-World War II is a very interesting and compelling setting on it's own. There is also ton of flavor text, both written and voice acted, going miles to give, for example, characterization of every soldier you can command in the game, with quirky personalities included. World overall is really inviting. That said, core plot has some very noticeable problems. One: it tries to tell a war-themed story in probably most non-violent way possible, implementing massive amount of well-known anime clichés, where Spec Ops: The Line simply eviscerated and deconstructed this genre to the bare-bones. It leaves the game without cohesive message and consequence, making it hard to take serious. Add pretty long cutscenes to the mix and you will receive something that not everyone can stomach. I ultimately liked it, but everybody wanting a serious story or having an anime allergy, take caution.Gameplay is a weird mix of strategy game, RPG and third-person shooter. I would compare it to Worms, Fallout 3's V.A.T.S. system and Supergiant Games’ Transistor. Many others also use X-Com as a reference. The gameplay may have some ""first-installment-oddities"" like: unbalanced classes, clueless buff/debuff system, slow leveling requiring additional skirmish battles (just to keep on par with the enemies), annoying randomness and unexplained mechanics... BUT at the end it's real, genuine fun and battles feel like chess matches. Tanks are awesome, sniping enemies from distance is awesome and owning the AI in pretty hard battles is awesome too. It's a solid gameplay worth your interest if the description feels compelling for you.Music? Top notch! Japanese people certainly know how to make symphonic music. I also cannot say a bad thing about graphics that have their own charming style. This cell-shading will not age quickly. I also commend a good PC port, free DLC, New Game+ mode and good content/price ratio (even with long cutscenes, 32 hours for one playthough is pretty neat result).Valkyria Chronicles is a weird mix, but for those who want to take risk, it may be a bullseye. Not for everyone, especially those with low anime tolerance, but definitely worth a look for the uniqueness sake alone.			"

												Back on 2008, Valkyria Chronicles came out to very little to no fanfare and it quickly became one of the 'hidden gems' of gaming for the PS3. Then quickly after that, Sega produced two more sequels on the PSP and then other spinoffs on mobile platforms. Not to mention, the game was originally developed for the Xbox 360 but Sega decided to make it for the PS3 instead, considering they weren't seeing much support for the project from Microsoft and they wanted to cater to the Japanese audience. So needless to say, it has had quite a history until its PC release.Regarding the port itself, it's quite fantastic. Other than a few audio issues where gunfire and character voices in-game may not be as loud as they were on the PS3 version and how the cutscenes are still in their original 720p video format, everything about this port is an improvement. The relatively flat, water-color aesthetic of the game means that upscaling them to modern PC resolutions results in a very crisp look. The conversion from 30 frames per second to 60 is quite stunning to behold as well. Especially for a VC fanatic like me. So I'm glad that new fans of this franchise will get quite an amazing visual experience.For the game itself, it is a really fantastic mix of seriousness of war to the colorful characterizations of anime. It strikes a great balance between cartoony fantasy (moments of character comedy, light moments with off-days of the soldiers, fantastical mythology and lore)  and World War 2 style seriousness (replete with themes of racism, genocide, Jewish persecution and corruption and evils of war).  What I absolutely adore about this series is they don't mingle too much into one mindset and you are going to get a lot of funny moments and serious moments in very balanced doses throughout. So if you want a certain variety of emotions and scenarios in a game, the Valkyria Chronicles series is for you. Aside from the theme itself, the combat system BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones) is an elegant mix of real time 3rd person shooter and turn based strategy you have to play to believe in how well they come together. The combat system may sound like a weird coupling, but only a few minutes of getting used to the system, you will fall in love with this elegant combat system even if you are a jaded strategy game fan.Honestly, the game still stands the test of time regarding its unique gameplay engine, likable characters (This game has lineage with the likes of Sakura Wars, so character interaction is their bread and butter)  and a lovely story and lore complemented by the incredible music by the legendary  Hitoshi Sakimoto of other legendary strategy titles like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre.So if you want to support an underdog franchise and be a part of potentially making a full fledged, major Valkyria Chronicles 4 happen, this game is a very easy game to recommend. It's not to say negative things about Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 though, as they're lovely games in their own right. Though they are scaled down side games in comparison considering they came out on the PSP, which is quite a bit more under powered compared to the PS3 and PCs of the modern era. Hopefully, those games come out on the PC as well. But until then, I can't recommend Valkyria Chronicles 1 more. It's definitively one of the most lovely games on the PS3 era and I can't be happier it's on the PC for more people to experience it.			"

												Very well done port of one of the PS3's best games. Thank you, Sega. Fingers crossed that this game is well received by PC gamers, encouraging more quality PC ports and inspiring more confidence in western releases of traditionally Japanese franchises (hint hint, Yakuza 5 and Valkyria Chronicles 3).Looks great running at higher resolution and framerate. The pre-rendered cutscenes are still at their original resolution, but they look mostly fine - thanks in large part to the excellent art style.Great keyboard and controller support. Fully remappable with proper button prompts for keyboard/360 controller.The gameplay, characters, and story are still just as great as they were when this game was released back in 2008, but they're not perfect and won't be everyone's cup of tea. The characters and plot are very anime. VERY anime. The fusion of turn-based strategy gameplay with real-time shooter elements is novel and pretty darn fun, but it can be a bit finicky in spots. The real-time controls at times don't feel precise enough and there can be a trial-and-error feel to some missions. The issues can lead to the game occasionally not feeling fair or balanced, but I don't find it severe or frequent enough to be detrimental to the overall experience.Music and dialogue are great (English and Japanese audio tracks both included). There are some minor audio issues - odd mixing, some slight popping on cutscene dialogue. The first patch has mostly corrected this issue, but hopefully it will get a little more attention because it's still not quite perfect.			"

												Must play if you like tactical games.  I don't like that Japanese Anime Manga stuff but I enjoyed this game.If you are one of this dudes who has like a samurai sword under your bed and think asians girls won't hate you you should definately buy this game.Plot is pretty much WWII shananigans.You are like belgium or something. You fight some Nazi Inspired Monarchists but they come from the East like the commies. Things I like:+ Great looking art style. Very unique.+ Great voice acting.+ Music is well done too.+ Works well on Intel HD 3000 (don't hate I'm buying PC soon)+ Works well with controller. I used Xbox 360 and then Steam controller.Neutral:* It gets corny. Some of the romantic sub plot has a ""written by a 13 year old virgin"" kind of feel. But that's just Japanese things. If you are into that kind of stuff you will like it.Things I don't like.- That God Damn ****king tank controls. Tips (no spoilers):* My favorite tactic is run right next to the enemy and shoot them in a face. Well that's pretty much my only tactic.* You can save game (which i only found out in Chapter 8 or so....)* That blue turd attached to the back of the tank is vulnurable to damage. One hit with Lance will kill it. Also 20 rounds from Assault will kill a tank in turn or two depending on size of the tank.* Most of the missions are 20 turns. Take it slow.Some Japanse words translated for you to get started:Lance = Ruchnoy Protivotankoviy GranatometImp = aka Imperial, Nazi Inspired Commie Monarchis guy that you kill in the gameEdelweiss = TankDarcen = Jew			"

												One of my most favourite PS3 games that really never got the attention it deserved, and to be fair, I initially brushed it off when I played a demo of it with no real context or idea of the story at all. I initally bought on an impulse (I was really looking for a heavy binge of cell shaded games at the time, thanks, Tales of series!) and grew to love over the course of my playthrough. It brought everything that I loved about Fire Emblem, and more with its beautifully designed watercolour-esque presentation...all with free DLC included! Get ready for a long love letter review...Valkyria Chronicles is set in a fictional version of Europe, known as Europa (yeah, I know, original) in the year 1935. The neutral nation, Gallia holds an abundant of an important resource known as Ragnite ore, which pretty much is this world's bread and butter for fueling just about everything. In an attempt to capture its resources, the East Europan Imperial Alliance launches a campaign on Gallia to fuel their ongoing war with the Atlantic Federation. Caught in between the crossfire, the player is left with the job to repel the foreign invaders and find peace in a wartorn continent. Lets go by some of the differences Valkyria Chronicles compared to a normal S-RPG:Valkyria Chronicles gameplay works off by giving each team a select amount of command points at the start of their turn, allowing each team to use it accordingly. You use one command point to command one unit for their remainder of either their stamina gauge, life, or when you are comfortable at where they've stopped. This unit is free to attack, take objectives, or escort and save allies from the battle. You later on get the ability to use these command points to perform ""orders"", allowing the commander to inspire army to fight in a specific manner, which can vary from hunkering down from enemy fire or increase the chances of proccing their potentials (we'll cover this later). This goes on until one team either one team uses all of their command points or ends their turn, allowing them to pool a certain number of remaining command points for the next turn. Now, its important to know that the actual gameplay relies on a stamina gauge movement system rather than grid based, similar to comparing a checkers where one piece can only move one square each to chess where the bishop, queen, and rook can move as far as they'd like on the board unless its obstructed. A unit can move forward, backward, sideways, etc as much as they like as long as they have enough stamina to complete that action. However you should keep in mind how MUCH stamina you have left, as you don't really want to leave a unit in enemy fire.Each solider you recruit as you continue in the game is unique, they are all different people who have their own backstories, and as individuals, have their own personalities. This is known as ""potential"", which can sometimes be a good thing, sometimes be a bad thing. Lets say for example the scout Alicia has the potential ""maternal"", which, when any of her close friends are nearby she will increase her desire to protect them, giving her increased stats all around. Another one would be the sniper Marina, who is a lone wolf with the potential ""my way"" , giving her increased evasive skills.  But its important to note that not all are positive buffs, for example, Ramona has ""chatty cathy"", which procs whenever a close friend is nearby, she just can't stop but chitchat with them, which distracts her and lowers her accuracy.  Its important to know who works well with who, and what kind of quirks they have. Like having pollen allergy. Wow, that really sucks to have as a potential.Now its important to note that just like Fire Emblem, there is PERMANENT DEATH. If one of your soldier falls in battle (barring the important story characters, of course) and are not rescued in time by an allied solider they WILL DIE FOR GOOD. There is no way to revive them if you don't reach them in time. They are gone. For realsies. In fact. there is even an in-game graveyard to remind you who has died so far in the war and how badly you failed. Talk about a punch in the gut. So its a good idea to keep in mind to train your scouts as they will most often act as your objective takers and evacuation units, just because they don't pack as much damage as shocktroopers doesn't make them useless!I loved this game dearly as I never got so involved in a bunch of fictional soldiers than in any other game. X-COM allowed me to make silly units, but I never got attached to them, not even to Sir Buttingtonfarts the sniper. I'd recommend this game to just about anyone that has never given it a fair shot, or just love S-RPGs like Fire Emblem, Disgaea, etc, but want it in a different taste. And hey, maybe give the 2nd and 3rd game a shot! They both improve the gameplay even further by adding multiple branching classes and adding more background stories for each soldier, just...uh...they're on the PSP. Which is a bit of a dead system. And not as pretty. Oh well.Please note that the game cinematics runs on 720p for some reason, the gameplay is working fine for any other resolution, so pick whichever you'd like. But for anyone who's playing 1080p or higher it might bother you that some of the scenes might appear a little ""edgey"" or a little jagged. Yeah, its bothering me, too. But hey, 60fps! Glorious watercoloured battlefield action! In sixty framerates per second! Take that, my old launch PS3.			"

												After Finishing the Game, Getting over 20 Hours into Valkyria Chronicles (PC) I can finally honestly make a Review of the Game.Port Quality:   Excellent.  Game does suffer from some minor bugs, but it's mostly engine related when playing at higher FPS than the game was EVER designed to perform at.  Aside from that, most everything works beautifully.   Graphically and even Control/Handling.  Game runs absolutely beautifully for a PS3 Port over to PC.   Graphically it looks beautiful as well.  Controls, In Depth:  Being a PC game people expect good Mouse/Keyboard Controls.  Despite being a Port this game doesn't disappoint.  I played the game from start to finish using Mouse/Keyboard and save for 4 Story Missions I ended up getting A/B ranks on everything else, mostly A Ranks.  Being I'm a Veteran of the game I know how to beat most missions well, and I prefer PC games vs console.  I openly give SEGA a Thumbs up on their efforts on adapting the controls for PC.  Even going through Menu's seems to work well, as long as users remember the menus were never designed for a mouse, so the mouse does not function for menus.  Game Itself:  It is a no brainer that Valkyria Chronicles is a Masterpiece of a video game, and despite being a Port to PC it does not disappoint anywhere.  Everything works well, the story and characters are colorful and memorable.   The game has never been more beautiful to play because of the higher resolution options.  Anyone who has any doubts about buying this game, have those doubts out of their own miss givings.  There is no gamer who should not find something to enjoy in the splended world of Gallia.			"

												Anime style story-driven tactical RPG about courageous Squad 7 of militia fighting a hostile nation that invaded beautiful and peaceful country of Galia.PROS:- Beautiful comic book style graphics.- The game uses fictional countries and nations, but definitely has a WW2 feel. If you like WW2 themes (I do), the game is great.- Fine character development and touching story.- Good voice acting.- Good music.- Lots of tactical options. Every unit serves its purpose. Multiple options to win every battle.- Some levels are challenging, but as a person that sometimes has to refer to tutorials and FAQs, I was able to complete all by myself.MEH:- AI moves might be better. There are times when enemy is able to ruin you, but instead of destroying one tank, delivers equal number of attacks on both your tanks. So you have a feeling that AI goes easy on you. There is no difficulty setting.- Japanese dev had to squeeze a cute winged piglet there. It serves no purpose at all.- There are times where it is sort of naive, but it's still good.CONS:- Controls are sort of clunky, definitely prepared for gamepad, not a mouse.- Your tanks get stuck.- Some parts are unskippable, which may be painful, because sometimes you know you royally screwed up after enemy's first move and you'll need to reload from save for sure, but surprise surprise, you have to wait for enemy's all moves to do anything (it can take 2-5 minutes).As you can see, important stuff in the game is really good. There are some nuissance bugs and glitches, but it's all within norms. I recommend Valkyria Chronicles wholeheartedly.GAMEPLAY 8/10GRAPHICS 9/10AUDIO 9/10STORY 9/10			"

												For those that have never heard of or played this game before, I absolutely recommend it. It's a good hybrid of RTS and third person shooting. Think sort of along the lines of Fire Emblem crossed with Advance Wars crossed with Command & Conquer.As for those that did play it on the PS3, I can easily recommend this version. Playing this at high resolutions and framerates is super nice. It is easy to downsample it to 4k on my 1080p monitor and I can STILL get 120FPS. The only problem I have had that is worth noting is a bug where the tank can't go up hills if you are playing on 120 FPS. Hopefully Sega issues a fix for this.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a TRPG (Tactical Role Playing game) and every character under your command has their own unique personality and traits which will either give that character an advantage or disadvantage on the battlefield for that turn.PROS- Interesting story- A great pc port- English/Japanese voice options- Game mechanics are quite solid- Graphics are beautiful though it's in ps3 quality- Sudden difficulty spikes- Characters have back stories- DLC is also very goodCONS- Speed runs encouraged for gold ratings- Some ""orders"" can make missions too easy OverallI really enjoyed the game and do hope that Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 will be released on steam in the future.

												One of the best games of the PS3 era and you can now play it on the PC. Fun tactical gameplay, interesting cast of characters and a war story that while it has it's dark moments doesn't get too bogged down in the harsh realities of war. The anime style may not be to everyones tastes but it never gets too caught up in it's tropes. Transition to the PC from the PS3 has been fairly smooth, some slight hiccups with the mouse and keyboard controls but nothing too major (and if you have a controller set up you won't even notice). Includes all the DLC and will give you roughly 35+ hours of gameplay (not including A+ ranking all missions and replays). It's a fantastic game for a low price, I highly recommended you pick it up now rather than waiting for a sale, so hopefully SEGA gets the message and ports VC2 and 3...and maybe even works on a 4th. C'mon 7th Squad need you!			"

												A job well done, Great port, I can't stress it enough, this port is functional and shows that SEGA are committed to delivering quality PC products. This is the short answer to what is to expect of this port, of a game actually a few years old, but able to outsell some big players, like certain flops released near this date.Valkyria Chronicles is a well made strategy game, made with the intention of doing something different from usual. The intent wasn't on having awesome graphics (even in 2008 the graphics were ok) but something beautiful, and even now, six years later, the game still looks beautiful, not at all old.The plot is engaging, maybe a bit reliant on cliches, but still well done and interesting. Any story about a war not glorifying it, but showing it with fairness (Cruelty, heroism, sacrifice, duty, loyalty...) is always a welcome sight. The main characters are well developed, and the side characters get their own missions to shine.The music is beautiful, with some tracks being fairly normal, while others are memorable. Voice acting in English is kinda Fairly Bad, while the original Japanese work is polished and flawless.The controls are well ported, mouse control is smooth and correct, I miss having a cursor in the menus, but the important part (The combat) goes flawless. It also allows controller use, for those who prefer the original experience.Combat can be as challenging as you allow it to be. Certainly victory won't be an issue most of the time, but getting A rank is another, different, matter. Still, the learning curve is user friendly, as long as the player accepts B ranks for a while.The Strategic part varies, sometimes being smart allows the player to have really fun combats, while considering possibilities. Other times using strong scouts allows to skip the entire combat by simply rushing an objective fast. It's not cheating, but still, I'd discourage players from exploiting the mechanics for fast victories.Long story short. This game is cheap, good, it has aged well, the control is good and it's fun. Simply one of the best Tactical Strategy game i've ever played			"

												An excellent, excellent port of an already excellent game. The keyboard-only controls in the book menu are a little goofy, but the actual map/battle controls are spot on and exactly what the game needed. And the game runs very well and downsamples like a monster (though, sadly, this will not help the FMV engine-rendered cutscenes).There's quibbles but who gives a damn, the important things have been done very well and the game at the heart of the port is one of the best strategy RPGs of the previous console generation. There's no reason not to buy this and love the hell out of it.			"

												I don't normally play anime games, but this was awesome. The best part of the game is the fact that each individual soldier you can assign to your squad is individually voice acted, each having their owns lines of dialouge and short biography, which makes every soldier appear unique and worthwhile. Except for Engeneer Herbert. Why did you ever even join the military Herbert? You don't put any effort into anything. Do you even care? Of course you don't.			"

												This is a rare specimen of a game that's more than the sum of its parts.

It's a game with character and style that crafts its own unique identity, oozes charm and has captured the hearts of many players to become the cult classic it is.The steam version also runs insanely well compared to the PS3 original. Load and save times are nonexistent, controls are highly customizable and the game looks as good as it did in my rose-tinted memories thanks to proper support for much higher resolutions.			"

												Game is decent port of ps3 game. I have doubts about the controls system though, but everything is customizable. From looking at the key mapping menu it didn't even look like the mouse was used until I tried playing without the gamepad. It's definitely a game better played on a gamepad if you're not quick on the keys. Gameplay graphics are great if not better. Story is unchanged fromt he orginal but if you've yet to play the DLC definitely pick this up. I'll be occassionally streaming this since I plan on getting all the achievements eventually. Come stop by if you want to take a look at the game. Even if I'm not online there should be clips available of past broadcast. http://www.twitch.tv/kickzngigglezEDIT: So I've been asked a few things on stream so I'll just answer them here incase anyone else was wondering about them.The difficulty of the game is very interesting because it's a challenging game but it can also be easy. During the early level your equipment will be rather pathetic, especially in the accuracy department. However the missions are less punishing. Later in the game your characters abilities are amazing but the game definitely punishes you at every wrong move. Unfortunately like Fire Emblem and X-COM RNG tends to make things chaotic every now and then. However every stage has an easy/short path but it usually takes a few failures every now and then to figure it out. Have fun if that's the sort of game you're into.The story and what to expect is pretty much a standard war story. However I mean the war stories you hear from your grandparents and not the ones from hollywood. If you find experiencing a rollarcoaster of love and tragedy amusing, have fun on the feels train.			"

												Valkyria Chronicle was one of those big surprise games for me on the PS3. As a bit of an anime fan I was immediately drawn to the graphics of this game when it was first announced in Japan. When the first english release came out I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I knew I wanted it... Valkyria Chronicles can be best summed up in the opening lines of the game itself, ""what follows is a chronicle of those fought, lived and died."" Valkyria Chronicles is a character driven strategy game combining turn based elements with third person action. Every soldier under your command is different, they each have their own capabilities whether that be accuracy or health and all have ""Potentials"". Potentials can range from something as simple as preferring to run over concrete or urban paths leading to a rise in defence to screaming ""VEG-TA-BLES!"" when they run over dirt... Then their are your inter-unit relations. Most soldiers have three other soldiers with whom they like and if within close proximity during an attack, will lend their fire to the attack for extra damage. Then some soldiers just don't like certain individuals to one sniper hating EVERYONE. The story is great and you'll find yourself saying ""just one more battle!"" just to see the next cinematic and seeing how the story evolves and what happens to your favourite characters. Overall give Valkyria Chronicles a go, you may be pleasantly surprised.			"

												An amazing title that got me hooked for 10 hours straight after my purchase, the port quality is great, voice acting is superb, from both Japanese and English VA's. But what really caught my attention was how much SEGA invested in this title, and I'm talking specifically about the squad members, with each of them having their own voice, lines, apperance and personality traits, not much of a big deal when you think of it but it really adds up to the experience. The same goes for the glossary section and how it explores each character, weapon, vehicle into great detail as you progress through the game.The art direction is also something that is definitely worth mentioning, I'm a sucker for cell-shaded graphics, and the way the game presents itself on the canvas engine really makes the game stand out from anything else I have played, absolutely brilliant presentation.Gameplay-wise I have to acknowledge that there are some noticeable differences from console to PC, more so when you are playing at 60 frames per second, it can be awkward and tough at the times, with units firing at twice the rate that they normally would on PS3, but the game itself plays really damn well. (I will also commend SEGA for promptly acknowledging and providing the PC with a post-release patch that addressed several issues when playing with high frame rates, more specifically tank movement.)I'm glad that SEGA decided to port this to PC, I had been seeking to try this game out for quite a while on my PS3 but unfortunatelly I never managed to snag a copy on retail, I can't believe I almost missed out on playing this gem.This really is an amazing game with great replay value, I love it, so much so that I've decided to re-write my initial review.. and by now I have over 90 hours clocked and I've beat the game a total of 3 times. A solid 10 out of 10 I recommend it to everybody.(Apologies for the almost like 'sales-pitch' review, but I do speak from the heart)			"

Posted: November 17, 2014
												I attempted to play this game on the PS3 not long after it first came out in English, but became annoyed with the game system after about five missions and stopped. Since a friend bought me the new PC port as a gift, I felt obliged to play it, but regrettably all of the original complaints I had about the game were vindicated and the port introduced a host of new ones as well.Presentation:Valkyria Chronicles' greatest strengths are its beautiful watercolor-style graphics, which still look great six years later, and its powerful orchestral score. I have nothing to complain about in regards to those.The PC port, while it can run at a higher resolution than the original PS3 version, has some major issues related to the graphics framerate. The game is unplayable above a certain FPS due to severe bugs with the speed of interception fire and with tank physics, and the FPS limiter only allows running the game at 30FPS or 'refresh rate' (too high on many monitors to avoid bugs.) 60FPS fans will have to prepare themselves for a 'cinematic' experience.Many of the cutscenes are prerendered as 720p video and look very ugly at higher resolutions. They also make the size of the game's download, at 20 gigabytes, far larger than any 6-year-old game ought to be.Gameplay:First of all, Valkyria Chronicles isn't a strategy game; it's a puzzle game. The puzzle is figuring out what the game thinks is an A-rank strategy, a feat of military genius on par with the legendary conquests of Napoleon and Caesar. The answer ranges from ""run one scout past enemy lines to kill the two soldiers sitting in their main base and 'capture' it, inexplicably forcing an enemy retreat"" to ""have the same shocktrooper shoot everything"" to ""move your tank to an empty corner of the map so it can attack the enemy reinforcements from behind when they magically appear."" It is never ""have your entire squad work together"" or ""secure the area before advancing forward."" Foolishly attempting to use 'intelligent' tactics learned in inferior strategy games such as StarCraft or XCOM will result in punishment. You will earn less XP and money and receive no royal accolades (with their accompanying special weapons) unless you replay the missions again and again to find out what insane act of bravado can clear them as fast as humanly possible. Or you could use a walkthrough.This isn't just because the rank & reward system favors sheer speed over all else; it's because the game design itself encourages and rewards a ""lone commando"" style of play. As the Command Point system makes every squaddie cost a point to move, it's far more efficient to spam CPs on whoever you already have at the front lines than to bring up an ally to assist them. Even when the diminishing returns start to make spending further CPs on your point man a waste, those you leave unused will roll over to the next phase, and the poor enemy AI means letting them have a turn will rarely hurt if your units are in safe positions. ""Orders"" are another way to spend CP that's more efficient than wasting it on teamwork, the most useful one magically turning your scouts with light rifles into beasts capable of single-handedly destroying heavy tanks, and thus negating the need to use speciality anti-tank soldiers or your own tanks for such purposes.The PC port adds quite a few bugs that do nothing to improve the experience. The most severe problem I suffered was a glitch that caused my troops to fall out of the map ( 


Valkyria Chronicles™ 
A Screenshot of Valkyria Chronicles™
By: DOZO




 ) when they climbed any ladders in one mission, making it impossible to take out some deadly cannons you were expected to neutralize, and necessitating a cheesy and tedious maneuver to reach the objective despite that.Controls:The controls are mostly alright except for the tanks. They wiggle back and forth constantly whether controlled with mouse or keyboard, wasting AP, and will frequently get stuck on something invisible and vibrate in place until they can no longer move. During missions where I had to use the tanks a lot, I had to save before moving them and sometimes reload upward of five times before I could avoid glitching out during the movement. I shouldn't need a gamepad to play a PC game, assuming the tanks control any better using one of those.The menu system is also cumbersome and makes it a chore to do anything, gamepad or not. SEGA could have done much better in the port department here, though I suppose it's impressive by the standards of Japanese publishers that the controls and interface are mostly usable.Story:No comment. It's pretty much standard JRPG material aside from the twist of having a fantasy-WW2 setting. I can see where people who love it are coming from, and where those who hate it are coming from. For me, it was enough to keep me playing to the end despite my dislike of the gameplay, which seems a rather commendable accomplishment.I did notice something rather conspicuous when playing with Japanese audio and English subtitles. I'm pretty fluent in Japanese myself, but the subtitle translations (apparently an exact copy of the English voice actors' script) of Valkyria Chronicles are so loose that at times I wondered whether the person who wrote the English script was. Very few lines have the same nuance as the originals, some conversations are completely rewritten and there are even a few lines added in where the Japanese audio has only silence. The original dialogue is kind of dry and dull at times, so I can't fault the localization team too much for wanting to ""punch it up,"" but I think it's a disservice to those who only know English and are unaware of the changes; I've seen quite a few people complaining about the corny dialogue in VC and wonder if they would have felt the same had it been more accurately translated.One of many examples I could give, from the cutscene at the end of chapter 12 -なんだか不思議、ウェルキンと話していると、いつも元気が出てくるんだよね。僕も、アリシアと一緒だから頑張れるんだよ。うん。　ありがとう、ウェルキン。　私…ウェルキンと出会えて…　本当によかった。My own literal translation:""It's kind of mysterious. When I talk with you, Welkin, it always makes me feel better.""""And it's because I'm together with you that I'm able to keep trying, Alicia.""""Yeah. Thank you, Welkin. I...""""It really is wonderful that I was able to meet you, Welkin.""And the in-game subtitles: ""You know, it's funny. Whenever I talk to you, I feel like everything is going to be fine.""""Yeah, well, you're the only reason I haven't completely lost it Alicia.""""Really? Thank you, Welkin. Me too.""""I'm glad we were able to meet... and work together.""Nitpicking? Maybe. But pretty irritating if you can tell, and worth pointing out to those who can't, I think.Conclusion:As long as you know what to expect from it, Valkyria Chronicles isn't a terrible game, but it's misrepresented by almost everyone and will only annoy and frustrate hardcore strategy game fans (like me.) I cannot personally recommend it, but it's evident that a lot of people would, and I'm glad they were able to find it enjoyable. I encourage them to try real strategy games sometime and learn the joy of thinking on one's feet and adapting to the unexpected that is nonexistent in Valkyria Chronicles.Additionally, due to the buggy PC port, it's best played on PS3 and not PC. I hope that patches for the PC version are coming, but I don't expect them.			"

												Having never played the original Valkyria Chronicles I never had very high expectations for the game. After 30+ hours of playing and finally beating the game I can say that this game has soared above and beyond what I wanted to get out of this experience. The story is told amazingly and the passion put into it made me laugh and cry along with the characters. As I said having not played the original game I can't say how good of a port it is from the PS3 but I would definitly recommend this for someone new to the series. Solid controls and the limited mobility by the use of CP (command points) allow you to take full advantage of many actions. The ability to have a ""reaction fire"" is also a new mechanic that I have never seen before but is implemented amazingly into the game, finally being able to fire upon enemies who come into the line of sight prevents many moves that could flat out ruin the game experience for me. Many different unit types and enemies also make this game interesting as each new level brings new enemies and challenges. One of the few games I could give a solid 10/10 to. Now time for the second playthrough!			"

												Ok I don't want to fanboy over this game but be warned this is going to be very biasOk now lets put it bluntly, I love this game, when I first played this game back on the PS3 I fell in love with it instantly, how it looks, the characters, the music, the gameplay I loved ALL of it so without spoiling too much about the game I'll explain the plot.The year is 1935 in a ficitional land called Europa, and yes it is essentially just Europe and basically, their WW2 happens with the Empire (Who are basically the Axis) and the Federation (who are basically the Allies) trying to out kill each other, during this though the Empire decides to attack a small neutral country called Galia and this is where you start the game.You play Welking Gunther, the son of a EW1 (their WW1) Hero coming home to help your sister and maid evacuate, on the way Welkin gets arrested by the town watch due to being a suspected spy where he meets one of the other main characters, Alicia Melciott, shortly after your attacked by an empire scouting party and the game beginsnow from that description your probitly thinking a very 'Tales of' game but in actuallity the game has alot of things similer to the XCOM line of games, the game is a mixture of real time and turn based gameplay, to put it simple your turn starts with you on a birds eye view with icons repsenting your troops, you select one and assume direct control of said character, here the game unfreezes and you can be shot at, you then move around, crouch behind sandbags and more but you have a bar which dictates how far you move, outside of that you can end or turn or enter aim mode.here all gameplay stops again, the enemies shooting at you finish (though the mounted guns tend to misbehave and keep fireing for much longer) and you can do a more aggresive action, haling, repearing or the more obvious one, shooting the opponent, but be carful because if your in range of the enemy and they survive your attack they're allowed to counter attack, then you can only end your turn, when you run out of command points you end your turn and then the enemy's begin, basically being able to do the same thing.Theres also permadeath in this game, baring a few missions every mission has one possible failure state: Welkin Dies. if his tank explodes or on the few missions he's on foot he hits 0 health you instantly fail, outside of Welkin there are 4 more ""Essential"" characters, these will never die in battle and will instead retreat, being unable to be used for the remainder of the battle, then theres everybody else, if they are killed then they stay dead, no ""Amazingly they survived"" or retirering due to injurys, when they die they are perminatly dead till you play through the game again.next is the story, as you would expect for most japanesise games (Not all, just most) the game has some very cliche anime-like moments and archtypes (Including an obligatory beach scene) but actually keeps itself very down to earth and showcases something in war that most war games don't manage, how in war a situation can go from silly and fun to dark and depressing in the blink of an eye, this allows the characters to feel like actual people, you feel then reacting to the sudden changes as you would and that in turn helps you to attach to them.Now incase i go over the character limit i'm just going to randomly throw the 3 problems I have with the game so1. The difficulty is all over the place, some missions are rather difficulty then suddenly you get an easy one, theres one mission that is absurdly difficult about 1/3rd of the way through the game but the next 4 or 5 are a cake walk, theres no real curve which makes the experiance a litting jaring2. the AI sometimes goes into full derp mode, I've had snipers run point blank range into my shocktroopers to try and snipe one, I've even had AIs just end their turn standing in the middle of the battlefield because they got shot once3. the ports animated cutscenes are at 30fps 720p but the game can be played at 4k and 60fps, small gripe but a little jaring, the game looks beutiful anywayok still not at the character limit? good I'll continueone thing that strikes me about the game (outside of its graphics which look beutiful especially in the animated cutscenes) is the music, which was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto who you may know from his work in FF12 and the Tactics series, the music uses alot of violins and piano work to help express the emotion being felt at the time including tension, joy and sadness, of course this runs into the problem though that alot of tracks are repeated but thankfully it doesn't get too annoying to listen to after multiple playthroughs and it tends to save the best tracks for when its needednow to finish off is graphics, and i'm just going to say this now, SEGA needs to use this game engine more, while it does defently have rather low texture quality its only noticeable at really close range, the Canvis engine has that really great combination of vibrant colours, strong lighting (when it's used which unfortunatly is not often) and makes the characters have very distinquishable sillouetes which prevent you from being killed cheaply, there ARE a few issues with the physics but the game doesn't use then in say how a Call of duty game uses it, typically its saved for the ragdolls which disappear after a short whileOverall Valkyria chronicles is as good now as it is then, it is well made and is one of the best games of its generation and mayhaps even be with in a few ""best games of all time"" list. I would defently recommend buying this game.			"

												I've bought this game 1 year ago and managed to play it only couple weeks ago.Well, i regret not playing it right after purchase.Amazing story and characters with beautiful soundtrack. I really loved customization system. It's not very complicated, so you wont be confused about weapon choice, etc. Turn-based system makes this game much more interesting and sometimes you really need to think about your next move. Also - scouts are OP!Wish there were more story and info about Squad 7 members. Not just book info.Rosie and Marina one love <3  "

												This was one of the best games on the PS3 for me, and while I've only given it a quick look on Steam, it seems like a good port. The mouse only works when selecting units in game and for controlling units after you select them (i.e. not during the menu interface), and settings can only be adjusted outside of the game, but that's a lot more port effort than some console ports I've seen. Haven't tried to see if it has gamepad support, but I'll probably play it keyboard and mouse just for the mouse aiming.As for the game, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes tactical RPGs but is willing to try something a little different. The art is beautiful, the characters charming, the story is great and the gameplay is fun. Your mileage may vary on the between mission stuff. I liked it, but the upgrade system takes a while to get interesting, and I'm sure some people won't have the patience for selecting the next 'episode' of the story.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles, originally a 2008 PS3 exclusive title, is a fantastic JRPG with a great art style, heartwarming story, and a unique gameplay experience. Without spoiling anything, the game's story takes place in a fictional land based WWII-era Europe with elements of fantasy and Japanese anime. Prejudices, war, death, revenge, family, and romance are themes that VC explores well.The art style of the game is one of its strongest features. VC looks like a water color painting in motion and makes for a great style without seeming too bland. The gameplay is a mix of turn-based and real time strategy combat which can be challenging, but quite rewarding.VC does have its flaws. Since it is a PS3 port, the controls feel much more comfortable on a gamepad rather than a mouse and keyboard. The difficulty of the game is moderate, but it can fluctuate at times and there is a learning curve.Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing title that is worth playing over and over again.			"

												This is one of the notable JRPGs of last generation of games. I recently played the PS3 game(I was at the Marmota part) before buying this port and a brand new PC rig, in which I had to trade my PS3 copy for Star Ocean 4. I'm thinking that this game surpasses it's original game, just because 60fps at 4k resolution, Game comes with the DLCs at a lower price compared to the PS3 game and it fast to no loading times at all. If you are a fan of SRPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics(They even got the composer of FFT in this game), this is definitely recommended to you. Replayability is also good since there is Hard mode and EX Hard mode. I am very pleased to see JRPGs come to Steam and hopefully let this be known to Japanese developers that there is a GROWING DEMAND for japan developed-games in Steam, old or new games, there will be a people buying those games.GOOD JOB SEGA, BAYONETTA SERIES  AND HD VALKYRIA CHRONICLES 2/3 ON STEAM PLEASE			"

												I absolutely adore this game. Its a ps3 classic that slipped under the radar for most people for its simple visual style and animeish look. While it does contain its fair share of anime tropes it still manages to be an extremely engageing experience. The story manages to both be compelling, dramatic and silly with the game possibly being the first to really take a look at consentraition camps and blatant racism. Though its messege just seems to be that its bad. Nonetheless the narrative does keep on being compelling during the entire experience. The gameplay can best be described as x-com meets 3rd person shooters. It manages a almost perfect difficulty curve by giving new exiting challenges on almost all the levels. It really manages to make you think about what strategies you want to use in order to win in the fastes amount possible.Visually the game is stunning, using the best cellshade and shadow effects ive ever seen. That being said texture quality is something that looks like an early ps3 game, since it is. However i feel like they should have taken advantage of the pc horsepower giving a few more effect and higher visual fidelity. At least the game runs smoothly without taxing my system above 10% (both cpu and gpu).In conclusion valkyria chronicles is a must buy for anyone who likes their x-com or similar strategy games or if you are a fan of anime. The mix of the two whilst weird works suprisingly well. A lack of visiual upgrade and cringeworthy english voiceacting being the biggest downfalls of the game. However it is still an abosolute classic!9.5/10			"

As for the VO, the characters all feel really well fleshed out and relateable, as well as interesting. even the minor squad mates all feel like they have personality. The voice actors do a superb job in their roles and the dialogue is great, nothing feels lost in translation.15/10. Do yourself a favor. play this game. Its perfection is rivaled by very few.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is something I would definitely recommend even at full price especially for a tactical, turn-based RPG fan.Pros:Solid gameplay for the most part, requires some tactical thinking here and there, especially if you're aiming to get A ranks on missions, which seemed pretty challenging to me. Loving the idea of not having to ""grind"" levels on each character individually, which enables you to have a very flexible squad - you can select soldiers that would contribute the most with their abilities to a particular battle. Ability to buy upgrades and often choose different upgrade trees for your squad weapons also adds to it.Interesting story, taking a fairly unique approach to reinterpreting the WW2 theme. Lore is deep and as time goes by you uncover more and more bits of information about the game's world, characters, history. Makes the game quite immersive.Art style is pretty. 3D-rendered anime characters are beautiful and detailed. Environments could maybe use some more work at times and I'd personally appreciate if the game had some more contrasting color palletes.Music is gorgeous. Beautiful orchestral arrangements never feel out of place.Localization is pretty great. English voiced-over dialogues are enjoyable to listen to, most of the characters are voiced nicely with the exception of maybe one or two, that don't make their appearance all that often anyways. You can always switch to the original, Japanese audio if you so desire.Great PC port, although lacking mouse control in menus, the battles themselves are absolutely 100% playable with keyboard and mouse and for me, personally, it works even better than using a controller.Cons:I've only one major complaint about this game, and it surprises me how I don't see many people mentioning this. The AI can be VERY dodgy in this game at times. In some instances you can see enemy soldiers just move around through the entirety of their turn for no apparent reason at all and ending their turn in almost exactly the same spot where they began. Enemy tanks do the same sometimes, wasting Control Points (tanks spend more CP than foot soldiers) and sometimes ending up in a position where they expose their weakspots and are easy to one-shot. This breaks the immersion of the game for me.Aside from that, some people might be put off by the amount of cut-scenes and game's attempt to focus on both story and gameplay. I personally wasn't bothered by it at all, but thought it would be worth pointing out regardless.ConclusionAll in all, I've enjoyed and am still enjoying my time with this game a great deal. The dodgy AI can be annoying sometimes, but it doesn't really justify ignoring this game, so if you're into tactical, turn-based RPGs and/or are looking for an interesting, well thought-out story, I'd say totally give this one a twirl.

												Duration: 40 hours (main game without extras)Playing Valkyria Chronicles is like watching a Studio Ghibli TV series where in each episode there is a tactical battle that is played in FPS turn-based mode.  Without doing a full review the story was top notch and one of the best I've ever experienced in a video game.  The art style and animations were top quality and the voice acting was also pretty good.  Much of the game will be spent watching these cut scenes which explains the massive 26GB harddrive space needed. The tactical combat was fun and a wide variety of missions is thrown at the player.  The game starts off easy showing you the ropes before you put your team together Jagged Alliance style.  The characters have a wide variety of personalities and the game is not without humour.  For the actual combat you have a number of command points to move your characters and issue orders.  Once selected it turns into a First Person Perspective for movement.  Characters have a finite number of action points to spend moving and get one attack per activation anytime during their move.  The blend of FPS and turn-based tactical is unique and flows very well.  Defensive fire keeps the tension up.  In between battles there is the headquarters where you can assign experience to your classes, buy R&D, equip found weapons, and a number of other strategic tasks. There are also skirmish battles you can reply if you find your experience of money lacking. A few negatives keep this from becoming a 10.  First are the tank controls.  Moving the tank in FPS mode almost works but takes a while to get used to.  I spent a couple activations early on spastic-ing in place while trying to inch forward.  Sometimes the controls are hard to move forward just a little to repair sandbags or disarm mines. Another negative is the mid-game battle versus the giant tank which was almost depressing.  Aside from that though, the battles were great. It was almost information overload once the headquarters is introduced, although it doesn't take long to understand and get into it. All in all, the graphics, art style, story, squad-building tactical fun is like nothing I've ever played before.  After 40 hours I was sad to see the story end although it did so with Ghibli delight. Overall I have no difficulty recommending this game. 9/10.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles makes a great first impression. It looks gorgeous, has a stack of content and seems to have an interesting tale to tell. Unfortunately, the illusion crumbles over time, resulting in a thorougly disappointing experience.It is not a strategy game. It is a glorified puzzle game, and not a very good one at that. It's riddled with exploits, unbalanced mechanics and awful AI - the sort which will send infantry running head-first at your tank. There are some interesting ideas there, but it's just so poorly executed. The main strategy involved seems to be replaying missions over and over again to learn enemy positions and understand the often obtuse gimmicks and quirks - a railing which somehow absorbs all shots in chapter 10, for instance. It's a grind, and not an enjoyable or rewarding one. If the story was great it might be worthwhile, but despite some early promise it quickly descends into trite dialogue and grating anime tropes. The attempt at a serious story is undermined by the juvenile battlefield quips and the dissonant nature of the objectives - throw your people into risky situations to win as fast as possible. It's hard to get caught up in a dark tale of the horrors of war when you have soldiers who squeal ""Yay! Happy grass!"" at the sight of a meadow.After forming such a positive first impression, I found this game profoundly disappointing.			"

I love the graphic style.I love the episodic storytelling.I love the characters and their growth.I love the comedy & the drama.And most of all, I love the gameplay.This is one of the best turn-based games ever made, period. The story is a bit cliché but you can still enjoy it. For some the anime-style presentation can be a downside, but for them I can finally say GET OVER IT! If you can't play a game for that, then you're missing on one of the best tactical games ever made. Not to mention it's CHEAP. II can't think of a better deal.Yeah, it's cliché. Yes, it's anime. So what? I really don't have anything bad to say about this masterpiece. Just buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												There are some minor problems such as mouse not working on menus, but you will get used to using the keyboard to navigate the menus. The controls works in combat, which is where it matters. The soundtrack is great, the combat is fantastic, there is so much development and uniqueness on every character (you have dozens of soldiers to deploy, and every one is voice acted, has a background story, an unique personality, etc.) This is the best tactical RPG I ever played.

												Heyyo, VERY BIG RECOMMENDATION!!! This game has a fantastic art style, pays respects to civilians and soldiers who lost their lives in WWII and just shines in quality. WOW, SEGA! You've impressed me so much with this game! This is the SEGA I remembered as a KID! :)Square Enix should take some lessons from SEGA and Nihon Falcom (The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky) on how to port a console game to PC. This game runs FLAWLESSLY! There's no graphical settings, but the game engine seems to scale the texture, shadow and particle effects quality settings in respect to your game resolution which works quite well! I can run this game at 4K downsampled to 1080P and everything runs at 60fps!!! AWESOME!Now, I do want to give you folks a serious bit of advice... THERE'S NO AUTOSAVE! So save your game after each mission.. because this game isn't 100% stable when it comes to alt-tabbing.. I've had it crash on me twice... and had to redo some missions which was annoying because I was too stupid to manually save  after doing each mission haha... so you've been warned. :PThis game just RUNS so smooth! I can't get over that hahaha... there are only a few minor performance problems... two in fact. First? The title screen is locked at 30fps so it feels sluggish compared to any other part of the game, including the book mode menus which run at 60fps.... second? The cutscenes have no upscaling filters and are not 1080P quality.. they used I'm guessing the PS3 versions which are 720P which don't look as good as the rest of the game... but that's just two minor nit-picks that barely detract from this game.Now? Let's talk about the game... Valkyria Chronicles is based off of WWII in the country of Gallum... which I'm guessing is the Netherlands if you look at the game's map of Europa. Gallum is a neutral country that was forced into EWWII (Europa World War II) by the invading forces of East European Imperial Alliance (aka The Empire) for the precious resource of Ragnite (the game's equivalent of the real world's oil / fuel... or if you love Command & Conquer? Tiberium! w00t! loved old school CNC). The game follows a handful of protagonists and their allies, plus a few of what the game calls ""optional custscenes"" of antagonists... now, I must say.. optional cutscenes? I'll watch them anyways. I love a damn good storyline... but I know some people aren't as patient as me lol, so they'll enjoy the ability to skip optional cutscenes.The combat takes a bit to adjust to since it's very much an active-turn-based combat system... think of it as a kind of mix of Xcom (or Final Fantasy Tactics) with Syndicate (or regular Final Fantasy)... as you move your units around? Enemy troops will constantly shoot at you as you move around!! So keep an eye on your map, which direction they're pointed in and make your actions count! Once you're done shooting / healing / repairing / etc? Mash that ESC (or whatever gamepad button it is, haven't tried gamepad on this yet heh) button and END YOUR ACTION!! That? or quickly run your unit behind something to hide... because after you take an action? The enemy will start shooting you again. It takes a bit to wrap your head around when you're playing the game as I thought I was in the safe-zone.. and then bullets started flying again so I had to spring baction into action and try to end my actions before my poor unit lots all of their health due to my apathy haha... oops.Training your troops goes by classes which is a lot more forgiving than games like Xcom where you shouted at your PC... ""NOO!!! I just spent hours traning that guy just for him to get gutted!! Now I need to replace him with a greenhorn half ways through the game!? WEAAAAAKKK!!!"".. Nope! This game? You loose a Lancer? Dammit... but at least the next Lancer still has the same training level. It still does suck to lose soldeirs though, as they can have some really darn handy ""Personal Potentials"" and ""Battle Potentials""... which are kind of like the Perks from Fallout. They'll get advantages / disadvantages in combat depending on if they are near certain types of people (fellow Shocktroopers, tanks, males, dust, paved roads, etc) and have certain other soldiers they will ""Like"" which allows them to perform combination actions with them if they're near each other... so if you have a little squad of three that like each other? All three can potentially shoot their weapons together if one of them attacks / counter-attacks.Just... YEAH!!!! This combat system is so well thought out... well, everything about this game is well though out! It's a VERY VERY HIGH RECOMMENDATION! A special gem on the PS3 gets the special port to PC it deserves for a wider audience to enjoy. My hat off to thee SEGA for making this game and then giving it the care and attention it deserves for this port. :)			"

												Imagine you have a copy of Fire Emblem.Replace the weapons with firearms.Improve the turn taking system.Improve character movement.Add more terrain features.Add unique background stories on every character.This is a phenomenal game that I have no regrets buying at all. My only complaints are the menu and controls due it being a game ported over from the Playstation Portable (PSP) console, but once you get used to the controls, this game is absolutely delightful.

												Normally, jRPGs are played for its story telling: you just keep going (through countless, sometimes stressful, enemy battles) just so you can know what happens in the end, because simply most of them are very well written. On Valkyria Chronicles’ case, however, I’d say it is the opposite: the gameplay is what the game has of appeal while its story, although not bad by any means, is pretty predictable and straight forward. It’s more of a game to have fun rather than to get a master piece of a story.StoryIt’s decent, but follows an anime-esque order of events which makes it feel a little generic: boy finds girl, both fight against an evil dude who wants to conquer the world, boy and girl realize they are in love with each other, boy, girl and a squad of around 8 more people defeat armies seventeen times larger because “friendship and love are stronger than anything else”. That’s pretty much it. You know how the game ends pretty much 3 hours in, maybe even less, depending on how used you are to this kind of story. The game, however, still has some really nice cut scenes now and then, which are pretty well done and cool.The characters are OK, and you end up liking the main ones: they all have their own personalities and they are not (well, not most of them) bland. One thing that I thought was poorly executed, however, is that pretty much only five characters from your squad legitimately participate on the story, while the others that you choose to make part of your army just take part on the missions and that’s it. The game gave each one of them a biography, an unique personality and people they like/dislike, but they’ll never have dialogues or interactions with other characters (as in, by their biographies, Ted and Marina seem to have a hilarious relationship, but you can’t really see anything about it anywhere). I feel like making something like Fire Emblem, where you can develop relationships between characters on missions if they keep fighting together, and thus being able to see cut scenes of  them interacting with each other would be something really great for this game.GameplayThat’s where the game shines. Around the lines of XCOM, Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based shooting game with all the RPG elements it should have, using equips, status and aiming to decide how much damage each attack does.  The missions and their objectives are very creative, and it’s really rare to have ones which you just have to “capture the enemy’s base”, or “kill all enemies”. Although the early game is fine, things really get good on late game, where you can’t just rush the enemy thinking there’s nothing to lose: some of the ending missions require the player to elaborate their own strategies to succeed (otherwise, you’re plain dead), and when they actually work, it feels really rewarding, especially when you’re aiming for a mission rank A. The leveling system on the game works in a way that you actually level up the classes, and not the characters: this way, all the characters of that specific class will be the same level, making it pretty much impossible to grind just one character to beast-levels and soloing the whole game with him, like many other jRPGs . All five classes are well designed and balanced, and you need to use all of them throughout the game.It has its flaws, however: I felt like the aiming of the characters is just way too awful, to levels that really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. On late missions, where missing a shot sometimes is really not an option, seeing your character failing an almost point-blank shot by a lot is not really nice, and may lose you the whole mission. The aiming gets better as the game continues, yes, but they sometimes still miss ridiculously easy shots…just because. By the way, it’s so bad early game, that I didn’t even bother using snipers until chapter 10+ (which is way after middle game). They just couldn’t hit anything at all.Another thing is that controlling tanks was TERRIBLE. I played the game with keyboard+mouse, and while WASD controlled the direction of the tank, so did the mouse…and, since you need the mouse to change the camera to know where you’re going , and the keyboard to actually move forward or backwards, you need to use both at the same time, and boy, does that confuse the game. The tank sometimes goes the complete opposite direction you wanted it to go, wasting a lot of precious Action Points for nothing.Final Score: 8/10Overall, a very nice game, with really fun and challenging missions.  My biggest issue was indeed with the story, as it felt like the writers didn’t really want to risk doing something out of the box and just went on with what normally sells. If you think Naruto has a great story, however, for you I’d give the game a 9/10, as you’d be able to enjoy it as whole much more.			"

												""YES"" if you are not so serious in strategic aspects or just wanna enjoy storiez.""NO"" if you want to have serious strategy game and expect this to be anime XCOM.The good and the worst+ Interesting dramatic story.+ Customizable rooster and (some) equipments.- I was expecting a good strategy game but you got war puzzle game instead. Game encourages you to rush instead of quality play.How strategic aspects was bad:- If you attempt to play ""flawless"" game (as in XCOM standard), kills all enemies while taking least damage, you thought you are cool! The game tells you, TOO BAD, C or D for you, with huge decrease in reward.- To get A, you spam scout's turn, ignore 80% of enemies in the map, rush to the flag as if scout was on steriods, your main force done nothing - just here to sightseeing, now you got A and 3 times the reward! Cool! What's the point of main force, other classes?- The reward system implies you to play this way, else you will have to grind from other skermish map. If the grade had no impact or only a little impact on reward, I would not criticize this point.- Cover/bunker system is broken, flanking enemy crouching behind his bunker does nothing, you still attack with reduced damage!- The game almost force you to deploy main characters everytime, because if you dont deploy these guys, you dont get extra CP and will be at disadvantage, resulting in lower grade.Although I was fustrated on its gameplay but somehow enjoyed the game in overall. I was fan for both JP games and XCOM. Barely thumb up for this.			"

												As someone who doesn't like JRPGs, I absolutely love this game. It's pretty much Xcom, but with a third person shooter mechanic and Nazis. Combat is surprisingly in-depth and can lead to some intense moments in-game. The story itself is pretty good, being about 2 young adults commanding a platoon( I refuse to call them a squad. It has 20 people in it for god's sake) while going through the horrors of war. Despite its fantasy elements, it quite down to Earth in it's portrayal, filled with tearjerkers and heartwarming moments. I also really liked the characters, finding myself becoming really attached to them as the game progresses. My personal favorites are Jane the sadistic psychopath and Jann the token gay guy(voiced by Bender btw).Soundtrack is also pretty good. Same with the voice acting, though there is Japanese for the weebs out there. As for performance, I managed to run it a constant 60 fps on a cpu that has frame dips on Half Life 2. You won't need to worry about your potato running it.Overall, pretty good game(except for Chapter 7. That chapter deserves 7 shocktroopers scorching it with their flamethrowers) and one I highly recommend for those that enjoy turn base strategy.			"

												One of my all time favorite games for the PS3 now ported over so I can play it on my PC. If you've already beaten the game on the PS3, then I suppose you wouldn't need to buy this game again; however, for those who have yet to play this game I highly recommend it.I recommend you play this game with a controller by the way.Now onto the actual game review. The game is a semi-turn based strategy RPG. I say semi-turn based because enemy units can shoot at you while you move during your turn and vice versa. It's a fairly simple to learn game and infuriating at the same time due to the random trajectory of your bullets, but overall the game is incredibly fun. Highly recommended for those who enjoy strategy game with elements of action/shooting.P.S. It has dual audio if that's important in your decision making. Just a side thought.			"

												This is the overall best game SEGA has made since giving up hardware in 2001. Unfortunately, when it originally released on the PS3, it came out at the absolute worst time. It was a time where JRPG's like this were being looked down on, the PS3 itself was not doing well thanks to the high price and 360's headstart, aand SEGA themselves really didn't do much marketing for the game regardless. So it wasn't the smash hit it should have been.Hopefully now that its on Steam, more people will discover this awesome game. And this is the best version of the game, as well.			"

The port is perfect with no resolution restrictions, no fps restrictions, full mouse support. You can go crazy and even down-sample the game form 4K or 8K if you have a crazy setup. It's hilarious that the game on the PC looks way ♥♥♥♥ing better then the per-rendered cut scenes in the game!Why SEGA would see how popular the franchise is and make a PS4/Xbone/PC Valkyria Chronicles 4 or something!

												Just a thoroughly enjoyable, absorbing, brilliant game that will suck you in and eat up days of your life. I genuinely had to get everything that I wanted to do in a day done before I booted this up, because I knew once I did I wouldn't be moving for 8 hours.  It's very rare that I find a game that I just want to play for hour after hour, day after day, and when I'm not playing it I'm just looking forward to getting back into it. Starcraft, Rome Total war, XCom EU are on that list, and now VC joins them.VC is 50% Visual Novel and 50% ""TBS-with-a-twist"" first time through, and you should only consider it if you like BOTH types of game. (After the first run through you'll not bother with the story and jump straight into missions, but doing that first time round totally defeats the object of the game). The game is broken down into chapters, and each chapter tends to have about 5 or 6 story segments and one big fight. If you're just after combat and action, you'll be frustrated. Having said that, I don't usually play VNs, but the story in VC is so engaging and the characters so likeable you'll get totally wrapped up in the epic storyline. Alternate-Europe gets swept up into war, local people become war heroes, concentration camps are liberated, characters you get to care about fall in love or suddenly die. Magic happens. Giant, battleship-sized tanks explode.I say TBS-with-a-twist because VC uses a mechanic I've not come across before. It IS turn-based, but the defenders can still react. As an example, if your active character runs 50 metres, hunkers down in cover and lobs a grenade at an enemy 20 metres away with his back to you, it's all good. If you start your turn and decide to run face-first into an enemy with a heavy machine gun pointed at you, he'll mow you down. I'm used to TBS games where I can simply saunter up to an enemy and stand one hex in front of him while he's miraculously frozen in time doing nothing, so VC's system is certainly more realistic. It's better than XCom's Overwatch option too, as that's just a one-free-shot deal, whereas one defender could happily mow down your entire squad on your turn if you decide to be an idiot.You can see the artstyle from the screenshots. Some people may prefer cutting-edge, ultra-realistic 3D graphics and won't like this, but personally I absolutely loved it. If you're a fan of Japanese animation, Studio Ghibli-type artwork it's a real treat.There are a couple of minor flaws. First up, like many people I messed up with the confusing save system. As others have commented, it's easy to think there's only one save slot because scrolling on the save screen is not at all obvious. Unlike a lot of games that track your campaign progress and keep a record of the fact that, for example, you've completed 12 out of 18 chapters, each save is COMPLETELY independent in VC, so if you mess up and save a new game where you're on the first mission over your save file where you're at the final mission, it's all permanently gone. This wouldn't be an issue if the possibility of multiple saves was more obvious, but if you're pre-warned it's no biggie. I managed this because I'd got to the final mission but was getting pooned because my squad was under-powered, so I  was doing an optional side-mission, which was very long and in multiple parts, to get more xp. I had to call it quits for the night so I saved halfway through. The next day I was horrified to realise that this side-mission was now literally my only save, and when I wanted to switch back to the main campaign I had to start at the very first mission again. I hope that makes sense - in a nutshell, be aware of the possibility of multiple saves and use many of them to be safe!Here's the interesting point though. With most games, if you play 40 or 50 hours and then by being a total tard you lose ALL your progress, you'd usually (1) scream yourself hoarse (2) put your fist through your monitor (3) put a jihad out on the feckin developers and (4) delete the game in a ragequit and swear never to play it, or anything by the developer, ever again. In my case, after only a minute of kicking myself, I realised that this meant I would have to start the campaign all over again, AND THIS WAS A GOOD THING BECAUSE THIS TIME I COULD DO IT BETTER! Remember I said I was getting pooned in the final fight because my squad was under-powered? The xp you get to upgrade your units is based on how well you complete each mission. Since I was scraping crappy wins with a C or D rating most of the time, and not doing side-missions, my xp had been limited and my squad were all about level 11 or 12. When I re-started, I was getting A or B ratings and playing all side-missions, so when I got to the final fight they were around level 17 or 18 and had a much easier time.Well, if you're still reading, you must genuinely be thinking about trying VC, in which case the advice is simple: do it, you'll love it!

												What happens when you combine the RPG elements of a turn-based strategy game with the action of a 3rd person shooter? A completely new genre and, hopefully, the future of tactical role-playing games. Valkyria Chronicles (as far as I know) is the first game to ever try this formula and thankfully, it was done right.I really like this game and have tons of reasons of why you should buy it to back it up but before that let's get my main issues with the game out of the way. The ranking system doesn't take in account if you killed enemies or if you allowed any of your units to fall in battle, the ranking system ONLY takes into account how many turns you took to finish a mission which leads me to another problem, Scouts. They usually are your main units because you don't really need any other units! Why would you spend your time moving around all the other classes if you can just combine orders and scouts so they can basically do all the jobs of all the other classes? You can still achieve As without the so called ""scout runs"" but still... it seems a little broken (Thankfully I was able to avoid this by only trying to use 2 scouts per mission and little to no orders which made the game more fun and challenging).*You can still use scout runs to farm money and exp in the skirmishes but that's alright-STORYIn the year 1935, a huge war (EW2) takes place in the continent of Europa. The Empire tries to take on the continent in an effort to get more Ragnite for their country (basically a mineral which is used for EVERYTHING) but the Federation fights back. In the middle of both countries is located a thrid neutral country, Gallia. When the Empire decides to attack Gallia, the story of how a small country can beat a super-power begins...You play as Welking Gunther, the son of the hero of the EW1, as he guides Squad 7 in an attempt to push the Imperials out of Gallia. In your journey you're accompanied by fellow aspiring baker Alicia Melchiott, former bar singer Brigitte ""Rosie"" Stark, veggie maniac Largo Potter, genius engineering prodigy (not to mention your sister) Isara Gunther, and a bunch of other colorful characters that make up your squad.The characters are all unique and feel different (with some cliches here and there), the plot is enough to keep you entertained but doesn't really stand out, the game deals with theme like racism and life admist war, but what really makes all of this great is the way the story is told.-GAMEPLAYAt first, the game looks like your typical strategy game (Fire Emblem, Advanced Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc...) you're showned a map where you have certain objectives and you can see the location of your units and SOME of your enemies. Once you choose which unit to use with your ""CP"" or Command Points is when the real fun takes place. You are suddenly thrown into a third person perspective of the unit you chose where you're allowed to move around, crouch and take cover, attack enemy units, heal yourself or your teammates, save downed units, etc... How much you can do depends on how you spend your ""AP"" or Action Points which is represented by a gauge which deplets as you move. Aside from keeping watch of your AP, you also have to watch out for enemy fire which will go for as long as you are in third person perspective. Finally each unit is different depending on which class you are (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, or Sniper) and to further differ each unit from one another each character has their own Potentials which trigger based  on different criteria during the battle. I know it sounds REALLY complicated but to sum it up, the game is fun, unique and not really that hard to catch on once you get used to it.-SOUNDThe soundtrack is great and always manages to fit the mood. The game is has full voice-acting for each and every character and really DO give a personality to each squad member or enemy. A MAJOR + is the inclusion of both Japanese and English voice acting but as far as I know, this game has GOOD english voice acting unlike most JRPGs or Japanese games in genral.-GRAPHICS & PRESENTATIONGraphics are BEAUTIFUL and look rather unique with its oil-painting, anime like look. The game's hub world (if it can be called that) is divided in a story/picture book menu which divides the game in different sections and menus which, again, is really unique and looks nice.In conclusion, BUY THIS GAME!!! Even at the full price of $20 this game is absolutely worth it!!! The game offers 60+ in the normal campaign, not to mention this version includes all 4 previously released DLCs. It has the option for a new game + and also every mission you're given a score based on performance, so you can replay missions and aim for the A rank in all 4 difficulties if that's your thing. Basically, it's cheap, unique, fun, engaging and has tons of replayability :) Oh and I almost forgot, this game freaking has VYSE, AIKA, and FINA from SKIES OF ARCADIA!!!!! That already makes it a must buy for everyone on Steam :O*On a side note, I did encountered some problems:-The game ocasionally crashed (recurring examples include: after the first time you visit the Headquarters, and after the results screen in both missions of Chapter 5: The Kloden Wildwood and Report 6: What Lies Beyond Hate) I have heard this happened to many others too, hope it gets fixed.-Characters suddenly glitching out of the map.

												Six years after its original release, SEGA brings Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and it's a surprising decent port. It allows arbitrary resolutions and framerates. While there is no mouse support in menus, the actual gameplay has decent mouse control. Graphically, it scales well with better hardware and runs well, although sadly all the cutscenes are the original PS3 prerendered quality. Thankfully the artstyle helps it age more gracefully than some other games. Save and Load times are vastly improved over the console version.As for the game itself, Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based strategy RPG. However, when you control characters the game moves in real time, with the exception of aiming. The maps in Valkyria Chronicles are not grid based, which allows the player a greater range of freedom compared to other SRPGs. Shooting is determined by line of sight (except for grenades etc), although RNG determines if you hit or not. This system works well, although sometimes the AI leaves something to be desired.The gameplay sets the foundation for an excellent story, a beautiful aesthetic, and a good soundtrack. I wholeheartly recommend Valkyria Chronicles.			"

												TL Won't Read: 9/10. Good story/them historical references/weapons. In-depth n' stuff. Slow but tactical gameplay. RNG trolls hard. Buy it now pls. This game is actually surprisingly in depth. It seemed very linear with a campaign-only visual novel esque style, but without the romance. Well it turns out I couldn't have been more off.Instead what I paid for was an extensive Semi-RPG/Strategy game with an enjoyable campaign and combat flexibility. Upgrades, passives, special abilities, weapons, etc (And some romance... god damnit). The gameplay is very smooth and easy to get into due to simple controls and mechanics. For you die-hard strategists out there, the game is easy to learn, but hard to master. It's welcoming to non-strategy players who just want to play through the story. At the same time, it can be extremely hard to plan and reach for utmost efficiency for the highest rank. The skirmish option allows you to replay levels for those extra hardcore perfect-run gamers seeking to get the spotless win (Me being one of them). You can even change the voices to Japanese if you're tired of hearing horribly awkward English voice acting!It's hard not to like this game even if you don't particularly go for WWII based games. The story/concept is appealing for the average player. World War history buffs will drool over the historical references and weapons. My favorite of course being the Lancaar Anti-Tank-Gun-Thing that reminds me of the Panzer Faust. Albiet the gameplay can seem slow paced at time, it makes you stop and think rather than going Leroy Jenkins all over the enemy. Furthermore, each of the characters' unique personalities makes it easy to get attached to them, and hard to simply have them charge like a pawn. There are no ""choose your lifelong partner"" options or super complex MMORPG skill trees. If you're looking for something ridiculously open-world and free then move along. Additionally the RNG can get a bit frustrating. Such as having your favorite stormtrooper sniped across the map by a tank... twice. I've had one or two hair-ripping, vein-popping, desk-flipping moments where seemingly easy shots will fly right over targets. Occasionally the the tanks you control spazz out and turn in wrong directions, or your soldiers will fire their entire clip into the ground because ""F*** You"" that's why. There's even some racism against the fictional race of dark-sins... darksens... darxsens... darcsens? It starts with a D or something. Oh and some characters get a power buff just by getting turned on... Just don't ask.Regardless of the small peeves, this game is definitely worth the money and the time.			"

												From what I've played so far this game is not only a seriously good port, it makes me regret not buying a ps3 to play the game when it first came out. Valkyria Chronicles combines good animation with an interesting plot, driven by a psudo WW2 setting and complimented by interesting and diverse characters with personalities which crosover into the awesome xcom-like gameplay. Jump to the last 2 paragraphs for Summary.After the first 3 chapters you are given control of a squad of 20 people which you can pick from the starting recruit roster of at least 30. Each recruit has different things that they like and dislike which act as potential modifies to that recuits ability on the field. 'Alex' might fancy women, for example, meaning when he is in close proximity to women he has the potential to have an accuracy boost as he want to impress the ladies. There are many others such as ""pollen allegies"" which has the potential to distract the person when they are located near flora or on meadows leading to a reducution in accuracy. This little intricacy adds so much to the gameplay all the while surreptitious causing the player to form connections to each member of your squad as you begin to remember that ""Alex"" while he fancies women is also big on camaraderie so being close to multiple members of your squad could potentially increase his effictiveness in battle. Battles are acomplished in turn baseed manner, facilitated through the use of Command Points (CP) and Action Points (AP). Command Points are actions spent by the Commander (The player) to move troops and issue orders. Each troop can be activated through one or more CP. Once activated you are then given control of that recruit and can expend AP to move acround the battlefield. You can also choose at any time to perofrm a specific action whether it be shoot the enemy, throw a grenade at the enemy or heal yourself. This can be done withour completely expending your AP allowing you move to a position where your attack is potentially optimal and then retreat to cover to defend against attacks on the enemies turn.In between mission you can upgrade your squad's equipment through expending points on armour and weapons while also improving the abilities of each class through spending earned experienced in the training area. The whole headquaters area reminds me once again of X-com as you have you barracks where you can look at detailed information on your men, the Research and Development tab where you can purchase equipment upgrades as they are unlocked through the story mode and the commmand tab where you can remove and add different members to your squad. To summarise, if you like the gameplay of X-com, a low fantasy/alternative WW2 setting, and anime style animation then this is the game of your dreams. For $20 you get a game with an awesome setting backed up by solid gameplay mechanics which are easy to learn and control due to excellent Mouse & Keyboard functionality. Also the performance on my rig was excellent as well the a solid 60fps@1080p in all gameplay circumstances. I did notice some micro fram stutter in the cutscenes, however it is not enough to detract from the overall experience.Main Rig Specs:cpu: AMD fx8350gpu: Gigabyte gtx 980Monitor: Benq 60fps 1080p			"

												This game is much better than I thought it would be. The Turn-Based strategy mixed with real-time 3rd person combat is pretty well done, much better than I imagined it.The map is populated with enemy units, with your own placed prior to the mission at specific control points. You have a variety of soldiers to build your own squad with, including Snipers, Heavies, Troopers, Scouts, and Anti-Tank units. Each individual soldier have several individual traits and personalities that make them unique and suited to different environments and situations, making pre-planning worth while. Knowing your soldiers strengths, weaknesses, personality, etc., even down to who they work best with and who they don't. Mix in equipment and upgrades, not to mention a customizable tank, and this game doesn't fall short on the prep. It's simple enough for the less forward thinkers to jump in to battle, but a good strategist makes the difference (and yes, permadeath exists).Once the battle starts, the fighting takes place in turns. You have a certain amount of command points, which you need to move your units. You spen command points to select units to move from an overhead map, then move them from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective. Each unit has a stamina bar, which determines how much you can move the unit around. When you aim, you're stuck in place Resident Evil style, allowing you to take your shot. Your unit shoots, then your opponent shoots in turns. You have a choice of weapons and tools, which vary based on what unit you've selected. You've got some support squadmates, like an Engineer, who disables mines and repair the tank, and some support tools, which includes a healing item and ammo packs. As stated above, some individuals have unique skills, which can affect the battle in a lot of ways, such as a unit with the Tank Killer trait do more damage to tanks, misandrist characters won't work well with male sqaud mates, and so much more. As the commander, you can issue orders, such as a retreat, heal, damage boost, accuracy boosts, morter support, etc. There's a lot to do and take in, but the game's difficulty curve does a good job of introducing all this stuff to you slowly and thoughoughly. Once that's done, a story happens, and it's a great story. You can press A or Space to continue the story. There's main missions, side missions, challenges, and so much more.			"

												8.5/10genre : turn based/tactical game with rpg elements+ beautiful graphics, although i don't like anime art in games, in this game combined with the beautifully drawn environments the result is great+ epic storyline, hours of cutscenes that not only explain the story but enrich the character portraits - fictional world war setting with many twists and emotional moments+ unique blend of turn based and real time strategy - tons of upgrades - leveling up really matters and gives great advantage - lots of side missions and skirmishes that you should play in order to earn xp and upgrade more - very challenging battles from the beginning, nothing is random , you get rewarded for playing wisely+ excellent port, controls with m/k with no issues+ addictive and long game with replayability- well no big flaws in the game, what i found more annoying was some presentation issues in the sense that i find it weird to have in my team a 12 year old girl as a scout or a 35 year old man presented as a fully experienced old soldier lol (same issue i have with jrpgs, that makes me loose immersion)- too many cutscenes but fortunately most of them are short and to the pointreally great game, i could say epic since the story is epic itself, surprisingly good gameplayrecommended not only to fans of tactical gameplay but all those who like a challenging game with a very rich story			"

As far as strategy games go, it's a neat mix of turn based and real time systems, albiet with minor annoyances here and there.

												Valkyria Chronicles is a gorgeous, unique hybrid of turn-based tactics and real-time action that doesn't live up to its full potential, but it's still well worth your time if you're interested in games like XCOM or Nintendo's Fire Emblem series. Initially released on the PS3, the game's excellent hand-drawn storybook visuals have aged remarkably well. The story is full of Japanese RPG cliches, but it's still engaging, particularly its stark depiction of war (based on World War II). The game plays pretty well, and the transition from turn-based to real-time is as smooth as it could be. The unique hybrid nature introduces a few wrinkles that take a while to get used to, like needing to hurry to end a turn because enemies will continue to fire. The biggest issue is that there are too many missions that don't play to the game's strengths. These missions rely more on trial and error, and they can lead to some frustration if you're not sure what you're supposed to be doing. At its best, Valkyria Chronicles offers exciting and approachable squad-based tactics full of colorful characters with distinct personalities. If you're willing to overlook some difficulty spikes and the occasional frustrating mission, it's one of the best games of its kind on Steam.			"

												I played half of the game on my PS3 and I fell in love with it. When it came out on Steam, I bought it the very first time it went on sale (although the game is more than worth its full price) There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'll just keep it short.The good: Great visuals. Everything is rendered to look like a watercolor painting. It truly blends the anime art style with 3D environment.  Engaging storyline. It is rather simple and somewhat predictable, but it's well written enough to keep you wanting to progress through the game. Well developed characters. All main characters have a unique backstory, and they actually affect the skills of the characters (called 'Potentials' in the game) Exceptional fun combat. It really requires you to think about the moves that you're making. Every choice you make is crucial, from which unit to deploy first, to which direction your unit should face after their turn. It's a fair system, if you fail, it's only because you did something wrong. Each battle is rather long and failing it can mean restarting all over if you didn't save or you initial setup is wrong. But it never feel like a chore to retry a battle. Some people have complained that the pre-rendered cutscenes look outdated because they're rendered in 720p. I can barely tell the difference, and that's saying something since I play all my games at max and 60fps. I suppose the difference is unnoticeable because of the anime-like art style.  Full controller support. I actually played this using the PS3 controller and MotioninJoy DS3 toolThe bad: Occasionally, I experienced lag. It would usually last 1 turn, and would return to normal once you go from unit view to command view. It is quite infrequent and not a major problem.So, if you're a fan of RPG, especially JRPG, this is a must have.			"

												As someone who hasn't played this on a console and who pretty much impulse bought it, I was not only plesantly surprised, but very much have enjoyed playing it. A wonderful game all in all. I could only tell it was a console port thanks to its somewhat strange controls. The characters are enjoyable, developed to a good degree, the combat, while a little annoying with RNG is compensated by the ability to save during combat so if you really are driven you can taken down the target you keep missing by just continually rolling the save. It has a light difficulty curve and shouldn't be too hard as a new game to pick up if you like a plesant mix of Turn-Based Strategy and Real Time with a healthy dose of a RPG. I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a solid, rather novel game.			"

												You don't know the meaning of under appreciated until you've played Valkyria Chronicles. Without a doubt, I can say this is my all time favorite strategy and PS3 game. It has a beautiful soundtrack along with amazing graphics. The game also comes with a colorful cast of characters and is very story oriented. Now, if you don't enjoy cut scenes . . . chances are you will still love this game. Although you may find yourself sitting through cut scene after cut scene, each help develop the story and truly tell you just what type of game the creators were trying to make. I'm also a bit disappointed on the game's length, but that's probably because of this games uniqueness that isn't offered anywhere else.I will also mention that this game does indeed have two sequels. Unfortunately, both were released on the PSP, so don't expect a PC port. Plus, only the second Valkyria Chronicle is available in English. On the bright side, there is a fan made English patch available online for those of you interested.To sum up my lengthy review: BUY THIS GAME! BUY IT NOW! PLEASE SUPPORT THE MOST UNDER APPRECIATED GAME IN HISTORY!			"

												Its not like I wanted this or anything SEGA. Its about time, stupid idiot company. Hmph. Seriously though it looks like a solid port in terms of technical standards, its Valkyria as you know and love it if you are a fan of the series.If you are new to the franchise then sure take a look at this simply because its a grossly overlooked game due to its presentation. For an animated game the art style is beautiful, beyond that of any animated game I have ever played. The story is surprisingly deep as well and handles many facets of wartime life and experience.I will say I had issues when running 16:10 with letterboxing, but using an external tool has sorted that out. Edit: Sound issues have been fixed with a patch within hours of release, what a lovely job SEGA are doing with supporting this game. Though if you are still having trouble, try switching speakers to 5.1 mode and disabling all but the ones you have, sound should work perfectly then.Hans/10			"

												Boy, what a ride this game was. Captivated from start to finish, on the edge of my seat to see what happens next. I, personally, am not really big on the anime style and was kind of hesitant when i got this game from a bundle. I gave it a chance because of it's good reviews and I don't regret it a single bit.The gameplay was amazing. It was different, in fact I've never played anything like it. It was refreshing. It gave a good mix of strategy but also gave you some control on how you moved your units and where to shoot with them. Sure there were some parts where controlling a unit was iffy around some spots, but it wasnt gamebreaking or aggravating. In general I was surprised but content with the new approach.Story wise I have absolutely nothing to say against it. Everything was nicely layed out. The story wasnt stretched into a boring drag and it also wasn't too short. The details to the story were well presented and everything was pretty clear. Some parts even managed to bring a tear to my eye. The ""Story Rich"" tag on the game store really represents it well.Overall I think I would give it a solid 9/10. Definitely would recommend it to friends.			"

Display options aren't quite as robust as some would hope, but the major boxes like hi-res support, rebindable keys and 60+ fps have all been ticked.  Throw in achievements, trading cards and all the DLC included at no extra cost, and you've got a port that is absolutely worth supporting.Attention Japanese devs/publishers trying to gain a foothold on Steam: THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE.

Neutral:It´s Clearly a Copy paste with few improvements from the PS3 version.Keyboard and mouse works but you can´t navigate the menu with the mouse, at lest you can aim with it.You cant change the the settings ingame, you have to do it before starting the game.I do recommend a controller for this one, but if you dont have one its Prefectly fine with KB+M just make sure you go trough the control settings before you start playing the game.If you don't like the default settings, as stated above, you can Change them thankfully!A Clear 9/10 in my book and i only hope they will give it some tweaks down the line :)Thanks ...whoever ported the game!

												Of all of the turn based RPG's I have played over the years, this has got to be one of the most enjoyable games I have touched. Immediately up there with FF7, Chrono Trigger, and Legend of Dragoon. The tactics are XCOM like in a way that totally fits, and the story is amazing to the point that I desperately hinged on every word from every character. Yes...EVERY character is voiced, and voiced EXTREMELY well. The picture chats keep the game from getting bogged down in cinematics, and the overall flow is very smooth. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone with a penchant for TBS games. And if you into story-based games. I played a very casual playthrough, going through everything I could...and JUST finished the game at something near 28 hours played. TOTALLY worth the $20 USD I spent on it.So good I am going for a full round two, got to get top ranks on every mission in this game, its that good.			"

												I was sold on the game Valkyria Chronicles because it was supposed to have good strategy in a turn based format, and it was supposed to be frank about the horrors of war in an alternate universe mash-up of the two World Wars. This is what I had read about in reviews, and my mouth watered with anticipation of seeing this handled with the flair of an anime.The StoryThis didn't feel like a game about war or about the military. There is an analogue to the Holocaust when the evil army burns down a building full of Darcsens (a race of black haired people). All the death happens off-screen, and the Darcsens in your squad (including one who had been living with them for a few months) effectively react with, ""Oh well, such is life."" No one ever mentions this again.Of course, at another point the whole squad gets two weeks of leave because a named character dies. Everyone just decided to put the war on hold, I guess.Also, the problem with the Valkyria. The game starts out being mostly grounded in the idea of warfare against enemy soldiers, tanks etc. But about half way through the game it throws that idea out the window and it ends up about these characters with superpowers, supertanks, and other absurd ideas that ruin the tactical grounding it established in the beginning.The TacticsWhile the game is tactical, in a sense, often it boils down to rushing the enemy and shooting them in the face at close range to kill them before they can counterattack. The same tactic works for tanks which can be insta-killed if you strike their weak point. This feels like a poor replication of the battlefield.The Command Point system is open to exploitation. There are many times I've spent almost an entire turn's worth of command points on a single unit who would single-handedly mow down the majority of the enemy. If the AI exploited this system as badly as I could, we wouldn't stand a chance.The combination of these two factors make the victories feel rather hollow, as I never really felt the illusion of feeling like I was playing against an intelligent opponent.The biggest tactical challenge you have in this game is enemies who spawn suddenly without warning in a location that is not an established spawn point. You can position a soldier in a great tactical position only to have a swarm of enemies spawn on top of him and kill him before you have a chance to react. The battles become less about genuine tactics and more about replaying the battles in order to anticipate these spontaneous events.			"

												Man, talk about a hidden gem! I had never heard of this game before I saw it on Steam for %75 percent off during a Sega sale promotion. I was browsing through what games were available and, unfortunately for Sega, reviews on most of the offerings were unfavorable. But Valkyria Chronicles stood out with overwhelmingly positive reviews, and I can say now that I've reached the end of the game that every positive review it received was well deserved. Without giving anything away, it has a complex but not overwhelming battle system that is part turn-based strategy, part third person shooter, which remains enjoyable and challenging until the very last battle. The story is touching and keeps you guessing throughout each chapter. Simply put I've never played a game like this; with all the COD clones and sequels nowadays its really refreshing to see something so original in both gameplay and story line. The only unfortunate fact is that more people don't know about this great offering from Sega.			"

												This is by far one of the best stories and games I have had the privileged of playing. Highly recommended for strategy, shooter and story driven players. Turn based system. Upgrades and leveling classes. New equipment. Modifying tank load outs. Choosing a specific team for each battle based on each characters strengths and weaknesses. The amazing engine that brings the beautiful art style to life. A story that will make you feel the whole spectrum of emotions as you progress through and care about each character. This game is worth every cent. This is now in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Any game that can bring on the tears is definitely a winner.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a heartwarming story about the struggle of a once nuetral nation that has been stuck between the buttcheeks of 2 huge military powers fighting over a mineral. You play as Welkin, the 22 year old son of a legendary war hero, along with his Sister (Isara) and his hot grill (Alicia). This game so far (for i've not completed it yet) is a challenging tactical war game that gets hard pretty fast. Don't let the Anime part turn you away, there are no ""Waifus"" or ""Senpais"" in this brilliant game.Pros:- Strong Main Characters- Each foot soldier has their own personalities and traits- Excellent voice acting- Intense Battles- Customizable squadCons:- Some awkward pauses between lines- Lots of excessive actions such as emotional hand clutches and awkward eye contact (But that's just the anime coming out)- Pretty awful tank controls (Use the mouse to turn, not A or D)- The ♥♥♥♥ing engineer at home base that only calls you by ""Bro"" or ""Dude""8.8/10 Would put a fat emo kid named Kevin on my squad again			"

												Just completed this game and I will have to play though New Game+ to get all the achievement.Overall this is a very interesting and different game then most Turn based Strategy game.Every time you issue a unit to move and fight all enemy within range of that character will interception fire and act like actual Time based which force you to act quickly and decisively. I know this game has been out for a while but the because the unique type of pencil drawn graphics it doesn't look old at all and seems very refreshing.The actual game difficulty is real hard. I spent quite a few hours at the very beginning to train all my troops type to level 15 and most mission still seems very hard. I usually start the mission play it get a rank B or C then load a save game then read online guide and with some Save/Load Power to finally get an A.The music of this game is actually really good. Once you complete the game once there will be a music section for you to enjoy all the music in game. I actually had ""Play all"" option on and reading a book for a while and it's quite enjoyable.The achievements for this game is really straight forward but it does take 2 full play though to get them all. The length of this game is quite long. Animation and story does take a long time to go though and it's pretty interesting and sad at times. Overall 8.5/10 would be my rating.			"

												Gonna let y'all know first thing, I bought this on playstation back when it came out because it was cheap, I was into WW2, and I liked the boxart. This somehow became one of my favorite games of all time.I'd played this game for years and the revival on steam was a huge deal for me being away from home so often. It's a very unique title, with a great artistic feel and a storyline I thoroughly enjoyed. They weren't afraid to push some boundaries with the story, taking a look into basically the holocaust and concentration camps. Something about the characters, the way their stories flesh out the more you use them really impressed me. I would go back for a second playthrough and realize half of my ""Squad"" had about two sentences in their biographies and would decide to make up a new ""misfit"" squad of characters I've never used. The story just captivated me and I fell in love with the characters and universe of it. Replayability isn't the highest but SP-Campaigns or whatever it's called going back through the story with all the tech you've already found is a lot of fun. I love the tactical/strategic genre and while it is a PC port with some interesting controls it wasn't that hard to adjust to. The game for the most part struck me as an artistic experience. Kinda like Shadow of The Collosus way back in the day. A gorgeous soundtrack, a unique art style, just a different kind of game. Maybe not a AAA title but to be honest I'm getting sick of those. Here's hoping this re-release is the spur needed to get the sequels here in the West! Assuming SEGA can un-screw itself with that PSP business.			"

												Excellent turn based tactical strategy game featuring a bread baking female soldier with really bouncy hair.Unlike some other recent PC ports which shall not be named, there's no rifle animations locked to 30 fps, it actually supports resolutions, escape key doesn't spontaneously make the game explode, and performace is a constant smooth 60fps (or even higher if your display supports it) on practically any computer. The only downside right now are some minor audio issues which I hope and expect Sega will patch. Aside from that, this is an excellent PC port. And most importantly, it's a really great game so go buy it now!			"

												Valkyria Chronicles was a hidden gem for me. Shooters aren't my thing and everything with modern weapons such as tanks and machine guns has a rather hard time with me. Not that such games are bad or anything I just don't like them. Just my individual preference. So this game had a rather hard start for me: Visuals: I have grown rather fond of the graphics over time but I wasn't impressed at all at the first glance. The painted style turned out to look better and more endearing than I thought both in cutscenes and actual gameplay. The map you choose your characters to move could have been a little differently designed but that's really nitpicking. It was an interessting gamble with the graphics I'd say and it paid off, at least in my books.  Gamplay: The Gameplay takes some getting used to, since I expected a turn based strategy game and Valkyria chronicles has a way of switching between a tactical map (where you can spend your command-points (CP) to move your units and end your turn if you either run  out of CPs or don't want to move anyone) and an action map (where you control the single unit itself moving him/her over the battlefield aiming and shooting yourself). While in action mode enemy units greet you whenever they can with interception fire, while you have to switch to ""target mode"" first before you can fire back which is kinda not nice. Once you know the ropes however everything falls into place quiet nicely and the game is a lot of fun. Downsides are in my books that the balancing and rating are off. Speed is everything. You'll get an A-Rank for a mission if you complete it in like 2 turns while other factors like casualties on your side or number of killed enemies do have little effect (if they have an effect at all)  and that motivates only to scout-rush-tactics after all high rankings means more funds and exp. As for the balancing: Good thing is that each class is useful. Considering the rushs scouts are properly the most useful, but the rest can hardly be dismissed. Your protagonist however can use ""commands"" (special abillities) to do pretty much whatever. he can heal units in calling a medic, boost a units offense or defense (however that works) lower damage from interception fire or give special boosts against tanks or make a unit aim better. While a like it to have such abillities and like to get some noticeable effect out of them in this game they seemed to be a little OP.  Story: The Story is set in an alternate-universe-Europe called Europa and the time is WW2 (here EW2 - Europan War 2) and many links to the real history exist (""ragnite"" is a mineral that takes the place of oil/petroleum as a rare ressource and so on) but some things are quite different as well: in this war aerial combat isn't a thing at all. This isn't exactly my cup of tea either but it was done nicely. You don't actually fight the war in it's entirety but only a small part of it and your not an all great hero, but a mere squad leader although you are meant to pull off some miracles (but that's a protagonist for you.) (I like that, you can't be everywhere doing everything)The characters are rather well done and the overall story - while nothing special - isn't bad.  tl;dr: I got surprised by the game in a good way. I bought it only because it was discounted and was like ""let's give it a try. If it is bad, then I didn't waste much money on it."" Looking back, that game is well worth even the full price. It has a few set backs but makes more than up for them.			"

												Man!! What have I been missing!!? I really wish I'd bought this for PS3 back in 2008 when it first came out.Being an avid follower of JRPGs over the years, I put this one to the side upon its initial release back in 2008. The reason? Well, let's just say I was turned off by the military based story driven narrative. What a fool I was! Now having played through a good portion of the game, I can happily say that this game is an absolute gem, and I should of taken heed from my friends to play it when I had the chance.Still, here I am now, and it's a fabulous game, with a great cast of characters, interesting story arc and gameplay......OH THE GAMEPLAY, how awesome thine are. Each mission is beautifully designed, in such a way I never feel like any of the missions are copy pasta jobs. Each one has their own corresponding story event, and style. For instance, sometimes you just need to clear out the bad guys in one mission, and capture the base, another mission requires you to sneak through an enemy encampment and survive, and another tasks you with destroying a behemoth tank, but in varying stages throughout the mission. It really is a feat of how level designing should be done.The main character and supporting cast are very engaging, and the storyline is fun and sad, but very endearing and you find yourself having empathy for a variety of the characters. Some of it is a little cliched, but not so much that it becomes overtly obviously. Just enough for it to be cohesive, but not enough for it to be cheesy, a nice balance imo.Anyway, here is a quick overview summary of my pros and cons of the game:Pros:- Fantastic port, with optimized controls and very easy to follow.- As far as strategic JRPGs go, this has got to be up there with Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea. But completelydifferent in style, truly a tour de force of strategic role playing right here.- Colourful presentation throughout, basic, but polished well where necessary.- Superb music. Traditional JRPG styled music with a strong element of military based rythmes.- Intricate customization options from weapon/tank modifications to order commands and squad assignment. It's all up to you, great fun.- Relatively cheap game for such plentiful content.- Great characters that you actually will care about.Cons:- Graphics are a little dated (It's a 6 year old game)- The AI can sometimes do stupid things like jump over a sandbag, run around, do nothing, then run back over the sandbag and hide.- The game crashes occasionally for me in really annoying places, like during a mission or before i've saved after a mission. So remember to save at every conceivable chance!So there it is. At the end of this all, I could go into far more detail, but all you need to know is this equation:Do you like superb strategic JRPGs - Yes?Do you like great storyline arcs, with fascinating characters - Yes?Then wait no longer, go and buy this excellent game!

												FOR GALLIA!!!loosley based in the Early Stages of WW2, Valkyria Chronicles Depicts War in the eyes of a Militiamen Platoon called ""Squad 7"" during a Conflict between 2 super Powers, The Empire and the Federation, while The Country you hail from is called Gallia a ""neutral"" country in the Conflict, it would soon be dragged into war for Not only its Rich Resources but other More Elaborate Plans.Valkyria Chronicles plays and Completes like a really good JRPG on the PS2, From character Progression and Weapon upgrade Progression this game follows a good Pace at which you Level and Flow along with the Story.The game boasts---***Tactical Gameplay as you Lead and manage multiple Squad Mates and Veichles to meet certain Objectives.***a Overview map in between Teammate turns to see where and what enemies you have Spotted.***Free roam Turn based Combat, go where you will on the battle field using all the cover and advantages you can use, giving the player As much freedom as possible to meet any objective.***Characters host a multitude of abilities relating to the terrain they walk on to the people they fight along side and fight against***Rank System for Completing Missions and chapters , rankings are from  A-D i believe (End game stuffs) Replayability!***Team Customization, picking who will be on your team or how many of each class you want in your party, along with minimal kit customization for more specialized  weaponry for certain characters.**MUSIC by:Hitoshi Sakimoto, look up this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he is god like. Maybe you have heard of Final fantasy 12? TACTICS OGRE? Final fantasy Tactics,A2? or for the PS? this guy did it. such a bad♥♥♥♥♥!! a god amongst Video game musics *V***60FPS and Smooth!---some Negatives---**The Camera movement sometimes can be tricky on corners.   -well placed shots that hit air instead of going in between small yet well spaced out objects (invisible Walls or rather large object hitbox) but then again this game does not have a lean left or right option but that is ok since it does not detract from it for those shots are very rare to find.***720p Cutscenes, looks a lot more low res than the rest of the game.**has a ranking system that May or may not be to everyones liking, a hit or miss really. more about Blitzing than actual slow and Tactical Combat when trying to Get the BEST rank, but sometimes every combat is not about killing every enemy on the field  but actually getting an objective done so i can dig it, but some people cant.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A good Story based Tactical RPG and wishing for the other episodes in the Valkyria Chornicles to come out for PCGive this game a shot If you are into JRPGS, a good story, some Refreshing Team based Tactical Game play.

												This game is amazing.  Through cel-shaded visuals they somehow manage to capture the horror of war without being overly violent and gorey.  Starting with a group of militiamen, which are only citizens who were called to take up arms; a good portion of them being under 18 years of age (Oscar is 15, to put it into perspective), you fight battles that the army deems (without explicitely stating it, but you start to realize it as your characters would) too dangerous or trivial to send their own troops to do themselves (normally, these 'trivial' battles involve throwing your people in front of tanks or machine guns to ""clear the way"" for the actual army, something that would usually encur high casualties) because to the army General, you're expendable and nothing but peasants and farmhands and he's not far off.  While the General believes himself to be Aristocratic, your group in Squad 7 is anything but.  Welkin, the main character was going to school to be a teacher despite being the son of a warhero General himself.  Alicia was just a baker, Oscar, who is 15 wants to protect his sick brother.  You have people in your group who were in EWI (European War I), a girl who was a magazine model, outcasts, students, a singer, all just normal people which put into perspective that you're not leading a group of battle-hardened soldiers into war, but a group of everyday people who just want to protect their homes.The game starts off lighthearted enough but quickly ramps up in ambience when Imperial troops start shooting civilians while running away. The battlezones start colorful and bright but quickly shift to bleak trench filled warzones where you start jumping into trenches and getting down and dirty using your Shocktroopers against enemy entrenched troops with flamethrowers, hand grenades and sometimes just sheer luck all the while dodging mortars flying around and machine gun/cannon emplacements you have to keep out of the line of fire of, it gives you a sense of satisfying trench warfare that even top FPS games can't match (and this is a turn-based RTS RPG game).That is evident when the game puts your in its own version of a Normandy-like beach landing where you have to capture a beachhead from the Empire and get past machine gun bunkers on the cliffside that will tear any soldiers that enter their line of fire to pieces with no chance of getting to cover.  After that, you go up the hill where tanks are waiting and foot soldiers, past them you enter trench fighting, where you then run down another killzone with machine gun bunkers to make it to their beachhead base where they have soldiers and tanks waiting for you.  Well Squad 7, time to get to work.  What drives it home more is throughout the game you unlock chapters focusing on specific characters to see the more human side to them, and on more than one occasion your people raise the fact that the missions they are about to undertake has a high chance to get them killed, a far cry from your ""Oh what, we have to run through a burning building, scale a mountain and survive a nuke?  No problem"" FPS-like super soldiers.It's a story about war, love, betrayal, loss AND it has satisfying combat and appropriate challenge?  10/10, would recommend to anyone.			"

This game has a very decent story, great characters and powerful moments that will make a grown hairy man cry. A very unique Turn-Based game which is a must for every fan of the genre with a bit of RPG elements. I really don't care about Steam achievements but I admit it's a nice addition since it adds a bit of value and replayability (the PS3 version had no trophies). This is a solid 10/10 game and an underrated classic. Great PC port, affordable price. Get it now!			"

The graphics hark back to a Manga-filled entertainment time with that JRPG twist, however, it loses its chrub demeanor very quickly when you discover that it is extrodinarily repetative in its style of play - as in - you learn early and nothing else changes outside of settings and storyline...

												An exceptional strategy game. I wish the anime and jrpg elements didn't keep me from looking into and enjoying this game earlier. As it turned out those quirky japanese elements provided a nice console game charm, that as a PC gamer I haven't felt since my ps2 days.Valkyria Chronicles instantly goes down as an all time classic for me.

												Valkyria Chronicles is turn based tactical game surprisingly similar to Worms (or Hogs at War if you played that). You deploy your squad on an overhead map view, but when you select a unit, camera closes in and you move, take cover, aim the weapon and fire using shooter-like controls. You can move same soldier several times in a single turn and can also move after firing, if that soldier still have stamina remaining, but watch out - enemy soldiers will not stand idle during your turn and will fire at your active unit when you are not aiming, so there's always a feeling of pressure, even there's no timer.All soldiers in your squad are unique, every one with his own name, face, voice and personality traits. These personality traits will even affect their performance on battlefield, in both bad and good ways. For example, responsible engineer will get a stat boost if she's the last to act during a turn, while scout-pacifist might randomly decide to disobey the attack order and refuse to shoot at the enemy. Soldiers can die permanently if they are downed for three turns or if an enemy soldier reaches them when they're in downed state. To save downed soldiers, move one of your still alive units to them and he will call the medic for evacuation.Valkyria Chronicles takes place in the middle of what could be described as ""fantasy World War II"". It is unusual setting for japanese games and makes Valkyria Chronicles stand out among others. Sadly, the story itself is mediocre at best and face-palmingly stupid at worst points.The worst thing about Valkyria Chronicles though is its battle ranking system. Speed of completion is the only factor that matters. This encourage the tactic of rushing in and capturing enemy home base as fast as possible, which will get boring soon.			"

												If you have any interest in a Strategy RPG whatsoever you owe it to yourself to play Valkyria Chronicles.  At $20 it is a great deal, It includes DLC that cost about $12 on PS3. Even now if you were to pick up a copy of the game on PS3, it would run you 15+ dollars in most cases, so for just a few bucks more you get all of the DLC as well. The one thing that has bothered me about the port so far is that the time inbetween missions does not have mouse support, but it is still pretty easy to navigate with the keyboard. Loadtimes are very quick, any 16/9 resolution that your monitor supports is supported by the game, and framerate is able to go as high as your monitor's refresh rate. None of that ""let's lock the game at 30 fps for no real reason"" shenanigans. Also don't worry about the lack of graphical options. It seems like many of the textures scale with resolution. Make sure to turn up your mouse sensitivity a bit if the controls feel a bit sluggish, it helped me out a lot personally. Other than that the controls are quite solid in their default state. As someone that has also played the PS3 version I would say that the controls are on par if not better than what was set up for the PS3 controller. The cast of characters is quite large, and they all have their own quirks. A lot of them are likable too. There are a large number of squads you can field because of this, and even some characters with the same class can play a bit differently because of their personality traits. The story covers quite a few serious war related issues, and there are a lot of great moments. Don't want to say too much about it though. If it matters to anyone, Dual audio is present, so you can choose from the original Japanese, or English audio. Buy this game. It is also quite fitting for Veteran's / Remembrance day. From what I have played so far it is a solid port and definitely worth the cost of admission. TL;DRPros: + Solid story. + Great combat system where tactical decisions actually make a difference. + Large cast of characters with many different possible squad make-ups. + Smooth controls (turn mouse sensitivity up) + TANKS. + A good PC port.  + TANKS!Cons: - Mouse support not availiable in the menus.  - In engine cutscenes look a bit dated because it is a PS3 game from 2008. - It took this long for it to come to PC.

												Valkyria Chronicles is an absolutely fantastic turn-based/real-time strategy JRPG, that is certainly something very unique. The PC port handles excellently with only a couple of minor issues, that being the lack of mouse support in main menus and the pre-rendered cut-scenes still being in the console resolution and frame-rate.The narrative captured my interest from the very beginning with an intriguing and somewhat satirical take on world war 2. The turn-based combat system is both unique and familiar, reminiscent of the likes of XCOM, while operating in real-time on a bar of movement points until the turn runs out in a third-person-shooter style.It’s worth a look if you love strategy or JRPG’s and a fantastic story to boot!

												I love every part of this game, from the beautiful and artistic story to the strategic and sometimes quite difficult battles. I fully reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys games with great artwork and fun strategic gameplay. I will warn you though, some of the fights in this game are very hard and may seem completely unfair but I'm sure that if you try hard you can do it. This game was completely worth the money I spent on it. I do , however, reccommend waiting for the game to go on sale since steam has sales almost every weekend. Seriously just wait a week and you will only have to pay half the price and you can buy another wonderful game.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles commits one major sin as a strategy game: it expects you to follow a certain order of steps in order to complete any given map. You *can* beat the maps in a variety of ways--and the game will rate you poorly for it. Setting up chokepoints with scouts, blitzing with soldiers, sabotaging enemy tanks with Lancers... you can be as smart as you want, VC won't like you unless you play how *it* wants.If you can get past that, you'll find an amazing title here. Lead artist Raita is a little odd in how he draws women (boobs do not work that way, good sir), but there's no faulting the amazing visual style and setting for this game. For something set in as mined-out a concept as World War II, Valkyria Chronicles is far more engrossing in its visuals and music than its concept will make you think. Gameplay-wise, Valkyria Chronicles is also quite inviting in its combination of real-time third-person action and turn-based gameplay.Many of the fun content in Valkyria Chronicles--different weapons for recruits, for example--are hidden in out-of-the-way areas and will need a guide to be found, and the odd sense that you're not playing as the game wants you to will haunt you, but Valkyria Chronicles is a game that is definitely worth your time and money.

												One of the best japanese games on Steam so far.+GameplayIf your are looking for a fun JRPG with a turn based combat buy this NOW! (or better wait for sales, this is steam) it has been a while since I didn't enjoyed so much a JRPG and even more turn based ( ;_;).It's very addictive and the hours playing go very fast. Like in XCOM you will get affection to some characters of your squad and maybe for your bad decisions you will see them die.It's because that you will take so much care in the battle of what do you do and how. If you manage well your movements and tactics the game rewards you pretty well.After finish the game I just can say one bad thing about the combat, if you use orders with main characters you will become into a inmortal god (Rosie with orders = Rambo + Chuck Norris + Van Damme, insane).I killed the final boss in one turn in my first run.+StoryIt's not the best plot ever but is enough for catch you into the game. You will have some cliches recurrent of japanese games but thakfully the guionist do not overdo this situations (and other stupid situations for do everything more good looking like use a flare in the middle of enemy camp during a infiltration, Eh!! WE ARE HERE!!!)If you have watched Full Metal Alchemist it's the best explanation for describe the setting in this game, WWI weapons with some more actual tecnology, a country in the middle of a huge war, mysterious powers in the background... It's very close to FMA. Very recommended if you liked the anime.You also  have a lot of lore for read if you are interested in the universe of the game and it will help you for understand better the actual war during the game. It's not a very dense lore so you dont will get bored reading a look of text.+CharactersYou have a plenty selection of characters for your squad and every one with his own background and story that's why you dont want see them die and you try finish every battle without a lose anyone, like a true commander in some way you get into that role very easy.I miss some new exclusive characters after finish the game like Selvaria (<3) or Jagger. Anyways you have a lot of them for send to a certain death.+Graphic optionsIt's a game of 2008, I was not expecting much but you have a lot of resolutions options and for diferent hz of your screen and that is always welcome.The game at this point can run even in a toaster and dont have any new features from consoles except the resolution.+ControlI was expecting play this with a controller but it's perfectly optimized to keyboard and mouse and works better. Aim to the head with the 360 pad it's horrible.+Duration39 hours and I dont finished all the skirmishes and try to get rank A in every mission. The game is very complete and offer you a very reasonable amount of gameplay.Ready at Dawn take note please.+SoundtrackIf you pay carful attention to the soundtrack in videogames like me I'm pretty sure you will love the ost of this game. A great soundtrack for a great game.+Japanese VoicesYes! Dual audio! please keep doing this. The english subtitles in some parts are not accurate with what the character is saying (this happens often in a lot of games) but the most part of the time it's a good translation from the japanese.-User InterfaceIt's just a port with minimal changes with consoles but the main menu is horrible for navigate... You feel like ""ey I can click here and go fast to the next page"" but no, you cant and you must open submenus.The graphic options can't be changed in the game and have a independent launcher just for that it's a little bit odd.Would have been nice a completly new interface thinking on pc and the posibility of use a mouse for navigate around the menus.The game absolutely deserve the exist in Steam and I hope SEGA bring more japanese games to pc. Yakuza come to us.			"

A very tidy port of one of the PS3's best games, and a very interesting take on the strategy-RPG genre, which gives games such as Tactics Ogre, Front Mission and Disgaea a run for their money. Not only is it fun, but it's beautiful too. The Canvas Engine is one of the best things to come out of the last generation of consoles.			"

												I first played (and beat) Valkyria Chronicles for the Playstation 3. I enjoyed the game so much that I originally bought it for Steam just to show my support for the game. Even though I did not have the intent to replay the game on the PC, I ended up doing just that. The Steam play through was my fourth full play through, and it was just as enjoyable as the first was. The game's story, characters, combat, visuals, music, voice acting. Everything about it is absolutely terrific. I recommend this game to everyone. Contantly. And they hate me for always talking about how great Valkyrai Chronicles is. Incessantly.My *only* suggestion would be: play this with a controller. It is so much better with a controller than it is with mouse + keyboard.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles came out for the PS3 about 6 years ago and is a strategy RPG.  This contains all the DLC and some touched up visuals.  This is an EXCELLENT game.  It basically takes the events of WW1/WW2 as in that both wars are/have happened and the land looks exactly like Europe.  Everything else is different.  You play as a member of a militia group from a small country that's on the defense from the eastern empire (Russia area).Graphics have been touched up, it can be run at 4k pretty easily with GeDoSaTo.  Running @ 4k and 60fps causes some issues with tanks being able to move up hills.  The audio comes in english/japanese (and may have more, I never checked).It's a turn based strategy RPG.  You level up your classes instead of individuals.  You upgrade your weapons and tanks between missions.  Grinding isn't really necessary.  The way the game is potrayed, you can't redo story missions but you can replay 'skirmishes' over and over again if you want.  It is helpful for new people to learn units strengths/weaknesses but it's absolutely n ot necessary to grind.  I played every skirmish once and was able to beat the game without much issue.This game is a lot of fun, a little challenging here and there.  Has a great cast of characters with great voice acting.  The story is really well done.  I don't want to spoil certain parts but it handles some situations that don't get featured in games all that much well.  You can save practically anytime and quit if you have to run to do something!			"

												The reason to buy a PS3, now on PC. Words can't express the joy upon hearing this was coming to PC.This game is a strategy JRPG. It used a custom engine for the time which blended a manga art style with a 3D engine. The engine was scaled down for the sequels which released for the PSP. This however, is the best version of it, the full version.Valkyria Chronicles has a setting in a WWII technology world. However with one distinct difference, a lack of airpower. In a way Valkyria is a blending of ideas from WWI, WWII, and Napoleonic wars. Everything is centered around Ragnite. A miracle mineral used to both power vehicles and heal troops.Mixed into this world are those descended from an ancient race who could manipulate Ragnite. Where the Valkyria name comes from. Imagine super soldiers with energy cannons that can decimate everything.This all comes to pass in the nation of Gallia which holds the largest stockpile of Ragnite but is neutral to world affairs. Others want it, then are willing to do anything to capture it. There is a lot of political wrangling in the background of the story. But also at the root of it is many very dark undertones of hatred of Darcsens, Gallian natives who are heavily stereotyped in Gallian society.There is common anime tropes at times but the story is extremely solid. Created by members of Sega's famed Overworks team. Those that missed the Dreamcast golden age, now is the time to see what Overworks was capable of. Sega even did an anime based on this game, which is in some ways better. The ending of the anime is better than the game, makes more sense, but both are fantastic. Skies of Arcadia (The greatest Overworks title ever made) fans will even get a treat with cameos from Vyse, Aika, and Fina as all of their characters were snuck into this. This is the kind of game Sega should be delivering to the PC crowd on a regular basis. I couldn't hold back from purchase the moment it was announced. My PS3 may never boot up again and I certainly want to see more titles like this making it to PC. If you don't buy it for PC, buy it for PS3. I honestly bought a PS3 just to play this game and I didn't regret it one bit.			"

												A militarised Fire Emblem type of game?Count me in.The gameplay offers the use of 5 different classes (Scout, Shock Trooper, Lancer, Engineer and Snipers) split with the many chosable units and 1 tank. Instead of individual leveling of said units, the game asks to level up the classes instead. So no worries on switching up units there. For the tank, outfit it with stat modifiers.Combat can be tough at times but enemies folow a set path in most so its possible.Units can die permanently in combat if incaped during firefights and not rescued in time.And special guest appearance of Skies of Arcadia heroes (Vyse as a Shock Trooper, Aika as a Scout and Fina being the Medic) is a plus, thanks Sega.Includes all DLC released on the ps3.Squad 7 (or Platoon 7), move out.9/10			"

												I bought this game on my PS3 back when it got released. I must have finished the game from start to finish at least 5 times and i enjoyed it everytime so much. Funny that i was thinking about playing it again a few days back and today i noticed it came out on Steam! Bought it instantly without any hesitation. This game is one of my favorites of all time for sure!!For anybody willing to play something different and embark on an amazing journey with an epic storyline filled with cool characters. Then this is the game you dont wanna miss! ;)Thanks SEGA for releasing this on the PC !!			"

												amazing game with a compelling story the dialog is a little childish but the overall tone resonates with a whimsical nostagia.  the gameplay itself is perfect, combining elements of Emblem with the original Medal of Honor Games. I played the game extensively an would play it again and again even when the achievements have been unlocked and the medals won this particular game still compells players to pick it up again and agian because in laymans terms, its just plain fun. i cannot recomend it enough as both a game and a possible obsession, bravo sega, bravo.

												This is my first long review ever, im so sorry for my worst english xdi love this game, it's just good for me. but there are some wrong translating for the game, for the example, when the Squad 7 in the barious desert and parked their tank there, Alicia said that ""Enemy in Sight"" or something like that, but when i hear the japanese voice it said ""matte"", which means wait. Well, overall is good, the story is rich, the gameplay is fun, the art is more than i expected for an anime game.Let's start talking about the story (Spoiler alert!):The story is talking about the second European War II. The Story started from a little city named Bruhl in East Gallia territory, when the main character --Welkin Gunther-- head back to the city from his university and drawing next to a river. He was drawing some fishes in the river. Because of his suspicious act, he was being chased by the city guards and one of them is the main character of the game, that's Alicia Melchiott. When Alicia is taking Welkin, some Imperial (That's the enemy of Gallian) encounter them. Let's skip this part. after Alicia and Welkin defeated the imperial's spies and Welkin have escaped the tank, Welkin meet his aunt --Martha-- and his Sister --Isara Gunther-- they have some conversation. after some times, some Imperials spies attacked their house. when they are cornered and have no other choice, Isara took out her father's tank, the Edelweiss. I like this part, the tank looks cool, i will explain why i think so later. They head towards the center of the city to  help the city guards and Alicia. Welkin and Isara (and Martha) has arrived there, but Alicia and the Guards are in critical condition, in that mission, the player must help Alicia and The guards preventing the Imperials destroyed a gate. the player can kill the tank there with the Edelweiss. when i said that the Edelweiss is cool, that's because it has good armor and of course, it's because the game developer draw it perfectly. unlike the tank they encountered, Edelweiss got more HP and THP(Hit Point and Tread Hit Point), which make Edelweiss more powerful. So, because of that, the player can kill the enemy tank easily without any big problem. Altough the player have finished the mission, they are ""not"" actually win it. The Imperials got more power and it forced them to leave, so they have to evacuate to randgriz  *sounds like razgriz from Ace Combat XD*  The capital city of Gallia. But before they leave, Welkin, Alicia and Isara make a promise that they will take Bruhl back from the Imperial. Alicia blow a lion paw flower.Whew. After typing the prologue I won't type the rest, please god!, time to for my comment. once more (SPOILER ALERT):Well, so the story is very good actually, but the prologue is a little bit awkward tough. you can read the part when i say that the guard and Alicia were arresting Welkin. This part make it awkward, in my opinion the guards supposed to do something intimidating Welkin, it will make the part a little bit ""wow"" but just like you have know, i can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to a finished game. The rest of the story is good, i like when Alicia become a Valkyria, i mean, i can't even guess that she is a valkyria. the latest story, wow, was crying XD. It's when Alicia and Welkin jumped to Isara's plane, i keep thinking of Isara when i look at the plane and keep crying. The epilogue taken place in Bruhl again. where Alicia has own a bakery. Welkin has finally become a teacher, and married Alicia. The Epilogue started when Welkin walking to the windmill and met his students. then he met Alicia with her bakery van, they have a little conversation and then........... Isara came out from the van what is this at my cheek.... oh it's tears. and said that she has help her mother in the bakery. after that, She wants Welkin to come to see how did she help his mother. there are many funny moments in the game too, which make the story not boring and sad very much yes... not very much....so overall of the game is good, i HIGHLY recommend you to Buy this game. the story is very good and the art is very KAWAIIIIIII too ;d. the music... well, the music didn't met my recommendation tough xd. but don't think about it! i bet you will enjoy the game!9/10~~~XCMD~~~01-21-17			"

												Well well well... so after 6 years we finally get this game on PC. And apparently, the sales blew all expectations out of the water and made good old´ SEGA really happy, so hopefully that means part 2 and 3 will make their way to the west on PC as well.This game is absolutely great! It has a bit more story than most games, and it´s also very story driven with the book chapter format, which means you really feel for the people in your squad after a while. It also helps that all characters are believable and distinct like real people.The game has an interesting, tastefull approuch to handling difficult topics such as hate, revenge, racism, and <!spoiler alert!> deadly concentration camps. As anyone who looks at the store page can probably see, it basically takes place during world war 2 with different names for the participating countries and everything taking place in Europe. (or well, Europa...) Despite the overall seriousness the anime like story still has time for some nice extras like a sexy T&A beach episode!!Enough about the story, I am worried I might reveal too many spoilers for people who still have to play the game. Gameplay, then: it´s pretty good. It´s an interesting mix between third person shooter (GOW style) and turn based tactics. It works! Accept for some bad AI at times, but nothing too shokcing. Just that I have seen, for example, mortars not just missing my troops, but only hitting their own. And the like. But nothing which breaks gameplay. Graphics are great, anime/waterpainting style. :Dfinally, about the port. It´s decent. good keyboard/mouse controls (altoughI use x360 controller), 60 fps or highser support, low sys reqs, and support for any resolution including 4k with textures etc. automatically scaling in quality.Pretty good, sega!All in all, I definitely recommend this game! :3			"

Short version: 89%Valkyria Chronicles successfully merged a lot of anime tropes and turn-based tactical combat. The colourful missions, the familiar yet interesting mechanics of mixing map-level strategies with third-person action, and especially the memorable cast all make a good job to entertain us despite the horrible user interface.Long version:At first glance, Valkyria Chronicles doesn’t look to be more than a game that tries to mix JRPG and tactical combat, veering a lot more towards the latter with game elements like an overmap to place units at, or tactical points spent each round to determine which unit to take control of in a third-person segment.It’s not even a balanced game: not only you can reach maximum level and highest-grade weaponry near the start thanks to the DLC challenges, but even without them, a single defence-boosted scout can make short work of most maps. On top of all, soldiers have personalised abilities, so some are borderline useless (like half of the Edy detachment), some are demigods (the other half of the Edy detachment).Still, with self-control, players can find a lot of fun and challenge on each map, as they all try to bring something new, opening up myriads of possibilities on ideal squad composition, tactics, and strategy. The story is every anime ever, full of quirky, light-hearted stereotypes, who– thanks to their extreme personalities– are all memorable and easy to form an attachment to.The plot is set in an alternative Europe, where the evil Empire (a combination of late 19th century Russia and Prussia) invades a small country (Poland moved to the Baltic). We play the role of the defenders, whose adventures are really predictable, but thanks to the very anime-like tropes and characters, it is fun to watch. It has to be fun though, since the levels are so short that about a tenth of the campaign is spent by playing, the rest is us watching this visual novel type adventure.			"

												“Oh, maaan, Ted's so good,” Cherry gushed to Marina as she signalled the sniper up the ladder, “He totally knows just when to ease up, and just when to, like, push harder... he's totally incredible!” Marina Wulfstan climbed up silently, wishing to herself that the noisy scout would miraculously keep to herself while she was here. Marina vaulted the end of the ladder, already in motion, dragging the body of the patrolman clear from the ledge before setting down. Cherry Stijnen bunkered down against a chimney, reminiscing on another well-spent night in a Ted's company. “And he loves warming up as much as doing it,” she continued, “he takes off my dresses real slow, takes care not to just rip my clothes off... like, he treats me like a present, like, the kind with the pretty wrapping you want to keep, y'know?” Marina clearly didn't know, and didn't care. She crouched down over the edge of the building, staying out of sight while scoping the surroundings. “Two shocktroopers by the objective,” she reported in, ever mindful of her role in the team, “Engineer and shocktrooper bunkered on the east side, light tank providing cover. Scout concealed in foliage further east, no clear shot. Orders, commander?”“This is a surprise attack,” Welkin answered over the radio, “Take out as many shocktroopers as you can to cover our scouts' advance, then the engineer to make Largo's lancers stick to that tank. Rosie, take care of anything out of Marina's sights.”“I don't blame him, though,” Cherry effortlessly segued, “they are beautiful clothes. Got them through a mail-order catalogue in Gallian Girl. Took like forever to save up for them, but they were totally worth it. You know, you should try something flowy sometime, Marina. It'd feel, like, so much better than those jeans and tees you always wear, y'know? You'd totally look better for it...”“Ugh...Stijnen's right here, surely she can handle one scout,” Marina reasoned with the commander, squeezing the trigger and hearing the satisfying thud of an enemy falling dead. Please, get her away from me...“Negative,” Welkin replied, “if something goes wrong you'll need the support. Cherry will back you up. Until we're in position, the field is yours.”“...roger, commander,” Marina acquiesced, her shoulders lumping with a dejected sigh as she lined up a shot. Cherry noticed this, and moved to her comrade as she fired, dropping another trooper.“Aw, don't worry, sweetie,” she cooed into Marina's ear with a pat on her shoulder that would've ruined the sniper's shot, “It's not a lost cause! Once we get you into some good clothes, you'll be totally hot! Of course, we'd have to do something with those nails, too... mmmaybe some eyeshadow wouldn't go astray, either... but it's probably mostly the hair. We need to totally pull it away from your eyes, y'know, let the guys know, like, what they're getting...”You stay the hell away from my hair. “That's wonderful, listen,” Marina managed through gritted teeth, looking up with a glare that stopped Cherry in her tracks, “I need to concentrate on this, okay?”“Oh, um, like, totally...” Cherry sat back down, watching the quiet woman absorb herself in her task. Marina could still feel the scout's eyes on her, and it unnerved her. Her aim was wandering over the enemy shocktrooper; arm, torso, leg, neck, clean air... She felt agitated around anyone, let alone someone as obnoxious as her. She felt the eyes on the back of her head leave, and her aim steadied...“We could probably do something about that personality of yours too,” Cherry commented, getting straight back into it, “it's no wonder the guys don't look twice at you...”What the ♥♥♥♥!? Marina's hands shook violently as she pulled the trigger, executing what was possibly the worst shot she had ever fired in her military career. The shocktrooper was thrown from his feet, a bullet flying through his lower leg. He went down with a cry, and a grimace of pain, alerting all his friends to the hostile presence. Marina shot Cherry a glare that froze blood.“Damn... Turner, move forward and finish that guy off. Wulfstan, what's going on?” Welkin asked from the radio, as the screams of the poor shocktrooper intensified briefly, before petering out. “Are you under attack? I can get Nelson there to back you two up...”Marina steeled her gaze at Cherry. “Won't be necessary, commander,” she said coolly, “I can deal with it.” Marina reached over, grabbing the scout by the scruff of the neck. Cherry gasped in surprise as the sniper pulled her close, and placed her lips over hers.What..? Cherry's eyes went wide as Marina's mouth closed over hers, as her tongue explored Cherry's own, lapping and drawing at it, trying to coax it into action, action that Cherry's mind couldn't make through the shock of being kissed by another woman. She's..! Cherry sat paralyzed under the ministrations of the sniper, and could only look blankly at her as she closed the kiss, pulling away gently, smirking at the scout. She pushed Cherry back sharply, Cherry falling flat on her behind as Marina turned back to the road below.“My roof,” Marina said, as she cocked her rifle, lining up a shocktrooper on the ground. She's... Cherry managed to herself as Marina put a bullet through the enemy's eyeball. “My rules,” Marina cocked again, turning to the rear base and lining up a second, sliding a slug under his visor. Cherry could still only manage to sit and stare bug-eyed at the woman, the synergy of weapon and soldier in efficient, cold-blooded unison, cocking her rifle a third time in as few seconds.“My way.” she finished, planting the third round into the engineer's ear, who went down like a sack of potatoes.Welkin's voice crackled again. “The road's clear! Lancers, scouts, move up and clear that tank!”The whistle of Largo's rocket screamed from the street, ending with a deep, resonating explosion, the shot a direct hit on the tank's radiator, destroying the vehicle in one deft move. Alicia moved forward, her footsteps echoing on the cobblestone road. Marina smiled as she surveyed her handiwork, quickly glancing at the frozen scout before turning back to the ladder, leaving Cherry to gather her thoughts.She's... she's good... She wasn't sure if she meant a good soldier or a good kisser.			"

												Ok, given how much time I've ended up spending on this game, I think it's only fair to give a review.I'm not normally a fan of japanese games - by japanese, I don't mean games from japanese devs - I mean the kind of anime games that are reeking in japanese culture, with cute cartoon girls and edgy teens. I though this game would be the same at a glance, but I ended up picking it up on someones recomendation when it was on sale. My friend described the game to me as X-COM set in WW2, and I love X-COM.The setting is a fictional, almost alternate reality WW2, or the second Europan War as the game calls it. Two large empires are fighting for a fictional resourse neccessary for the survival of their empires, and it just so happens that you're peaceloving neutral country sit's upon a huge stockpile of the stuff. The forces invade your  hometown, so in retaliation, you take control with 'Squad 7', a local militia, with the goal of liberaing the country.  This involves inventory management, the researching of new equipment, squad training and more.Whilst this doesn't sound like a very unique storyline, the way in which the games explores the war, while still maintaining a very fictional feel to it is very gripping and individual. Without spoiling too much, you see close friends die, Nazi Germany scale attrocities, and locations which you grow an attachment to destroyed. In addition to this, the game features some highly addicting X-COM style squad management gameplay, both in and out of battle. The challenging gamplay, gripping story, and refreshing presentation all make for a great game. This is a 10/10 in my book, the best game I've played in 2014.			"

												It is an amazing game which manages to portray the attrocieties of war and makes the player want to not stop untill the game is over. The game itself is basicly an anime which then gives the player control during battle and also allows them to customize, train and upgrade the units and weapons used. For those put off by its ""cute"" art style at first just give it some time because you will fall in love with what Valkyria Chronicles has to offer. This game has made me want sega to port over  Valkyria Chronicles 1 and 2...even if 2 is not that great, I still want them both.To sum up, if you like anime, turn-based-strategy and getting attached to characters then this is the game for you.

												I first played (and beat) Valkyria Chronicles for the Playstation 3. I enjoyed the game so much that I originally bought it for Steam just to show my support for the game. Even though I did not have the intent to replay the game on the PC, I ended up doing just that. The Steam play through was my fourth full play through, and it was just as enjoyable as the first was. The game's story, characters, combat, visuals, music, voice acting. Everything about it is absolutely terrific. I recommend this game to everyone. Contantly. And they hate me for always talking about how great Valkyrai Chronicles is. Incessantly.My *only* suggestion would be: play this with a controller. It is so much better with a controller than it is with mouse + keyboard.			"

												There are a lot of games that while contemporary are regarded as ""classic"" or ""masterpieces"", but don't hold up well when you go back to them years later.  Their luster fades, their novelty no longer feels like anything more than a cheap gimmick, and modern successors do what they did better.  Valkyria Chronicles is not one of these games.Every bit as fresh today as it was in 2008, VC is perhaps the most singularly inspired tactical RPG to ever come into existance, seemingly arising out of nowhere with wholly unique gameplay, a fully realized setting full of fantastic worldbuilding, and a cast of characters as memorable as they are lovable.If you love strategy games, RPGs, or just games that are truly original, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the best games ever made.

												What many consider to be one of the greatest and most overlooked gems on the PS3 finally hits Steam! Obviously, it's the same game you played in 2008, only with a higher resolution, framerate, and (arguably) better controls.This shouldn't have come as a surprise to me, but as a result of many abysmal PC ports by other companies, it did. This game has mouse support! While the menus and chapter select screens don't have a mouse cursor and make you navigate with the keyboard, the actual battles fully support the mouse, and it works absolutely perfectly. I would recommend you increase the mouse sensitivity, however; the initial setting of 50 is a bit low and I found 75 to be much better.Unlike Final Fantasy XIII's recent PC release, Sega actually allows us to change the game's resolution to just about anything we could ask for. What a concept, right? While the pre-rendered cutscenes are still locked at the PS3's 1280x720 resolution, the battles look absolutely amazing in 2560x1440p at 60+ frames per second.In an age where many console-centric companies see the goldmine that is Steam and decide to hastily and carelessly port their games over, Sega has done us an enormous favor and made a very respectable port of one of the best games on the last generation of consoles. If you've never played the original on PS3, you absolutely owe it to yourself to pick it up now. If you're like me and have played the PS3 version to death, you still owe it to yourself to pick it up again to experience all of the enhancements that the PC version brings. If we're lucky, maybe Sega will decide to port over Valkyria Chronicles 2 and, if we're very lucky, Valkyria Chronicles 3 to Steam.			"

												So far this PC port seems like it's really well done. Before i go into detail i would like to introduce the actual game to people who are interested in it.If you just want to know about the port quality, you can skip this partTo sum the story up really fast: This game is about a war set in 1935 EC between 2 powers in europe, the Empire in the east and Atlantic Federation in the west, that are in need of a specific ressource. The Empire crossed the border to the west an attacked, thus starting the second european war. Your place in the game is Gallian, a country that always stayed neutral so far, but now has to fight and defend themselve because the country possesses huge amounts of the needed ressource. The story is told like a tale from a book, chapter by chapter. You will have a lot of cutscenes, maybe more than some people would like to.The gameplay could be described as a strategic and really advanced worms with more specific mechanics. It's turn based with different units which can be upgraded. People who enjoy this type of game will definitely have fun with VC.Regarding the port:The port seems really solid. Keyboard and mouse controls might need some practice, but they are working fine. Resolution and frame rate are changeable, no crashes or performances problems (frame drops etc.) so far. Only thing i noticed is, that the cut scene aren't affected by frame rate changes. These still seem to be in 30 FPS, also not sure about resolution changes effecting them. Doesn't matter to much, because it still looks great. Only thing that bugs me is, that the changes to sound volume don't really adjust the cutscene volume. At least not for me. So consider turning down the master volume on your windows mixer instead of the volume control in the game to have some consistent colume changes.Other than that: If you know this game, if you enjoyed it on PS3, if you want to support SEGA and you want it on PC with all DLCs for 20 bucks or whatever, i think it's safe to say, that you can buy this. If you are still unsure, i recommed watching some streams on Twitch.tv first before buying.			"

												This game is a mix between advance wars, fire emblem and most WW2 games. Though the WW2 setting is set in a fictional universe, the plot itself gives a much better experience than most shooters. I  really enjoy the game's character designs and the method of presentation their gameplay. It was nicely introduced so that the player can digest slowly and learn how to experiment with their tactics and such.My comments about the gameplay is a mix between the usual RTS and third person shooters. I really liked this combination. This requires some planning before striking your enemies and advancing through the game.Each character has a unique combination of attributes that may be advantageous or prove to be a disadvantage at certain situations. This gives a very nice blend of mixing the character combinations and see how it works out. I hope there would be a relationship feature or character interaction in or out of battles just like in fire emblem.The music kind of reminds me about my days playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and A2.The developers design for this world gives some sort of an anime world, but that isn't much of a surprise from a game from japan.Though I really wished to replay old mission as I wanted to do better. ANd the interphase change to accomodate PC gamers is satisfactotionary, I need some time to get accustomed to play this game.Overall, this is a game that is worth your money, I never regretted buying this game and I really hope a sequel might come up but I doubt that.Overall:9.5/10 Gameplay:9/10 Music: 9/10 Interphase change from PS3 to PC:6/10 Plot:10/10 Character design:10/10 Replayability:8/10			"

												Holy crap, 10 hours in and I'm showing no signs of putting this down! Screw console exclusives! I wish I had gotten my hands on this game sooner. I've always loved games that had you recruit a plethora of characters that you can level up and equip to take with you into battle. It's kinda got that JRPG element going on with the turn based battle system, but does it in a unique way. Fan-♥♥♥♥in'-tastic! Really hope the sequels find their way onto Steam as well I want to play the hell out of this franchise!			"

												Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) is at the bottom.To start, Valkyria Chronicles (I will refer to it as VC) was released in North America on November 4th, 2008 for the Sony PlayStation 3.  VC had two more sequels released in the following years of 2010 and 2011.  VC 3 was released in Japan only, and neither of the sequels were able to live up to the original game.  If you want to read reviews about the PS3 version, which is identical to this version, I would suggest you start here: http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/valkyria-chronicles.PC reviews here: http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/valkyria-chroniclesI personally have sunk many hundreds of hours into the PS3 version.  The game’s main positive attribute is the amazing story, which is masterfully voiced in both English and Japanese.  The awesome soundtrack is beautifully composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who has also created scores for Final Fantasy titles.  The extremely unique and breathtaking watercolor graphics produced by the CANVAS engine make this game’s art style literally one-of-a-kind, and now it looks even better in high definition thanks to the work done by SEGA to release the game on PC.  The game also took advantage of Nvidia’s PhysX technology to simulate realistic physics for debris, hair, clothing, grass, and more on the PS3.  Without a doubt, this technology will be coming to PC along with the game, and possibly be even better than before.  The game also boasts its own type of gameplay style; I would describe it as “a turn-based real-time third-person-shooter strategy RPG”, yes, turn-based and real-time together.  The game’s characters are very easy to identify with, or at least make a personal connection to one of them.  Throughout the story, the cast (50 playable characters with unique personalities) will have to find strength to fight in a war they never wanted, and to find solace in even the grimmest situations.  Each one of the characters carries their own personal set of “perks”, or as the game calls them, “potentials.”  These unlock overtime, and throughout the game the roster of more than one hundred characters each have a different set of eight “potentials”, some good, and some bad.  For example, a unit may gain the ability to occasionally fire off a barrage bullets without the enemy having any chance to dodge from the aptly named “undodgeable shot” potential.  Or, a unit may slowly lose hit points during their turn because they are allergic to the terrain.  This makes for a great strategic gameplay mechanic as you will have to change your line up of soldiers for each mission in order to have the best possible team for the situation.Short Version:+Great Story+One-of-a-kind art style+Great Soundtrack+Great Characters+Great Gameplay+DLC includedTL;DRGet.  This.  Game.Perfect Port!			"

												This is a rather unique game. Having played lots of JRPGs on PS1 and PS2, I'd honestly have to say I've never encountered game play mechanics quite like this. Though much of the story is presented in a somewhat manga inspired ""talking heads"" panels format, the game is suprisingly polished in so many ways. The stylized ""drawn"" graphics, the comic book text sound effect words hovering over things in game, along with a nice bit of background information on characters, weapons, and the world available to read, and a story that's (thus far) been pretty fun all contribute to the game's uniqueness.The combat system is also interesting, combining third person perspective real-time control elements with turn based strategy elements. Though by no means difficult, the game does offer a reasonable challenge on first play through, requiring thoughtful consideration of how much you want to upgrade your troop's levels through repeatable skirmishes. There are often a few approaches to combat situations depending on how you utilize your ""orders"" (aka special temporary buffs) and class types. I've not quite beaten it yet, and though the story has a rather cliche love interest as a dominant part of the storyline, it's been a fun game thus far. Definately worth grabbing for $5 to $10 if you appreciate the art of game design. They did a lot of things right in this one, and the PC port is pretty solid (though I suggest using a control pad for moving your tank around. The controls get a little weird on tank movement if done with a mouse.)			"

												A very enjoyable tactical-shooting game, with beautiful graphic and characters.Though in early game the snipers and lancers would miss as often as when you play in XCOM: E.U, but thankfully, mid game they become better, when best equipped, they're your dependable killing-machines.Sorry if I sound bitter with the chance of misses, but it really gets on my nerve at times. I guess its a step we'll have to face when playing tactical shooting games. Nevertheless, Valkyria is a great (old) game that I've cherished since the minute I played it. Good graphics, even the characters are adorable with their background and shortcomings. Especially love Alicia, Rosie and Selvaria! You will need a lot of time to gett used on how to battle the enemies, and getting an A-rank in every chapter. It os well advised to watch some guides if you're trying to complete all the Medals provided.The Valkyrur effect is also awesome :)You really should buy this.The best in Valkyria Chronicles ever.

This port shares the originals strong points and even allow us to run it at 60fps which makes this game feel so much smoother.The game itself has stunning hand-drawn graphics accompanied with a beautiful soudtrack composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, also known for his work on games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XII, GrimGrimoire, Breath of Fire V, etc. Lovable characters, pretty damn awesome story, fun, simple and solid battle system... Considering all this comes with all the DLCs of the initial release, it's well worth every penny you'd spend on it.			"

												If you arent sure - catch it on a sale. If steam thinks you want it - chances are, you'll love it!I caught Valkyria Chronicles on sale for $7 US and decided to give it a spin. Steam has been hassling me about buying it for a year or more maybe, and though the girl with the rifle reminiscent of an SKS had me intrigued, I am somewhat prejudiced against anime products finding them to be immature and corny. How wrong I have been!I was immediatly hooked, being a WW2 buff, and finding the universe to be believable enough to be engrossing, yet fantastical enough to keep me guessing as to what is next. I have never played a turn-based/rpg/squad-based-shooter (whatever this game is) like this before, and felt that it would be inferior to real-time control. I find this style to be quite enjoyable, and easy to get into. The story has me hooked, hitting me personally, as I come from a tight-knit small rural town similar to the one featured in the prologue, and the parallels in this game world vs the real world, where politics, economics, and even racism is astonishingly close - far from the immature drivel i passed it off to be. At this point, I am willing to try other anime titles and not judge them by their style.			"

												Now this is a darn fine game.Valkyria Chronicles is a gorgeous, fascinating combination of strategy and third person shooter.  The game takes place in an allegorical version of Europe in World War II and follows the citizen soldiers of Squad Seven as their country of Gallia is invaded by the much larger Empire.  I found the characters extremely likable and the story to be engaging.As solid as the story is, however, the traits that stood out the most to me were the presentation and gameplay.  As is evidenced by the screenshots, the game is flat out gorgeous.  The entire thing looking like a pencil drawing that is as majestic in motion as it is in stills.  And the combination of a top-down turn-based tactical map that transitions into a real-time third person view works astoundingly well.When Valkyria Chronicles was a PS3 exclusive, I recommended it to everyone I could.  Now that it’s on Steam, I’m excited to do the same again.			"

												A top notch JRPG from SEGA that has been ported well to accommodate PC playability with ease. Turn-based, action point system of combat makes strategy and planning an important factor for gameplay.Aggrevating at first, but once you get the hang of it, you learn to make the best of your limited move-pool and skillfully take out opponents in seconds. Story is rich and told in chapters of a storybook. Cutscenes are impactful and full of emotion. Character development is excellent. From the beginning of the war to the end, the main characters clearly undergo psychological and emotional changes that fit perfectly with the plot. And duh, romance.Would definitely recommend this game if you like RICH STORIES and TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAMES.			"

												This game is aesthetically incredible. Tactical gameplay is familiar but the real time turns keep it very fresh. Characters are great and memorable through voice-acting, backstory, and design. The world seems to have a rich history but the overarching story itself is a little bit lacking compared to the rest of the game.Overall, one of my favorite games. A good choice if you would enjoy a semi-casual tactics game and definitely worth a try if you like JRPGs in general.			"

												Normally i don't bother writing reviews, but for this game, I'll make an exception. Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game in which you will love the characters, story, original gameplay and visuals. It is probably one of the best games I've played in the last year, and I've played a ton this year. The best way to describe this game is: a great anime with gameplay mixed in. Even if you aren't into anime itself, but are just looking for a game with a good story, Valkyria Chronicles got you covered. The game is presented to you in a book with different chapters, each chapter has a number of episodes which can contain: gameplay, cutscenes or dialogue scenes. Visually, Valkyria Chronicles is also very appealing. The game looks like an anime, but with a sort of painted vibe to it.Valkyria Chronicles' story isn't always about the pure fighting in a war, but really gives you a look at the lives of those soldiers fighting the war. Because of this, you really start to care for the characters, and might cry when one of them dies in battle (because the game has a permadeath system, but I'm not sure if this also applies to the main characters). But the main characters aren't the only ones you will get to know, because every unit you can use in the game has it's own backstory (although not as extensive as the MC's). During the game, there will be moments where you go through all kinds of emotions, from laughing to even crying.The gameplay in itself is pretty solid and an entirely new take on the turn-based strategy. Each turn, you have a number of Command Points (CP). These CP determine the amount of moves you can make, so you can move the same unit more then once. Using a birds-eye view, you determine which unit you're going to move and to where. Once you pick a unit, the game changes to a third-person perspective, and you can move the unit like in third-person games for as long as you have action points (AP). Once per move, the unit can also take an action.I would love to see this kind of gameplay again, the only throwback is that the screen in which you choose which unit you want to move doesn't always have a clear image of the environment (especially in the beginning). This resulted in me sometimes picking a unit, thinking i could move somewhere, only to realise that there's a steep hill in the way.			"

												Fabulous and gorgeous from the first sight, very original to its core and very japanese with that, inheriting all those special ""J"" things, like the gals with big eyes and boobs, and cute little pet everyone loves... etc.I've made two different opinions on this game: as a game enthusiast, who loves different approaches, unstandard design decisions, it's - ""Whoa! 9.5/10! Best for every money!""But as a gamer with tendency to realism and perfectionism... while playing I was confused so many times trying to get those achievements... so I'm not feeling the game concept was right. In fact, there was so many furious ""Why?!!"" and ""Oh, really?!"" while I was getting a perfect from this game, so my final count drops to 7/10.Buy it, if you're a fan of the games in total, or if you're deep into all the ""J"" stuff. The game will perfectly suits in your collection.And DON'T buy Valkyria Chronicles, if you can't stand anime stuff for long and want all the achievements. Or if you want a realistic story about war. Or good tactics game. Because there, to get ""A"" (""SS"") rating, you need to forget about good strategies like move carefully, stay covered, flanking enemies and so on. To get ""A"" rating you need to pick one scout and run like hell on enemies positions, dodging tons of bullets.One of the most intriguing features at the start of the game as unique bio's on every soldier in your squad, meaning different behavior at the battlefield... quickly becomes a burden, because almost everybody are broken in some way. That means, you cannot collect a dream team, you need to pick different people for every mission, even for different terrains, and hey! it is not so easy, because of the way the management in the game organized.To speak of controls in the general... well, optimization from console to the PC went not too bad, but controls, and more of all, use of the mouse... can be a real pain. Especially while driving a tank (another potentially great feature went really bad on PC).Well, like I already said, game's facinating - for anime fans, and may be even dull for those who aren't. Tread carefully!			"

												I never write reviews, but I feel strongly enough about this game that I feel I need to.Valkyria Chronicles is not a terrible game. I hesitate to even call it a bad game. In many ways, it's promising. The first six or seven missions are quite fun, moderately challenging, and really seemed to be setting the game up to be great.However, around the eighth mission, the game really takes a dive in quality. It begins to introduce ""gimmicks"" to levels, such as supertanks that can't be damaged until a cinematic happens, an immortal Valkyrie that can move around the map and one-shot your units, mortars that target random areas and force you to waste movement points to get out of their way, and armored cars that move around a city block.The gimmicks themselves aren't bad. Advance Wars, for instance, was a franchise that had a lot of them. Huge cannons, giant lasers, tank-devouring blobs, etc., and yet managed to make them quite fun. In many ways, in fact, this game reminds me of the Advance Wars model.The key difference is that in Advance Wars, it was easy to see how the gimmicks worked. You could easily view the range of the giant cannons or the movement speed of super-tanks. Here, that's not an option. The only way to learn about how the gimmicks work is to experience them firsthand, since there is no way to see their range, movement, or how they operate. As a result, there's no way to fairly deal with these threats without repeating a level a few times or savescumming constantly. If you're like me, and hate cheesing your way through levels, you're forced to replay a level multiple times just to see how the gimmick responds to each new move of yours (Oh, you didn't realize that the turn after the Valkyrie appears, she'd be able to attack all your units except the ones that were hiding behind your tank or the enemy's supertank? Hope you saved at the right turn with your single save slot!).Honestly, it's very disappointing. The first few missions were quite fun, and I really tried to press on once I started getting to the gimmicks, but ultimately, I can't recommend this game, even if you can get it really cheap. It doesn't reward skill. It just rewards savescumming.			"

												I can't say much about the gameplay and story yet, but I'm very, VERY impressed with the quality of this port.I signed the petition to SEGA a long time ago and was surprised with the news that this game was coming to PC after such a long time, I'm kind of broke but pre-ordered it anyway. However, I was very afraid if I could run this on my toaster (NVIDIA 640m) based on my terrible experience with the Final Fantasy XIII port and was overwhelmed when I tried to change the resolution to 1080 and got solid 60 FPS along with some tears of joy. I can't recall another game that played so smoothly on my toaster. This is ****ing great. Dark Souls II port is awesome too, I think FROM and SEGA are doing a nice work with the master race community, but we want more! So, please, SEGA, bring us Resonant of Fate too so I can pre-order it too, just TAKE MY FREAKING MONEY!I will tell about the game itself once I have the time to play it, but, overall, 10/10.			"

												A WW2 Era game with some fantasy aspects.Interesting game with a vast cast of characters to go through in the Personnel tab, who will evolve as you use them in missions more. Kinda like understanding more of themselves and their base characteristics and how they were drafted into the military.Challenging missions, but it is sometimes difficult to plan your strategy when you have no idea what the enemy is going to do next, but I suppose that is part of the fun.A very good port over game from the console platform.Controls are smooth with the keyboard and viewing mechanics are possible with the mouse.English subtitles with Japanese voice? Yes please.There is English dub for those who prefer that.It plays like XCOM: Enemy Unknown but without the grids. 9/10 would recommend. Would play again.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is what happens when the country that brought us Final Fantasy, Hello Kitty, and Princess Mononoke decides to remake X-Com.  Alternatively, it's what happens when the country that brought us Code Geass decides to remake Final Fantasy Tactics, except with tanks.It's the 1930s on NOT EARTH and NOT RUSSIA is invading NOT FRANCE in order to capture their supplies of NOT OIL in order to continue supplying their NOT WORLD WAR TWO campaign against NOT THE ALLIES. You play as Welkin Gunther, the son of the former hero of NOT WORLD WAR ONE who has, for some reason, inherited his father's tank. Seriously. The thing is just sitting in his barn as if it were his dad's old Mustang, and not, you know, an armored weapon of war. The plot takes the Final Fantasy Tactics approach of having a linear campaign with some side missions you can do to grind levels if needed. There is an interesting storytelling conceit in that the framing device for the game is a history book written about the exploits of your character and his squad during the war. . . like Final Fantasy Tactics. Except this is different because instead of moving a glowing dot around a map, you're turning pages in a book. And stuff. That's basically the game. You watch a bunch of cut scenes, do a tactical combat mission, then watch some more cut scenes. Occasionally you visit your headquarters to train up your troops and research new weapon technology. So basically, what will make or break the game for you is A. how much you're willing to put up with linear storytelling, and B. how much you like the combat. I happen to like the combat a lot. Most of the combat takes place on a top-down map, with your units and the enemy units represented as circular icons. You receive a certain number of ""Command Points,"" based on the mission and the number of special character units you take along with you. Each Command Point allows you to activate a unit one time. During it's activation, you jump into the unit's head, controlling it directly Gears of War style. During each activation, you can move a certain distance and take one attack. Attack accuracy is based on weapon and character skill, headshots deal extra damage. Interesting enough, Valkyria Chronicles seems to take a page from the tabletop game ""Infinity,"" or perhaps the old board game ""Space Hulk."" Rather than going down the list and activating each unit once, you can choose to use multiple command points to activate a unit multiple times. This gives you a chance to, say, take a followup shot with your sniper when RNG screws you on the first shot, or unload multiple rocket rounds into a tank with your one anti-tank dude.Characters are divided into five classes. Scouts carry bolt-action rifles, move fast, and have the best vision range. Lancers are slower, but carry anti-tank rockets that can penetrate tank armor. Engineers are a bit slower than Scouts, but are still fairly fast, and can repair your tank and replenish ammo supplies. Snipers are the slowest, but have great accuracy at long range. Shock Troopers. . . do something, I guess. I still haven't figured out how best to use these guys. And then there's the tank. It's a tank. It's awesome. It can roll over enemy emplacements, shrug off small-arms fire, and blast the hell out of their tanks. On the other hand, if it blows up, you lose. And it costs 2 Command Points to activate.All this ends up forcing you to use the kind of combined arms tactics that characterized World War II. You end up using your tank as mobile cover for your infantry, picking off enemy Lancers while the Tank clears a path. Or you end up using the tank to bombard enemy positions to clear firing lines for your infantry. Good, fun stuff. TL:DR version: It's X-Com meets Final Fantasy Tactics. If that sounds fun, give it a shot.			"

												Nothing much else to say here that everyone else have already said. Graphics and animation are nice and top notch despite its age. That ""watercolor"" style is simply gorgeous.Story and lore is pretty rich although all the background text you unlock is entirely optional for those who love to learn all about the world.Combat system is one of a kind and very solid. I've yet to find any other game that is any bit similar or as refined. It's turn-based, but when you select a unit, you actually personally control that unit during its actions through third-person. Enemies react to your actions during this phase too which was mind-blowing to me the first time. When a unit attempts an attack instead of an actual hit percentage you get a cone of potential directions of fire and the amount of shots the person will make. RPG aspect is very minimal though since the only real customizing feature are just a couple of unique weapon upgrades and how you outfit your tanks. Regular equipment upgrades work on the entire squad and the class level ups are similar. You'll have more than enough exp and money to buy and upgrade everything so there's almost no risk of choice. My only complaint is the replayability of the game. Basically, unless you are aiming for absolute 100%, there's no real joy or reason in playing it again. New game plus keeps the enemies exactly the same while retaining your squad's upgrades from the end, so you literally cannot die through over half of the game at this point. Although the story is good, it still gets bland after you hear or see it several times.			"

												Gameplay: great. It's not very tactical at times and the AI is really bad (either scripted to stay in place or run to a pre-defined destination), but the unique mixture of third person-perspective action and turn-based strategy somehow works very well, making the game approachable for the fans of both genres. Missions are varied and don't let the player get bored by repetitive actions. The game is very enticing and it's too easy to suddenly realize that it's 2 AM now and you have spent half of the night playing.Story: characters are cliche and plot is cliche as well. Whoever wrote them though made a very good use of those cliches though, making the characters very likeable and easy to get attached to. Sure, it's not the greatest piece of fiction world has ever seen, but it works. If you're a teenager and this is your first jRPG, you will probably love it.Graphics: stylized to look like hand-drawn Japanese animation. If that's not your thing, you may have a problem, but otherwise it's clear and easy on the eyes. The port to PC was done very well so framerate is smooth. As a side note, character design was taken care of by a rather well-known hentai artist and, surprisingly, did not result in tons of fanservice but rather gave the game a no-nonsense war fiction feel.Sound: I'm obviously biased here as the music was done by my favourite VGM composer, Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy XII among others). I will spare you from singing praises, just listen to the battle tracks which he excels at. Voice acting is very competent in Japanese version and average in English, where it's hit or miss. If you don't mind a liberal translation, Japanese voices and English subtitles are probably the best way in this case.Summary: definitely worth buying and playing. This kind of game is what you would expect to see on handheld consoles, which is all the more reason to try one when it finally got a PC version. Score: 9/10			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical turn based RPG with real time movement and aiming, set in an alternate reality Europe during the second world war (or second Europan war as it is known in game). You play a militia squad of a small country attempting to protect your people from the the greed of two superpowers. That being said the game world has its own history and politics with only thematic links to reality. One such link is the inclusion of concentration camps, a dark topic which contrasts with cheesier, anime trope ridden, writing. There were multiple moments when I would cringe at the behaviour of these grown adult soldiers, but this did little to take away from my overall enjoyment of the game. What the story does that is most important is set up unique tactical scenarios where strategies from previous battles will not be useful. The levels are presented episodically so you are free to return to any level you have already completed. The game is linear, with occasional side missions being the only exception. Your squad is fully customizable, allowing you to select what class units you want, select their weapon, and to chose among a variety of characters with their own traits. The one disappointment I had was that I did not feel quite as connected with my squad members as I thought I would have. The focus of the character building is on a set of core characters, with the side characters getting their back story told through text that you unlock on a personnel page. I was, however, able to assign them roles and play to their strength in the battles. Outside of the battles you have the option to upgrade your units and equipment, though initially the equipment progression is linear. During battles you can play cautiously, but you are rewarded for completing missions quickly, pushing you to take risks.All in all this is an absolutely fantastic game. I strongly recommend it.			"

												Really good port of a really good game. Got this game when i got my PS3. I ignored it for about a year because it didnt really interest me, but once I started playing i knew i was missing out.It puts a nice twist on tactics based games. Once you select a unit, instead of moving them on the overhead map and attacking, you actually control the character in 3rd person view and can interact with the environment. When you are in the stage enemies can attack you instead of standing there letting you run past. If you are familiar with xcom the attacking system is a little different. Instead of rolling the dice you have a crosshair that you can move to different parts of the body. On human troops headshots do extream damage and on tanks they have radiators, which allows light infantry units to damage to damage the tank.The story is eh, but the artstyle is great. Every character has personalitys or ""Potentials"" that can make or break a battle. Some units gets a defence boost when under fire, while one outright refuses to attack due to being a pacifist. If units are next to each other, there is a chance they will shoot with you when you fire, allows you to make some devastating combo attacks.Difficulty wise, it can be a roller coaster. On chapter 7 for example, you fight a very difficult and rather long mission, while chapter 6 and 8 can be rather easy, though the difficulty kinda levels out near the end of the game. Despite this, the game requires little to no grinding, which is a plus in my book. You can go the entire game without beating a single skirmish or extra mission. Once you beat the game you can start again in New Game+, which allows you to keep all levels and equipment, which means you can absolutly destroy the missions you once had trouble with, and along with that, you unlock an extra difficulty on skirmishes.All in all, its a great game. Is it for everyone? Of course not, its a strategy game with an anime-esq artstyle.			"

												I'll leave the extansive reviews to someone more invested in them, but World War Anime is actually one of the closer games to a tabletop wargame and is tons of fun.

Valkyria Chronicles takes a buttload of planning and patience which are not my strongsuits in games LOL. BUT  its still very very fun, especially when things go according to plan. At times it can be rage inducing tho!! So far the story has been amazing and a bit emotional which I love in a game. Def a 10/10 and a worthy addition to anyone's library			"

												If you like both anime and xcom, than you will probably have an o-rgasm playing this. But even if you just like strategy turn-based combat games, you can't miss this title. It's pretty unique in his genre, both artistically and gameplay wise, so you should give it a try - especially on sale. That said, expect cheesy dialogues and strange narrative choices. Story is overall good, but it is presented in an anime-way that may not appeal everybody (myself included). Also, the game features great music tracks.			"

												As a person that does not watch anime or has never played any Japanese RPGs, this game struck me as an awesome looking WW2 game with a Japanese twist. I was rather sceptical about purchasing it because I did not want it to be like the horrendous Girls und Panzer anime based on WW2 and World of Tanks. However, I can honestly say this game is AWESOME!It ticks so much boxes in all the right places. The graphics has a nice cartoony yet pretty feel to it, gameplay is smooth and stable, and the story (which people have criticized) is actually pretty good! The story is simple. In an alternate planet, in the continent of Europa (which is obviously Europe) consists of two superpowers, the autocratic Empire and the Atlantic Federation. After a resource known as Ragnite (which powers everything) goes scarce, the Empire invades the neighbouring peaceful nation of Gallia to take their Ragnite reserves. The story is viewed from the perspective of Welkin, a nature-loving nerd who is caught up in the Empire's invasion of Gallia. There, he meets Alicia, a baker who took up arms to defend her town from the Empire long enough for its citizens to evacuate. The story telling in this game is sublime, and I found myself sucked straight into it after the first 10 minutes. After some mumbo jumbo Alicia and Welkin are drafted into the Gallian Army. This is where the game properly begins. For those who've played Xcom: Enemy Unknown, this is exactly like it. You have your HUB where you can recruit and train soldiers for your squad. There are a lot of different squad members you can choose, and each one has different voices and their own stories which I find pretty awesome. There are some characters you get attached to, like the homosexual Lancer named Jann (who is voiced by the same guy who voiced Jake in Adventure Time.) There is also a R&D department where you can buy upgrades for your weapons and tanks. That's the story out of the way. Basically, this is the anime version of Xcom but with WW2 themes. Each round you can choose where to position who (there are five classes of units)  and battle. To move a unit, you have to use one Command Point. Unlike Xcom, upon selecting a unit to move, you take full control of them from a third person perspective, allowing you to run around, explore the map and fire at the enemies at your will. This is the same with tanks.  As the game progresses, the challenge increases. However, there are many moments where you will just think ""WHAT THE HELL KIND OF BS IS THAT!"" This game is brutal when it comes to the missions. You've  made so much progress in a mission, and then you fail all because of an absolutely STUPID trickshot that blows up the Edelweiss. *cough cough GIANT OP TANK cough cough* I've had many rage moments where I just slam on my keyboard in anger and alt+F4 the game in rage. Pretty much every mission was like that. Have one or two game overs that end in rage, and then have a stunning victory. Be prepared for it.On that note, one of the things that I did not find enjoyable is that the game can become extremely difficult (such as the second mission.) These particular missions you have no choice but to use the method the game expects you to, not using your own strategy against the enemy. I found this a real problem in an otherwise perfect game. Especially with boss battles (I hate the boss fights in this game.) I really wish that one was able to choose their own strategy and use it against the enemy. While some missions do present this ability where there are multiple ways of winning (be it spamming scouts and doing a hard/fast approach, or go in guns blazing with the Edelweiss and a buttload of Lancers and shock troopers) it still isn't perfect. Due to the lack of variation in enemy types, and the linearity of the levels, there isn't a whole lot of Supreme Commander stye strategy going on here. Not to mention that the A.I can be a bit too smart sometimes.There is also a grading system that grades you on how well you beat the mission. However to attain a perfect score you must 100% of the time do the super scout approach. This is a good game. If you like turn-based strategy games like Xcom, this is the game for you. If you're a casual player (which is highly unlikely since Xcom isn't a casual game,) then don't go for it, and watch the anime (read below) instead.EDIT: I discovered the existance of a ""Valkyria Chronicles anime"" that is practically scene by scene anime of the game but with some minor story differences. It's not brilliant, but it's a hell of a lot better than *shudders* Girls und Panzer.EXTRA REVIEW!: Valkyria Chronicles Anime (SPOILERS AHEAD)At the time of this review I am seven episodes in, and there is not much I can say really except for the  differences in character for some people, namely um... ALICIA, WELKIN AND FALDIO! To add more drama into the show the makers added some sort of love triangle, so now Alicia doesn't know if she wants the W or the F. Speaking of Alicia, she's a total B*TCH in the anime. In the game, she's very caring and you can see she has a thing for Welkin from the start. In the anime however, she constantly yells at him, calling him a ""weirdo."" Well, you kinda would agree with her because Welkin is really weird in the anime, he constantly seems really oblivious to the situation around him, never serious as if he has a cloud in his head instead of a brain. I love the scene where Irene threatens to tell everyone he tried to♥♥♥♥♥♥her if he doesn't give her an interview and he starts laughing innocently as if she just told a funny joke.Faldio acts like a charismatic lady's man, but the way the writers wrote him makes him look like a generic  ""jock."" He automatically starts gunning for Alicia and tries to win her heart by doing stupid things, such as telling everybody they saw each other naked (Alicia caught him shirtless and flipped her sh*t, and Faldio snuck up on her putting up her washing on a clothes line and picked up some of her underwear, and again she flipped her sh*t.) and then used Greek history to compare them to Aphrodite and Ares. The other characters are pretty much the same. Jann is still the awesome homosexual guy (except that he isn't voiced by John DiMaggio. Seriously, they should have made him deliver his lines in Japanese.) There are also some other characters such as Faldio's sargeant, but they aren't really that memorable. Also, they made Maximillian seem like such a boring villain. In the game he sees everything with a hint of boredom, and isn't afraid of showing his wrath when needed. In the anime, he's bored pretty much all of the time. That's really all I have to say about the anime. If you're a big fan of  VC, then have a go at watching it. I think it has remained loyal to the essence of the game, but does attempt to deviate (which is not a bad thing!) They tried their best.			"

												I have mixed feelings about Valkyria Chronicles. By one side, I really loved this game, I obviously would not spend 36 hours of my free time to play a game I do not like. By other side... there are too many aspects I could not accept, in general I was disappointed and not impressed. Well, I will try to explain.Best parts of the game are setting and lore. It developed brilliantly, Valkyria Chronicles is not just another fairy-tale about ""good and bad guys"". It is a tour through a fictional but very realistic world that has its own history and its own problems, like economical and political issues or cultural acceptance of national minorities. There is a lot of attention to small details, well, just look at this glossary, where you can find a lot of various information, from historical facts to weight of anti-tank gun. Look at these maps, where each street has its own name. For example, did you noticed that one of the streets of Bruhl is named in honor of general Gunther, father of our protagonist? Look at biographies of characters, not only major characters but every insignificant infantryman in our squad has its own small story. All this, taken together, creates a magical atmosphere and immersion. I believed in Valkyria Chronicles, I delved in this game and I loved it, but......but then, I was faced with characters that inhabit this world, and I felt myself, well... cheated. Problem is, I just can not believe in storyline of Valkyria Chronicles. It filled with obvious cliche, like ""war is bad, friendship is good and, despite everything, life is going on"". Most situations looks frankly false for me. I guess, story was designed by people, who know nothing about army, relationships and discipline. Watching countless cutscenes, too often I was not sure, should I laugh or cry. My point is... I do not demand realism in game about magical girls called ""Valkyrias"", but if game pretends to talk about serious issues - such as patriotism, xenophobia, humane attitude to enemies and eternal question ""do end justifies the means?"" et cetera - I expect that these issues will be highlighted properly. I could not understand, what this storyline actually is... is it a bad comedy or slobbery drama or something else, I do not know. Lack of a good story was especially disappointing for me if compared with brilliantly developed setting, so huge is this contrast.I do not believe in protagonists. A funny thing is that it was easier for me to believe in personalities of antagonists - commanders of imperial army - who are not stereotypical villains ""lets destroy the world because we can"", but people with their understanding of situation and their reasons to fight. I even feel slight sympathy for antagonists like Jaeger and Selvaria. And for ending... I am trying to not use memes, but in this particular situation, I simply can not find another word but ""facepalm"". Just facepalm. This ending is terrible, a classic ""deus ex machina"" in its worst shape. *sigh*Well, this was my opinion about storyline. As for gameplay, I have very mixed feelings too. Combat system is quite interesting and promising, but also it has a lot of flaws. It is absolutely imbalanced, to be short: in most missions you will need only one scout to win the battle, and all other units are useless. To be fair, there is a couple of situations where you will need to use tank or shocktrooper, but in most cases all you need is a scout (obviously, this will be Alicia) and several useful spells (they called ""orders""). Lancers? What lancers? Engineers? Never seen a single one on the field. Tank? Clumsy piece of ma... well, metal. AI is terrible. It tends to run in circles like headless chicken and often skips turns without any reason. Of course, flaws of AI are compensated with large numbers of enemies but, surely, quantity will not help the imperial army to stand against unbeatable Alicia.Surprisingly, despite everything, battles was interesting and enjoyable for me. Well, this is my opinion: Valkyria Chronicles is not a strategic or tactical game. It is a puzzle game. The goal is to end missions in less possible count of turns, and suddenly I found that it is quite challenging. I replayed battles again and again, trying to solve this puzzles, and I enjoyed this, even despite all this annoying ""evades and misses"". Even bosses can be defeated in one or two turns, and doing so gave me a nice feeling of completion.Last but not least. Game looks gorgeous, I absolutely loved this art-style. Characters looks attractive, landscapes are beautiful, Alicia is cute and Selvaria has huge ch... well, charisma. Eye candy.So. I can cautiously recommend this game. If you can push yourself through countless silly cutscenes and accept weird combat system, then you probably will love Valkyria Chronicles. Actually, there is some good fun, buried under a thick layer of husk. In fact, there is only one thing that makes me sad... I am absolutely sure that setting of Valkyria Chronicles deserves much better story.And, well... if it is one of the best japanese games then I hope that I will never see their worst. Valkyria Chronicles might be decent, but consider it as masterpiece? No, not even close.			"

												Six years after the original debut, there is still no real successor or alternative to this title on the big screen (only PSP sequels). It is still a very good game and very much enjoyable if you are its intended audience and understand what the game is about, but it does show some age. The assets were made for 720p TV and it looks considerably dated today. The port makes almost no attempt to accommodate PC interfaces, resulting in a confused mess of Tab, F, Enter and Space Bar and delays when navigating the menus. Even the story feels old (even though it was a fine piece back in 2008) as today's games and anime have evolved into ones with better storytelling techniques.Still, VC1 remains an excellent title. There is great gameplay for those who understand what it is and an enjoyable story for the open-minded who don't categorically hate anime. The steam release is made even better with the inclusion of all extra content formerly DLCs, such as Edy's Detachment or expert skirmishes, all for this bargain price. And yes, it includes the Japanese voice option just as the PS3 version did.If you count yourself as an enthusiast of turn-based strategy, you cannot pass this one up.			"

												Oh SEGA, now you have noticed how the PC Master Race cherishes such masterpieces, like this one, with GREAT value.Anyone who likes any strategy role playing games is STRONGLY recommended to get this game, or at least have a look on how this game shaped up to be one of the BEST games of 2008.The port is well optimized for PC play, though bugs and crashes do exist. Hopely that will be patched out later.Now we await for the next port(s) or surprises, SEGA. Don't let us down.			"

Biased review: This game is ♥♥♥♥in' great.Valkyria Chronicles is about a guy with a marginal amount of conscription military training drafted as an NCO due to a sudden war with Germany--no, Russia--no, Imperials. Since it's much like Poland or France's lunch with Germany in 1939/1940 (or if you prefer Finland's lunch with Russia during the same time) the NCO pool is empty and they appoint Welkin Gunther as platoon commander of 7th platoon. With the lovely Capt. Eleanor Varrot as company commander, you're turned into a militia level army ranger platoon mixed with the resource problems of Rommel in North Africa.- Where are you going with this?The story is stupid but gets better. Just skip the pig stuff and you'll get Montgomery and Patton chasing after you eventually.- B-but my ranks are terrible..Ranks mean nothing unless you like Dark Souls speed runs and hate video games. Focus on not killing off best girls/guys unless you want to be the laughing stock of every social gathering.- PS3 is garbage. Ports are garbage. I bet you like kissing girls too.Shut your mouth. The port is great. Runs on toasters or giant metal toasters and looks great. Sega used to make toasters named after biblical publications. They know what they're doing. Transparency between platforms is a good thing because PC will always win. Now we have japanese XCOM: Advance Wars.- Wooooooooooooww instantly killed.Remember: shock troops are the backbone of a breach and clear team. Recon are good for recon, high mobility flanks, cleaning leftovers, or tactically securing objectives. You'd be surprised how many people throw all recon at a problem and wonder why two Imperial shock troopers clean house like Rocky Balboa with an M60.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a 3rd person strategy shooter set in an world inspired by WW2. Fans of XCOM or fire emblem should find themselves at home with the gameplay. It's a relatively light hearted war story with a focus on the main characters. The cell-shaded graphics stand the test of time and PC optimization is solid. I loved this game to bits and so glad Sega brought it over to PC. Also there are waifus.Longer VersionOptimizationValkyria Chronicles is a PS3 port, and they did an great job with the mouse and keyboard transition. The game supports higher resolution and fps than the original, although cutscenes are still PS3 quality. The default mouse sensitivity is a bit low for my tastes, so you might want to bump it up to 100 in configurations. No crashes on my endGameplayValkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy-third person shooter hybrid. Think a fusion of XCOM and Fire Emblem. In the game the player are given command points (CP) for each turn in a overview map. Moving a unit takes up CP and will turn the game into a 3rd person shooter. In 3rd person the characters are given an action points (AP) bar, which depletes with each step a character makes. The objectives for missions vary, but most of the time it requires capturing a enemy base, and player is encouraged with more XP and money to win with fewer turns. Permadeath is in place for any non-essential characters, so protect your waifus/husbando. I should mention that you have a couple of turns to tag fallen waifus before permadeath occurs. Your soldiers are all given a background and perks unique to their background. The leveling and upgrade tree are class dependent so no need to train individuals. Note: There is a almost gamebreaking strategy by the end of game, but there is a rather large difficultly spike in the middle story.StoryThe game is set in a mixture of WWI and WW2, and your fighting for a neutral country caught in up in a larger conflict. Some of the stories and character rely on anime tropes, so if you absolutely hate that stuff you probably won't like the game. Ultimately the game is more about the characters and their reactions to the war than the actual conflict itself. I played on the PS3 and thought it was a humanistic stories slewn with optimism for a better future. By the end of the game I also connected with at least a few of the characters. (I'm being vague to prevent spoilers) This is also one of the few games that touch on racism in a mature way, so major props.			"

												A decent port of a fantastic game. Not particularly well-balanced, and the plot is really anime (whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to you), but one of the most unique and fun takes on the Strategy/RPG genre.A few notes about the port:* Resolution options poll from your monitor, same with FPS limit (caps at refresh rate).* Cutscenes are (unfortunately) pre-rendered, as they were on the PS3. As such they're a bit jittery.* Dual audio is in, but the subtitle track is the same as the PS3 version -- It's a dubtitle track. Again, up to you how big of a deal that is.* No graphics quality options. Considering the game was developed with a custom engine for a single platform, that isn't a huge surprise, but worth noting.* FPS-wise, it runs like a dream. Haven't seen it dip below 60 ingame once.While it's not quite the gold standard of port features, it works and works well.The game's real fun, comes with all of the DLC for free (which adds quite a bit of content!), and if you missed it in its original run you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.

												Since I've only started playing, I won't presume to know enough about the game to give you a full review, but I do have a couple of impressions already. The first of which, is that the game looks cool and interesting. Graphics aren't too impressive, but aren't bad either. Voice acting is solid.As for the story and game mechanics I still can't say much, except that the story looks like it has a lot of potential, and the battles are quite difficult, to say the least. I consider myself a reasonably experienced Strategy/RPG gamer, yet I find the battles in this game very challenging. Actually, ""very challenging"" is an understatement too. I guess I should have used the word ""frustrating"" instead, but since I've only just started, I'm giving the game the benefit of the doubt and assuming it simply has a somewhat steep learning curve. :)Anyway, I'll keep you people posted with new impressions as I play, hopefully to make this post worthy to be considered a full review eventually. :)			"

												I was quite pleased that Sega chose to release this game a full 10 hours earlier, but it kinda sucks for me because I also have my finals in Microeconomics tomorrow morning.Anyhow, this is a wonderful port: it supports so many resolutions and has uncapped its framerates (unlike other console ports). That said, you won't need a flashy desktop PC with multiple graphic cards to enjoy it - it runs very smoothly on my 2 year old Dell XPS 15 (GT 630M, i5 Ivy Bridge).I haven't played the game on other platforms, but I am a fan of the genre (I loved XCOM, Shadowrun Returns, The Banner Saga, and turn-based 4X games like Civilization and Endless Legend), and I'm having a lot of fun so far. I really loved that there are voice options in either English or Japanese, and that all the DLCs are included. Being a history geek, I really dig the alternate history theme in 1930s Europe.I'll be updating this review once I finish the game (which won't be until for a few weeks), but it would still pretty much be a thumbs up anyway for all that I've said above.

												Great SRPG from Sega , awesome PC-Port.Your country is under attack by Empire Forces and you , are General's son. You have it in your veins. So you grab your stuff, join the army and prepare your forces for incoming attacks. This game has great tactical stuff and rpg aspects also, but I must say , it's a turn-based game, but even if you don't like them, you should try this game. Characters can be developed and learn new classes and you can also improve your equipments or your own tank. Visuals are awesome, like a visual-novel with anime graphics.Best thing about Valkyria Chronicles is, that you have your own squad. You recruit them, train their class and build your own strategies. Why is it that good? Every character has different traits and mood. There are even tsundere or introvert shy girls in my squad , whose defense or accuracy drops when a male soldier is near them. Yeah..love can bloom on the battlefield alright.10/10 would bloom my love on the battlefield.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is easily one of the most amazing titles to be developed during the PS3/360/Wii console generation, if not one of the best games ever to be created.  Absolutely gorgeous visuals (which, let me assure you, remain completely amazing in this port and those concerned with FPS or Resolution will have 0 complaints), a beautiful soundtrack, incredibly innovative and well developped gameplay, and a cast of characters and story you absolutely will come to love.I can't recommend this game hard enough.

												If you have played Valkyria Chronicles before like I have, then you do not really need another reason to go ahead and buy this game as you should already own it. IF, on the off-chance you have never played this game or, dare I even contemplate this, heard of Valkyria Chronicles then you should continue reading on for reasons why you should!The art style is by far the first and most noticeable thing of this game. To sum it up quickly, it's beautiful and does nothing but enhance the games characters and story. Then you have the story itself, from beginning to end it is one of the better stories I have played in any form of RPG for a fair amount of time, with many an unexpected twist to be had during the course of it. The story is chaptered, with small episodes playing out as you progress through the book that you use through the course of the game. The book is also the main hub of the game, the usual subcommands and also allowing you to flick back through any episodes you want to watch again if you so wish.The battles are turn based but the amount of thought you sometimes need to make sure you can get those pesky A ranks later on is more than definitely required as even one wrong move will get one of your valuable units killed, and who really wants that now hmm? Treat the units carefully and yes, you may get a lower rank in battle but you can always go back and play them again for more experience. Each turn, you have a set amount of movements which is counted by CP. Each time you want to attack you use one CP to move into position before attacking although you could also be running, or flanking, or hiding away depending on how your battle is fairing. There are also skills in Battle which may consume CP aswell but have a strong effect on your Units. Some battles may also have what is referred to as ""Aces"", special enemies that give extra rewards for defeating them such as weapons and tank upgrades.After battle, you gain Experience, Money and sometimes loot used to help you in your fight against The Empire. The usual upgrades to both class and equipment exist, making sure that grinding although for the most part not necessary, is still a great way to keep all your units topped up and raring to go! The port itself is rather well done, nothing is lost from the PS3 to the PC as expected and unlike other ""certain ports"" that shall not be named, has some configuration for Resolution and the like.The main selling point as a returning player was, every DLC being included and creating the complete package. So all those extra challenge missions I was personally unable to complete back on original release I can now go ahead and do so.Hopefully this helps a little with your decision to purchase it, it really is one of the must-owns that was on the PS3 and works just as well on the PC whether you use Keyboard & Mouse or go with a Controller.

												I had my doubts before I played it since I got it out of humble bundle but this game is great. You really do grow attached to your squad. Each character has traits for personality, whenever good or bad but all of them contribute to your squad's strengths and weaknesses.   The storyline is actually pretty good as the game paints the inglorious picture of war and the music is fine enough not to be annoying to listen to which is a rarity because I usually mute game music.  Graphically, this game looks fantastic compared to other games, and this one is a port to boot! The voice acting for the JPN ver is passionately done right while it's so-so for the ENG ver. The mechanics are simple enough to enjoy while being challenging enough to have you fight hordes of enemies by tactic. One complain I have about the mechanics however, is that grade is essentially how fast you do a mission rather than how much of the enemy is destroyed. I have to blitzkrieg most missions to get the A rating within three turns otherwise it's a bust and reloaded save.   A lot of love was put into this game and that is very apparent with the amount of flavor text and world building it provides. I honestly would have paid full price for this game for how much I enjoyed it. SEGA did a great job, I'm for once not disapointed!			"

												I had a great time. Unfortunately it suffers from its anime roots from time to time.  Missions tend to be long, sometimes a half hour or more. It starts to cause problems in the midgame. Chapters 7 and 14 in particular were dealbreakers for me. Long cutscenes followed by a very long mission, followed by a nearly invincible enemy spawning and one-shotting me from miles away, requiring me to do it all again.  It absolutely took me out of the experience to have to retry a mission 3 or 4 times before I realize that it just isn't possible using any normal tactics and that those missions were all about prepositioning units to deal with insanely overpowered enemies that havent spawned yet, or else rely on an AI enemy or ally that is similarly overpowered but inconsistent.The gameplay is hella fun, the story is actually great, and the art style is capital F - Fantastic so it's absolutely worth playing.  Just be aware that sometimes the game wants you to jump through hoops instead of shoot people.  Don't be afraid to look up a guide if a mission seems to be impossible, especially on the two chapters I mentioned.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles holds a special place in my heart. I would throw all of my bananas at it. Because it deserves all of them and it is shame it didn't enjoy the success it should've gotten back in 2008.It's essentially an SRPG, JIm, but not as we know it. It looks better, it sounds better, it plays better. Everything about, like letting you take direct control of your troops in a 3rd person shooter style, to having all your troops have distinct personalities, to having death be permanent, to the audiovisual design ... it all feels deliberate. The setting is also novel for the genre, forgoing the typical fantasy for an alternate WOII. It even comes the closest to actually depicting the Holocaust of any game I played, a pretty ballsy move by itself. Ok, there are some anime tropes in the story and characters and not everyone likes those, but that's just one tiny drop in an ocean of awesome.Add to that a pretty solid pc port, letting you enjoy the watercolor pastel visuals in resplendent 1080p and 60fps, and you've got yourself a game you won't regret buying. I did, twice, and I'll fling poo at any naysayers who disagree.I rate this game 5 bananas out of 5			"

												The faults:-Scouts are overpowered.-Ranking system favors speed to the exclusion of all else.-Perfect ranks are often at least somewhat dependant on knowing events and soldier positions before the battle starts.-It could stand to be longer, at only about... 40+ missions with the DLC, the game is short by JRPG/SRPG standards. Long compared to anything else.-RNG hates you and wants to see you suffer. Like all other RNG's ever.That's literally all the flaws of the game. It's beautiful, has a large cast with unique voice acting, great combat mechanics, a good plot, and a very fair learning curve. It avoids pulling its punches, with enemy units often outnumbering and overpowering yours by a very significant margin, even from the early maps, where they'll have multiple tanks, anti-tank soldiers, snipers, and all manner of stuff set up in nasty positions. New Game + is a thing, and opens up extremely hard maps as well.On the port side of things, it's a solid, proper port. It has its bugs, namely when going to higher FPS counts, but it looks better, runs better, and plays better than its PS3 counterpart.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles         9.5/10-Captivating storyline with very interesting characters.-Turn based RPG elements are groundbreaking for 2008.-Very challenging gameplay and battle environments.The only minor issue I had was controlling the tank at times.Other than that, it is already my 2nd favorite game on Steam.

												An excellent and essential strategic JRPG with third person shooter elements. Great art direction, a historic throw back to post-WWI Europe, great soundtrack, 3-Dimensional characters that make you care about keeping your squad alive, continuously increasing difficulty, great sentence fragments and comma spam!Tag and bag it!

												The biggest Surprise for me for sure in terms of Games! Best turned based strategy i have played since xcom enemy unknown came out, the battle are long, hard and epic. Huge amount of customization options and different scenarios to keep your strategic brain on top of things. No moment to be bored in this game. Of course there is some cheesy japanese flair thrown in there.. but who cares.. i love chessy! LOL! Anyways, i have to say this is how a strategy game should be made, the voice acting is amazing and the storyline is pretty good and very original. I Hope there is a sequel to this.. i would pre buy it! If there is any game i would say this is a must buy for any turn based fan! :)			"

												I have played half an hour so far and here are my thoughts thus far. I will update if anything changes.Pros:-Great english voiceover (and yes I am VERY picky)--Unique art style-Combat that mixes 3rd person shooters with strategy based movement-High quality port, but basic-great resolution and Hz SupportCons:-Not a huge array of options, just resolution and Hz along with volume sliders for sound effects and music (no sliders for cutscenes)-The artstyle is hit and miss, can cause pixelization of far away objects-Even though it is turn based if you get in range of an enemy they will fire at you even if it isnt their turnAll in all, its a good game and I hope SEGA ports more great titles. Please port some other great games, such as: Bayonetta, Hastune Miku: Project Diva, Sakura Wars, Shenmue, Chu Chu Rocket and others. Have a nice day :3			"

												You haven`t played VC jet, but love strategy-games like the Fire Emblem Saga or CODE NAME S.T.E.A.M.?Try it out, borough it at your Videostore or something, this is not something that you should miss!______________________________________________________________Valkyria Chronicle is a roundbased stradegy Game (like Fire Emblem and such of the japanese Fraction) but replacing the ""Chessfield"" with a free moveble field and the ability to aim at the target yourself. (Like in CODE NAME S.T.E.A.M.)It has an very good Story shown half in beautifull cutscenes, half Pictures and text, fully dubed in englisch/japanese wich was adabted as an anime in Japan, due to its popularity. Even though the Story is great, the Gameplay never leaks fun too, the option to replay maps got me spend a lot more hours that i had to without getting bored!And even without redoing maps for better scores / money / ep the Story has hours of playing through only the Mainstory maps - wich are getting more difficult thoughout the story and can somewhat really challenge you, espessially if you made a mistake! (a pluspoint for me, its a strategygame afterall^^)____________________________________________________________the best point in VC for me is, that i love the story and the gameplay in such extend that i cant decide if i`m sad or happy when the scenes are over and the map starts / the map is over and the cutscenes start. Its so hard! I want to play to see more, but i want so see more to get to the next map! >-<I personaly love the Fire Emblem saga and looked for YEARS for something that could reach its throne in my heart. And i found it someday: Valkyria Chronicle.While these Games are easiely said diffentent, they are somewhat the same too, so i HIGHLY RECOMEND IT for Fire Emblem fans that missed these!			"

												A fantastic and unique hybrid of real time action and strategy RPG gameplay with a strong memorable cast of characters, interesting world and absolutely gorgeous graphics. Definitely worth playing. Note: It is a great port, apart from it acting weird if your frame rate exceeds 60.Original frame rate on the console was 30 and it can be set to that if you want an authentic experience. It's not a fast paced shooter so this should not have any significant impact on your ability to play.			"

												One of the few good weeb games, and a perfect fit for pc. Valkyria chronicles is what happens when you take advance wars, add a pinch of Final fantasy tactics, and give it Real-time elements.This port however... it needs improvement. Stuff goes haywire when you set it to 60fps and above, and the game becomes needlessly difficult as a result.			"

												If you loved Advanced Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, or even Fire Emblem/Shining Force, you're going to love this game.It plays like a SRPG you would expect to come out of Japan, but is heavily enlaced with elements of real-time action. You're not forced to stay on a set grid and move so many squares at a time. To me, that freedom is a nice change of pace, and still is even many years later in this port to Steam. You heard me correctly; this game is nearly eight years old, and looks better than ever at 60fps.It's nice having surprises like this come to pc every now and then, and I fully welcome any console game port to pc that gets optimization as decent as Valkyria Chronicles.My only actual complaint is that this game never had any type of head-to-head mode.Here's hoping Sega will consider giving us high-definition ports of the PSP sequels. I'll be there for that, Sega. I'll be there with a big wad of cash in my hand, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥eating grin plastered across my face. Until that day arrives... where's Shenmue?Update: Shenmue is on the way :)			"

												This game is great! Sega has released it's PS3 eclusive RTS. It's a great game and it is also a great port! Reaching resolutions up to 4k and able to play at 60fps is also a plus. I mean playing 60fps is standard but at least this port does not have any performance issues and the game looks really great! The only downside is that the pre rendered cutscenes are locked at 720P and there aren't that many options when it comes to visual quality but it's still overall great. The story of the game is really good; if you don't like anything about anime you may not want to pick up this game because the game's length is at least 50% cutscenes/dialog but it isn't bad because it's pretty well written! Overall I really hope Sega decides to port more of their console exclusive games and give them the standard 1080p and higher/60fps and higher treatment.			"

												This game is just something else.In terms of gameplay and mechanics, it's pretty solid, and its structure overall could be likened to a fusion of Battalion Wars, Tales of Symphonia, and Fire Emblem, with the really good and the really, really r e t a r d e d stirred together like toothpaste and orange juice in a hot mug. By that I mean it has an extremely clichéd, childish, predictably mainstream Chinese cartoon format of storytelling and characterization that isn't even the slightest bit realistic or well-thought out, assigning trope after trope after trope of everything you've both seen before and haven't really looked forward to rolling your eyes at since middle school. By this I mean that in terms of the way it treats WWII-era modern warfare in both theory and practice and how this applies to realism and storytelling, it's just like Battalion Wars in that it's just plain dorky and mentally r e t a r d e d. In other respects it's like a Tales series JRPG, or a Fire Emblem game, in that it makes extensive use of overused anime character archetypes and plot devices while considering such things as highlighting individual relationships between characters to be far more important than the overarching premise of the game itself. In any normal RPG, this is normal and even expected, but when you apply it to a turn-based, pseudo-RTS, WWII-oriented tactical military strategy game, it comes out looking extremely messy and awkward, to put it in simplest terms. For example, senior military commanders with extremely distinct and flaunty personalities are, at various times, physically at one another's necks when they should be realistically separated by several hundreds or thousands of miles of war fog and various logistical sensitivities, and each time they either try to duke it out face à face like kings did during the era of Bronze Age chariot warfare, or they just talk for a while, go their separate ways to ""take it outside"", and then throw their huge, disposable armies of nameless human pawns at each other until the loser publicly admits defeat and runs away. Meanwhile, your snipers make use of only very light cover and more or less taunt and flail about whenever they pick off some poor ♥♥♥♥er on the enemy's side from just 75 feet away; in real life this would guarantee that his hiding spot would be compromised and his head would get blown the ♥♥♥♥ off by countersniper fire or something else within 3 seconds, but yeah this is just a game and it's super anime so screw all that. Bottom line, if you like your tactical wargames super realistic and no-nonsense logical, you might just hate this game and drop it before you get past the third level. If you can overlook the frivolous and typically shounen animu arrangement of it all (or if, for whatever reason, that's what you're actually looking for), then you should be able to take the time to appreciate what a fantastic job Valkyria Chronicles does in making up for all of its faults, with its addictive and challenging, balanced gameplay, semi-innovative mechanics, and Go-oriented rather than Chess-oriented approach to low-intensity tactical warfare. It's entirely possible you will either love it or utterly despise it as a result of its various pros and cons, but it's still by all means worth giving a shot if you've found it in any way intriguing from my review.

												The game is a nice mix between the Winter War and the Invasion of Belgium, put in a somewhar likeable mechanic. The storyline is likeable, though filled with those nice cancerous anime tropes that will make you cringe, but that is balanced by somewhat likeable characters and good gameplay, which doesn't get stale.My only personal gripe with this game is with the Valkyria's. If this was a simple anime war game, made in the style of Talvisota, I'd love it to hell. But NO, we need a magical girl with a oversized Panzerfaust!			"

If they don't then I hope they at least continue the franchise as I would love to play more of this game series and pay some hard earned money to buy them if they do.As ports go, this port is really well done. As others have stated the cutscenes are PS3 graphics, but they are in no way bad, however everything else is 60 fps for me so far. If you are looking for a great game to spend your money on, this is a sure fire bet to have a good time with. If you enjoy it too you should tell others about it  because they might love it too.			"

												The best game I have played this year.I have always wanted to play this game to see what all the fuss is about but I don't have a ps3 so trying it out myself was kind of off-limits. Thus I was very happy to see that after 6 years, Sega finally decided to release the game on pc, and I was even happier to see that they actually put some effort into this port. I'm not going to pretend that it's perfect, as it has some pretty obvious, though very minor flaws. So far I have managed to enjoy this game fully without even having to bother plugging in a controller, as the keyboard and mouse controls feel very fluent, which in my experience is very rare for console ports. This pc version is definitely one of the better ports out there.The game itself is also excellent. Turn-based combat mixed with a bit of action is definitely a hit. So is the story of the game, which is told in either well made animation or little conversations between characters that remind me of skits from Tales of -series.Valkyria Chronicles has so far been the most fun I've had with a video game since Fire Emblem: Awakening. And that's saying a lot, as I've had a blast with Dark Souls-series and some other great games I've played this year. For the low price of 20€, you definitely shouldn't miss out on this gem.			"

												This game is like the love child of XCOM EU and Fire Emblem Awakening... if those titles had come before this one's original release, at least. If you like strategy games, ANY kind of strategy games, I guarantee you'll like it. The story is all right, with the translation and dub being kind of wonky as expected of a 2008 japanese game, but it's average at worst. SEGA did an overall nice job with this port, with the game lacking a bit on graphic settings but still, crazy resolutions at 60 fps support is there for those of you with good computers, and the game is decently optimized. The gameplay is pretty unique for a turn based strategy game, the real time elements are pretty damn well integrated and the missions maps are very well designed, made to be approached with strategy without forcing you into a set ideal tactic. I recommend this game to both fans of strategy games and fans of japanese games, and really, to anyone that is looking for a really good game at a really good price.			"

												I already own this game on PS3, but I bought it again for PC. Why?  Because it's easily one of my top 5 favorite games of all time.  Fantastic, strategic gameplay.  Great replayability. Good story.  Loveable characters.  Challenges are pleasantly difficult.  And the added achievements are icing on the cake.  This is one of the few games I have that I am dead-set on 100% completing all the achievements.This is a surprisingly well-done port.  Supports 1080p resolution which actually does make the game look even better (though cutscenes are all still in 720p, BUT still look good).  Controller support.  There'll probably end up being mods and post-process injectors to make this game look even better than it already does.  Aiming with the mouse is SO nice for precision shots, something that was often difficult on PS3 because of how much the curser moved with the analog sticks.You OWE it to yourself to get this game.

												I won't say the same thing that every else is listing the contents of the game. It's an amazing game and the port from the PS3 is almost perfect. For Gallian veterans, this game is no a brainer. Not only to be able to replay and reminisence but to also support the series and show Sega that this gem is not forgotten. To one day hopefully see a new entry in the series for all of us to enjoy. For newcomers, this is a game you should definitely play if you have always been a fan of strategy RPG's. Sharing many traits from games like Fire Emblem, Shining Force, and possible Final Fantasy Tactics while giving itself its own concepts to make it even more unique. It's definitely a pretty hefty game and will take you at least 30-40hours to complete the first time around. That time doens't include the DLC and New game+, in an effort to completely 100% this game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and for Sega for release VC3 to the West already ^^"" #ThankYouSega			"

												VC is a tactical military sim with a lot of anime influence.  You play as a division within the Gallian military during an invasion of your homeland by the Empire, who has invaded your country for your plentiful Ragnite supplies.  If you want to know more about the story, get the game :P (or read a review with spoliers in it).The mechanics of this game are such that it requires tactical thinking before moving your soliders.  Enemies will fire at you at will while you ar ein their line of sight and can kill you quickly if you dilly dally too much in action mode.  A quick way to deal with this is to plan your targets and move locations ahead of time and only change your plans if surpises arise (like hidden units that you have traveled passed or new enemy units that have your move location clearly within their los) and then enter fire mode asap or end the current action turn asap.Every unit has strengths and weaknesses, for example scouts are a very fragile unit but can move the furthest and have the largest sight range.  On the other hand tanks take two CP per turn but are resistant to everything except lancers and other tanks (especially if you get hit in the weak spot).If you plan to run around out of cover for most of a mission, you are going to fail it end of story.  Move from cover to cover and plan your attacks based on weaknesses and strengths and there are very few situations that you will not be able to handle if your units are leveled enough.This version on Steam also has all of the DLC for the game so there is extra content that you may not have on your PS3 version as well as the Japanese voice overs.  Do yourself a favor, as well, and either use or buy a controller.  The control scheme, while doable on k&m, is tens of times more suited to a controller.You are even able to replay missions as you go forward and have stronger units so for those of you, like me, that like to find a more simple or quicker stratagey can experiment to your heart's content.  You will even get exp and dct to use for upgrading your equipment and units from replaying missions.I really can think of no negatives in this game other than that the configuration menu is a separate exe file, like many other Steam games (SPAZ for example).  I don't consider it a negative though.This game, on its own, gets a 9/10 from me.  I will knock of half a point (8.5/10 for the PC port as without V-Sync and frame limiting there is massive screen tearing and there are a few graphics glitches in crossfire/sli).I have this game on PS3 as well and have sunk hundreds of hours into it.  Not much is too different between the PC port and the console version.  Though there is one particularly nasty bug:When you go to the headquarters for the first time, do not do stuff at the training grounds and R&D Facility.  Instead just go there and get the basic run down and then leave.  Once you have visted these and the other two areas, leave the HQ and then save and re-enter.  If you do anything at the R&D or Training Grounds the game will crash upon attempting to return to Book Mode.This is the only major bug I know of so far though I am a paltry 9 hours into the game (on Chapter 4).If you like tactical games like FFT, Breath of Fire, or Growlanser then you will like this game.

												Fun game! Many hours of game play! It Reminds me of mgs portal ops.I love and hate the perma-death of the soliders. Had to restart once due to one of my favorite characters dying. Each match can last up to 10(speed run)  15 (good player) or 20 minutes ( Normal player) and maybe more. Game is rather long and so I recommend buying the psp ver.   (I Dont know the difference between the steam ver and psp ver.) "

												Highly addictive tactical first person gameplay, engaging characters you grow to care about and a great visual anime like story that displays as the game progresses - what more could you possibly want from a computer game? Its not often these days that I play a game from beginning to end, but such was the case with this game. I invested over 90+ hours of game play into this one. I have been computer gaming since the 1970s and played many hundreds of computer games and this game is one of the very, very few that has really impressed me - and that is truly saying something! Trust me - you will love this game! Highly recommended!			"

												One of the best games I've played on PS3 is now on PC! Valkyria Chronicles is a touching story involving a group of normal people who are thrown into war, fighting for the town they grew up in and the life they left behind. I really enjoyed my time with these characters and cannot wait to revisit their world with even more definition and smoothness than I experienced in the past. The port is quite solid, featuring resolution options, dual audio, rebindable keys and even includes all the DLC missions. This certainly makes it feel like quite a bargain even 6 years later, and with a 30hr+ campaign I think it is. Some may need to tweak the PC controls to get them to their liking but I found them more than sufficient out the box, since the option to rebind is there though I don't think this could be seen as a fault at all.PC elitists will be happy to hear that 4k with downsampling runs incredibly well with the GeDoSaTo mod, so much so that v-sync will probably still be necessary to help limit those frames. If I had one complaint though it would be that the pre-rendered scenes are still at native PS3 720p which is upscaled to your resolution, though I don't think that it's ugly in the least. In fact, thanks to the art style, I think this game stands up well against the test of time and is bound to become a classic on PC in the years to come.			"

												Read this if you a) hate anime; and b) love turn based strategy. That describes me when I was thinking about buying this on the PS3. I am very, very glad I bought this game then, and I was happy to buy it again on Steam. If you love anime...well, you wouldn't be reading this, then, unless you wanted to argue with me about how I am an idiot for not liking anime. Just move on, because I'm sure you have some cutscenes to watch. If you're like me, though, I do have to warn you that the cutscenes in this game - of which there are MANY - are anime as hell. I don't even need to go into it, though, because I am pleased to report that you can skip any of them - or all of them, if you want - if you get tired of watching Welkin and Alicia blush with embarrassment just from talking about bread with each other, or listening to the winged pig squad mascot have an 'oink oink' conversation with squad characters, or just generally annoyed by the anime of it all in general. So, skipping cutscenes = awesome. The gameplay is GREAT. I wouldn't say the game is hard. It starts out very easy, but gets a very nice level of difficulty going for itself later on. The game is also fairly long. I've replayed the game a bunch of times on the PS3, and you really do get the feeling that you like playing it even after beating it two or three times. There are also the typical 'skirmish' missions that allow you to gain EXP and credits outside of the stroy missions, and they are fun, BUT there are only ten different maps for skirmish. There are varying difficulty levels, but to be honest they all feel the same except for the 'EX Hard' mode. The real disappointing thing about all of them, though, is that your ranking for each map is mostly based on the number of turns you take to complete the objective, usually capturing the enemy 'base' (walking up to a flag and hitting a button). Every map can be beaten in either one turn or maybe two turns, and so once you figure a map out for that rating, there's no real challenge even on the hardest difficulty. But, that's really only a minor complaint. Figuring out how to get that one-turn victory is fun in and of itself, so it's not really a negative other than the limited replayability aspect. There's enough gameplay here to make up for it. The game looks great. The art style is really neat, and really just looks amazing during play. The different classes and vehicles have a really nice rock/paper/scissors distinction going, and upgrading equipment, vehicles, and squad levels is not complicated - you can't really screw it up. The down side of this is that there's not a great deal of choice for you to agonize over. The real strategy for you is deciding how many and what type of classes you choose to field for any map rather than which squad members - most of them (except for the 'main' characters, which may or may not be required for a given map) are interchangeable. Also, you can actually switch squad members out during the play of any map and bring in other squad members to replace them. The best thing about this gameplay system, though, is that you get to field enough squad members on any given map that you can deal with the enemies on the field in the way you want to deal with them. You can have a lot of really effective squad compositions, and it is neat to try out the levels in a bunch of different ways. Also, certain characters have affinities or dislikes for certain other characters, or may have different attributes trigger under a given set of circumstances that happen in game. These come in the form of both buffs and debuffs, and do really add to the variety. Some of them, particularly affinity-based buffs and debuffs, are really very amusing, and you find yourself laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off at the way some squad member reacts whenever his secret crush is around. It's well worth finding out all the good ones. Yeah, I do highly reccommend this game. The gameplay really is a blast: it's not Xcom hard, but it's got a decent enough level of challenge, and the missions get big enough that you do have to spend time figuring out how to exploit the enemy. If you do like turn-based strategy, this game does it WELL, and you'll probably like it quite a bit.			"

												Sega is well known for making PC ports so awful your eyes fall out of your skull and creep into the deepest, darkest, depths of your basement, leaving a puddle of tears in their wake. So it is with great happiness, when I say that Sega has made a very good port here. Controller support, V-Sync, great resolution options, the whole shabang. The only thing lacking here portwise is the inability to use the mouse in the menu screens, which you will quickly get used to; the other problem is that cutscene quality is not changed from the PS3 version, fortunately the unique artstyle makes the game look rather nice even during those. Now as for the game itself, it's a turnbased tactical thirdperson shooter hybrid and boy does it work well. Move your soldiers about one at a time with your limited pool of command points, which are higher depending on your unit selection as some units provide cp bonuses when on the field. This game features permadeath for soldiers in your company who are not main characters, and each of these character has certain traits and a small bit of backstory to make their death oh so sad. I would recommend that any strategy fan pick up this game because there is nothing else quite like on the market, and this is something that you should definitely experience.			"

												I have already beaten this game 4 times on the PS3 and as a JRPG fantatic I must say this game is fantastic. The alternate WWII setting is very creative and I overall love it. The stories war and political tone is creative in the JRPG realm and is definetly welcome as I do enjoy its tone. The gameplay was revolutionary for the time as this is a strategy RPG that lets you take direct control of your units as you lead them to battle. The game of course takes strategy and patience to get through but the overall feel of the gameplay is natural and fluid and you will fall in love with its battle system. Overall I would say pick up the PC version of this wonderful game. The PC version is worth it because it includes all the DLC including the one where you play as best girl Selvaria. So yeah this game is worth every penny and $20 is a steal for this masterpiece. So do yourself a favor and buy this incredible game			"

												Alright time to break it down. Valkyria Chronicles. Originally PS3. Back then when we had no trophies. Now on Steam, it includes the DLC. You heard me right. Edy's and Selvaria's Dlc in the Extras Menu. For those who haven't played it buy it here, you get the whole thing. Now onto review. A masterpiece. 10/10 Hardcore fan. Was so into it when I was younger.  This game took me by storm and revisited the days when the ps3 first came out and you are literally playing a wonderful story that has familiar elements of description depicted in WWII and WWI. However the game itself has you take the grand role of Welkin. Now I must state this games mechanics was unique. There was ways to upgrade, replay areas for cash(Yes farming for your upgrades and seeing characters lines and actions). The people have unique bios and personalities. There are some interesting facts and cross overs. You have a Tank (I'm not complaining).  The characters have their own coming of nature throughout the story. The side quests delve more into it as well as the bio from taking them into battle and having the reporter cover it. You play this game, you won't regret it!GALIA TO ARMS!(Spoilers ahead) The feels of Isara... The singing...Your characters can die.There is Skies of Arcadia Vyse and Aika as well as Fiona (Medic)The bios are funny... same with linesYour tank is your friendUPGRADEShocktroopers best cover fireScouts and Snipers best shootersLancers don't you dare missEngineers Repair and grenade. Shots mediocre. Interesting side notes and cutscenesWelkin has a fan club, same with Alicia apparentlyI don't care if Darcsen, they are fine as hell!Now that the small stuff is out of the way.The characters. Yes all of them have a unique story. The theme is befitting of the story and game. The plot is very well done and will play you out for some. One of the best things is that I can say about this game is that back then not everyone knew and when they finally did spread about it, oh man was I one of the few that had the hard copy. Still proud and never gonna forget playing this game and the memories. Now I'm playing here for old times sake. Ah I must admit though, the frames do matter when viewing, some computers don't handle it well. Know your settings people.			"

												Played it before on PS3, then played it again when it's released on Steam, still loved it!Story : If you're a fan of anime types of storyline then this games delivers it really well. Even though the background story is about war and opression (also include some racism), this game delivers it in a way that's not too dark, and makes you want to cheer for the characters in the story. Further along the game you might even sympathize with some of the antagonists once you know their background story.Gameplay : The gem of this game. Even though it claims itself as a tactical RPG, it's actually a bit more than that. The freedom of movement in your action and the various methods you can do to complete a mission is what makes this game shines. Even the skirmish missions, which is essentially missions for grinding, can still be fun when you experiments with different completion methods. Though sometimes you will get frustated wishing for that one extra Command Points. :PCharacters : A LOT of characters, each with their own quirks which often will make you chuckle, or sometimes grind your teeth in frustration. Ex : those characters who sometimes forgot to reload their gun, too bothered to move, etcArt : I think I'll simplify it by saying that this game was once praised as one of the RPG with the best art on the console version.Fair warning though, not sure if it's my PC or the game itself, but the there seems to be jagged edges on some of the textures especially when playing cutscenes. Not really that noticeable though.Porting Quality : A lot of games which were ported from console to Steam usually suffers from inadequate porting issues which causes a lot of bugs etc. What surprises me is the porting quality of Valkyria Chronicles is really good. Tens of hours into the game and I haven't encountered any problems yet. A big plus.Extras : The Steam version comes with all the DLC and also original Japanese voice for the game. Might be a plus for some people.Conclusion : A must have game if you're a fan on anime style storylines, fun tactical gameplay, and pretty art to look at.			"

												Short version: Best $5 I've ever spent.Long version: 12 hours into the game, and I'm loving every second. Haven't felt this way since I played Fire Emblem for the first time on Gamecube.The unique combat system, engaging narrative, and immersive atmosphere really make this game stand out. The combat is essentially the kind of turn based RPG you might be familiar with from games like Fire Emblem, but actions are played-out real-time, with the other units on the map getting ""attacks of opportunity"" a la D&D. Difficult to describe, but that's the best way I can put it, and if offers a very unique and challenging experience.The narrative and characters are filled to the brim with anime and RPG cliches, as well as real-life streotypes. The game seems to all but acknowledge this, without breaking the fourth wall, so its easy to not only ignore, but enjoy. There were moments, however, where the game's dramatic tension was dulled by the predictability of certain cliches. I, however, like to think I'm pretty scrutinizing when it comes to narratives, so perhaps this won't bother many people. And if you're not familiar with anime and RPG cliches, this shouldn't bother you at all, as the narrative is otherwise very good!The atmosphere really complements the game. Behind all the light-looking, cutesy anime figures, is a very serious backdrop of a nation suffering from conflict. Being only 12 hours into the game, it feels like this seriousness could be played-up a bit more. Through all the info that Gallia is suffering from the war, the player seems to only rarely see the devastating effects of war first hand, and it works counter to the comentary about wanting to stop the war and bring about peace: if war means being able to kick♥♥♥♥♥and be a hero all the time, who cares about peace?Again, I'm cynical when it comes to narrative, so this probably won't bother you.There are a few other very nice touches about the game. The glossaries detailing the histories of characters, statistics and fluff info on weapons, in-game news reports about the war, the intricate cutscenes involving the main characters, the fun of customizing your troops gear and skill level. They all add icing on the cake!Overall, this game is a work of love, and it shows. I'd buy it again!			"

												If you played this game on PS3...  why are you reading this?! You already know how great this game is! This review is for everyone that hasn't heard of VC or is still on the fence about it. First off, don't be dismissive of the reviews; this game was VERY well received by critics and rightly so. That it underperformed commercially (and why you may never have heard of it) is due to matters that I'll save for the end (in case you don't care). Financially this is a great value: you get the game (which still sells for 40+$US for a used PS3 copy) and all the DLC (another 20+$US on the PS Store) included. This adds extra difficulties, new skirmish modes and additional bits of story.Mechanically, VC is a strategy game in line with typical turn-based tactical games. You take a turn, then the enemy goes. Repeat until you win or the bad guys do. That is about where the similarities end. In practice, you control your troops in a third-person view, directing them freely on the battlefield. There are no grids here. Each character gets an action and movement, to be performed in any order you choose. Movement drains an action bar, so you can use as much or as little movement as you want, take an action and then move again if you want. All of this combines to make the fight feel much more fluid than in typical TBT games. To ice that cake you've got leveling, R&D, active and passive skills and ""Orders"" that basically act as global spells or super powers in other similar games. Taken together, it is a refreshing and interesting take on TBT fare. Most importantly, it all WORKS. Unlike many systems that try to redefine this genre, BliTz engine actually performs as intended.Visually, the original game was (and still is) impressive. The aesthetic ties directly into the story, as it's a recounting of events as viewed by a war correspondant. The game begins with a book opening and the author telling their story. To that end every bit of the world and interface is designed to reinforce the idea that this is literally a story in motion. And don't worry, the exposition is minimal. Everything here is ""quasi-cel-shaded"" and given texture and color like illustrations on paper, and all of this reacts in realtime rather than in still frames. Simple put, the artistic style (in my opinion) is beautiful.As for the narrative, don't let the visuals fool you: Valkyria Chronicles touches on the costs and darker sides of war. You won't see grizzled scruffy men grunting and barking curses at each other, nor will you see giblets and fountains of blood. In fact, though the implications of the horrors of war are not ignored, the actual violence itself is pretty tame. Likewise, if you see all the bright colors and cartoony art style and think this is going to be child's fare, think again. This is no Advance Wars, folks. Nowhere will you see something like, ""Hey guys, we just destroyed an entire enemy army! Let's go grab a soda!"" These are real people in a desperate situation, and the narrative never loses sight of that.For those that are familiar with it, the team responsible for VC also created Skies of Arcadia for the Dreamcast, and originally intended this game to be a sequel or spiritual successor to it. What they brought to Skies they also brought here: a clear and well defined world, as well as an interwoven story told within it. The entire game is focused on its objective of telling this story and making you love it. No collection missions. No skinning animals. No street races. No grabbing flags or hitting glowing checkpoints. This game is a story, and it only sets out to tell it.To wrap up, I am a HUGE VC fanboy. I've lost count of the articles I've written and references I've made about getting this franchise on PC. I still insist that the real reason that most of people have never heard of this series is because it launched too early in the PS3's lifespan and then had its sequels shackled to the dying PSP. Now all of that doesn't matter! I'm extremely excited to see this series where I believe it always belonged and truly hope it will find new life and new fans here on The One True Platform (tm)!			"

												If you're a fan of games that try things different from the genres they find themselves in, and anime, then this game will be a hit for you. I say differently, because the game is not your typical strategy-RPG game. It throws a neat action element into the mix that can be mistaken for action as a focal point, but in practice, the action element actually causes more strategic forethought than you would initially expect. No running in, guns blazing, in this game, or you will likely be quickly mowed down. At least, until you get the hang of things. At the end of the day, though, it's a pleasant experience with an engaging story to tell, a largely excellent vocal cast and localization, and a JRPG on your PC. How can you go wrong?			"

												The game is already a classic, I was just worried about the port considering there has been another not-so-good port released recently (I'm looking at you, FFXIII.) It turns out there wasn't anything to worry about, as both the game itself and the port are much better than FFXIII. Keyboard and Mouse support, button remapping, graphics/resolution options, and all the other makings of a good port. The only downsides appear to be that there is no mouse support in the in-game menus. It's not really a huge deal and the mouse is fully functional when it matters in the game. The other issue my friend and I have both shared is crashing after returning from headquarters for the first time. I'm not sure if it's just coincidence or something causes the crash, but it was incredibly annoying to go back and do things over again because of the lack of an auto-save feature. Remember to save often.			"

												This game is superb to say the least , personally i find difficult to describe it , but it for sure would fall under a mix of SRPG and JRPG. In the end it is a mix of shooter/RPG/strategy game.The port quality is decent/good , the game is ofc old , but SEGA did add plenty of standard features to it , so technically speaking , there is very little to complain about.Describing this games combat would is a hard thing , i guess to give an quick idea i would say you can select soldiers to send on each battle , you get an overall number of ""actions"" per turn and you can spend them on any soldier you got , when you decide to shoot then game gives you a third person shooter camera in which you probably will try to get a headshot. Add to that the fact this is a RPG , so there are different classes that do different things and got different tools.I recomend watching a video about the combat and how its classes work...This game really deserves to be recognised has one of the best games that ever launched on PS3.

												Good story, have a really... REALLY lots of cutscenes.It's more like you are watching an anime than actually playing it.If you love anime, this game is really enjoyable to follow.they got a freaking bonus episode (aka: fan-service) in there.the funny thing is, you need to buy this bonus/extra chapter (with ingame currency). and this one special chapter cost a whole lots more than the other episodes. The first time I saw it, I was like. WTF.. why suddenly this extra chapter cost a fortune. But it was damn worth it Story: 9/10good plot, lovable character, got both humor and romance in it.Has its happy, sad, and shocking moment.Some of the characters actually have a really nice development Graphic: 9/10it's an anime ffs, if you like anime. nuff said Gameplay:  6/10The gameplay is actually not that bad.It's just the turn-base system is not really a ""fair"" and good turn-base mechanic/system.The opposing team can 'free' shot you even if it's not in their turn.What's bad from this is that we/they don't have to reserve any action point to do so. This is why I call it free.At some cases it can be ridicilously annoying.Moreover, when it's the against the AI, they can free shot you all the time.Even when you are just standing there, not using your action point to move.Which is really weird for a turn-base game. And our unit only shot when the AI move (not fair dude, not cool at all).You can move the same unit again and again, which can be exploit easily.And in most cases, perhaps it's the only/easiest way to finish the game with an A rank result.From mid until late in the game.One of the class feels really OP, that you basically only need to use this one class to wipe the entire enemy team.Heck, in most of my missions, I only use 2 units of this class to finish the mission.There are lots of characters in the game, but some is clearly stronger than the other and once you know it.You will only use those same characters again and again. This brings down the diversity and i feel sorry for the rest of the character.Regardless of all this flaw in the mechanic.It's still fun to play tho.For anime lover out there, I can recommend this game.(or just watch the anime version)			"

												A really solid game which effectively balances RPG and strategy elements; I enjoyed every minute of it.  Other reviews will do a much better job in describing the customization and solid mechanics the game offers so that won't be the focus of my review.  What really stood out for me is how the game isn't afraid to bring out the more uglier human elements, such as racism, war brutality and hatred.  For example, a common theme in the game is the dehumanization of Darcsens, an ethnic group with jet black hair who are reviled, ridiculed and mostly treated as subhuman by in-game society.  Having played so many war games which simply pits the generic ""good guys"" Us vs. the ""bad guys"" them, it is refreshing to see how the characters, friends and foes, aren't cleanly defined but and each have their own strengths and weaknesses plus personalities which make them unique and memorable.  Seeing the characters with their flaws and prejudices fight together and ultimately learn to appreciate and respect one another in a non cheesy way is a sign of great character development and is one of the shining features of the game.  Ultimately however, I really love how despite all the struggles that are felt by the characters in game, the developers always provide a message that there is always hope, no matter how desperate and miserable things may be.  While the dubbing at some points are cringe inducing, if you love a fantastic story, RPG and Strategy, give this game a try, you won't be disappointed.			"

												I had the hardest time whether to get this game for the pc or ps3 since i'm an rpg player and like to collect rpg/good games and I dont consider digital copies to count. All I can say is that, I had no regrets buying this for the PC. This is a good game for all you people that don't know. Its fairly challenging imo and i'm only on like chapter 10 at this time of writing this. Alot of trial and error and you probably still wont get a good score w/o using guides. Good story so far, no realllly dispisable characters, good stratagy game, decent music, funky controls in the beginning but I got used to it (really bad tank controls though imo lol). All in all, a really good rpg game that's definitely worth picking up on steam even if you don't play RPGs!			"

												As of this writing, I have only experienced 7 hours of gameplay. This is an early impression, not a full review. It will not be a comprehensive examination, just my initial thoughts on the game.First, I will address the matter of the PC port. I have experienced zero issues. Excellent port. There are very minor gripes, none of them game-breaking in my opinion. A good PC port runs well, and has more options for PC users. It does not necessarily have to re-vamp the whole game at a fundamental level. If you absolutely despise console games, you will find a reason to not like this. I'm not a console gamer nor a console game lover, but this one is really a great game that transcends its origins.I went into this somewhat skeptical. Even after a little research and a few gameplay videos, I was unsure but decided to take the plunge. Let me assure you, I am not at all sorry that I did so.I absolutely love the world that Valkyria Chronicles takes place in. The art and overall esthetic is beautiful. Voice work is of good quality, and suitable for the genre. If you watched anime when you were a kid, this might very well strike a chord with you.Playing this game is very much like watching an anime, except that you're involved in the story. There is plenty of story here. You can skip the story and just enjoy the combat scenarios, but you would be missing out on this amazing piece of art. Do yourself a favor and experience what this game has to offer. If you really don't like anime or this type of storytelling, then you might not want to waste your time.The combat is enjoyable, and there is plenty of depth to be found for those concerned it may be overly simplistic. You are required to think. Thoughtless deployment and thoughtless actions result in failure and death. Synergies between squad members are meaningful. The transition to and from real-time movement within a turn based structure is smooth and works well, but may take some getting used to for a few. Once the flow of an engagement becomes natural, the system shines.I'm having a lot of fun with this, and I'm glad I bought it. If you're still on the fence, read some more reviews, watch some more videos. I can tell you that this game's cult status is not without reason, and I can now see why it had and has such a devoted following. Definitely a classic.As always, your experience may differ from mine. I hope some of you find this information helpful.Happy gaming!			"

												It's an anime game set in World War II. It plays like a mixture of Fire Emblem and Gears of War. That's gotta be worth $20, right?Good things about this game:-Graphics are stylish and nice-Sound is good, unless you're repeating the same mission again and again, but I'll get to that later-Combat is intuitive (doing stupid things will get your dudes killed most of the time)-it's an anime. This is good if you like anime.-The port is good, but you should be playing with a controller for an optimal experience.Bad things about this game:-Mission 7 is frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm about to spoil it for you. Basically, you personally fight Hitler in North Africa and he's piloting a tank the size of a naval cruiser. When you're about to lay the smackdown on Adolf himself, Rule 63'd Rommel appears with an ancient space laser and kills all of your units, and then you probably get obliterated by a panzershreck. UNLESS, of course, you're replaying the mission for your second, third, or fourth time. By that time you'll know Rommel's on her way; otherwise it's completely out of left field and you'll lose have to repeat the mission. This is fundamentally bad because it ruins the experience. If Rommel had just slaughtered my men in droves but I still won, that would have been fine. But because of the instant-kill factor forcing me to repeat the mission, the whole experience was ruined. At time of writing this review, I've played Valkyria Chronicles for 12 hours, and 2 were spent playing that one same mission.  I'm not complaining that the mission was too hard, I'm saying it's just poorly designed and frustrating to basically require the player to have precognition or a strategy guide to clear it on their first try.-No character development or screentime for anyone aside from the 6 main characters (but then again it is an anime so what did I expect)-Wonky hitboxes on RPGs make it impossible to hit certain targets from certain angles, which leads to moments where a shot clearly connects but deals no damage. You'll know what I mean when you get to Mission 7.-Aiming controls take some getting used to. They're clunky, which can get you killed sometimes. Most of the time it's no big deal though.IN SUMMARY: buy this game. It's fun.			"

												I will be honest. I only know about this game from Prject X Zone which, in my opinion, is basicly a catelogue for games people should get. Never thought I'd find it on Steam! Anyway...A strategic, 3rd person shooter game in the style of Anime. The gameplay is great, frankly. The gameplay is reminescent of a cross of Risk, Civilization, and a bit of TF2 (personal opinion it's a good thing), plus anime. The main amazing thing is each character is unique and has their own story, their own pros/cons, and even things they like/dislike to do. I found one who doesn't like killing, and wont act if they have to attack. Most willingly fight, so dont worry. I have only just gotten into this game, but I am hooked. I'd give it a 8/10. Why not more? *cough* no megaman *cough*			"

												Probably one of my top 3 favorite games of all time. I really don't know what it is about this game that makes me love it so much...But I think its that pleasure that comes from making a team of interesting characters that work well together. Every character has a their own unique personality and you find yourself growing attached to them and relying on them. I would find myself talking to them. Telling my sniper ""You got this shot, I know you do, I'm not even worried about it."" or yelling at a downed man ""Today is not the day you die, we're coming for you!""Any friend I would talk to would have different people on their team and different characters they rely on themselves.Anyway I could write paragraphs about the interesting levels, story, upgradableable gear, music, etc. But I'm only going to say its all great, all of it.If you like strategy and story, you will not be disappointed.

												Valkyria Chronicles is a charming game originally deployed on the PS3 6 years ago. The game is based on a fictive version of a 2nd world war era Europe. 2 large ntions / alliances of nations dukes it out in an attempt to control a multipurpose ressourse, the ragnite, that has become scarcier. Stuck in between the two major powers, a small independant nation, names Gallia, struggles to maintain its neutrality until one of the major powers, the eastern empire, turns its gaze upon the large ragnite reserves it posseses. It is now up to a small band of civilians of all origins enroled into the millitia to defend the contry and push back the eastern invaders. The player controls squad 7 of the militia. The game is a strategy role playing game with several unique twist to its game mechanics:The missions rewards the players who manages to reach the final objective in the shortest delays, encouraging risky tactics over attrition tactics. A mission will rank the player based on the number of turns it takes to accomplish the main objective. Each ranks gives a different amounth of xp and cash and the difference between each ranks can be very noticeable. The difference in gain from a Rank A reward and a B rank rewards can make killing all units more of a hinderance than anything, as they'll never fill the gap of xp between the 2 fo example.Each turns are made up of a player phase, where the player gets to use his command points as he fits, and then, the enemy phase who does the same. The player don't need to play all his units in a turn, nor is he limited to use each units once. Indeed, he can active multiple times the same units over the course of his phase, but each extra time the character is activated, the movement points are reduced, causing a gradually more limited movement range. Furthermore, several weapons and actions have a limited amonth of use per phase and usually regenerates of only one use per turns (exemple, sniper rifles can shoot only 3 bullets, and only recovers 1 bullet per turns, so if the player shot three times this turn, the next turn he will only have one shot).  Keep in mind however, that command points are limited, and some other things uses command points.  For instance, tanks consume 2 points of commands and the player can also use ""orders"" which gives a boost to either a single unit or entire squads or can allow for some special actions like sniper support or instant evacs for different costs depending on the specific order.An important difference in gamplay mechanics is that whenever you select a unit, you fall in a 3rd person perspective and control the character directly. I can make 1 action (shoot, heal, repair, throw grenade) and can move as long as your movement gauge has some points in it. Some skills may trigger at any time during the activation, giving buffs or debuffs on your character's actions, thus influencing the results of the actions. While in action mode, the character player by the character is subject to counter fires by all tanks, scout, shocktrooper and engineer units in firing range, as such, the player cannot just waltz in enemy lines unattended. Also, when the player attacks any of the stated classes but fails to kill them, they can make a single counter attack, making the management of a unit's HP primodial in the action phase. But what is true for the player, is also true for the enemy. A good positionning of the player's units can make a formidable line of defence. A bad positionning can lead to death however, so it is recommended to end each character's final turn in hiding or in cover, in order to improve their chances of survival.Each characters comes with 3 or 4 personality traits who can be beneficial (like hard worker which allows a second action) or hindering (like pollen allergy which generat an hp loss whenever your character walks in the grass) and each characters have their own unique combination of those. Furthermoe, each characters have access to up to 4 benefical potentials based on their class, giving even more variety in each units.There is perma death in this game for every sub characters. While story characters are immune to this, they become unavailable for the rest of the mission. This occurs when a character is reduced to 0 hp and he is either left ther for three turns unattended, or that the enemy walks up to him first. In order to avoid this, the player needs to either send a unit next to the downed man or spend some command points and use the appropriate order to force an evac of the unit without risking another unite for the job.Another twist is that the xp earned in a fight is considered a squad exp rather than an individual one, like most games of the genre. This exp can then be spent on leveling up classes as the player wishes it. When a class is leveled, all characters of that class are leveled along with it, even those not currently part of you selected squad. This design choice allows the player to try out different characters without suffering the drawback of a character underleveled compared to the current state of the game.The visuals of the game stands up very well despite being 6 years old. The graphics juggle between anime style and watercolor painting giving it a unique artstyle that can stand the test of time. Each environnement are well depicted and their atmosphere well expressed. Details go as far as giving a unique face to each of your prospect squand members, giving them a identity and a personality despite not being integral part of the story. Even some Onomatopoeia can be see on screen whenever a tank moves, a gun shoots or some other interesting sounds occurs while in slide shows during story sequences, giving the feeling to read a comic book.The menus and between mission events are all integrated in a book style interface, as if all you experience in the game is red through scriptures and images of the book, this way of navigating through the menu allows the player to remain immersed in the game's universe even though you are in the meta management of your squad. I found it charming and pretty unique in its own right.Sound is another part of the game where lots of love was poured into. The original sound track is one of the bestI listened to in the industry, channeling through strong emotions whenever it was needed. Likewise, the voice acting / dubbing is pretty good, and the player can even choose between Japanese or English voice over, both being of very good quality.In short, it is a beautiful game full with unique mechanics and personality that deserves to be tried out. My game on the ps3 lasted for a good 40+ hours and I stilll had the dlc to finish. The PC port, when played with a game controller, is very much like the PS3 version, with generally better FPS. I did encounter some major slow downs shortly after some in missions events triggered while in 3rd person mode, but they are few and far in betwee and usually don't last long.I have been preaching the virtues of this game for 6 years now, and those who decided to give it a try, loved it. The game was cursed by near inexistant marketting on a very prolific gaming year and passed mostly unnoticed by gamers of the time. Sega is now giving the francise a second chance and I can only hope that, this time, the game will get the recognition it deserves :D			"

												First of, let me get this off my chest: this game is so much more than it seems.Under the fairly infamous anime coat is hidden story that is at times surprisingly mature,  and for those who enjoyed the X-Com series for the feeling of working with >actual< characters, this is a must-have; the game is literally stuffed with content of absolutely zero gameplay value, but that will do miracles with regard to your immersion.Much to my surprise, I soon found myself eagerly reading up on every bloody update in the personnel tab.As for the gameplay, that was even more of an surprise; the game somehow manages to make the battles both incredibly entertaining and >fun<, and yet still requires you to actually think about your tactics - you will no doubt find yourself restarting mission with different set of units entirely somewhere along the line.Which brings me to another point, the Valkyria Chronicles have a brilliant learning curve - first mission may be your typical ridiculously simple tutorial in its essence, but before you know it, you will be in charge of an entire platoon facing enemies who outnumber you greatly, and precisely at the moment you will begin to feel confident in that role, you will find suddenly be faced by a tank army with the support of a bloody armored train with mortars and whatnot.I've come to notice that whenever I become used to a certain ""set"" of units, the game changes the nature of your challenge - an aspect that I've come to love, and which I wish was implemented in the X-Com series themselves.You are continually forced to inovate - I cannot stress how great that is.

												I would recommend Valkyria Chronicles to all those that enjoy playing SRPGs. The features of this game that I enjoyed were:The setting is a World War 2 analogue with the weapons of war being rifles, hand grenades, and tanks. The majority of the SRPGs that I have played before tend to have a medieval-fantasy setting, so this change was refreshing.The gameplay mechanics is a combination turn-based and third-person shooter. At the start of your turn, a map with the locations of all your units (and that of any visible enemy units) is displayed. You can the choose to give a command to a unit and control them. This causes a transition to the 3rd-person world, where you have to move the unit through the terrain while being mindful of enemy fire (thus placing importance on finding cover). When you decide to get the unit to attack, time stops so as to let you choose where to aim at the enemy, as headshots deal critical damage. The gameplay does a good job at simulating the points-of-view of a commander giving orders to his soldiers and those of the soldiers carrying out said orders.Perma-death - it reinforces the fact that this is a war and giving bad orders will result in the death of your squad.Excellent characterization of playable non-plot-essential units. In fact, it is probably the best that I've ever seen in a SRPG. Each character is distinct in that they have their own set of potentials (i.e. abilities that has a set chance of activation), voice, and dialogue. These three attributes are usually enough to paint a picture of the kind of person that they are. Cross-reference that with their personnel information and the list of people that they like gives you enough information to picture the group dynamics of the squad.The only part of the game that I disliked was how the game ranks your performance of each map. It ranks and correspondingly rewards you depending on the number of turns that took you to complete the map. While I could see how achieving an objective quickly would be important for a small militia against a large army, this is in conflict with playing tactically and advancing slowly to ensure that none of your soldiers gets killed.

												I am now on the final mission of this game and it has surpassed all of my expectations. Playing this game has been a hugely enjoyable and thoroughly rewarding experience, and I already know that this will easily become one of my favourite games of all time. If you wish to know in detail why I feel this, please continue reading.The storyline, for me, is flawless. I originally expected it to be a strange retelling of World War 2, but instead I was treated to a long and gripping plot including hugely likable characters and storyline developments that I genuinely didn't see coming. At one point it even brought me to tears. Until now I had honestly felt that I had grown out of JRPGs, but this game certainly proved me wrong.Gameplay-wise, Valkyria Chronicles can be a very, very frustrating game to be honest, but frustrating in a GOOD way. Whilst it is true that character movement (and particularly tank movement) is a little clunky, I never found myself hating the game because of it. When I became frustrated it was because Valkyria Chronicles is challenging and very unforgiving. If you make a tactical mistake or stupid movement with your troops, you will be very lucky not to be punished for it and rightly so. This game makes no excuses for not holding your hand and giving you an easy ride. Similarly, it will reward you for thinking strategically and this is the beauty of the game for me. There was no lengthy tutorial detailing every single strategy available to me. You start the game with a simple mission, begin to naturally acquire a feel for the controls, and before you realise it you are thinking of ways to effectively move your troops and prioritise targets. Valkyria Chronicles masterfully hides what it is teaching you so much that you don't even realise you've progressed until you return to older missions and annihilate the enemy with euphoric ease. It's just a real pleasure to play through this game. It never makes you feel like an idiot or treats you like one, which for me is a trap that many current generation games fall into.Graphically Valkyria Chronicles looks surprisingly good for a PlayStation 3 game from 2008. SEGA have done a wonderful job of upscaling the graphics and sharpening up the user interface. I have no complaints whatsoever, and would even praise it for its use of a beautiful hand-drawn style cel shading which has aged considerably well.In conclusion, I highly and thoroughly recommend this game to anyone, and I really mean that! I am neither a strategy game fan, nor a big JRPG fan (the last JRPG I played and really enjoyed was Final Fantasy VII!), and yet this game grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me in. It's simply a very, very good game and as a gamer I honestly wish that there were more games like this being made these days.			"

												VC is a really good game with some flaws in the gameplay and other things .the game is mix between 3rd person shooter and TBS , the gameplay is really good but there's a flaw in defense mechanic and the only way to defense your untis is by crawling through the bush  or satying behind a sand bag if you did this you get extra defense but let me expalin the problem  :a unit with defense needs 10 shots to die a unit without defense needs 5 shots to die  but still if you sneak behind him you need to a 10 shots to kill him so it's not about the place  it's just a binary thing either 0 or 1 combat is not the only thing in this game , you have a big system management upgrading the classes,weapons,tanks and you can choose from a different soilders to fight with you every one of them have his/her own personality and these personality can effect them in the combat . the story was really good until you reach the sec half of the game and the game slpas you and the game become A ♥♥♥♥ING ANIME CLICHE.both the soundtrack and the art style are really good it toatlly  fit the game but the game is anime so if you hate anime you would probably hate it Pros:-The system mangment -The characters -gameplay-soundtrack and the art styleCons:-the menu is so terrible  -a flaw in defense mechanic-you can't skip or speed up the enemy turns-the game don't give any kind of into about the upgrades . -the way you play a cutscenes is annoying and they're on 720p .Conclusion:if the anime thing doesn't bothers you then go buy it , yes it have some flaws but the game is enjoyble and unique.sorry for poor my grammar .

												Decent port. I absolutely love this game. Highly reccommended if you like Turn-based Strategy.What is it? I guess you could say its a mix between XCOM and Fire Emblem. It's an undeniably Japanese take on World War II, and it works. The cell-shaded graphics are gorgeous, though cutscenes can be quite grainy. Everything on the in-game engine looks fabulous though. The game has a fantastic art style. I will say that most of the in-game menu cannot be controlled via mouse. It is obviously not ideal but as PC players, this is something we have to put up with when playing some console ports. Other than that the port is pretty great.			"

												I love this game. It brings me back to the days of final fantasy 7 and 8 and mega man legends... playstation days. Even brings me back to my MGS PW or PO fix... or even to the Pokemon days... It's great. Far as I can tell its an alt universe German invasion of France with no luftwafelles. It's even got the little occultish stuff going on. Some romance, idk, haven't really been trying to beast through the story. It's a game that makes XP farming fun, very tactical. The video shows no game play, but it's like a turn based rpg war game done in semi realistic but kid friendly anime art(even though there is people dying all over the place.) Idk, it plays like metal gear acid, just a little less complicated, and a little more kriegspeil. It's really fun, and I am compelled by the story. I'm not sure, but I feel like this game was released on PSP for some reason. It's a lot like final fantasy tactics except it's sorta simplified and complexified in different ways. Just youtube a game play. There are some annoyances. Gamepad design is weird and in menu is oversensitive, but aiming a weapon, it's literally goes the opposite damn way. No it's not an inverse, idk why they did it, it's to allow for more human error. Xcom kinda except you do a lot of the aiming. It's really great tho. Also, another thing thats really kinda annoying... Well, they have their cutscenes which are great, but they have these sub scenes that are just so annoying cause you have to press a button every line. Even when someone says ""..."" Really kinda annoying buuut I'm looking past it.			"

												If you missed out on Valkyria Chronicles on PS3, here's your chance to catch up on a treasure of a game.It's an excellent port at a great price, including all the DLC that effectively doubles the game length. My only qualm is that, with KBM, tank controls are sketchier and difficult to get used to. A gamepad is generally preferable in this case but you can definitely play with either.This is probably my favourite strategy RPG of all time. Progression through stats alone is not enough to get ahead, you have to adapt to the terrain and enemy team in every match to get ahead. Gameplay is engaging and fun, and very satisfying, though with some understandable quirks that could be corrected (but there hasn't been anything like this so they can be forgiven). Any given battle is a significant investment of time, and you end up getting a ton of mileage out of the game as a consequence. Each of the units and classes are useful in their own ways and you will use all of them healthily. It's well-balanced.The orchestrated OST is stellar, the watercolour art engine is outstanding, voice acting is professional and draws from all kinds of actors. The story is probably overwrought with war movie tropes, but the world-building surrounding Europa and the background attributed to the characters, weapons and countries are captivating. It's a product of love.Valkyria Chronicles is one of my favourite games of all time, is what I'm saying. The PC port captures everything great about it. Absolutely look into it, it's a unique game that anyone can enjoy.			"

												Please note that this recommendation is coming from somebody who usually *deplores* anime, so you can be assured that the gameplay more than makes up for it.Think AdvanceWars in 3d but with brief 3rd person real-time segments on the battlefield.  You can customize abilities and weapons in the true RPG style.  It's worth a look if you like military turn-based strategy.  In the later levels, you really have to think about your moves.  There is A LOT of game for your buck here.I wrote this review and recommended this game the second after one of the characters in a cutscene unironically used the word ""fisticuffs."" "

												A solid game. The gameplay is a strategy game with pretty simple controls, and a third-person perspective. You have a limited number of moves each turn, and each unit has a meter that runs out as they walk around. You also get one attack or action per move.The graphics have a nice anime look to them, like the textures were painted. The story is interesting, and there is some decent character development.Weapons and tanks can be upgraded, and your units can train to level up using experience gained from battles won.I like how every member of your squad has their own personality and backstory.  Each has a few unique perks too, like certain terrain they perform better in, or types of units they are stronger against - even other soldiers that they like to be around.If you like squad-based strategy games like X-Com, you'll probably like this game as well.Squad 7, move out!

This game occurs in an alternate universe earth where the east Empire fights the Federation (sounds familiar?) and when the Empire decides to attack a neutral by stander country. A pair of young adults must take arms and defend their homeland at all costs.A bonus: this game comes with the Japanese voice over(in addition to the english dub) as well as all the DLC released on the PS3 version. If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Shining Force, this is a game would yould like.			"

												Its the same old game ported from the ps3. If you played that one then this will be no different but will always have a place in my library. For new people getting into this then your in for a wild ride. Controls are finicky but still manageable. Its a tactical game so making small moves in wrong directions or aiming will greatly affect your outcome. Story is a strange twist to the genre of a war(very similar to what we already know) but adding an anime twist to it. Check out old reviews and base yoru decision off that, but i highly recommend this game.			"

												The original PS3 version was one of the hidden gems of the system, it was critically acclaimed and well loved by it's fans. Unfortunately sales wise, Valkyria Chronicles fell victim to SEGA's little to non existent marketing and to a poor release date in the west. Due to this fact and because the decline of the home console market in Japan, the second and third games  were only released on the PSP. Sadly the third game was never even localized in the west. So, you can see that Valkyria Chronicles as a franchise had a long and rough ride, but don't let it discourage you. In the SRPG genre, it's one of the best, and in my opinion, it's also one of the best games ever created.-Art:            5/5 If you like anime, then you won't be dissapointed. Every character and enviroment looks phenomenal.-Graphics:   4/5 Valkyria Chronicles aged well, and compared to the original 720p version on the PS3, the higher resolution options and unlocked FPS helps it tremendously.-Music:        5/5 The soundtrack is a beautifully composed orchestra, you'll often find yourself humming it.-Story:         4/5 Valkyria Chronicles has a good story with likable/relatable characters, although it can be considered a little bit generic.-Gameplay: 4/5 The combat is fun and engaging, but since it's a tactical game, sometimes it can be punishing.-Overall:      4.5/5 While the fanboy in me wants to give it a 5 out of 5 (YES, i consider it THAT good!), i don't want to decieve anyone, so realistically it's a 4.5. The PC version is good, the keyboard and mouse works perfectly with remappable buttons and a mouse sensitivity option, so props to SEGA for that, it's really rare these days to get a proper PC port.With the current price of 17,99€ (wich almost feels like a steal for such a great game), i can only encourage anyone who is thinking about buying it. Hopefully this time, SEGA will see the potential left in the franchise.			"

												Played VC for the PS3 and I'm very pleased to see it on steam.Valkyria Chronicles is a solid turn based third person strategy/shooter with a very nice art style and story. The only issue I have with it is you're rewarded for how fast you complete a mission, not how WELL you complete the mission. Inbetween missions you can choose which classes of units you'd like to improve, what weapons you're interested in fielding, and what characters you'd like to depoy. I guarantee you'll find your favourites.If you like turned based games I'd highly reccomend it. Enjoy in 60FPS.			"

												I've played this game for over a hundred hours on ps3.The bad:     Unless it was patched after this review, menus have horrible controls.  Fortunately, in-battle controls are great, and the mouse works just like it should.  So basically, when it counts the controls are great, but when it doesn't it can be a bit annoying.     The plot and characters at times are almost saccharin.  A few missions in this makes more sense, as there is permadeath and the combat can be gritty.  The plot does its best to keep the whole thing from depressing you.     The game grades your performance on speed alone.  This means that if you want high grades on a lot of missions you're best off just using scouts and the occasional lancer.The good:     It's a mix of strategy RPG and third-person shooter.  It works much better than it sounds, and it doesn't sound all that bad.     Every character is unique, and picking the right characters (not just character classes) can make missions drastically harder or easier.     Gear and tanks can be customized.     Annoying character?  You can permanently kill them off.  Granted, you might find that they're more valuable than you think at first...			"

												tl;dr: This is a must have if you're looking for a deep single player experience with an excellent fleshed out story.what is this?: Valkyria Chronicles is a single-player turn based strategy game that works much in the same way other games do in their genre but with a few twists. Think X-Com but with real characters. It's set in a WWII-esque setting which takes many ques from history in the 2nd World War and other conflicts, any keen history buff can see where the various influences for nations,weapons, vehicles and events come from. Pros:*Great storyline, I enjoyed it and I still have a ways to go until i'm finished. (i've watched the anime for this which is mostly similar).*great combat mechanics, the combat works well and its possible for your squadmates to do well, troops are divided into 4 classes each with their own strengths and weaknesses and require close teamwork in order to be at maximum effectiveness. *traits and potentials: Each soldier is different, they all have their own stories and personal quirks that make their way into how they perform on the field. For example some soldiers hate each other and their effectiveness can wax and wane based on who's fighting with them, or their preference for a certain environment can help them or hinder them.*Various RPG elements such as leveling characters, traits and weapons (with them having new added effects).Cons:*Difficulty scales up quickly which requires you to at times grind skirmishes.*Tank controls can be incredibly annoying and has more then once lost me a battle due to how it was ported. However this could just be my own issue.*Certain plot points can be unsettling with there being frequent references to Racism (against a group known as Darcsens, essentially made to represent the Jewish and other minorities). However for a first serious depiction of the Holocaust and discrimination put on minorities, not only by the antagonists but also the protagonists too makes it somewhat of an eye-opener to the attitudes held across the world at this time. special notes:This game, which came before the anime differs greatly at times with the Anime, the anime features a lot more drama and added or removed plot points, even going as far as inventing new relationships that did not exist. I personally prefer the game in terms of plot (it all feels warmer and friendlier then the Anime). In terms of plot the Game is (in my opinion) better.			"

												Just as glorious as I remembered! Pretty good story told through some of the best Turn Based strategy of last generation. The World War II inspired setting is really unique and gives some familiarity without hamfisting it down your throat. In terms of the port: It's just about average. You can launch into a configuration window but all it really gives you is the ability to switch between keyboard and controller, although it does give you the ability to rebind keys! Which is often overlooked on PC ports.Another problem about this port is that if you chose to use the keyboard, you'll have to use it to control menus since this has no mouse support for that. In combat you can use mouse aim and select units with the mouse but that's as much integration as it gets. Last but not least, there is no graphics menu....not that the game is worse for it since the art style is fantastic, but i was kind of excited to maybe see some AA or DSR options (which you could force through Nvidia Control Panel). It's not that big of a deal to me for a game as rich in art and atmosphere as this, but it certainly would have been an improvment.In the end I plugged in my gamepad since this was clearly designed with a controller in mind and unfortanatly Sega didnt do much to give it a PC makeover. (It seems like it would be an easy thing to patch in, so this could be an outdated problem someday.) I am enjoying Valkyria Chronicles immensely and anyone who didnt have a PS3 last gen to experience one of the best tactical RPG's Sega has to offer, I highly recommend you pick this up.			"

												I love this game. It brings me back to the days of final fantasy 7 and 8 and mega man legends... playstation days. Even brings me back to my MGS PW or PO fix... or even to the Pokemon days... It's great. Far as I can tell its an alt universe German invasion of France with no luftwafelles. It's even got the little occultish stuff going on. Some romance, idk, haven't really been trying to beast through the story. It's a game that makes XP farming fun, very tactical. The video shows no game play, but it's like a turn based rpg war game done in semi realistic but kid friendly anime art(even though there is people dying all over the place.) Idk, it plays like metal gear acid, just a little less complicated, and a little more kriegspeil. It's really fun, and I am compelled by the story. I'm not sure, but I feel like this game was released on PSP for some reason. It's a lot like final fantasy tactics except it's sorta simplified and complexified in different ways. Just youtube a game play. There are some annoyances. Gamepad design is weird and in menu is oversensitive, but aiming a weapon, it's literally goes the opposite damn way. No it's not an inverse, idk why they did it, it's to allow for more human error. Xcom kinda except you do a lot of the aiming. It's really great tho. Also, another thing thats really kinda annoying... Well, they have their cutscenes which are great, but they have these sub scenes that are just so annoying cause you have to press a button every line. Even when someone says ""..."" Really kinda annoying buuut I'm looking past it.			"

												Decent port. I absolutely love this game. Highly reccommended if you like Turn-based Strategy.What is it? I guess you could say its a mix between XCOM and Fire Emblem. It's an undeniably Japanese take on World War II, and it works. The cell-shaded graphics are gorgeous, though cutscenes can be quite grainy. Everything on the in-game engine looks fabulous though. The game has a fantastic art style. I will say that most of the in-game menu cannot be controlled via mouse. It is obviously not ideal but as PC players, this is something we have to put up with when playing some console ports. Other than that the port is pretty great.			"

												If you missed out on Valkyria Chronicles on PS3, here's your chance to catch up on a treasure of a game.It's an excellent port at a great price, including all the DLC that effectively doubles the game length. My only qualm is that, with KBM, tank controls are sketchier and difficult to get used to. A gamepad is generally preferable in this case but you can definitely play with either.This is probably my favourite strategy RPG of all time. Progression through stats alone is not enough to get ahead, you have to adapt to the terrain and enemy team in every match to get ahead. Gameplay is engaging and fun, and very satisfying, though with some understandable quirks that could be corrected (but there hasn't been anything like this so they can be forgiven). Any given battle is a significant investment of time, and you end up getting a ton of mileage out of the game as a consequence. Each of the units and classes are useful in their own ways and you will use all of them healthily. It's well-balanced.The orchestrated OST is stellar, the watercolour art engine is outstanding, voice acting is professional and draws from all kinds of actors. The story is probably overwrought with war movie tropes, but the world-building surrounding Europa and the background attributed to the characters, weapons and countries are captivating. It's a product of love.Valkyria Chronicles is one of my favourite games of all time, is what I'm saying. The PC port captures everything great about it. Absolutely look into it, it's a unique game that anyone can enjoy.			"

												Ah yes, Valkyria Chronicles. A verry interesting entry in the SRPG (strategy role playing game) genre. This game occurs in an alternate universe earth where the east Empire fights the Federation (sounds familiar?) and when the Empire decides to attack a neutral by stander country. A pair of young adults must take arms and defend their homeland at all costs.A bonus: this game comes with the Japanese voice over(in addition to the english dub) as well as all the DLC released on the PS3 version. If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Shining Force, this is a game would yould like.			"

												Its the same old game ported from the ps3. If you played that one then this will be no different but will always have a place in my library. For new people getting into this then your in for a wild ride. Controls are finicky but still manageable. Its a tactical game so making small moves in wrong directions or aiming will greatly affect your outcome. Story is a strange twist to the genre of a war(very similar to what we already know) but adding an anime twist to it. Check out old reviews and base yoru decision off that, but i highly recommend this game.			"

												The original PS3 version was one of the hidden gems of the system, it was critically acclaimed and well loved by it's fans. Unfortunately sales wise, Valkyria Chronicles fell victim to SEGA's little to non existent marketing and to a poor release date in the west. Due to this fact and because the decline of the home console market in Japan, the second and third games  were only released on the PSP. Sadly the third game was never even localized in the west. So, you can see that Valkyria Chronicles as a franchise had a long and rough ride, but don't let it discourage you. In the SRPG genre, it's one of the best, and in my opinion, it's also one of the best games ever created.-Art:            5/5 If you like anime, then you won't be dissapointed. Every character and enviroment looks phenomenal.-Graphics:   4/5 Valkyria Chronicles aged well, and compared to the original 720p version on the PS3, the higher resolution options and unlocked FPS helps it tremendously.-Music:        5/5 The soundtrack is a beautifully composed orchestra, you'll often find yourself humming it.-Story:         4/5 Valkyria Chronicles has a good story with likable/relatable characters, although it can be considered a little bit generic.-Gameplay: 4/5 The combat is fun and engaging, but since it's a tactical game, sometimes it can be punishing.-Overall:      4.5/5 While the fanboy in me wants to give it a 5 out of 5 (YES, i consider it THAT good!), i don't want to decieve anyone, so realistically it's a 4.5. The PC version is good, the keyboard and mouse works perfectly with remappable buttons and a mouse sensitivity option, so props to SEGA for that, it's really rare these days to get a proper PC port.With the current price of 17,99€ (wich almost feels like a steal for such a great game), i can only encourage anyone who is thinking about buying it. Hopefully this time, SEGA will see the potential left in the franchise.			"

												One of my favorites from the PS3 generation.  It's got a definate JRPG feel to it, but it's the tactic based battles I enjoyed most.  I didn't need to buy this, since I have it on PS3.. I did anyway because I want to see more games like this in wild, and for all platforms.Anyway it's quite fun.  I hope to see the other games in the franchise moved over.  Glad sega did this.			"

												VC is a really good game with some flaws in the gameplay and other things .the game is mix between 3rd person shooter and TBS , the gameplay is really good but there's a flaw in defense mechanic and the only way to defense your untis is by crawling through the bush  or satying behind a sand bag if you did this you get extra defense but let me expalin the problem  :a unit with defense needs 10 shots to die a unit without defense needs 5 shots to die  but still if you sneak behind him you need to a 10 shots to kill him so it's not about the place  it's just a binary thing either 0 or 1 combat is not the only thing in this game , you have a big system management upgrading the classes,weapons,tanks and you can choose from a different soilders to fight with you every one of them have his/her own personality and these personality can effect them in the combat . the story was really good until you reach the sec half of the game and the game slpas you and the game become A ♥♥♥♥ING ANIME CLICHE.both the soundtrack and the art style are really good it toatlly  fit the game but the game is anime so if you hate anime you would probably hate it Pros:-The system mangment -The characters -gameplay-soundtrack and the art styleCons:-the menu is so terrible  -a flaw in defense mechanic-you can't skip or speed up the enemy turns-the game don't give any kind of into about the upgrades . -the way you play a cutscenes is annoying and they're on 720p .Conclusion:if the anime thing doesn't bothers you then go buy it , yes it have some flaws but the game is enjoyble and unique.sorry for poor my grammar .

												Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 console-port from 2008. I can't make comparisons to the original, since I know nothing about it. The graphics are improved though, as the game supports high resolutions. You can't directly change any other graphical settings, but higher resolutions render the textures and shadow maps in better quality. You can also disable the console limit of 30 FPS to your native refresh rate for a smoother experience. Controls are working in full gamepad support, as you can expect from a console port, but keyboard/mouse functionality is limited to the game's combat phases where mouse usage gets its debut. Menu navigation is managed strictly by directional buttons. I played it through using a gamepad, because it felt more natural as in how its meant to be played. I only used mouse for a bit of aiming support. That's where mouse is vastly more accurate than a gamepad. But it's not necessary by any means. The game is paused when you take aim. You can take your sweet time fumbling with the analog sticks if that's what you prefer.The main story is cut in pieces of visual novel -like speeches, pre-rendered cutscenes (which by the way are lower resolution than the rest of the game, probably straight copies of PS3 version) and combat sequences. The story is as cheesy as any moderate anime series. It has the usual characters mental growth, bits of romance, drama and handful of twists and turns in the plot. It has the common manga clichés like a group of teenagers being in control of the world's fate and awakening to superhuman powers (kinda, if you see it that way - I try to not spoil anything). I personally love that stuff. This game is based on a fantasy world - look for reality checks elsewhere. The otaku in me noted the lack of ""fanservice"" though. That would be the only minus in my personal taste.The gameplay mechanics are a real treat to us turn-based/srpg lovers out there. Combat sequences start by positioning your units. You get a set amount of action points each turn that are shared between your units. One action point is used when you select a character to move (or two action points for a tank) and you can attack once before deselecting it. Moving itself is a blend of real-time and turn-based system. Running inside of enemies sight/range, they will fire at you. They stop firing once you stop and take aim to shoot - it works quite well. If you select the same character multiple times during one turn, they are each time more fatigued, resulting in shorter stamina bar which indicates how far you can move. You can also use your APs to issue ""orders"" that you learn with more combat experience. Orders can be things like buffs to your units stats, healing or issuing a mortar attack anywhere in the battlefield. Although there's a decent list of different ones, I found myself hardly ever using them unless I was in a worrying situation. When you end your turn, the un-used action points are transfered to the next turn as a bonus. The enemy count tend to outnumber you the more the further you get, but their AI is, frankly, bad. You can use that to your advantage when planning the battle. The bad AI didn't really bother me. Rather, it balances the odds and helps you predict their next move.Winning battles award you with money and experience. Money can be used to upgrade your tank(s) and your mercenaries equipment. Experience is used to learn new orders and increase your character classes levels. Your units don't have individual leveling. Upgrading a shocktrooper class for example levels up all of your units in that class, potentially giving them new personal ""traits"" such as chance to trigger evasion bonus when under enemy fire or a shot that never misses the target. You can freely change the units you take into the combat. The experience you gain doesn't only affect those you take with you to the fight. They all gain benefits equally. Each character has his/her own ""personality"", stats and relationships. Good relationships with another character next to you in a battle makes both of them attack simultaneously when one of them attacks along with other possible bonuses. Bad relationships naturally decrease the peformance. Before wrapping this up, I should mention about those white cloudy borders you probably notice in all of the screenshots of the game. Yeah, they seem kinda unnecessary and I don't know what it's about. It was a curiosity at first to me - why is my view obscured by odd cloudy borders? During the 3D enviroinment of battle scenes, you can sometimes see manga sketch -like black lines of the background within that stuff. Did I understand it backwards? Perhaps the colored middle section was a result of my imagination when the real game was actually monochrome pages of a manga? When you enter a smokescreen grenade, the whole screen is filled with that stuff and you only see black outlines of everything. Am I seeing something that don't exist? Hmm! ;] Whatever it may be, after short gaming I forgot about it and my eyes started to ignore the white. It's probably just how they want the game to look more dreamy with already pretty canvas-like graphics.Overall, this game exceeded my expectations. It's fairly easy game, but oddly satisfying and addictive to play. While the story might not be anything to write home about, I will remember this title by its gameplay system. I would recommend it to anyone fond of turn-based war games and anime. I give it five out of five stars. :]			"

												This game got me addicted to playing it and took 76 hours of my life. I played it until I've achieved every achievement and finished everything I can do with this game. It breaks my heart deleting it on my hard drive, but all good things must come to an end. Salute to squad 7 and to all of Gallia!So here's my short review.The graphics of this game is what you would expect an anime game to look like. It's well designed and the movements of the characters are very smooth and not clunky.The voice acting and the BGMs were great. You can choose wether the audio is in english or japanese.The gameplay was awesome. A combination of turn-based, fps, third person game. I really don't know what it's called but it sure is awesome! :DThe story is told in a book-style menu where each scene is there in chapters and you can view the scenes as many times as you want. The story is well told though.The mechanics of this game are well explained. It's not that complicated and you'll surely get used to it in no time.The DLCs are free and there's the story mode and the skirmish mode. There's so many thing to do in this game.Check it out on YouTube if you really wanna know what this game has in store for you.I don't know how to rate these kind of things but because of the experience I had with this game and the 76 hours that my life had a sense of purpose again (LOL) I'll give it a whopping 10/10.

												A great port of a great game.The gameplay is solid, and can be reasonably difficult. Your squad members CAN die permanently, but on the other hand you will earn more rewards from missions if they are completed quickly, so riskier moves can be quite tense. Missions will never feel impossibly hard, but you will always want to pass with your entire squad intact. (Somewhat like XCOM: Enemy Unknown)Valkyria Chronicles has a really diverse cast, each with their own backgrounds, strengths and weaknesses. The game is quite story-based, and there are several optional side missions that flesh out the squad.Finally, the game looks amazing with a unique art style. Here's hoping to ports of the sequels!

												I usually wait for a game I am interested in before buying a video game console. And this one was the one which made me buy a PS3. The team behind it is composed of people who worked on games like Sakura Wars and Skies of Arcadia. The OST is from the man behind the ones of Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XII and Tactics Ogre.The game itself is like a mix of traditional (square movement based) tactical RPG and third person shooter. The movement is free and aiming involves a manual part instead of being only based on the character skills.Each fight brings a new element to the gameplay and the inclusion of tanks units for cover and orders from the commanding unit to alter the fight are nice additions.You can build your team of characters out of a large cast and each of them as special characteristics that can heavily influence their attitude in combat. For instance, some perform better when they are alone, some gets better stats when running fiercely into battle and worse stats when they are forced to advance carefully.As far as I have seen the PC port works well and the mouse control is quite helpfull when it comes to aiming. All original DLCs are included and the price is reasonable. It seems to support any resolution as well as any refresh rate. However, be aware that the cutscenes are not rendered in real time and seems to use the original from the PS3 (which were not that bad but in 720p without AA).			"

The combat is a mix between multiple genres, where you look at a map of the level enviornment, with icons placed to represent units and objectives. Selecting a unit brings you down on to the battlefield, where you control them using a limited pool of AP (think stamina). Enemies aren't docile in this game, and if you're within a unit's range they'll defensively fire at you. This intercepting fire can be absolutely lethal, and forces you to think your tactics through in a way unlike most turn based games. In addition to commanding your units, you can also issue orders, which are effectively buffs (Caution is an especially useful one, which lowers the damage of the afformentioned intercepting fire). You also don't have to move each character once and end your turn, you move units from a pool of CP, with regular units costing one point, tanks two, and orders are variable but usually between one and three. You can also save your unused CP up to a maximum of twenty points. The AI tends to be fairly intelligent for the most part, using cover and any special abilities they may have. They don't aim for the head, but the battles would be absolute curbstomps on their part otherwise. Sometimes they make silly mistakes, but they overall function properly.One negative thing about the game is that the grading system for each stage rewards taking stupid risks and completing the objectives as fast as possible as opposed to a more tactical and careful method. This is good for speedrunners, but not so great for people fond of taking things nice and slow, as the diminished rewards of a lower score could serve to force you to grind in the skirmishes to keep up. Also, while usually fair, the game does have a couple massive difficulty spikes, especially when you have to fight a massive tank known as the Batomys (seriously, good luck getting through that without a walkthrough). STORY:The story is satisfying, but it isn't anything to heap praise upon. You play as Welkin Gunther, and alongside your newly met friend Alicia and Darcsen sister Isara, you join the Gallian Militia. Two major powers, the Federation and Empire are at war with each other over the acquistion of a power source known as ragnite. Your little country of Gallia happens to be sitting on a lot of that precious stuff, so one of those factions (the evil sounding one), decides to invade your country. With superior numbers, technology, and overall everything, the country of Gallia is forced to start universal conscription. You, Welkin Gunther, are put in charge of the milita's Squad 7.Each of the many characters you can recruit for your squad is their own, with a detailed backstory, full voice acting, and various potentials which can help and hinder in battle. Most of your squadmates are teenagers, as this is a JAPANESE game, and such is to be expected. A permadeath aspect of the game helps to raise the stakes, much like Nintendo's Fire Emblem.The story does a good job of tackling the horrors of war, but it has it's flaws. SPOILERS ABOUND IN THIS PARAGRAPH BTW THIS WAS YOUR WARNING KTHNXBYE. The romantic relationship between Welkin and Alicia seems to be a bit forced, and doesn't seem to add much to the story. In addition, Alicia as a whole seems like a major Mary Sue. She's pretty, everybody likes her, she's the most powerful scout available, she's smart, a good cook, and is a Valkyur (an immensely powerful being) for some reason, and just wants to be normal. This could easily just be me, though.SPOILER IS OVER URWELCOME. Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is worth picking up. If you don't like turn based combat, or have a strong aversion to anime, you should probably avoid it, but you also probably figured that out by now.By the way, one of the units totally looks like Gordon Freeman. If you'll play it you'll find out who I mean.			"

												Quality turn-based strategy. Plenty of management options for your squad and just as many approaches you can pick from during the battle. Anime art style is really nice. If you are a fan of ""Annie May"", you will also care that there is a well done japanese voice acting. You will get to hear a lot of it as the game is ""story rich"", featuring a couple of cutscenes and dialogue scenes between all combat missions. Only thing I don't like are the menus.			"

												Sure you have to either like anime or not mind that's part of the over all game design, but if you get past that the game mechanics in terms of the way turn based is mixed w/ a sort of FPS movement system, the layout of the story through a book and chapters, and all of the design over all works to present a cohesive well thought out and executed package.And just to go on a bit about the game play, the turn based battles are immensely entertaining in the same vein as xcom.  Really glad this got ported to the PC (a workable port at that).  Here's hoping Sega pays attention to the sales numbers they've admited were way past their expectations and they bring VC2 and VC3 to the PC as well.			"

												9.75/10 Short comment on the story. Its not anything revolutionary, but it is one of the best love stories (personally) in a very long time and a nice, simple war story. It did a good job of keeping my attention and the bonus maps kept the story flowing very well and not seem abrupt (except the beach vacation one).Moving onto the gameplay, this is one of the best Tactical RPG systems I have ever seen because there is a lot of room for creativity, devising strategies, and planning. You want to get A ranks? Well there is no set way to do it. The world is your oyster here and your mind is very important, more then the levels of your units (more on that later). There are tons of possibilities with class loadouts, creative exploitation of game mechanics (smoke grenade are a good example), and orders. I did use a walkthrough for a large portion of this game, but I found myself messing up instructions or the instructions not working. So what I did is make my own improvements to their strategies and found a way to do some of these in less turns. And unlike some other games where you can get a ""god loadout"" (Fire Emblem Awakening and Bravely Default come to mind), most maps have their own unique feature that this is prevented, therefore most maps aren't too boring or repetitive. Quickly on leveling, it isn't what a match rides on. You can be lvl 20 on a map with lvl 8 enemies, but still lose your A rank easily because of bad decisions.Bad points about the game. 1) Some maps are way to stupid. Put Rosie here, use up all but two turns. Then put Alicia out and win. Another example is just putting Alicia out and only using her and getting an A rank (and I did this several times). 2) Most of the special weapons you hunt down aces for are completely worthless. The only notable weapons are the ultimate flamethrowers in the game, which are pretty much it. Otherwise there are like 8 sniper rifles that are worthless. 3) To get A ranks in most maps, it relies HEAVILY on the save/reload function.Side note: The anime is garbage. Welkin is a retard and Alicia is a typical tsundere which was painful to watch.  Valkyria Chronicles 2 is supposed to be trash. Valkyria Chronicles 3 is supposed to be decent, but Sega won't internationalize it. So Sega hit gold once and then ruined it basically. Sounds about right.			"

Bad side of this game is a good characters with cool biography on the rival(imperial) side and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scrubs on gallian(your) side. Also the war is looking wierd - 1 militiant squad repelling imperial army of invasion and killing whole Imperial government just becuase scriptwriter took some acid. 8/10 becuase there is no normal imperial campaign or even custom battles with possibility to choose own side			"

												I would like to correct a few things. A big thank you to Firehawk for helping me see the game through the anime. If you haven't read his reviews you really should (someone give that man a job!)I love this game. However, it does have many, many flaws. Again thank you to Firehawk for helping me acknowledge what i knew but wouldn't accept.Let's get past the bad part, the gameplay. I won't go into too much detail as others (*cough* Firehawk *cough*) have done a pretty good job, but I shall summarise. Enemies that stand still and take bullets, moments where the AI is incredibly dumb, a very odd leveling system, unbalanced gameplay, some units that respond to incoming fire (scouts, shocktroopers and tanks) and some that don't (all the others) as well as several poorly planned scenarios. Oh you may need to have a certain tolearance for occasional poor dubbing and repetitive soundtracks. There that'll do. For full details see Firehawk.Now onto what sells this game, aesthetics and writing (though according to some the latter needed work). Beautifully styled anime graphics mean it is the best looking turn based strategy game one can play. Anime fans will instantly be in love with how this game LOOKS.The best part though, by far, is the setting and characters.  In all my time video gaming I have never seen a game of this type that went to so much trouble, not only to create a great game, but also to craft an intricate plotline and give us great characters that we really want to keep alive. You REALLY feel like you have lost a friend and ally if a unit goes down and you are unable to get a medic to them before they die!  There are at least fifty (though there may be more i have yet to encounter) units All units divided into five classes suited to various combat roles. Each is genuinley an individual with they're own personality, strengths weaknesses and even little things like being a neat freak that can affect combat. All of this together equals a need to really think ahead, plan and use every advantage in order to complete your mission and bring all of squad seven home alive.So yes if you play this game, play it as a form of escapism, or as a person who simply enjoys anime and beautiful design. If you are a hardcore tactical and strategy fan, you will be dissapointed. I will still recommend this game for people who are strategy/tactical fans or anime fans (or if you are like me, both).			"

												So Valykria Chronicles is a gem of a game. I enjoy it a lot. Instead of a standard meat and potatoes game, this game is a shmorgazborg of stuff. What's that? A turnbased game? Sure. Except your enemies fire at you as you try to move into position. Add a bit of tank warfare, weapon customization and loadout selections. Little troopers with individual personalities (Cherry is one of my favorites) - It's got a bit for everyone. There are some cons. The battles are great but there are some that are.. kinda lame. ""Can only take out the enemy tank by hitting special super secret awesome singoku jidai weak points that only show up in xxxx situation"" - that kinda lameness, which is abundant in Japanese video games, and requires - REQUIRES - you to look it up in a guide because theres no way you could've figured that out on your own.BUT - the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. So what are you waiting for (unless it's a sale you're waiting for)! Buy this game! It's awesome, and then you, me and Largo can all get VIOLENT FOR VEGETABLES!			"

												So glad I finally get to play this game!  The port is very smooth, which was my biggest concern, I was very worried but it allows for 1920x  and V-sync as well as allowing a FPS up to the refresh rate and there is no slow down whatsoever, load times instant, etc.  Everything you'd want from a good port, sounds like they are learning from some of the past PC ports.The gameplay is fun and fluid, albeit challenging - sometimes a wait and see approach is the best strategy and it is reminding me of the my days of classic turn bases SRPG's like Brigandine and Fire Emblem, but with a gorgeous look.  The characters are likeable, and the story is mature despite the cartoon-y nature of the visuals.  I'm at the beginning of the game but so far so good! Living up to all the expectation's I've had over the years wanting to play this game.			"

												This is one of SEGA's greatest titles.  Epic battles with tanks and soldiers in an alternative history of Europe around WW2.  This game has amazing gameplay and requires actual strategy to make use of your units effectively.  One wrong step and you can say good bye to your forces and your chances of winning the scenario.  Fortunately, the game is fairly forgiving in many aspects, so survivability shouldn't be too much of an issue unless you are just constantly rushing into things.  The game has an amazing soundtrack, as well, with music very fitting to the scenes and battles.  The mix of drama, storytelling, and battles is carefully balanced and it's really nice that you can go back and watch most of the story content at any time.A tip to those who are having a hard time after chapter 4:  it's a bit tough to do, but rank up your scouts to rank 2 or 3 and do the scouts challenge in the second page of the skirmish menu (yes, there's a second page).  This will give a lot of experience points and cash for boosting your units, as well as an awesome rifle that dishes out tons of damage, despite it's short range.  Running through this scenario a few times will allow you to increase the damage factor of your scouts and engineers, increasing their effectiveness in many missions.			"

												So this is what you end up with when you go bat**** crazy with anime mods in XCOM.The difficulty is a lot more forgiving however, and the movement system is weird as hell. You get a certain number of command points each turn and use them to move units.......but you can spend as many as you want on each unit. You end up going all Rambo with a couple of units and forgetting the rest. And don't get me started on that damn ranking system.Still, it's a fun strategy game, and you get to save the not-jews from not-hitler so it's got that going for it.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is one of the hidden gems of the PS3 that everyone should play. The graphics are beautiful, the story and characters keep it entertaining, the backdrop has been used often (WW2) in games but never from this sort of rural perspective. This game involves military cadets at a small country caught between two warring powers- but while you may be used to brawny, muscle bound CoD war machines, the characters in VC aren't so war hungry. They have weaknesses, fears and personalities all their own, and it hurts if they fall in battle.The gameplay itself is both unique and fantastic, a major draw of the game. It uses a mix of turn based strategy and active movement- where you'll come under fire while moving, where cover like buildings, trenches and sandbags can really save you. You can sneak through grass- and each class has special abilities, such as scouts to spot those in grass, snipers which can't defend themselves but can take out enemies from a distance, and machinegunners which tear up close enemies as they run by on their turn.VC is what a strategy game should be- strategic, yet quick paced with every movement and position and action having meaning, and mistakes being very costly.I'll happily endorse Valkyria Chronicles as the best game of the PS3, and those who didn't have the chance on console should pick this up. (That is- unless you're waiting the HD version on PS4)			"

												I recently bought this game on the deal of the week sale for 9.99, and it's pretty much as good as i expected it to be. I never knew about this game when it came out on PS3 back in 2008, the first time i saw it was when they first added to the Steam store a few months ago in Novmember 2014. I saw the art style (anime) and saw how amazing all the reviews on the store page, so i decided to look up gameplay. The first time i saw Alicia running at 1080P 60 FPS (something the PS3 version does not support) i thought it looked amazing, then i saw a few comments about this game having a great sound track, then i was sold. I would of bought it on the holiday sale, had no money. I'm such a sucker for games with good sound tracks, and this one didn't disappoint. It's pretty good to see Sega pushing out a game like this since i'm a big Sega fan. It goes on sale fairly often, don't buy it for 19.99 (even though it's definitely work 20 bucks easily) just wait till it's 9.99.- Solid story line- Great sound track- Great graphics- Great gameplay- Solid keyboard and mouse controls (kind of wish you could use the mouse on the main menu though, but space bar being confirm makes up for it though)- Comes with ALL the DLC free that was on the PS3 as far i know (pretty sure it's all of it though)			"

												Pros:-A Great Story (A typical Tale for a JRPG)-Amazing Artstyle (Everything is Drawn out and then shades to Sketches when someone dies)-A great port especially if you just hook up a PS3 Controller to your PC or Xbox controller.-Some pretty original Game Mechanics but nothing too impressive-Can switch between english and japanese voicesCons:-There is no option to change the Difficulty for the game as a whole. (It's a Shame)-The games AI is rather simple, they move in a typical layout unless stopped by crossfire or stopped by the computed location as to where they were programed to move to. (Meaning easy AI)This game is one of those games you just have to buy. Even if you have played it on the PS3 way back in 2008. Strategic GamersRPG GamersJRPG GamersGraphic GamersStoryline GamersCharacter Development Gamers (Emotions to each individual Character)This game appeals to a wide variety of just about everything. If you are familiar with the rather underatted games and such like the Tales of ""Series"" (Symphonia, Abyss, Graces F, Xillia, Etc) developed by Namco, and other simular genres then boy are you in for a treat! If you are looking for a very challenging game strategic wise, I can't recommend this game you.You would be better off playing Civilzation V or Civilization Beyond Earth. The missions are not so hard, as they are just hours long sometimes 4-6 hours especially when you are first thrown in and are getting the feel of the pretty basic AI an with no ability to change the difficultly from Normal - Hard - Advanced. You get the idea. It's not a hard game just a long one. The storyline is a gem, that is all I will say, many tears were shed, many tables were flipped. Get this game and experience it for yourself or go back to Call of Duty, and let the real gamers play.			"

												Shortened version:Pros-Side character designs, vices, and backstories are diverse and interesting-This is a good concept, even if it's horribly implemented.Cons-This game is SLOW. There are a LOT of loading screens, cutscenes you need to go through, in game cutscenes you can't skip, dialog bits, and even waiting for the enemy to move takes a long time-On that note, you can't fast forward enemy turns. Minimizing pauses the game as well.-This is a strategy game with a HEAVY reliance on random number generation and probability. Many chances are a complete hit or miss--you either succeed or fail catastrophically. Some people also refer to it as a JRPG, but the RPG elements are very limited.-That said, the game is also horribly imbalanced. Many of the super difficult missions can be beat in a single turn by exploiting certain properties of your classes, while others can be beat quickly with a scout rush. The random aspect actually contributes to this.-Characters fail to come across as realistic. They feel almost there, but still a step away from human. Repetitive dialog doesn't help.-Plot has some decisions that are questionable or just stupid. The ending in particular is senseless (more on that below).Full review:Valkyria Chronicles seriously felt like a giant 30 hour sludgefest. As in I was slowly wading knee-deep in swamp.Good god why would a strategy game rely on random chances and probabilities for 80% of its actions?Why are there so many loading screens? Why are there so many goddam cutscenes that, even if you can skip them, you still need to load and watch a second of them first?  Why are the credits unskippable?Why is the dialog so long? Half the time it doesn't feel at all realistic. When characters interact, they usually reaffirm what each other said about 3 times, and they do it via repetition. (E.g., paraphrased: “Wow this bread is good! You should open a bakery!” After saying this like 2-3 times, instead of responding with “I’ve thought about doing so” or whatnot, the other character responds with something much more repetitious like “I’ve always wanted to open a bakery.” This is just paraphrased and isn’t word for word how it went.) Character interactions constantly feel a step away from human, which while it gets the point across, rarely feels genuine.There was only one character death in the game that made me upset. The only other death I sympathized with wasn’t even a character with a name, nor were they an ally. The rest were anticlimactic, predictable, or just outright stupid. (”I love you so I’ll kill myself in a blaze of glory for your honor!” f**k my A-HOLE.)The worst offender was at the very end, when you defeat the final boss. You literally have him about to surrender. He's disarmed, his super weapon’s been powered down, he’s weak and surrounded. Yet even one of your friends shows up and grabs him only to kill the bad guy in a suicide maneuver to atone for how he hurt you and and another team member earlier int he game AND IT'S SO GODDAM UNNECESSARY I'M ACTUALLY MAD. There was literally NO realistic reason for him to kill himself nor the final boss when they could’ve easily apprehended him. The icing on the crap cake? He kills them both by pulling the baddy-mc-badguy into a pit on board the carrier you’re on, which causes his deactivated weapon to explode, which causes the carrier to start exploding and basically screws the two main characters over. (GOOD JOB ATONING FOR YOUR DICKISH BEHAVIOR.)Being an anime game of course there’s supernatural aspects, but it’s only ever used against you. One good character has special abilities, but they only show up in game context once for the first half of a single mission and you don't even get to control them at that time. That's literally it. It's a huge  letdown--I would've LOVED to turn the tables and command a super soldier against an impossible objective. If they wanted it to be a plot device, they should've kept that in cutscenes only, not actually put it in a mission and not let you use it.Gameplay wise I love the concept and attempt at the approach, but the reliance on random factors is maddening and outright stupid. The way the game is set up, either things will go perfectly, or they'll go horribly wrong. There is no in between.So you wind up saving at a spot just to avoid watching the debriefing cutscenes, and the unit positioning, and the map-start cutscenes, etc. Probably the start of your turn, or right before a big play. Now you have to hope a perk you have will activate or your character won't suddenly develop Parkinson's and miss a nearly point blank shot, and when things do go wrong and you do absolutely no damage because of it, you'll reload. If you forgot to save recently, then prepare to watch all the cutscenes that played all over again since your last save, watch all the dialog bits, over and over and over again, until finally the RNG system stops jerking with you and you can move on.Whether or not it works in your favor, because of the random aspect most missions you can just rush a full scout team and have them slip in and capture the objective. Balancing is non existent. There is no difficulty curve, just a probability curve. Skirmishes can be beaten in 1-3 turns via a scout rush. Campaign missions can be anywhere from as much of a cakewalk, or can be absolute bull difficulty unless you know how to exploit the class imbalance. (One 'difficult’ boss that can kill your units in milliseconds if you don’t have cover can be beat in a single turn with just a smoke bomb and 3 snipers. Another can be beat in a single turn just by rushing shocktroopers.)Oh and of course, as you’re moving a unit around, if a perk activates randomly you’ll suddenly freeze and have a little mini-cutscene appear on screen as they say something gloaty, and then they get a perk to activate. Sometimes they can activate repeatedly during the same turn, btw. (Yay perk, boo WASTING MY TIME AND DISRUPTING MY MOVEMENT. One of Ted’s perks activated literally 3 times in a single move.)The game has a horrible habit of also changing mission objectives on you at random, without warning. One mission has two tanks spawn on opposite ends of the map. The only way to beat this mission is if you knew in advance that these tanks were going to spawn, and you equipped both of your own with anti armor rounds so you could actually kill both of them.My profile shows 30+ hours of play. About 40% of that was actually my gameplay. The rest was watching (and rewatching) cutscenes (some of which were unskippable), waiting for loading screens (there's plenty to go around!), and waiting for the enemy to make a move (even after they pulled some RNG bull and killed a key position of mine. Wanna restart? Too bad: you can't pause in the middle of enemy movement. You have to wait for their AI to tediously and meticulously finish. Even if they can easily kill you in their first move of their turn, they may decide to wait and finish you off during their last move.)I like a lot of the side characters you can put on your squads for their designs and backstories, and I feel like this system has a lot of potential, but beyond that this game was incredibly frustrating and slow as crap.I don't know why I bothered to finish this game. It was ticking me off for a while, and still does aggravate me.			"

												I don't like the anime style characters nor the cliche storyline, but the gameplay is good. The UI is a bit clunky; this was clearly designed to be played with a controller and not with a mouse and keyboard. There are a ton of cutscenes called 'episodes' if you like that kind of thing. Since I don't care for the characters nor the story, I don't care for the episodes. Fortunately, they can be skipped. As for gameplay, this is a turn based tactical game in the vein of X-COM. If you enjoy that, then this will be right up your alley.			"

												An amazing mix of Japanese anime and European war story, with squad based tactical RPG thrown in for good measure. This was the only game on the PS3 I played through several times and loved every second of it, when I saw it on PC I just had to get it and have been trying to unlock every mission with an A rating (still in progress). But to recap if you enjoy a squad based tactical RPG with anime elements and a cheesy war story you won’t lose out with this purchase. The only negative I would have to say are the occasional glitches on the pc version that I never came across on the console, so save often to avoid disappointments on certain levels, thumbs up!			"

												I think one thing almost everyone loves about this game is the fact that every single one of the many characters feel individual, each with their own animations and strengths/weaknesses. Aside from the characters, the gameplay is fun and the story is strong. I also really liked the music, it's a shame there wern't more tracks.However there are also problems with the game such as the port and the fact that it discourages slow strategic gameplay which which I honestly think is a huge mistake.Regardless, if you like the genre and art style then you should really pick it up.

												The lore is solid, and the story starts off with plenty characterization for the main characters. Top it off with gameplay mechanics worthy of a turn-based strategy and you have a promising game that's probably priced too low for its own good.As a port, it is incredibly well-optimized and should play well for most systems. Seriously, just get this game and play it in your free time. If you're a fan of turn-based strategy, then this game gives no room for you to dislike it.			"

												Here is my first comment, while the combat and game elements are excellent I would class this as a Visual Novel. I've spent as much, if not more time, simply watching the characters interact than I have playing the combat. If you don't like cutscenes or heavy narrative elements then I would avoid it.However, the narrative is incredibly well realised and absorbing. It's rich and touches on elements not normally found in games. The parrallels are easy to see, but unlike a more historically accurate setting the alternate earth allows for enough freedom that the story goes in unexpected directions. You can know what happened in WWII, but you can only guess what will happen in the game.The mix of realtime and turn based combat is excellent, and I'm very disappointed that it didn't become a 'thing' as I'd like to play it in other games (Xcom, I'm looking at you).Don't expect fast paced action all the time - but the action it has is excellent.

												Loved this game on the PS3 so I rebought just to have in my library and support SEGA's porting of awesome games to PC.  Didn't really intend to play, but that being said I've already pumped about 12 hours into this game in a matter of a few days.This game has a nice anime-artistic feeling to it with its cell-shading animation; the cutscenes aren't all that great since like everyone says, they are the original 720p port from the PS3, however, gameplay is smooth at my setting of 1080p 60fps.As far as gameplay is concerned, if you are a fan of turn-based strategy/war games, this is a must have game.  The first ever strategy game that I loved was Final Fantasy Tactics, and to me, I'd say this gameplay is on par with that.  Though the mission rating system is somewhat bogus, and theoretically you'd have to Scout rush to get the highest rating.  However, beating missions on first playthrough without caring about rating gives a feeling of great satisfaction.The story is heartfelt and warm; some parts may seem childish or stereotypically anime-like, but the themes and character develepment kept me entrenched the first time I played this game years ago and even now as I replay it.  That being said, I do hope publishers realize the potential of eventually porting more ""exclusive"" games to PC. "

												Phew! What a game! Wow! Amazing!Seriously, this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time. First off, it's a great port. Customize controls, muck with graphics settings, and easily use a mouse and keyboard if you wish. Well, sometimes driving the tank isn't the easiest with the mouse, but it's a pretty minor concern. Not only is the port well done, but the game itself is fantastic. It's like if Studio Ghibli made a movie about World War Two, and gave you interactive control over all the little battles in which our plucky protagonists participate. Think X-COM with an order pool.  I'm only about 5 chapters in, but the difficulty has been a nice gradual slope, and the system is complex enough that you can play around a little. Add in relationships between squadmembers, a nice little R&D and unit training system, and a boatload of solid voice work and you've got a recipie for awesome.My ONLY real issue is the occasionally uneven pacing. Sometimes the jumps between discussions of minority rights and the horrors of war to lighthearted anime antics and squad-level hijinks can be a bit jarring. Of course, this could be seen as an result of the style and influences.Anyone who likes anime, military history, or squad-level tactics should give this game a really solid look.			"

												This is a Wonderful PC port of a game I've already poured hours into but wanted to do it again, control scheme is wonderful, and in my opinion Valhalla Chronicles has some of the best character development and backstories ever.  There are many cutscenes which may become tedious for some players who like to jump into only the action but I prefer to know at least who I'm fighting with and what I'm fighting for.  My only dislike is the fact that the AI in the game won't really ever outsmart you, but you could be overrun by troops that are far too out of your league, and that feels to me like a ""bad loss"" where a good loss is when you lost because of a failure to be as strategic as possible with your actions and a bad loss is one where you could replay the mission as many times as you wanted and still die, even then, the challenge missions (which I'm probably not supposed to do until a higher level because they clearly outclass me) can be won with decent strategies and some guile.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good, fun, story-based game, or who likes strategy games with a slightly easier learning curve to them.			"

												Awesome Game, where do I begin? Is it a WW2 Game? Somewhat.. Is it JRPG? Perhaps.. Sci - Fi? Abit of that as well. What is incredible about this game is that it somehow blends all of the above elements into a fantastic movie anime game.  Smooth flowing graphics and music as well as in depth character build ups. It is a worth while investment. Its also not as simple as it looks. Much strategy is required in order to play this well. Re started a few times just to get it right. Choose the right team and you might just do well..Recommened. Looking forward to part 2.			"

												Imo Valkyria Chronicles is the best game on the PS3 and one of my 3 all time greats.The art style is very special and i really like it. The game focuses heavily on the story and has a lot of cutscenes, if you don't like that, you probably won't like this game. But if you play games for the stories (as i do mostly) you can't really go wrong with Valkyria Chronicles, except if you hate Strategy RPGs.			"

Top it off with gameplay mechanics worthy of a turn-based strategy and you have a promising game that's probably priced too low for its own good.As a port, it is incredibly well-optimized and should play well for most systems.

												So, first and foremost, this game is a port from the Play Station 3. Ports have not had the greatest history on steam, but rest assured, there are many things in this game that were done right:- Framerate defaults to 30fps, but this can be changed.- The resolution defaults to 720p, but this as well can be changed.- The controls are fully customizable for mouse and keyboard, and the game recognizes and works with the xbox 360 controller, so far as to have the buttons show up on the HUD in game.- Fullscreen can be toggled on or off- Don't forget V-Sync! Yay V-Sync!Most of these things are really what should be expected from a game on steam these days, so knowing that some ports are coming out with this now makes me happy (there are some that are missing these features that shall not be mentioned here, instead I will mention llamas: Llamas). What's even better than ports coming out with these basic features PC gamers have come to expect? When the games that are being ported are games like Valkyria Chronicles, this game is great! No really! You who are taking the time to read this should really consider buying it, if not for the game just to support the porting of games like this to steam.And also, TRADING CARRRRRDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Disclaimer: You may want to read a review that actually talks about the game itself before purchasing.

												Not much to say. This is a straight-up, good JRPG. Mixing elements of turn-based tactical/strategy RPGs and a third-person shooter, it feels quite unique. While it doesn't spend a ton of time innovating (aside from the aforementioned mix of genres), it has an incredible art-style and very solid RPG elements.The controls for PC are a bit nicer and more customizable than the controls for a controller, in my opinion, so they are very comfortable and practical for those who do not wish to use (or do not have) a controller.Overall, a very solid port. One of the best, perhaps (excluding FPS, which are often very easy to port over with the proper mouse-use tweaks). For a price this low, you cannot go wrong purchasing this game.			"

												I played half of the game in the PS3 version, and once I heard it was going to be ported as PC title I bought. So, this is a port of the aforementioned PS3 game, however, unlike other ports in Steam this is a good one. Controls might appear confusing at first due to some of the bindings, but you get used to them and if not you can remap them. Playing it with a control is optional too, but the keyboard/mouse combo was good to me.The game is about a small country being dragged to a world war due to two superpowers crashing due to lack ragnite(it is a mineral they use for a lot of things, like the petrol for us) in their countries. This small country was invaded by the Empire because it is rich on that mineral regardless it's stance was neutral. This country is being crushed and you will follow the history of Lt. Gunther to turn the tide of the war to get rid of the invaders. It starts like a ""normal"" war game but after some missions it gets some paranormal stuff(Valkyries), so if you don't like supernatural powers being involved in a ""normal"" scenario, you are not going to like it.The characters look like anime characters(which is fine to me and I like it!) and the game shows itself as it is a drawing, like reading an illustrated history book. If you hate this kind of stuff you will hate this game too. Every character has a reason to join the war, and while most of them aren't key to the history, the game still gives the player more information and details of them the more you use them.The gameplay is given from a tactical map with turn based elements where you choose what units to use at the begining of a mission and what positions will they have (there use fixed slots, though). It is played by turns between you and the AI forces, begining always with the player's turn. You are given points to move your soldiers and do their things and once they ran out you are asked if you want to end your turn(you can end it at any time though, not necessary to be empty). When choosing a soldier, the game changes into a third-person perspective and when you end your turn you return to the tactical map.Although the game uses turn based elements, if you ran in front of enemy troops they will fire to you(but if they, in their turn, run in front of yours they will be shot too!) because it is a feature of the game and can't be disabled. If you don't like your enemies in turn-based games to fire at you when it is not your turn, then you won't like it very much.You can upgrade your units in two ways: getting better weapons and training them to incrase their stats. When you win battles, you earn cash and experience(sometimes there are enemy ""Aces"" and if you kill them you get their weapons too) and that can be spent in new weapons or training respectively. You can also unlock some additional chapters with the cash earned through battles and let Welkin learn some stuff with experience points... although that comes a bit later into the game.Between battles, the game shows you a lot of cutscenes that you can skip if you want, but I don't recommend if you want to follow the history being told... if you don't like watching too many cutscenes you won't like this game. This game doesn't have an autosave feature, but you can save anytime you want, even in the middle of the battle. If you were expecting all the released games feature autosave, you will be disappointed. I don't think it needs this feature to be honest.I have heard a lot of people having problems with their PC and this game, but I haven't any issue so far, even before the patches were released. I play at 1080p with 60fps and I never had a single sound issue, sudden crash or ingame glitch. It also has achievements, but they are enabled after playing some missions.In case anyone is interested, it features a ""New Game+"" feature as well, carrying all your stats, medals, weapons, orders and money you had when finishing the game into a new game.So, at the end it is a good game and one of the best ports of the year 2014. If you like all or most of the stuff described above, I recommend this game to you. If you dislike all or most of the stuff described here, you should avoid this game... because I can see you writing a complain topic in the community hub ;). You can also watch some people playing it too, that might be helpful.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best games and sleeper hit on the ps3 many years back. Now Sega was Awesome! enough to port this to PC and its a fairly good port. The cut scenes are ok but doesn't look terrible but the ingame play looks as sharp and better than before on pc.  This is one of the best turn based strategy games I played on PlayStation 3 and Im glad to buy this again on Steam for PC.  Has great epic music, just listen to the title screen and you already get hit with an awesome theme. The story is fairly decent and bring up points about war and comradery among friends in a anime style-ish kind of way.  Another good reason to get the pc version is the load time is cut waaay shorter than that on ps3. Even better when you had it on SSD drives.   It has a WW2ish type feel and the artistic look of the game is amazing.  I would Highly give this game a try if your into Turned-based strategy.  Or even if your not, its an awesome game and plays/looks great.  If you see this on sale later on, I would buy it cause it's a steal!  Its decently long and you wont be disappointed  a must play in my book.			"

												I originally missed out on Valkyria Chronicles in 2008 when it came out on PS3 so I was quite eager to finally play it.The game is basically a turn-based strategy game but with a real-time move and combat system. I know, that's kind of confusing, but trust me, it's a good thing. You end up getting put in charge of a largish squad of people who each have a unique personality and set of traits, which makes things interesting as each of them can die and be lost forever.Really, it's a hard game to properly describe, but trust me, as someone who has had many regretable impulse buys, this is actually worth the money.

												One of the greatest and most criminally underrated / undersold / underplayed RPGs ever made now on the PC, with a huge selection of resolutions (up to 4k), controller and mouse/keyboard support, all of the DLC included, achievements, 60FPS, english/japanese voice options, and it even comes at a super cheap price. Well done, SEGA. For anyone that hasn't played it; buy it now and get ready to fall in love with a strategy RPG unlike any other. The game boasts a fantastic cast of characters, great plot, super strategic gameplay with a lot of action, beautiful graphics, a truly gorgeous soundtrack, and it's just one of those experiences that will stick with you for a long while after you beat it for the first time.SEGA, thank you for giving this title another chance and release, it easily ranks up with Lunar 1-2, Grandia 1-2, FFIX, Arc the Lad I & II, Super Mario RPG, and Nier as one of my all time favorite RPGs. I hope this will succeed enough to bring about a rerelease of Valkyria Chronicles 2, and I would be overjoyed to see Valkyria Chronicles 3 finally localized and released. Thank you for the extreme amount of care that was put into this port, it is beyond appreciated.			"

												This is one of my favorite strategy games to come out in recent years. This is a very unique game the only thing I can compare it to is Final Fantasy Tactics and XCOM. If you enjoy those games you will love this one. I love building an awesome squad that synergizes well. The only two down sides are the fact you can only rebind keys before you launch the game and the older cut scenes did not upscale as they were not in engine, sad but understandable for a six year old game.  The positive now really good mouse and key board support in regards to control and the actual in game engine looks gorgeous and scales well on most systems, I have amazing performance. Be warned this game does not hold your hand. You may find it easy in the beginning but rest assured I promise you there will be encounters that will challenge you and you will enjoy overcoming them. I high recommend this game and hope you will enjoy it.			"

												Usually i dont write reviews about games, but for this i will make an exception. I owned this on the PS3 and spent countless hours honing my squad's abilities, leveling, upgrading and buying powerful/accurate weapons. Not the mention the time spent on tuning up your tank which i made it pretty much indestructable. I havent come across another game which is a  tactical/3rd person, turn based, strategy hybrid.This game take place in an alternate universe across Europe in the middle of a ""resource-grabbing"" war and you play as a commander conrolling various characters, from war torn vets to fresh young recuits, each have their own biography and history. Throughout the game, the player commands each unit from a top to bottom view and perform actions (in a third person view) for a limited amount action points which is represented by a bar at the bottom of the screen.Squad members have their own unique personlities and most importantly ""potentials"" which enhance or cripple them during battle. To unlock potentials, the player have to level them using the rewards gained from completing missions.2 ""potential"" examples are:1) Your scout maybe overwhelmed by a volley of fire from huge numbers of enemy soldiers in line of sight, should the scout possess the ability to be extra hardy when facing alot of enemies, the scout may reduce all damage taken, making him/her unstoppable2) Using the same scenario above, should your scout possess the weakness of being scared when facing alot of enemies, he/she may perish way faster than you can facepalm.One can, move, shoot, activate various switches and climb/desecend for tactical advantages to accomplish the mission objectives.There are many types of mission objectives, capture the flag, rendezvous/escaping to an area, taking out certain targets and many more which keeps the game fresh. That being said, the game has a minor flaw in this area: your ranking and its reward gained is based on how FAST you finish the mission itself.Once a mission is completed, you earn rewards, sometimes in form of a currency to upgrade/level your squad, or purchase upgrades for your tank(s) and some missions reward specific weapons that are really imba. When the player completes the whole game, its be over yet as there is replay value from redoing missions to get more rewards, or even the DLCs  for the hardcore enthusiasts which will pit them to their limits. ***I feel the DLCs are hard.Summarised pros:=============-Great port, updated res, >60 FPS, (30FPS on the PS3)-Superb graphics and soundtrack-English/Japanese voice acting for ""anime-feel""-Great story and character development-Unique and memorable squad members-Long hours and replay value-Unique gameplay, mechanics-Keyboard/mouse/gamepad ready-CHEAP Summarised cons:=============-DLC may prove hard to some.-No multiplayer (PS3 never had one either)All i can say is, for a game this cheap, anyone/everyone might want to just give it a shot. One of the best game ever made.9.0 / 10 "

												Great port in the sea of horrible ports of Japanese ports to PC. Runs absolutely great, have a few weird character model glitches where some stuff is floating in mid-air. This and the in-combat audio is a little muted but going in and changing the audio options around fixed that real quick. With this gosh dang good port that can run and look great, along with all the DLC. This game is a must have for someone who enjoys XCOM or other strategy titles as it has got a unique set up unlike any other strategy game I've ever played. That and if you have a need for anime girls with guns this is it.			"

												The year is 1935. In Europa, the Empire declares war on the Federation, starting EW II. Because of its rich natural resources, the neutral nation of Gallia, is invaded by the Empire. Set in a loosely inspired WW II setting, you play as Welkin Gunther, a young Gallian University student fascinated by nature, who is drafted to the militia and made leader of squad 7.   As the story unfolds you will have to manage all aspects of your squad, from picking recruits, handling research to upgrade your weapons and equipment, to training your troops, among others.   The story is excellent with many twists and all characters being fleshed out, with complex backgrounds that end up justifying their personality and actions. Valkyria Chronicles is one of the few games that actually deals with heavy issues related to war, such as civilian massacres, concentration camps, ethnic cleansing, but portrays them in a mature way. Nonetheless it avoids being too heavy as you have the occasional casual moments with some respite between operations.   The combat mechanics are somewhat similar to XCOM. The battles are turn based, where you select your soldiers and control their actions. There are 5 different classes of infantry: scouts, shocktroopers, lancers, engineers and snipers who all have different roles on the battlefield, while Welkin uses his tank, the Edelweiss.   The graphics are simply stellar, as it uses an unique graphical style with the visuals looking like a moving watercolor painting. The soundtrack is also top class. Lastly there is a New Game + feature, where you can restart the story, unlocking some new features while keeping all your progress.   By far, one of the best games available on steam!			"

												Where do I begin...I played this game when it first released on PS3, loved every moment about it, I played it more than I slept for months on end. I beat the game about 7 or 8 times during the initial rush. It never got dull to me, between beating the game and watching the Anime with it, it was a perfect combination.The PC Port of this game, as I've played it thus far is without a doubt, the best PC Port of a game I;ve ever seen in action and had the privallege of playing. The gameplay is top notch, perfect 60fps no dips no nothing. Just perfect and smooth. The cutscenes are fluid as they were on the console.This game has been apart of my life since 2009, and now, since my ps3 is out of service, can live on with me even longer than it has.I don't wanna go into talking about the story of Valkyria Chronicles, but I will say I highly recommend this game. That may be biased, since it is one of my favorite games, but all in all, its well worth the 20 bucks again.			"

												This is one of the finest games I've played in a long time. Good, solid story and characters. The setting is enjoyably simple and interesting (Well thought out lore, unique weapons with weapon info, character profiles, medals/awards, culture etc). The part of the game outside of the story is a very unique blend of turn based strategy and first person action. You start with a set amount of command points that can be increased based upon the characters you're fighting with (some are better leaders then others). You can give specific orders (buffs) by using these points or take direct control and move a character. The missions are -challenging- even for a veteran of strategy games. Expect to play them a few times and to be wow'd when you figure out a winning strategy/trick.The level up system in the game is also enjoyable and rewards people who like to spend ample time having the best/strongest troops they can get.Great game. Well worth the shekels.			"

												This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I picked this game up on sale for $10, and it was the best $10 i've spent. Even when it's not on sale I would recommend this game. My first look at the game; I was kinda unsure about if it would be good or not, but I feel like it was amazing after I have played it. I didn't know about the JRPG, Anime game style, but it turned out to be great. When I first got into the game, I was stunned from how great everything looked. It was beautiful. Everything looked so pretty down to the grass on the ground.The Characters in Valkyria Chronicles are so great. Every single one of them in their own way, whether it be that they are cool, nice, kind, or if they are cold hearted, hateful, or jerk. The two protagonists of the game are: Welkin Gunther, and Alicia Melchiott. These are my favorite characters in the game, because of there background (SPOILER ALERT) their romantic relationship formed throughout the game. Welkin Gunther is a man in hie early 20s, that gets dragged into a war. Welkin is drafted into squad 7 as a lieutenant, who is also a tank commander of the tank Edelweiss. He is in love with nature, and wants to become a teacher. Alicia Melchiott is a woman the age of 19 who was formaly a baker, who later on got drafted into squad 7 as a sergeant, because of her role in the Bruhl town watch. There are also other main characters such as Largo Potter, Brigitte Stark (Rosie), Isara Gunther. Which are all awesome characters with good storys behind them.As far as game play goes, I would say that it has its ups and downs. But every game has that. I like the Third Person view when controling your character. The only think I dislike is that you can't see from the enemys eyes, when they are in view. I really like how you level up classes instead of leveling up one individual at a time. In my opinion that can get really annoying.Some advice when playing this game- Level up scout first. They are the best unit in the game- Another note on  leveling up. Get every unit class to elite rank before you get one to level 20- Save after every turn if you're unsure about how to win the battle- Make many saves- Don't let your units die!I rate this game 10/10			"

												This game is really fun!to be honest i had never heard of it before, so i was kinda expecting COD with anime girls but the way the game handles is actually really amazing.I'd recomend usng controller to play definitely. it's not impossible to play with keyboard (as i've been doing recently) but controller makes things flow easier, keyboard isn't awful, but definitely will take a bit of memorization/time in the beginning.every chapter takes me so long to complete but im 200% sure thats just me being amateur, but still fun absolutely because it's kinda fun to be pit in the situations laid out in the game and deploy every action u can think of to make things work- the satisfaction of seeing the finally work towards your favor is great... that's kinda most games tho i guess.buy it!

												I played half of the game in the PS3 version, and once I heard it was going to be ported as PC title I bought. So, this is a port of the aforementioned PS3 game, however, unlike other ports in Steam this is a good one. Controls might appear confusing at first due to some of the bindings, but you get used to them and if not you can remap them. Playing it with a control is optional too, but the keyboard/mouse combo was good to me.The game is about a small country being dragged to a world war due to two superpowers crashing due to lack ragnite(it is a mineral they use for a lot of things, like the petrol for us) in their countries. This small country was invaded by the Empire because it is rich on that mineral regardless it's stance was neutral. This country is being crushed and you will follow the history of Lt. Gunther to turn the tide of the war to get rid of the invaders. It starts like a ""normal"" war game but after some missions it gets some paranormal stuff(Valkyries), so if you don't like supernatural powers being involved in a ""normal"" scenario, you are not going to like it.The characters look like anime characters(which is fine to me and I like it!) and the game shows itself as it is a drawing, like reading an illustrated history book. If you hate this kind of stuff you will hate this game too. Every character has a reason to join the war, and while most of them aren't key to the history, the game still gives the player more information and details of them the more you use them.The gameplay is given from a tactical map with turn based elements where you choose what units to use at the begining of a mission and what positions will they have (there use fixed slots, though). It is played by turns between you and the AI forces, begining always with the player's turn. You are given points to move your soldiers and do their things and once they ran out you are asked if you want to end your turn(you can end it at any time though, not necessary to be empty). When choosing a soldier, the game changes into a third-person perspective and when you end your turn you return to the tactical map.Although the game uses turn based elements, if you ran in front of enemy troops they will fire to you(but if they, in their turn, run in front of yours they will be shot too!) because it is a feature of the game and can't be disabled. If you don't like your enemies in turn-based games to fire at you when it is not your turn, then you won't like it very much.You can upgrade your units in two ways: getting better weapons and training them to incrase their stats. When you win battles, you earn cash and experience(sometimes there are enemy ""Aces"" and if you kill them you get their weapons too) and that can be spent in new weapons or training respectively. You can also unlock some additional chapters with the cash earned through battles and let Welkin learn some stuff with experience points... although that comes a bit later into the game.Between battles, the game shows you a lot of cutscenes that you can skip if you want, but I don't recommend if you want to follow the history being told... if you don't like watching too many cutscenes you won't like this game. This game doesn't have an autosave feature, but you can save anytime you want, even in the middle of the battle. If you were expecting all the released games feature autosave, you will be disappointed. I don't think it needs this feature to be honest.I have heard a lot of people having problems with their PC and this game, but I haven't any issue so far, even before the patches were released. I play at 1080p with 60fps and I never had a single sound issue, sudden crash or ingame glitch. It also has achievements, but they are enabled after playing some missions.In case anyone is interested, it features a ""New Game+"" feature as well, carrying all your stats, medals, weapons, orders and money you had when finishing the game into a new game.So, at the end it is a good game and one of the best ports of the year 2014. If you like all or most of the stuff described above, I recommend this game to you. If you dislike all or most of the stuff described here, you should avoid this game... because I can see you writing a complain topic in the community hub ;). You can also watch some people playing it too, that might be helpful.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles was great on PS3 when it came out in 2008, now it's even better on PC with 60FPS and increased resolution. It blends round-based strategy with tactical third-person-combat and RPG-elements. The story follows the events of a global conflict between the western federation and the empire - it's basically an anime-version of World War II. Also: Hilariously pronounced german names like Gunther, Karl, Hannes or Herbert.			"

An excellent port for an excellent game. Here's to hoping they bring over the rest of the series.I can't recommend this enough. It's a must buy.			"

												The controls are not very good, especially for the tanks. This comes with all of the DLC that was available for the PS3 game too which is a very nice bonus. The game is natively 720p and changing the setting to 1920x1080 just makes some things blurry or grainy, it does not actually scale anything up.   As for the game itself, I played it on PS3 and bought it here immediately when I saw it. It is an excellent game, if you dont skip through every scene and actually watch them it has a well written storyline and good character development for the main characters. There are some good plot twists and the story does well to convey several of the realities of war without being particularly graphic or making light of serious situations.  There are also tons of little additional bits of information that come along as you play through the game and a lot of nice minute details.  If you like a turn based strategy game this is a good one, you dive into each unit and control it directly in a third person shooter type mode to take the turn. Every unit has a little personality which is driven by their voicing and abilities and weaknesses which change as the characters develop or through mission content. Non essential units can die permanently, so you are encouraged to respect their lives and work to minimize any losses as much as possible. Units level up as a class, not individually, so losing one of your more used units does not cost you everything they have learned or leveled. If a unit goes down you have a chance to rescue them before they die as well, so sometimes the risk can pay off. I enjoy this game and have played through it several times, if you are looking for a story driven action strategy game, give it a shot.			"

Interesting characters that make you reload saves when they die.      10/10 for filling a niche much needed			"

												In my opinion this is one of the most underrated games of all time.  The battle system is a unique blend of tactical 3rd person shooter and turn-based rpg.  I won't explain any more since it's more practical to youtube the gameplay.  If I could recommend one game to buy out of all the games I have ever played, this would be it.  Read other reviews and see that there is near universal acclaim from those who have played this.  It is unfortunate that this game wasn't more financially successful.  I hope that anyone considering this game will buy it so that there is some hope for a legit sequel.  Okay If you have to wait for a deal then at least put it at the top of your wishlist (Though it is worth the $20).  And if you won't put it at the top of your wishlist then at least put it higher than Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty.  Some additional thoughts:(1) Unlike some other ports, this game plays just as good, if not better than the original version.  Visuals are definitely better.  I can't speak to keyboard and mouse controls but it works just fine with a 360 controller.(2) One of the things I like most about this game is that there is no grinding. All battles progress you through the story. There is, however, an experience system and you can play though optional battles as needed if you need to level up your sqaud.			"

												Absolutely amazing.I have been waiting to get a PS3 so I could play this game and its sequels (along with a few more PS3 exclusives like Dangan Ronpa).But now that it finally has a PC port, I don't have to wait till then to start enjoying the game one of my favourite anime series is based on. If you want to get an idea of what the story is like, just watch a couple of episodes, or the whole thing (but spoilers are are obviously a concern if you wacth the whole anime.)The controls aren't hard to get used to, even if you aren't using a console controller or gamepad, it runs really smooth, cut scenes are beautiful and the voice acting is superb (Japanese voices, haven't tried English and likely never will). The whole idea of a RTS/TPS is something I had been wanting since I was a kid, and this game turns a great idea into a masterpiece. It is seriously worth buying, and if you aren't too sure, just watch some gameplay on a random YouTube channel (not a review video) to get a feel for what its like.As of yet, any drawbacks of the port that most people spoke of, if they did speak of drawbacks, I didn't really notice or mind at all.Still will be getting a PS3 eventually so I can play the sequels and other JRPG PS3 exclusives.

												This is a Wonderful PC port of a game I've already poured hours into but wanted to do it again, control scheme is wonderful, and in my opinion Valhalla Chronicles has some of the best character development and backstories ever.  There are many cutscenes which may become tedious for some players who like to jump into only the action but I prefer to know at least who I'm fighting with and what I'm fighting for.  My only dislike is the fact that the AI in the game won't really ever outsmart you, but you could be overrun by troops that are far too out of your league, and that feels to me like a ""bad loss"" where a good loss is when you lost because of a failure to be as strategic as possible with your actions and a bad loss is one where you could replay the mission as many times as you wanted and still die, even then, the challenge missions (which I'm probably not supposed to do until a higher level because they clearly outclass me) can be won with decent strategies and some guile.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good, fun, story-based game, or who likes strategy games with a slightly easier learning curve to them.			"

												Phew! What a game! Wow! Amazing!Seriously, this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time. First off, it's a great port. Customize controls, muck with graphics settings, and easily use a mouse and keyboard if you wish. Well, sometimes driving the tank isn't the easiest with the mouse, but it's a pretty minor concern. Not only is the port well done, but the game itself is fantastic. It's like if Studio Ghibli made a movie about World War Two, and gave you interactive control over all the little battles in which our plucky protagonists participate. Think X-COM with an order pool.  I'm only about 5 chapters in, but the difficulty has been a nice gradual slope, and the system is complex enough that you can play around a little. Add in relationships between squadmembers, a nice little R&D and unit training system, and a boatload of solid voice work and you've got a recipie for awesome.My ONLY real issue is the occasionally uneven pacing. Sometimes the jumps between discussions of minority rights and the horrors of war to lighthearted anime antics and squad-level hijinks can be a bit jarring. Of course, this could be seen as an result of the style and influences.Anyone who likes anime, military history, or squad-level tactics should give this game a really solid look.			"

												An old JSRPG that was released as an exclusive for PS3 back in 2008 comes to PC. It brings joy, sadness, and ermuhgerd all doze feelz, along with an HD retooling to better suit the machines it is destined for.The Great:Story is amazing, albeit very heavily weighted towards the end. Graphics could be said to be dated, but IMO doesn't show it thanks to the stylistic choices made - let it be known that sketch art is amazeballs. Strategy is simple for most missions, but getting the hang of the systems and how to exploit them will aid in attaining those coveted 'A' ratings.  Music is fitting and quite delightful throughout. Additionally, people say the english VA is campy, but I found them to be pretty spot on.  If it bugs you, you can use the original JAV tracks instead. Finally, the game is of a good length; not too long but not too short. I made it through in around 30 hours with minimal grinding (which wasn't necessary, by the way.)The Not-So-Great:Those PC Controls.... dear lord they are convoluted and nonsensical. Do yourself a favor, plug in your X360 controller for the best experience. Also, play with your framerate locked to 60Hz until the issue with tank physics is patched... otherwise, your tank won't be able to traverse semi-steep terrain which, while not required, is helpful in various missions.As an addendum: SEGA needs to release the two sequels on PC as well. I don't care that they were PSP titles, I WANT MORE OF THOSE FEELS! It's a quaint, well-realized world built with enough history and detail that I sat up and read all of the lore. I haven't done so since the first Mass Effect. Generally my time is better spent playing other things, but becoming engrossed in the setting was 100% completely worth my extra time.			"

												Bretty gud strategy game that I love and have played for many hours on PS3.  It seems to be an untouched port directly from the console, with the biggest difference I've noticed being the blessedly sped up loading times.It's turn based--you use up all your command points activating units, then your enemy does the same.  You select which units to ""activate"" from a two dimensional battle map, but after selecting a unit, the camera changes to a third person camera for the unit you've selected.  From there you run around and aim/fire like a third person game until you've used at least one item/attack and exhausted your movement points for that unit, or until you manually end that unit's turn.  You can level up your troops, upgrade their armor and guns, and customize your tank, so there are some ""RPG elements.""  The troops are also unique characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and quirky potentials that provide some variety even among units of the same class.It scratches my X-COM squad-tactical-strategy itch, complete with permanent unit death, though not as punishing difficulty wise.  The cutesy animu style belies a story that is at times quite stark and serious, covering topics like racism, xenophobia and the callous indifference of war.  The experience is futher enhanced by a solid and memorable soundtrack, including one of my favorite vocal songs from a video game.A big thanks to SEGA for making it easy for PC players to enjoy what I believe to be one of the best games on the PS3.  Psssst... SEGA... please bring VC 2 and 3 to PC also and take my money.  :^D			"

												I don't know whether to hate or love this game.First and foremost this is not an RPG.  There is no roleplaying in here.  You follow the story of a man named Welkin, but you don't make any decisions on his behalf outside of combat orders and equipment decisions.  It's a movie, and the interactive elements are the equivilent of playing magic the gathering.  I don't know why it's labled as an RPG, it's a turn based tactics game.As a turn based tactics game it's great!  There are a few units that have their own strengths and weaknesses that balance out pretty nicely, and the game hands you a variaty of combat situations to use them in.  Over time you upgrade weapons and armor and it shows in game.  The controls (On my gamepad anyway) are really smooth and easy to use, even going far enough to assign buttons to walk slowly, which is a godsend in minefields.  Not to mention the asthetics are georgeous.The story is terrible though.  Your enemies are an emporer who is evil and has all his men wear black.  All of your units let you see their faces, while the opponents all wear big face conceiling helmets to help dehumanize them.  For god's sake, your unit's uniforms are red, white, and blue.  The conflict is essentially that there is a shortage of a substance to the empire attacks everyone.  By the end of the game there is peace, but the underlying problem of ragnite shortage is completely forgotton, despite having less of it after the war effort.  Not to mention the characters.  I hate them I HATE ALL of them.  Every single one is that one really irritating character in a show that doesn't speak like a human being and acts really naieve about the world's problems.  In the end the game just announces ""You win all the battles, world is happy now."" It's simple, irritating, and cheap. Overall though, as tactical squab based combat goes, this one was amazing.			"

												This ia an OUTSTANDING game. If you like Skies of Arcadia, Anime, or tactical games even a little don't miss it!  The graphics have a very cool ""colored pencil"" cell shaded art style. The gameplay is equal parts turn based and real time and the story's vibe reminds me of the 16bit RPGs of old.  You command a squad of soldiers and have a certain amount of turns  to perform actions with each one. During your turn you control them in 3rd person view and move them around in real time. But when you decide to attack you drop into first person mode to aim and the action pauses allowing you to take your shots. The mechanics are well explained during tutorials in the game.There are numerous classes and upgrades to each. The missions are creative and enjoyable in their own right but the story may be what is best about this game. It has a wonderful plot and set of characters in your squad. The squad mates have good character interactions and you'll actually care about them and who makes it thru the battle.Also as a bonus for people who remember Skies of Arcadia..You can get Vyse and Aika in your squad! A highly reccomended game. One of the best PS3 games now for PC!			"

												Let me just say up front (because it'll sound like I hate this game in a couple paragraphs): I really liked this game, but that's because I'm a huge lover of SRPGs (Fire Emblem, XCOM, etc). If you're not a fan, might wanna read below to know if it's right for you. If you are a fan, still read below to be aware.I liked the characters, as well as the slight personality for all most of the 'grunts'. It reminded me of Fire Emblem: Awakening, though the grunts are less developed than that. The story was fine; not incredible, but delightful all the same. Im also glad the characters avoided the Squenix Effect, were relatively simple and weren't all belts and zippers. The translations were really well done, and I like the throwback graphics, though for some reason my comp would chug at times (it's been able to run any game so far without a problem). On the heels of that, though, the team who ported this should be given the utmost credit: they did a very good job of bringing thiis to PC without any muss or fuss (though I did have a clipping issue at one point on level 15).The real issue is the gameplay itself. In Fire Emblem:Awakening or XCOM, you're given indicators of whether or not you'll miss and how far you can advance. This game doesn't do any of that, and just instead gives you an AP bar for running and no indication of your chances of hitting, forcing you to wing it. That'd be perfectly fine if that system wasn't also intersecting with the rating system. To not struggle immensely towards the later part of the game, you need to get 'A' rankings on your missions to get the exp and gold boosts to upgrade your people sufficiently, or else be forced to replay maps over and over again to farm exp. To get an ""A"" ranking, you need to speed through each level with a precision and timing your troops just don't have, requiring you to save-scum and killing some of the fun of the missions. Because if you're gonna go for A rankings, which you pretty much have to, the tactics and decision making becomes very rigid and lacking in choice. Since SRPGs are supposed to be all about doing it your way, I have to raise an eyebrow at one that punishes you for doing it your way. TL:DR version: It's a rigid system in what's supposed to be a fluid genre, requiring a lot more luck than skill or tactics.And the less said about how the tanks handle, the better.So at the end of the day, I can recommend it for the story and characters, but gameplay will depend on how easily frustrated you get.That said, I can't wait for them to put out the second one.

												Just a quick review, especially since I haven't actually finished the game:Good:-Combat and Mission design (you can generally establish a favored strategy, but there are  some curve balls)-Art-Relatively intuitive gameplay-Some legitimately nice story moments-Interesting backstory-The various potentials and backstories do a decent job of helping you to remember your squadmates, and permadeath might actually feel weighty as a resultMeh:-The overall story (a bit saccharine and anime-esque at times, but some people will be used to this)-The subs for the Japanese voices aren't always in tune with what they're actually saying-The way the cover system works seems oddly picky-The fact that enemies can shoot at you while you're moving adds an interesting gameplay dynamic, but can be incredibly frustrating in close quarters combat-This is probably not the case on harder difficulties, but the squad revival mechanic seems overly forgiving-Sometimes the dialog can drag a bit-I thought the music was largely forgettable, but that might just be my personal tasteBad:-The menu system (it seems really clunky and annoying)In the end, it's been a very fun game thus far, and the only wholly negative thing I can think of is the horrible, horrible menu system. If you are used to anime (or can stand a very anime-esque story) Valkyria Chronicles will be a fun game.			"

Anyway, the game play is great, and the story kinda makes sense (Meaning that you can keep up with it). Its requires strategy, skill, smarts, and a little luck (I have no luck, btw. R.I.P Wavy). This may be good for some people, but at the start of the game you get kiddnaped by a Waifu. Enjoy that, and the fact that shes one of the two characters that wear skirts into combat. gg.			"

Plus it includes all the DLC!Even if you're not usually a strategy game fan (I'm indifferent to them personally), this is a fantastic little gem that's absolutely worthy of your time. Plus it will help set a precedent for more of this sort of thing getting ported over with this level of care!PS: Plus bonus point for having cameos from Skies of Arcadia.

Some missions may be frustrating.[ - ] Large download size due to uncompressed files.[ - ] Cheesy writing and dialogue. Overdramatic voice work (both languages).If you get frustrated easily or don't have much time, there are other games that provide greater and faster satisfaction.			"

												99 outa 10.Game is so great you won't even need a reach around.The story is great, building on real world history to a minor degree. The Darksen representing the jews. It has some rasicsm. It's not all fun and games but it mostly is. Just about everything you deside to do changes the apperance of your units.Planning ahead or learning from your mistakes. The game is a great experience in a strange tactical gametype. Try it out. More then likely your money will be well spent.			"

												One of the PS3's best games makes a graceful transition into the PC.A gorgeous game filled with great missions, Valkyria Chronicles remains one of the best and most unique TRPGs I've ever played. While randomly generated content often suits tactical games pretty well it's still nice to play a game with battles that feel designed by people and not spit out by algorithms.Though it may have been originally released in 2008 aside from the low res FMVs the game doesn't feel outdated at all.

												The year is 1935. In Europa, the Empire declares war on the Federation, starting EW II. Because of its rich natural resources, the neutral nation of Gallia, is invaded by the Empire. Set in a loosely inspired WW II setting, you play as Welkin Gunther, a young Gallian University student fascinated by nature, who is drafted to the militia and made leader of squad 7.   As the story unfolds you will have to manage all aspects of your squad, from picking recruits, handling research to upgrade your weapons and equipment, to training your troops, among others.   The story is excellent with many twists and all characters being fleshed out, with complex backgrounds that end up justifying their personality and actions. Valkyria Chronicles is one of the few games that actually deals with heavy issues related to war, such as civilian massacres, concentration camps, ethnic cleansing, but portrays them in a mature way. Nonetheless it avoids being too heavy as you have the occasional casual moments with some respite between operations.   The combat mechanics are somewhat similar to XCOM. The battles are turn based, where you select your soldiers and control their actions. There are 5 different classes of infantry: scouts, shocktroopers, lancers, engineers and snipers who all have different roles on the battlefield, while Welkin uses his tank, the Edelweiss.   The graphics are simply stellar, as it uses an unique graphical style with the visuals looking like a moving watercolor painting. The soundtrack is also top class. Lastly there is a New Game + feature, where you can restart the story, unlocking some new features while keeping all your progress.   By far, one of the best games available on steam!			"

★★★★★This is an excellent story-driven and unique third-person RTS game from 2007. It's obvious that the graphical style is memorable and nice like the young hard-to-not-notice animé galls in war uniforms. And yes, like an animé, it has a kind of cringy, optional english dub (but not terrible at all!) and it has some quirky writing and characters considering the setting. But do not simply pass this game by because of this.Let me first stress that this game is not meant for everybody, not because only of the above mentioned aspects, but because it is filled with hours of click-through dialogue scenes. These nicely animated and voice-acted in overall. However, they do take up the bulk of the game. You can skip through these, but that would mean you'd miss out on the perhaps the best aspect of the game. Atleast you'd get to experiences the charm and funny personalities during the battles where they get to shine. My personal favourite has to be Cherry, the cartoony 'Long Beach' girl, who would says things to her girlfriends like that 'dying is so not OK'. Despite the excellent charm, look and lenght of the game, it isn't released without its flaws. Though the combat is unique and robust, I did (literally) walk into some walls. In a game where your movement is restricted on how much space you've covered, it's only infuriating that you don't get to safety only because you didn't expect a invisible wall ontop of a curb high ledge. In these cases, I had to use another 'command point' just to move the guy like 3 feet just so he would be save. This quirk also applies to fences: characters can jump over sandbags, but a fence of the same height cannot be crossed. Some other reviewers joke about tanks being unable to shoot through tents (and also trees in some cases), which is maybe a similar quirk like the above mentioned, but not as constraining. A placement of a prop would have meant a whole lot to me.I believe that those quirks are the view things that were in my way of enjoying the game, beside some missions around the second act of the game which try to be different from the rest, but suffer from some odd design choices. These caused me to take a break on the game, till I visited the forums where players shared the same enervating experience. Bite through these and you'll have a great time (again). The general game is still excellent and worth checking out.			"

												It's a very unusual squad-based tactical combat game.  No squares or hexes?  Heresy.  ;)Gameplay:Depending on the mission you might be controlling as few as one or two named characters and a couple of generics, or deploying as many as nine or ten (often including at least one in a tank).There's a command point system.  One command point is required to activate a character,  which shifts into a third-person 3D view where you can run around (limited by action points, depending on unit class and also reduced a lot if this isn't the first time you activated the character that turn) and attack (once, although you can keep moving afterwards if you still have AP).  Action is *mostly* frozen while you're active, but enemies who spot may shoot at you (and you them, on their turn).  Time stops when you initiate an attack so you can aim (enemies have weak points; for humans its the head, for tanks it's the glowing radiator at the back) or look around without being shot at until you abort the attack or go through with it.CPs are also expended for giving orders, which can provide various bonuses and benefits.  Some are extremely situational, while others can be quite strong.All the characters you manage have a class (Scout, Shock Trooper, anti-tank Lancers, Snipers, Engineers); some visible stats (action points, health), some invisible ones (damage resistance, accuracy); personal potentials (traits, not always positive, which manifest themselves as you make use of the character) and battle potentials (traits, always positive, revealed and activated as you level up a class). Completing missions yields XP which you use to level up classes rather than individual classes, or to learn additional Orders.  The monetary rewards ('ducats'), are expended to research improvements to your equipment.  The faster you complete a mission (turns, not real time), the higher the grade and rewards.Story:Unusually heavy story line for this sort of game... in fact, navigation through the game is largely in *Book Mode* -- you're paging through a history book telling the story of your militia squad.  The characters you control *all* have biographies that get revealed as the story progresses, and the story is told through numerous cut-scenes between combats.It's sometimes sweet and fluffy, it's sometimes brutally tragic -- there's both scenes of love and happiness, and of devastation, slavery, and slaughter; of friendship, and treachery.  I found it unusually well done for giving purpose and context.Miscellaneous:Game is set up to allow farming, via skirmishes -- replayable battles outside of the main campaign, but unlocked as you progress.Art style is gorgeous, and not terribly demanding -- I was running it on a laptop w/ a Quadro 2000M.  It's a PC port of a game that was on a Playstation, so this isn't too shocking.Voice acting is pretty decent, if you consider that the characters are mostly ordinary young people, not professional soldiers.  When one character sounds like a Valley Girl exclaiming ""Well, DUH"" after she shoots dead an enemy, it's because she's *supposed* to be an 18-yr-old more interested in trends and fashion than, say, Clausewitz and Sun Tzu.Includes all DLC from the original game.Some bugs related to high frame rates; locking to 30fps is recommended.

												Owned and played VC 2 and 3 on the PSP, by the time I got my PS3,  VC 1 was no where to be found for me to purchase.****3 years and 6 months later (11/11/14)****I was so excited taht VC 1 was made to be available for PC on Steam. Played a bit and made me had the same feelings as 3 years ago regards to gameplay.While this is a port not a remaster, it is much better then Assassin's Creed 2 onward and Final Fantasy XIII. The only issue I am having is the controls. Other than that, the game runs great with Intel HD GPUs, getting 40-45fps, 55-60 fps with nVidia 750m.Pros:++Graphical options - Resolution and framerate++Solid +Memorable series themeCons:-Unfriendly keyboard inputs-It would be nice to have anti-aliasing built-inFor short, get the game if you missed it, or you played VC 2, 3 but skipped the first one. My rating [so far]: its a 9/10 underrated game (series) that has been under the radar for too long**Friendly challengePlay the game before you watch the anime [Yep, an anime series was made 6 years ago (2008), so you can judge whether it was a good adaptation or not! :P			"

												I'm writing this after clearing the game second time.TL;DR10/10The game is fantastic.Buy it if you're TBS/Anime fanGraphics and SoundA slight upgrade from 2008. with 16:9 resolution available.A fix may be needed to properly apply anti aliasing.Asides that. The art style is simply beautiful and anime-like. Characters have fine details on their face.Background and Environments is finely made. The vehicles and weapons are well-designed practicalThere are also some comic-like sfx font coming off guns and vehicles which is icing on the cake for the art styleThe sound design are adequate, not realistic or too cartoony.The music in menu and in game are also good. Well beyond par.There are radio chatters in game made by your ally and enemies alike which add to background.GameplayThe game featured RPG and turn based style gameplay with some real time elements.The gameplay is simple and very easy to understand and not many complex features.Every mission you'll start out with a briefing. showing the map and the objectives.In the mission. You must control your character to complete the objectives.The movement of your forces and enemy forces is represented in turns. If it's your turn, you enemy cannot move and vice versa.You will be given command points (represent in badges). Each command points moves your characters (2 needed to move a tank).You can select your characters to move.The character will have a set ""AP"" which will determine how far can they move.Besides movement, character can use their equipment (Main weapons/Grenades/Medikit/Repair tool) once.The character can be selected more than once. but their start AP will diminish each time.Command points persist after turn enabling you to move more effectively next turn.When you move in enemy range, enemy will start ""Incterception fire"" which happens in real time.It will stop as soon as you start aiming your weapon, get out of enemy sight or end the action.When you aim at enemy. You will display if your weapon is effective and the shots to kill the enemy.If the enemy survive the attack and your character is in range they will counterattack.In enemy turn. You can see where enemy units move.But if the enemy character isn't spotted by any of your units. The game show approximate movement on the map.Basically, enemy will do exactly the same thing you do in your turn.Environments are important in game.You can hide your units in grass, crouch behind sandbag or trench and climb up the ladder to get to vantage point.There are also boss battle in game!Outside mission.You can use experience you've earned during mission to rank up classes.Characters have class that will determine Hitpoints AP and equipment.Scouts have highest movement and spot enemy from afar.Shocktroopers have resistance against small arms fire and close range firepower.Lancers have Anti tank capability.Engineers can repair tanks,sandbag and can heal better than other class.Snipers can snipe enemy from afar.Each level up will improve performance in combat.You can use money you've earn to upgrade your equipment and tanks.You can also customize the roster of who will be in mission and backup.Each character have their unique ""Potential"" which will buff or debuff the character during the gameplay. Eg, buff accuracy on sniper nests/ nerf when dirt is nearby.Story and LoreThe story is great, if not the best aspect of the game.Set in Fictional continent of Europa in World war 2 like era.Gallia, an independent nation situated in the middle of two superpower (Empire and Federation) is once again under attack by the Imperial Alliance, commonly known as ""the Empire"" for it's abundant of ragnite resources in the conlict known as Second Europan War.The story revolved around Welkin Gunther, a College student then enlist into Gallian Millitia as Lieutenant.He then must lead Squad 7 from the outbreak of the war to end of the conflict.The story developed quite well with no plot hole and cliches. (I am someone who likes to look into plot hole, and I never found one.)There are motifs of Politics, war, life of a soldier and even racism.There are also sad and romantic moments that is excellently executed in the gameEvery characters you recruited have their own voice acting and personality and liking another character.The Unique voicelines are played throughout mission and also trigger during certain circumstance eg. meeting close friend.This game also feature Permadeath. Your characters who died in battle will be gone forever with exception of main character.The character development of main characters is done well, through cutscenes and cinematic.There are side missions that you can play the further look into detail of the main characters.On top of that there is character's bio and gloassary to futher educate you with background of characters and details.Conclusion.This game is classic if not timeless. I never own PS3 so I didn't play in the original release in 2008. I still don't know why I didn't play it on release of the game on steam in 2014 even my friend gifted me.Give it a try. This game will not disappoint you.PS. Don't watch the anime. It changed the story for the sake of........ fun? and is full of cliches and cringy moment.It's the undoing of the story of this game			"

												This is one of the finest games I've played in a long time. Good, solid story and characters. The setting is enjoyably simple and interesting (Well thought out lore, unique weapons with weapon info, character profiles, medals/awards, culture etc). The part of the game outside of the story is a very unique blend of turn based strategy and first person action. You start with a set amount of command points that can be increased based upon the characters you're fighting with (some are better leaders then others). You can give specific orders (buffs) by using these points or take direct control and move a character. The missions are -challenging- even for a veteran of strategy games. Expect to play them a few times and to be wow'd when you figure out a winning strategy/trick.The level up system in the game is also enjoyable and rewards people who like to spend ample time having the best/strongest troops they can get.Great game. Well worth the shekels.			"

												This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I picked this game up on sale for $10, and it was the best $10 i've spent. Even when it's not on sale I would recommend this game. My first look at the game; I was kinda unsure about if it would be good or not, but I feel like it was amazing after I have played it. I didn't know about the JRPG, Anime game style, but it turned out to be great. When I first got into the game, I was stunned from how great everything looked. It was beautiful. Everything looked so pretty down to the grass on the ground.The Characters in Valkyria Chronicles are so great. Every single one of them in their own way, whether it be that they are cool, nice, kind, or if they are cold hearted, hateful, or jerk. The two protagonists of the game are: Welkin Gunther, and Alicia Melchiott. These are my favorite characters in the game, because of there background (SPOILER ALERT) their romantic relationship formed throughout the game. Welkin Gunther is a man in hie early 20s, that gets dragged into a war. Welkin is drafted into squad 7 as a lieutenant, who is also a tank commander of the tank Edelweiss. He is in love with nature, and wants to become a teacher. Alicia Melchiott is a woman the age of 19 who was formaly a baker, who later on got drafted into squad 7 as a sergeant, because of her role in the Bruhl town watch. There are also other main characters such as Largo Potter, Brigitte Stark (Rosie), Isara Gunther. Which are all awesome characters with good storys behind them.As far as game play goes, I would say that it has its ups and downs. But every game has that. I like the Third Person view when controling your character. The only think I dislike is that you can't see from the enemys eyes, when they are in view. I really like how you level up classes instead of leveling up one individual at a time. In my opinion that can get really annoying.Some advice when playing this game- Level up scout first. They are the best unit in the game- Another note on  leveling up. Get every unit class to elite rank before you get one to level 20- Save after every turn if you're unsure about how to win the battle- Make many saves- Don't let your units die!I rate this game 10/10			"

												My recommendation comes on the back of some pretty hefty reservations.  First off: the gameplay is very fun.  It earns my recommendation on that back of that alone.  The game on its first playthrough is pretty challenging for first timers, and I assume everyone is a first timer since this combat system is rather unique.Unfortunately there are some seriously bad things, especially for an adult audience.  The combat has its fair share of unfairness.  The AI can end turns a lot faster than you can, which means you get dinged by reactive fire and their units typically don't.  One mission in particular had an enemy who was not only invincible, but could cross the entire map in one turn and would one-shot any soldier in their path.  Typical JRPG ""cheese as challenge"", but something one can expect from a distinctly Japanese game.  The real downside is the cutscenes and story.  It verges on interesting in several parts, but the characters and dialogue are often cringeworthy, borderline G.I. Joe PSA stuff, like ""eat your vegetables.""  Sometimes I want to alt+F4 out of the game when I have to hear my Rambo Elite Scout Aisha who has more kills racked up than three special forces units combined complain about body insecurities or that one enemy soldier she couldn't help not five minutes after she shot 4 in the face at point blank range.  The whole thing plays war like a game in Winny the Poo's Hundred Acre woods with characters whose status as unparalleled commando elites mass murdering whole armies is suspended every time a character needs to complain about their body insecurity or the horrors of a Darcsen labor camp... from a tank pilot who has literally killed human beings by running over them with a tank.So yeah, it's a great game for the combat and the story borders on interesting if you can get over the insufferable anime tropes and cliches.  If it comes up for sale, I'd recommend it.			"

												(Honestly I was going to review this once I finished the game but due to tests, reports, SAT classes, and life in general I have had no time to even relax to play games, it also doesn't help that I screwed up my save file a couple times. I will probably finish the game once hell freezes over at generous estimates. The only relaxation I have had is me sitting and listening to OK Computer, Pinkerton, In Rainbows, or Toxicity for the 200th time while doing all these things, just keep this in mind when reading this review)This game is a very underrated JRPG, overall JRPG's, especially on the PC platform, has been saturated with some of the most basic of basic tropes and at this point the only thing it takes to make a good jrpg on PC is to slap some♥♥♥♥♥♥ and copy paste some random popular jrpg that are either on handhelds or consoles. I am happy to say the Valkyria Chronicles does it's own thing and does it pretty well, and it has some tropes which can at times take me out of the experience, it isn't as bad.The game is a Turn Based Third person shooter, much along the lines of XCOM Enemy Unknown. The shooting mechanics work for what they are and enemies can shoot at you during your own turn which forces you to think on your feet, there are many times where you are given an objective and you will have to figure out what will be the best and most efficient way to finish the objective. There are a total of 5 classes, Scout, Shock Trooper, Lancer, Engineer and Sniper. Scout can run the longest and can shoot at medium-long range, ShockTrooper run faster but not for too long, they weild a machine gun and can shoot at close-medium ranges, they can also take a lot of damage. Lancer is strictly used for taking out tanks, or, depending on how you build them, can be used to take out soldiers as well. They can take the most damage. Engineer is one of the weakest of the bunch but can run at a decent distance and can repair anything, they also can heal the most and have 3 gernades. The Sniper is the weakest, but the hardest hitting against troops, their pretty self explanatory, you snipe people. The classes are *MOSTLY* balanced and each one bring something new and fun to the table. Be careful though since you can permanantly kill them off so you must make sure you have a plan.There is also loads of extra content such as Reports, DLC (haven't played all of them, will not be included in this review), and secret unlockables which bring out side stories of major characters as well as some minor. This is something I think the game does very well, characterization, every major character, and some minor ones, have their own backstorys and their personality, some characters at first seem dickish and mean at first, but when doing these reports you start to understand why they do it and they usually end up realizing their wrongs in the end, this is amazing character development and what brings out the best of this game to me, you feel for everyone and while you may not agree with how a character does something, you understand why. Even the enemy side isn't simplified as ""oh bad guy kill kill we hate kittens"" the enemy side does do terrible things, but it the game reminds us that the people have their reasons why they are in the war, and the reasons are justifiable for the most part. The game also has beautiful art direction and it is something that can only work in 3D for me, the anime simply does not do it justice.The story so far is also engaging, although keep in mind this is not a gritty WWII style game, it has it's serious moments but it is mostly not as serious as yo would think it is, this is not much of a problem for me, but I understand why people would be put off by animeish tropes being inserted into a WWII setting. but overall it is a very engaging story. I also liked it's references to WWII such as concentration camps and references on Trench Warfare, it's little but it kept me engaged in the story.Now for the problems, the game isn't perfect of course. For one thing it plays more like a puzzle game than a strategy game, as you will find yourself trying to figure out what the devs wanted you to do in order to get that A rank this isn't a problem for me right now since for my 1st playthrough i don't really care for ranks as much unless it is an extra or report mission, but it is a problem. Also despite many of the characters being fleshed out, many of them also aren't at all. Many of the characters I do not have a emotional connection to at all, the only thing is I can say is ""well this dude/girl looks cool i guess, and their attributes work in my favor so i like them."" so when one of them fall, unless they are units I use often, i don't particularly feel anything.Another problem is the difficulty spikes, they are everywhere they go up and down and it is really jarring. For example the Batomys battle is legit the hardest mission in the entire game, but it is like chapter 7. Then there is battle at Naggiar 2 which is also incredibly difficult, but the very next chapter is legit the easiest mission in the entire game. There is simply no flow to how the difficulty increases.I also mentioned how the classes are MOSTLY balanced, well, that's only initially. Once you reach mid-end game you realize how OP scouts are and how insane some of the orders are, Mortar Support being the most broken order as well as Caution mixed with defense order, as well as Penetration. And Scouts with defense order + caution are tanks, especially if that tank is Alicia, during late game she might as well be invinicible at that point. these completely break the game.There are also times where AI will simply glitch out or be incredibly stupid. like the enemy will sometimes get their snipers to constantly move back and forth and do nothing for no reason.Also last thing, Worst Report is R&R literally the most cringe worthy thing I have ever witnessed in a video game and it costs a whole lot of in-game cash too. why was that even made is beyond me.Overall the game is pretty great, later games do improve on these aspects, or so i have heard, so i hope they port them soon. I suggest you get the game at full price if you can to support the devs. It is well worth it.			"

It's surprisingly engaging.Cons:The controls don't translate perfectly from console - menus rely on keyboard only controls, the overview control with mouse is super wonky, and I can't operate the tank to save my life.Neither Pro nor Con:Really, really hard.

												Tactical RPGs are rare in today's gaming climate. Interestingly enough, it's one of my favorite genres. If you're like me and have been wanting a current-generation Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre for years now, give Valkyria Chronicles a try. It tries something bold and new with its third-person shooter style gameplay, but incorporates a large portion of the depth and tactics that make the genre riveting.The PC port is good, but not perfect. The graphics haven't been overhauled, it runs relatively well, and has solid controller support.I should mention that I beat Valkyria Chronicles on PS3 before playing the PC port.			"

												Amazing game. Get it. 'Nuff said. Pros:The art style is awesomeThe game's strategy mechanics are greatThe characters are well-done Not too easy or insanely hard; just the right level of difficultyThe fact that characters don't immediately die when their HP reachs 0, but instead go into 'critical condition' and you have to rescue them within 3 turns or they dieThe level-up mechanics are coolPigs with wingsCons: Sometimes aim is extremely annoying, like your Sniper missing 4 shots in a rowBosses are very difficult (Can be either a pro or a con, depends on the player though)Scouts and Engineers are too fragile Snipers don't have a very large movement rangeOverall, I give it a 10/10. Despite it's cons, it's an awesome game, plain and simple. If you're still not sure about getting it, go watch a video walkthrough or something. It's worth getting though :)Now to wait for VC2 to come out here.			"

												What a weird game, I vote yes on gameplay and no on the rest. Since you can skip most of the rest it comes down to a yes.The combat is interesting and rather unique (some balance issues) the squad management is great (even if the menu navigation is a weird).The setting is not bad either. Alternate history world war (although calling one side a loose federation of democratic countries and the other an authoritarian empire makes things very black and white), Lots of interesting backstory. The characters are overly silly, but I can live with that as it makes them a bit more memorable and distinct (although lots of overused cliche anime characters among them).The basic plot: battle for independence against a superior evil foe led by an underrated militia section whose leader is thrust to the front lines and is trying to get out of his fathers shadow to protect his sister etc. etc. Not bad actually now that I am writing it down and thinking about it.Alas it does not matter though, since the storytelling is awful. vomit inducing. Everyone is silly happy cheerful despite all of the horrible♥♥♥♥♥♥supposedly going on. Even if it just happened like 5 minutes ago. I am not asking for realism in terms of science, just emotion please. All of the overused anime tropes aren't helping one bit either. Everybody seems completely out of touch with reality most of the time (by reality I mean their reality). Lots of ""Friendship will save the day"" kind of lines.So much is just ridiculous:The main character after being asked if he is going to sign up to the military says: ""no - being a soldier is not for me I want to be a teacher"" which happened 10 mins after he killed 3 enemy scouts and saw several civilians killed for no reason in front of him, during an attack on his home town which basically was a declaration of war on his tiny country by an empire spanning half the world, oh and their tiny country has conscription, which is revealed 2 chapters later, I guess he forgot about that. Lets see, what else? The soldiers that shoot innocent civilians at sight yet somehow stop to explain to 2 people how they hate them and are going to kill them and don't do anything when one of them grabs a gun and points it at them. The general who is faced with impossible odds and yet seems to care more about lookign down on the militia and getting them killed than winning the war. The soldiers who are facing impossible odds and find time to be racist towards their own comrades and refuse to fight with them despite getting orders for going on a suicide mission the next day. The reporter who doesn't quite understand how government censorship works, luckily for her neither does the script writer.I found the best way to digest the story was to be drunk and think of it as a ""so bad it is funny"" kind of a comedy.And that is all in the first 5 chapters, don't know when I will be drunk enough to continue.PS: half your army is underage with one girl, a shocktrooper no less, being 12 years old.It will cost me more in alcohol to play through this game than the actual game itself.

												In my opinion this is one of the most underrated games of all time.  The battle system is a unique blend of tactical 3rd person shooter and turn-based rpg.  I won't explain any more since it's more practical to youtube the gameplay.  If I could recommend one game to buy out of all the games I have ever played, this would be it.  Read other reviews and see that there is near universal acclaim from those who have played this.  It is unfortunate that this game wasn't more financially successful.  I hope that anyone considering this game will buy it so that there is some hope for a legit sequel.  Okay If you have to wait for a deal then at least put it at the top of your wishlist (Though it is worth the $20).  And if you won't put it at the top of your wishlist then at least put it higher than Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty.  Some additional thoughts:(1) Unlike some other ports, this game plays just as good, if not better than the original version.  Visuals are definitely better.  I can't speak to keyboard and mouse controls but it works just fine with a 360 controller.(2) One of the things I like most about this game is that there is no grinding. All battles progress you through the story. There is, however, an experience system and you can play though optional battles as needed if you need to level up your sqaud.			"

												Absolutely amazing.I have been waiting to get a PS3 so I could play this game and its sequels (along with a few more PS3 exclusives like Dangan Ronpa).But now that it finally has a PC port, I don't have to wait till then to start enjoying the game one of my favourite anime series is based on. If you want to get an idea of what the story is like, just watch a couple of episodes, or the whole thing (but spoilers are are obviously a concern if you wacth the whole anime.)The controls aren't hard to get used to, even if you aren't using a console controller or gamepad, it runs really smooth, cut scenes are beautiful and the voice acting is superb (Japanese voices, haven't tried English and likely never will). The whole idea of a RTS/TPS is something I had been wanting since I was a kid, and this game turns a great idea into a masterpiece. It is seriously worth buying, and if you aren't too sure, just watch some gameplay on a random YouTube channel (not a review video) to get a feel for what its like.As of yet, any drawbacks of the port that most people spoke of, if they did speak of drawbacks, I didn't really notice or mind at all.Still will be getting a PS3 eventually so I can play the sequels and other JRPG PS3 exclusives.

												Ive played the hell out of this game and beat it like a lot of other people have on the ps3. Ive also played and beat VC2 and am currently in the middle of VC3 and I have to say you will not go wrong with this game or its sequels, in terms of graphics (well the graphics for the second and third game are watered down versions of the first one, but aren't necessarily bad), story, gameplay and even the soundtrack. This is a spectacular port for an amazing game that deserved a lot more attention than it was given. If you ever come across this game do not hesitate to buy it. I guess my only gripe with the PC port is that its aspect ratio is locked at 16:9 and there's no FOV option (at least not until someone succesfully hacks it) so I can't make use of my multi-monitor setup with this, but at least you can scale upto and past 4K on here and play the game in glorious 60fps.

												Every second you spend reading this is a second you could have spent playing Valkyria Chronicles.  Keep that in mind.It's day one of the release of this PC version, so a review might seem premature, but I played the PS3 version extensively and this seems exceedingly faithful to it.  From a technical point of view, the engine seems to have come across flawlessly, and the full range of resolutions available would at least indicate that it hasn't been a lazy port by any means.  Surround sound works well, M+K controls are well-implemented alongside the direct controller support, and the entire experience is smooth - as a port, I doubt we could ask for anything better.The game itself is a predominently turn-based squad tactical game, although that severely undersells the charm and quality of the gaming experience it provides.  You're given a pool of 'command points' each turn with which to issue orders to your squad from an overhead tactical map.  View then shifts to the unit in question, and you proceed to control them in semi-realtime action, moving them and performing such actions as they are capable of on their turn (such as shooting, throwing grenades, healing, etc).  That unit's turn ends when they run out of 'action points' or when you choose to end it early, and view switches back to the overhead map screen where you can use your next Command Point.  This continues until your Command Points are used up and the enemy gets a turn.  This continues until victory or loss conditions are met.  It sounds simple, but like many tactical games there's a lot of depth available to you that you'll only appreciate by playing it.Bracketing the combats are many well-presented story segments done in the game's signature watercolour style which are a joy to behold, as well as the opportunity to construct, expand, and advance your squad.  You also get to delve into the backstory of several of your squad members as they can get their own little sub-missions.If you've gotten this far, you've probably spent 2 minutes now reading this instead of playing the game.  Shame on you!  This deserves to be a huge success on the PC, hopefully breaking free of the somewhat cult status it holds on the PS3.  Buy it now - Galia needs you!			"

												An old JSRPG that was released as an exclusive for PS3 back in 2008 comes to PC. It brings joy, sadness, and ermuhgerd all doze feelz, along with an HD retooling to better suit the machines it is destined for.The Great:Story is amazing, albeit very heavily weighted towards the end. Graphics could be said to be dated, but IMO doesn't show it thanks to the stylistic choices made - let it be known that sketch art is amazeballs. Strategy is simple for most missions, but getting the hang of the systems and how to exploit them will aid in attaining those coveted 'A' ratings.  Music is fitting and quite delightful throughout. Additionally, people say the english VA is campy, but I found them to be pretty spot on.  If it bugs you, you can use the original JAV tracks instead. Finally, the game is of a good length; not too long but not too short. I made it through in around 30 hours with minimal grinding (which wasn't necessary, by the way.)The Not-So-Great:Those PC Controls.... dear lord they are convoluted and nonsensical. Do yourself a favor, plug in your X360 controller for the best experience. Also, play with your framerate locked to 60Hz until the issue with tank physics is patched... otherwise, your tank won't be able to traverse semi-steep terrain which, while not required, is helpful in various missions.As an addendum: SEGA needs to release the two sequels on PC as well. I don't care that they were PSP titles, I WANT MORE OF THOSE FEELS! It's a quaint, well-realized world built with enough history and detail that I sat up and read all of the lore. I haven't done so since the first Mass Effect. Generally my time is better spent playing other things, but becoming engrossed in the setting was 100% completely worth my extra time.			"

												Bretty gud strategy game that I love and have played for many hours on PS3.  It seems to be an untouched port directly from the console, with the biggest difference I've noticed being the blessedly sped up loading times.It's turn based--you use up all your command points activating units, then your enemy does the same.  You select which units to ""activate"" from a two dimensional battle map, but after selecting a unit, the camera changes to a third person camera for the unit you've selected.  From there you run around and aim/fire like a third person game until you've used at least one item/attack and exhausted your movement points for that unit, or until you manually end that unit's turn.  You can level up your troops, upgrade their armor and guns, and customize your tank, so there are some ""RPG elements.""  The troops are also unique characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and quirky potentials that provide some variety even among units of the same class.It scratches my X-COM squad-tactical-strategy itch, complete with permanent unit death, though not as punishing difficulty wise.  The cutesy animu style belies a story that is at times quite stark and serious, covering topics like racism, xenophobia and the callous indifference of war.  The experience is futher enhanced by a solid and memorable soundtrack, including one of my favorite vocal songs from a video game.A big thanks to SEGA for making it easy for PC players to enjoy what I believe to be one of the best games on the PS3.  Psssst... SEGA... please bring VC 2 and 3 to PC also and take my money.  :^D			"

												A flawless port of the PS3 Classic with a few PC bonus's. Porting to the PC means you get mouse control for aiming and with a nice sensitive mouse, you can make quick turns but the precision hits. Same in gae layout of the PS version, storybook advancing and what not.If I had to pick one issue, its that the save menu is still manual. No auto-save after each story advance / mission. But thats how it was on the PS3 and it worked. All in all, 10/10 for the port. Someone at sega finally earned some coin.			"

												Great Strategy game! I am usually not a fan of strategy games but this game really hit the spot, in a way.The game drags you into it's story right at the start and makes you want to play it for hours and hours.I haven't had a game which made me want to play hour after hour in pretty long time so i'm loving this.The mechanics are easy to understand and fun to learn.I didn't buy it sooner since I didn't want to spend 20€ without knowing if i'd like it, but I bought it now because it was on a 66% discount.Having played it for a few hours (as of now) I do not regret it at all -- In fact, based on how much fun i've had up to now i'd be totally okay with paying the normal price of 20€.If you're thinking about whether you should buy it or not then I say go for it, you won't regret it.

												TLDR: If you enjoy tactical turn-based gameplay with squad customization and character advancement, and you find the visuals appealing and aren't put off at the prospect of an animu-style storyline, give Valkyria Chronicles a go.Valkyria Chronicles is an old (2008) PS3 game that was ported to PC in November 2014. It tells the story of Welkin Gunther, son of a famous general from fantasy Europa's World War One equivalent. As a citizen of the tiny duchy of Gallia, situated between two continental superpowers: The Atlantic Federation and the East Europan Empire. When Gallia is attacked by an imperial army, Welkin is drafted into the country's militia, taking command of a squad of soldiers which he leads from the Edelweiss, a tank piloted by his adopted little sister. The game's storyline follows squad seven's struggles against the invading imperials, whose invasion in turn seems to be connected somehow to the myths of the Valkyrur of old.The game's characters are colourful, in most cases charming and likeable, but many members of the core cast can come across as a little cliched or over-the-top. Story-wise, it's good, but not great. There are some twists and turns along the way that I really didn't see coming, but the overall impression is brought down by the often fairly cheesy anime dialogue. The ham-handed way the game presents racism against the black-haired Darcsens is a good example of how an attempt to portray complex social and ethical issues doesn't work well when you're only really painting in black and white.Gameplay-wise, this game succeeds with a few bumps. Battles are split between a top-down tactical view where you select which units to activate, transitioning the game to a third-person view where you get to control characters and tanks individually. Each turn, you receive a limited number of command points that can be used to activate soldiers and issue orders (single-turn boosts to various unit stats, or other indirect benefits)  from the tactical view. Each activation lets your unit move and fire or perform another action. The different unit classes have different strengths, weaknesses, equipment and abilities, from scouts that specialize in fast movement and spotting enemies to engineers that can clear mines, repair vehicles and restock ammo.In general, this recipe works well for providing interesting tactical puzzles to overcome. Many challenges promote or require unit cooperation and combined arms tactics. However, the AI is generally lacking in sophistication beyond predetermined simple scripting, and beyond killing soldiers left hopelessly out of cover and such it generally fails to do much productive during its own turn. The gameplay style favoured to achieve ""A-Rank"" on the various missions (which depends solely on speed and no other parameters) tends to be dependent mostly on rushing a few soldiers forward as fast as possible, taking out special enemies along the way while completing the objective in a low number of turns. This emphasis on speedrunning in terms of what rewards you get from each mission somewhat hampers the overall enjoyment.There are other bumps in the road as well. The tanks move a little differently than infantry, spending movement points both when moving and turning. This might not be such a problem if they didn't have a tendency to spin around and jitter a lot, potentially draining all your movement very fast, owing to small glitches and a very awkward control scheme. The consequence is that you'll probably often just leave your tank parked in the deployment zone for the duration of many battles. Other sources of frustration include the fact that you cannot bring up the ingame menu during the enemy turn, which means if you realize you made a critical mistake you're forced to watch the entire sequence of enemy movement before being able to reload. Sometimes, I found it faster just to alt-f4 rather than wait for the AI to finish.As a final note, I'd like to say I enjoyed the visuals throughout the game. Some people might not like the style, but if you take a look at the preview pictures you'll get a good indication of whether this is for you or not.PROS:- Pretty visuals- Engaging tactical puzzle gameplay- Plentiful challenge in the DLCs- Colourful cast of characters- Solid storyCONS:- Issues with the port (tank movement, console-ish controls et al) can cause frustration- Poor AI- A-ranks only based on speed, tends to depend on reloading a lot to pull off difficult shots to be feasible- DLC weapons can screw up campaign balanceOverall, the game gets my recommendation. It's a game I was frustrated with at times, but one I also enjoyed a lot and ultimately found satisfying.			"

												My recommendation comes on the back of some pretty hefty reservations.  First off: the gameplay is very fun.  It earns my recommendation on that back of that alone.  The game on its first playthrough is pretty challenging for first timers, and I assume everyone is a first timer since this combat system is rather unique.Unfortunately there are some seriously bad things, especially for an adult audience.  The combat has its fair share of unfairness.  The AI can end turns a lot faster than you can, which means you get dinged by reactive fire and their units typically don't.  One mission in particular had an enemy who was not only invincible, but could cross the entire map in one turn and would one-shot any soldier in their path.  Typical JRPG ""cheese as challenge"", but something one can expect from a distinctly Japanese game.  The real downside is the cutscenes and story.  It verges on interesting in several parts, but the characters and dialogue are often cringeworthy, borderline G.I. Joe PSA stuff, like ""eat your vegetables.""  Sometimes I want to alt+F4 out of the game when I have to hear my Rambo Elite Scout Aisha who has more kills racked up than three special forces units combined complain about body insecurities or that one enemy soldier she couldn't help not five minutes after she shot 4 in the face at point blank range.  The whole thing plays war like a game in Winny the Poo's Hundred Acre woods with characters whose status as unparalleled commando elites mass murdering whole armies is suspended every time a character needs to complain about their body insecurity or the horrors of a Darcsen labor camp... from a tank pilot who has literally killed human beings by running over them with a tank.So yeah, it's a great game for the combat and the story borders on interesting if you can get over the insufferable anime tropes and cliches.  If it comes up for sale, I'd recommend it.			"

												First I need to say this port could have been made better, the interface does not support mouse and can only be navigated through my keyboard. I still can't fathom why Sega wouldn't do that because the interface is a mess and it would have been a lot simpler with mouse controls.Valkyria Chronicles is a truly unique JRPG although I don't belive its the best. When I got this game I thought it would be a mixture of some of my favorite genres, Anime, Turn Based Tactics, Third Person Shooting, and WWII. However with all of that I still had trouble enjoying the game. Even though its not actually WWII, The anime aesthetic clashed with the war setting, after watching movies like ""Band of Brothers"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Fury"" I have an ingrained idea of war stories about soldiers going through very dark and traumatic experiences. But this anime style just clashes with that tone wheres there are far to many whimsical and cute moments so that whenever anything dark happens it’s simply gone over, then its back with the tales of love and friendship. I just simply couldn't associate this game's plot to WWII. But despite all of that I did find myself liking the characters and wanting to see where the story was going next with every level.The game play was something that needed a lot more polish, don't get me wrong it WORKS I just wish Sega spent more time with this to refine the controls and mechanics. I hear far to many people compare this to X-Com Enemy Unknown and I disagree with all of them, I wish Valkyria Chronicles was more like X-Com, because X-Com is far better mechanically. Alot of the levels became trail and error for me because I was not really given good intel before I begin my operation. I would have liked locations to enemy bases better details on the terrain but I wasn't given much so each mission I sorta threw myself at it just to figure out what I was suppose to do. During my entire playthrough I found numerous glitches mainly with the tanks where's trying to move them (depending on terrain and camera angle) would cause them to vibrate and rapidly use up my movement points, however this can be prevented if you stop moving and recenter the camera. The infantry units all worked well and were easy enough to use, and there is a real novelty to filling up my squad roster with school girls and annihilating my enemies with them. The micromanaging aspect was a nice break between combat and had a decent amount of depth to it. Overall Valkyria Chronicles is a decent game and if you're willing to tolerate many issues but nothing truly game breaking there is a decent game here. If there's ever a sequel to this I would very much like the devs to look at other turn based tactic games and implement better design choices. The story is ok for a JRPG I would have liked better character development, because almost all the main characters stayed more or less the same at the end of the story.			"

												It runs perfectly on WIndows XP.  The game has only crashed once in the six hours I've played, and that's likely due to the aging hardware & drivers on the eight-year-old PC I tested on.  This thing is far below the minimum recommended specs, yet it runs like a champ @1280x800.Compared to the Crazy Taxi port (which explicitly lists XP support) this goes above and beyond the call of duty. Crazy Taxi won't even run properly on the same test machine.Sega has become much more adept at porting their titles over to the PC platform, and I hope they keep it up.			"

												I read the RPS review of this game which sung it's praises which got me interested and then I saw the game was only £15 so figured it was worth a punt.I'm about 10 hours in now and really enjoying it - the little story episodes are pretty good (once I'd got past the cheesy anime stuff - I'm not much of an anime fan) and the characters are built up as the story progresses and they're all fairly interesting and well written.The mechanics of the game are great - a turn based strategy like XCOM but with real-time elements which makes it far more interesting and adds to the action. Accidentally running out in front of enemy units and getting mowed down is punishing you for not checking if it was clear first. The classes all have their interesting traits but I found that generally the scout/shocktrooper were generally the most useful.There are a couple of annoying things about the game though - it's stable and looks great on PC but very little thought went into using a keyboard/mouse - I ended up using the keyboard a lot for operating menus which seemed fairly dumb. Also, controlling the tank can be incredibly frustrating at times resulting in wasted AP/CP...I'm not sure if it's a keyboard/mouse conflict but you can end up using up all your AP turning in the wrong direction.Overally, I was very impressed with it and look forward to finishing it!

												After a few years of initally playing it, I was very intrigued to see one of my all time favorite SRPGs to be Re-Released to a Larger Audience on PC. The best part about this is: The Port is actually great for one, and it does come with all DLC released on the PS3 Version for Free, so that is a major plus, because the DLC is also rather awesome.PC Controls are nice, but I mostly prefer to use a controller because I'm so much more used to it for this game. Music is still as awesome as ever. Graphics have aged a bit, but they're still somewhat beautiful. Story is one of the best I've ever seen in an RPG - No - Any Game ever IMHO, which is why I do praise it so highly. Honestly, if you enjoy SRPGs, what are you doing here reading my review? Go buy this game ASAP, it is a finely crafted masterpiece.			"

 It's a nice game that I enjoyed enough to want to complete but I don't think I'd ever even want to go back.First thing, the keys are a bit odd to get used to and even though rebindable, they still feel a bit weird to get used to because some actions are bound to the same key.The game sells itself as a tactical turn-based strategy RPG where after fights you earn money to upgrade your equipment (or purchase side-chapters) and EXP to improve your squad (or acquire new Orders).You can't replay the main story Operations to try and acquire a higher rank for them until you move on to its New Game +.Not too long into this it starts to feel more like a game of memory & luck instead of strategy because throughout most of the game a good chunk of the enemy operatives stationed are only revealed & visible if you let them have a turn and it just so happens one of your guys sees them or if you have a unit run somewhere and they happen to stumble upon them showing where they are.There's a system in this game called Command Points that determine how many times you can control a unit(s). You'll see these during your turn on the overhead map view. They regenerate by a set amount every turn and can be saved up by skipping the current turn. CP can also used for giving Orders (buffs) and you can use one CP to move a soldier (two for tanks) and decide where to move them and possibly do an action at the same time such as healing, shooting, and a few other various things depending on the class of the unit you chose. Controlling a tank in this game is bugged when using the mouse. When looking around with the tank, for some reason, you waste AP. Normally you spend a very minimal amount of AP by turning but for some reason the game thinkgs you're trying to turn when you're just looking around.A single unit moves in real-time using Action Points which determine how much distance they can cover before the AP are depleted. I don't believe the real-time part works here because way too often there will be invisible walls and little gaps that look deceptive enough for me to think I can walk through, for example a tree close to a wall with what looks like there's space to fit someone through. However before it's too late I stumble upon an invisible wall because apparently either the tree or that wall has a bigger blockage range than it made it out to be and so the AP I wasted trying to go between that small gap is wasted and you can't exactly have do-overs because the whole thing is in real-time. You can save the game and load while you're in the overhead view in case you don't feel comfortable with the turn you've made but doing so becomes real bothersome.To get a higher ranking in an Operation, the highest being A, you have to finish each while making the lowest amount of ""turns"" possible. With the way it works though it feels more like I'm trying to exploit the system by rushing as opposed to playing a turn-based strategy game using actual strategy to complete the Operation. An example of this is one of the very last missions where a boss is an overly defended tank where I have to keep shooting it until its armor HP is down to 0. I skipped my very first turn to save up CP and let the enemy with its incredibly unstellar AI do its thing without bringing any of my people down to 0 HP. So my turn comes and all I did was move one of my tanks as close to the boss tank as my AP can handle while after exhausting my AP I take aim & shoot the tank, slowly decreasing its armor HP each shot. Because I saved up all that CP in the skipped turn I can keep moving and shooting until its armor HP is down and reveal the boss tank's weak spot. With enough CP I managed to get behind the tank and shoot its weak spot with two attacks thus ending that boss fight within two turns giving me an A rank. It didn't feel like a strategy more than it did a rushed play.You can also almost complete an Operation with one person because most of the main objectives are basically just capturing a specific flag. If you have enough CP and the right Orders and you place those Orders on that single unit you can pretty much make them a possibly bullet spongy killing machine that can just run towards the main objective.The enemy AI are almost abysmal. During a boss fight, way too often they'll waste their own CP making unnecessary and sometimes completely pointless orders such as the boss making the order for a Heal Request when everyone of their units are at full health. The enemy AI will also often waste CP to control a unit of theirs to barely do anything or something worse that doesn't put the enemy AI in good light.They'll also often waste their own AP literally running in circles and running to extremely dangerous spots & getting instantly killed. It's almost as if you'd have to actually put yourself in front of them for the enemy to act proper.The English voice-acting is tolerable at best though you can set it to Japanese.The game's story heavy but it's not too bad. Because it's story heavy however it often felt more like I was going through a visual novel and 3D anime episodes more than I was playing a game.I suppose if you play ""normally"" it's not bad but so many of these what seem to be exploits feel like they ruin some of the fun.

												After a few years of initally playing it, I was very intrigued to see one of my all time favorite SRPGs to be Re-Released to a Larger Audience on PC. The best part about this is: The Port is actually great for one, and it does come with all DLC released on the PS3 Version for Free, so that is a major plus, because the DLC is also rather awesome.PC Controls are nice, but I mostly prefer to use a controller because I'm so much more used to it for this game. Music is still as awesome as ever. Graphics have aged a bit, but they're still somewhat beautiful. Story is one of the best I've ever seen in an RPG - No - Any Game ever IMHO, which is why I do praise it so highly. Honestly, if you enjoy SRPGs, what are you doing here reading my review? Go buy this game ASAP, it is a finely crafted masterpiece.			"

Posted: December 23, 2014
												I recently bought the game a few days ago at 25% off for the christmas sale and i have to say it has been my best buy all year. Already i have logged a great amount of hours playing.First I want to mention that this is a console port so if you are like me playing on a laptop and you get slowdowns just change the resolution down a bit, for me 1280x720 fixed it. Others say that changing the fps limit to 30 will fix it aswell.Yes it's a long review i really like this game and wanted to give out my opinion on alot of the topics.Story: [+] I am 3/4's way through the game and i have to say the story has been fantastic there has been a great deal of character development from both the main protagonist and the antagonist. It is your classic world war plot with a sub-romance but it pulls it off in a very unique way and every chapter introduces a great deal of information about everything mentioned in the game. For those of you like me that don't mind looking in the glossary or info tabs for more information about all the events, characters, places, and weapons. It does a great job of adding plenty of backstory.*This version of the game includes all the DLC bounus missions and content.*playing battles with extra characters unlocks backstory about them - giving you information on why they have the traits they do.*Story answers questions after it presents them or soon after[-] *It is a bit unfortunate that it seems a bit rushed at times (there are a few moments where something happened and some of the characters just gloss over it very fast.), *the chapters can be extremely short especially with most of the beginning chapters just including 1 battle with a few short cutscenes.  *You may not get some references the characters make in the dialouge if you do not check the glossary on the events that happened in the past.*Some of the characters can be forgettableGameplay: The gameplay is a very unique style which i have to say i love.  If you have played X-Com you will notice some similarities.  It is a turn-based top down 3rd person tactical shooter ""whew"".   You start off in the top down command screen where you use your ""CP"" given to you each turn to move your units on the battle field. Once you select a unit you go into third person where you are able to move around as much as their stamina bar will let you then you can do an action ie: shoot, heal ect...  The game also allows you to choose what upgrades you want for your tank/weapons  If you want a accurate sniper you can make it, then you can make a more powerful one and then equip them to different people in your squad for certain fights.[+] *The game is very challenging. There is no difficulty setting for the story missions (atleast for the first playthrough it does not seem to give you a choice.) *the skirmish battles allow for multiple difficulty choices.  *Every mission will be throwing you into a different scenario forcing you to adjust your strategies on the fly and make quick decisions to complete the given objective. *some maps may seem small but the use of cover and some nicely placed invisible walls make the maps seem 10X bigger than they actually are. *The game allows you to have 20 uniquely voice acted characters in your squad. at anytime you can swap them out for different characters who become unlocked as the game progresses. In the battles that i am at i have only been allowed a max of 10 soldiers on the field at a time. [i will update if this changes]*Unique playable characters, with their own personalities and voice acting.*The ability to lose characters forever. (yes your characters can die in battle leaving you to actually care more for the extra guys and gals than you normally would)*ability to save in battles (thank you! lol)*give squad members different weapons so they all don't just have the best accuracy gun should you choose to upgrade it.*Class leveling system - You level by classes not by individual so you don't have to worry about not taking alicia in every battle and think she will fall behind.[-] *Some of the gunfights can come down to luck or the old RNG, you can be right behind someone and aim for his head but miss Completely only to leave you facepalming and your character getting downed the next turn lol.*No present diffculty option for the story missions.*some smaller map design limits the posibilities of how to tackle a certain situation.*Tank's seem to dominate really easily so they overload the enemy with tank bustersGraphics/bugs:As it is a Ps3 port i was expecting it to not be in a high quality but i was pleasantly suprised. they have updated the PC version to allow support for beyond 1080p but for me and some others higher resolutions seem to cause problems without limited the frames to 60.[+]*I love the art style in the game, it is very vibrant and colorful*Runs great with no performance issues whatsoever*All enviroments are very detailed and definetly give off the worn battlefield feel*Characters are visually detailed and animated facial expressions and unqiue movements and animations on the field.[-]*a strange border style to give it more of a picturesque feel.*30 fps on certain resolutions may be noticable to some.*game will crash often if you alt tab during a skirmishLanguage?/Voice: This release is in english but it also comes with a japanese voice option. Unfortunatly it seems that the subtitles in the japanese version use the same ones as if you left subtitles on in the English dub. Now for us who can understand a bit of the Japanese language it seems that what they are saying and what the words at the bottom display do not always match. So if you are an wanting to hear the original script or a direct translation you may be better off finding a fan made translation/patch. I am playing the game with the english voices and i have to point out that they did a fantastic job setting the tone for each character. I even enjoy the lines given to the characters you can recruit into your squad, you can tell what kind of person they are just by how they sound.Sound/OST: From what i have heard in the game the music is great! the compostition Hitoshi Sakimoto put together fits the mood for almost every scene. he said that it took him a total of eight months to complete it and what time well spent. i can only say that the ost is definitely one i will be looking to pick up in the future.   Now for the sounds.[+] *The game adds visuals to sounds... what i mean is that if you see a tank moving the game will add a ""Vvrrrmm"" or ""rumble rumble"" next to it in a anime'ish style which adds alot to the art style. the same can be said for any other sounds like an explosion might have a big ""BLAM!"" come out of the ground which is nothing less than satisfying. *I'm not a gun expert in anyway but they sound good enough to me im not going to complain if they sound fake or hold it against them the sounds they use fit the art style and serious tone, it adds a certain charm to the game.[-]*Some of the voice acting for the English dub is out of synch with the characters facial animations. This can be normal with translated game but in this one it can be very noticable.Replayability: As this is a linear game i am a bit worried about how i would enjoy this game on the second time around so far the majority of the ""side quest if you can call it that"" is just a skirmish battles, it is very ""this is what you have to do now do it"".     The extra characters that you choose for your squad at start are random. my friend had bought the game and i told him he should get a person named Lynn but he did not have her or many of the ones i started with. he had some characters that i had just unlocked in recent missions.I may update with more once i start my second playthrough or complete the game.Overall rating: 9/10			"

												+Great port. Runs well with no issues.+Other than the two main characters, the rest are great. Even the variety of squadmates you can pick all have good personalities and voices. Most of the characters that follow you through the game have a solid amount of character development and grow throughout the story in interesting ways.+The combat system is great. The classes really all feel balanced enough to feel essential in some way, but there's still a lot of room to try different compositions. Units are good in different situations against other units in more ways than some arbitrary Rock-Paper-Scissors approach, and by the end of the game you'll know exactly what to do against a composition of enemies.+Mission design is pretty varied. Pretty much every mission has some unique twist that makes you play a little different, and regularly introduces new mechanics and unique arenas to fight in.+Main story alone took me about 30 hours, plenty of content. There are also a number of side skirmishes and little DLC encounters included that I didn't take the time to go through.+/- The style isn't for everyone. I'll give them credit in that only ~25% of any given tool or item is based on something straight out of medieval times (I mean hey, only a handful of main characters become invincible upon picking up a sword or something), as opposed to the ~70% or so of any given anime, but the game does a decent enough job of being surprisingly grounded in a number of ways that when the anime bullsh*t rears its head (why does the militia's standard uniform for girls involve thigh-highs and a skirt?) , it can be a little jarring.-While the combat system is overall great, some missions are pretty rough. Due to the nature of how a lot can happen in a single turn, it's very easy for a mission to go from great to failed in a moment. The only way you really stand a chance to get much done in most missions is either by completely wiping out any enemy forces before working on objectives (causing their unused action points to carry over to future turns as they're inactive), or hope that their AI bugs out and wastes their turn (like parking a Tank on top of a group of enemies and watching them start their turn, walk a single step before getting shot by your tank, and then immediately ending their turn). It certainly keeps things tense, but missions also often introduce new objectives and enemy spawns part-way through, which can really screw you up. If you don't save frequently, you're just asking to have to sit through the intro cutscene and dialogue for a mission again, missions that often take more than half an hour to finish in a successful run.-While the rest of the cast is great, the two main characters are just dull and ininteresting. Male (I actually can't remember his name) is some generic, overconfident, naive young adult who wins every battle he steps into and is constantly complimented on his weird, constantly comparisons of things with nature. Female exists solely to get offended by his weird compliments and serve as a shoehorned romance from the first cutscene. Her main hobbies include being so good at cooking that a princess breaks her sacred traditions to eat her bread for breakfast the moment she tries it. Her character does serve a role later on in the plot, but it's really more of her being transformed into a plot device that really has no bearing on her character.-Every time that ♥♥♥♥ing pig shows up, I get unjustifiably mad. Seriously, somebody needs to smack its VO in the head and tell him that onomatopoeic words for animal noises are approximations not to be taken literally, and that you sound like a kindergartener when you treat them otherwise. ♥♥♥♥ the pig.-I could seriously go on a rant about the ridiculous moments and plot devices in this story, but I understand it's just Japan being Japan for most of it.Overall, I liked the game. It has its issues, but it was generally really well polished, with breadth and depth in equal bounds. The style might not be for everyone, but it's generally easy to get past, and there's a lot of fun to be had for a good price. Definitely pick it up and give it a shot, considering its price.			"

												I loved this game to death, and I felt like giving it a small review after seeing it in my library again, so this is by no means an instant like or dislike.Roughly, I'd say if you enjoy turn based tactics game to any extent you're likely to enjoy this given you look a bit at the preview images and video. It's very much an open book from the screen shots alone. Action-points-esque movement will always have a soft spot in my book as well as intercept fire, even if it can be annoying some of the time. The various classes offer a wide range of deployment choices for most situations though belgian waffle girl tactics are as cheesy as they are great (I personally preferred lancing all the things with a certain armor support). The story is very ""war is bad"" and ""anime"" for what it is, but it's executed well enough and written with care regardless. The team took great care in making sure each of the characters had personality of some sort, if not a bit stereotyped at points for the sake of the story. While I'd write it off if it were any other game, I'm a sucker for the type of war drama offered up by it. I personally enjoyed the perspective offered through the main protaginist and his allies journey. Go into it with an open mind and you'll likely be pleased. "

												Nice TBS game. It's not as great as XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics, but the battles are long, diverse and there's room for several different strategies, even though there are only 5 classes of infantrymen and 2 tanks. The story, inspired by World War 2, but set in a fantastic world, is very good, although predictable and with some childish moments. You'll spend a long time going through dialogue and cutscenes. I played the main campaign once, on Normal (the highest difficulty for New Game), the “Behind Her Blue Flame” DLC (it was great playing as Selvaria, although obviously it was even easier than the main story) and most of the skirmishes (unfortunately, no new maps are introduced in the extras). I spent about 90 hours with this game and could've spent many more if I were after the 9 out of 20 achievements that I didn't get.P. S. I love you, Rosie.			"

												Light strategy and RPG elements mixed with squad based quasi-turn based gameplay. A very unique mix of elements that really turns the game into something greater than its parts. The gameplay alone will grab you, but if it's not enough, there is a great style in the game that shines through in it's visuals and it is even used at times to tell the story in unique, sometimes non-linear fashion.It does start go heavy into anime cliche territory at times, but it's a minor distraction, most of the characters are likeable enough to stick with and some well developed.

It does a great job of adding plenty of backstory.*This version of the game includes all the DLC bounus missions and content.*playing battles with extra characters unlocks backstory about them - giving you information on why they have the traits they do.*Story answers questions after it presents them or soon after[-] *It is a bit unfortunate that it seems a bit rushed at times (there are a few moments where something happened and some of the characters just gloss over it very fast.), *the chapters can be extremely short especially with most of the beginning chapters just including 1 battle with a few short cutscenes.  *You may not get some references the characters make in the dialouge if you do not check the glossary on the events that happened in the past.*Some of the characters can be forgettableGameplay: The gameplay is a very unique style which i have to say i love.  If you have played X-Com you will notice some similarities.  It is a turn-based top down 3rd person tactical shooter ""whew"".   You start off in the top down command screen where you use your ""CP"" given to you each turn to move your units on the battle field. Once you select a unit you go into third person where you are able to move around as much as their stamina bar will let you then you can do an action ie: shoot, heal ect...  The game also allows you to choose what upgrades you want for your tank/weapons  If you want a accurate sniper you can make it, then you can make a more powerful one and then equip them to different people in your squad for certain fights.[+] *The game is very challenging. There is no difficulty setting for the story missions (atleast for the first playthrough it does not seem to give you a choice.) *the skirmish battles allow for multiple difficulty choices.  *Every mission will be throwing you into a different scenario forcing you to adjust your strategies on the fly and make quick decisions to complete the given objective. *some maps may seem small but the use of cover and some nicely placed invisible walls make the maps seem 10X bigger than they actually are. *The game allows you to have 20 uniquely voice acted characters in your squad. at anytime you can swap them out for different characters who become unlocked as the game progresses. In the battles that i am at i have only been allowed a max of 10 soldiers on the field at a time. [i will update if this changes]*Unique playable characters, with their own personalities and voice acting.*The ability to lose characters forever. (yes your characters can die in battle leaving you to actually care more for the extra guys and gals than you normally would)*ability to save in battles (thank you! lol)*give squad members different weapons so they all don't just have the best accuracy gun should you choose to upgrade it.*Class leveling system - You level by classes not by individual so you don't have to worry about not taking alicia in every battle and think she will fall behind.[-] *Some of the gunfights can come down to luck or the old RNG, you can be right behind someone and aim for his head but miss Completely only to leave you facepalming and your character getting downed the next turn lol.*No present diffculty option for the story missions.*some smaller map design limits the posibilities of how to tackle a certain situation.*Tank's seem to dominate really easily so they overload the enemy with tank bustersGraphics/bugs:As it is a Ps3 port i was expecting it to not be in a high quality but i was pleasantly suprised. they have updated the PC version to allow support for beyond 1080p but for me and some others higher resolutions seem to cause problems without limited the frames to 60.[+]*I love the art style in the game, it is very vibrant and colorful*Runs great with no performance issues whatsoever*All enviroments are very detailed and definetly give off the worn battlefield feel*Characters are visually detailed and animated facial expressions and unqiue movements and animations on the field.[-]*a strange border style to give it more of a picturesque feel.*30 fps on certain resolutions may be noticable to some.*game will crash often if you alt tab during a skirmishLanguage?/Voice: This release is in english but it also comes with a japanese voice option. Unfortunatly it seems that the subtitles in the japanese version use the same ones as if you left subtitles on in the English dub. Now for us who can understand a bit of the Japanese language it seems that what they are saying and what the words at the bottom display do not always match. So if you are an wanting to hear the original script or a direct translation you may be better off finding a fan made translation/patch. I am playing the game with the english voices and i have to point out that they did a fantastic job setting the tone for each character. I even enjoy the lines given to the characters you can recruit into your squad, you can tell what kind of person they are just by how they sound.Sound/OST: From what i have heard in the game the music is great! the compostition Hitoshi Sakimoto put together fits the mood for almost every scene. he said that it took him a total of eight months to complete it and what time well spent. i can only say that the ost is definitely one i will be looking to pick up in the future.   Now for the sounds.[+] *The game adds visuals to sounds... what i mean is that if you see a tank moving the game will add a ""Vvrrrmm"" or ""rumble rumble"" next to it in a anime'ish style which adds alot to the art style. the same can be said for any other sounds like an explosion might have a big ""BLAM!"" come out of the ground which is nothing less than satisfying. *I'm not a gun expert in anyway but they sound good enough to me im not going to complain if they sound fake or hold it against them the sounds they use fit the art style and serious tone, it adds a certain charm to the game.[-]*Some of the voice acting for the English dub is out of synch with the characters facial animations. This can be normal with translated game but in this one it can be very noticable.Replayability: As this is a linear game i am a bit worried about how i would enjoy this game on the second time around so far the majority of the ""side quest if you can call it that"" is just a skirmish battles, it is very ""this is what you have to do now do it"".     The extra characters that you choose for your squad at start are random. my friend had bought the game and i told him he should get a person named Lynn but he did not have her or many of the ones i started with. he had some characters that i had just unlocked in recent missions.I may update with more once i start my second playthrough or complete the game.Overall rating: 9/10			"

												This game is great. One of the best single-player strategy games I have tried so far. It is very addictive with a great storyline, great characters and character progress, interesting mechanics, and great graphics. This game is an instant favorite for me the moment I saw the intro. I have already poured over 30 hours into the game and I felt satisfied. So lets get down to the pro's and con's.Pro's:1. Story: The story is by far the strong suit of the game. The story revolves around a small independent nation, Gallia, being invaded by the Imperials from the east. Your job is to stop them and reclaim the nation as the militia. You follow Welken Gunther and Alicia Melchiott along with their squad, Squad 7, as they fight to save their nation. The story will grip you at moments and give you all kinds of emotions. Happiness, saddness, gloom, hopeful, and more. This game pulls the player in on the story with extensive lore that updates the more missions you complete. So if you are looking for a great story, this is one of them.2. Characters and character progress: The characters and their progression throughout the war is great. There is, also, a tab to learn more about each member of Squad 7 and the other characters throughout the story. You can increase your squad members backstory by using them in missions. Even at the end of the game and do new game plus, you can read up more on the squad of what they did after the war. It adds more depth in the characters in your squad. Even the main characters get great progression as time passes on in the story. One such character is Brigitte ""Rosie"" Stark. I won't spoil the story about her and her change but she is one of the strongest characters to get progress. This game makes you attached to the characters and makes you want them to win and live on throughout the war.3. Gameplay: The gameplay is a mix of turn-based strategy with third-person shooter and real-time strategy. It is fun to play and is quite interesting. There is also character potentials to unlock when upgrading in the training room and by using them in combat. There are various types of characters with different traits and potentials, though some are a lot better than others. *cough* Jane *cough* You are given CP (command points) to use a character. Tanks take up 2 CP while foot soldiers use 1 CP. In that one CP, you can choose to move anywhere because the game doesnt use the traditional square turn-table but instead a free roam map. You can do an action like firing your rifle or throwing a grenade and even if you do that, if you have left over stamina, you can move again. They also added a mechanic where you can use all of your CP on 1 character but the character loses stamina when selected. There are orders you can give out as well that cost CP. 1 turn can take 2 minutes or even 15 minutes with so many options at your disposal. There is also class variations like scouts and shocktroopers. Each with their own role and benefits. Scouts with the greatest stamina and rifles but average armor and shocktroopers with the highest armor, smgs, and average stamina. It has upgrades and weapons you can pick up from battle as well to equip. You can even select who you want in your squad to change it up. There are even challenges you can do along side with the main story. It has so much to offer that it is hard to put down.4. Soundtrack: The soundtrack is excellent. I loved each song played, especially one song sung by one of the characters. It help show more emotion behind the story and in combat. Once you beat the game and start a new game plus, you unlock the music tab and you can listen to the entire soundtrack. It is great.5. Art style: The art style is great and amazing to look at. It's a mix of a sketch color art and drawn graphics, creating an interesting graphical outlook on the game.6. The price: For $20 for over 30 hours of content plus extra, this is such great value and a steal when on sale. I got this for about $6.79 and it is worth it. For all of this content, it would even be worthy of the $60 price tag.7. Level up: This game knew that people dont like leveling up one character at a time so they decided to throw that out the window and say that everyone in a class now levels up. To level up, you go to the training room and spend exp on classes to unlock new orders, new potentials in soldiers, and better stats on soldiers. So you dont have to worry about replacing a squadmate for a new one just so you can unlock their potential or to level up because this level up system affects all units under each class.8. Japanese and english dub options: This game gives you the option to change how the characters speak, which some japanese games dont give the option to the player. With this, you dont have to listen to japanese dubs, though I prefer japanese dubs. if you dislike how they voice-act.Con's:1. Anime: Now this one is a small gripe but I know some people will not play this just because it is like an anime, which it is. Even with that, I still think that non-anime players and anime-haters should give this game a try and not shun it. It is worth it.2. Replay value: After beating the game once, all that is left is to get better scores on missions. For people who want to be a perfectionist, this game will suck you in for another 20 hours but for me, I kinda dont want to replay a game for a better score.Overall: 9/10This game is absolutely stunning. I would use this game as a perfect example of why single-player games should continue to exist instead of games like Battlefield or Titanfall or even COD. True, multiplayer is fun and holds up the game a bit longer than a single-player game but most of the games like Battlefield or COD, will leave you un-satisfied. I always felt un-satisfied with those games but this game made me feel real satsfied and was a blast to play. I hope this game gets more attention and I hope that the sequels of Valkyria Chronicles get ported over to PC because I will literally throw my wallet to my computer screen.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy/tactics game, originally released in 2008 for the Playstation 3. The game takes place from an aerial view of the battlefield, and when you select one of your units you control them in real time from a third person perspective. The game includes many RPG elements such as experience points, leveling up, perma-death, and equipment upgrading. I won't go too deep into the explanations of the gameplay, as it's already on wikipedia.The first thing I noticed about Valkyria Chronicles was how gritty the story was, but how contrastingly puerile it's told. Bright and cheery storybook graphics, and limpid dialogue between the main characters undermine the harsh realities of the war going on in this game. The game does not shy away from mature philosophies and subject matter, and many atrocities such as racial cleansing, torture, and genocide are commited. And yet, nary a swear word is uttered by your characters as their squad-mates get ripped to shreds by a hail of gunfire, shedding not a drop of blood. It feels almost juvenile. But regardless of this, Valkyria Chronicles manages to tell an emotionally gripping narrative, expounded by the main character, Welkin Gunther. With his all-around likeable personality, optimistic yet realistic world-views, and brilliant voice acting, it's hard not to get sucked into Welkin's story and his relationships with his squad members.Speaking of squad members, you can pick and choose from 54 of them. All of them are individually voice acted, with their own backstory and personal benefits and flaws. One may be allergic to dust and would therefore be unsuited to desert combat, as another may have been born and raised on a farm and be naturally suited for combat in the country side. Or maybe one is a lady's-man, and will perform at his best when near a female squad member to impress her. (Or a man's-man. Homosexuality is fully accepted in this game.) All squad members interact with each other, and whether they like or dislike the person they're fighting alongside can affect the flow of battle. Members with a high affinity for each other are more likely to use Team Attacks, where they both fire on the same turn when near each other. Others are racist, and will receive a debuff when near certain squad-mates. As you use squad members more and more, their backstory will be revealed, but if they die in combat, they stay dead for the rest of the game, ala Fire Emblem. This makes for a very immersive and enjoyable experience, as your squad actually feels and performs like a squad, with individual lives that you can directly affect. Unfortunately many times the immersion will be shattered by the aforementioned limpid dialogue. One of my members proclaimed that he wasn't dying, he was just tired and wanted to take a nap, before dropping lifeless to the ground after taking a tank shell directly to the face.This callow dialogue is justified, or at least reinforced, by the setting of the story. Your character, Welkin, is a university student, living a carefree life studying nature and animals, far removed from thoughts of war. But when his hometown is invaded, he's forced to take up arms to attempt to defend it, and eventually enlists in the military. His lineage and experience defending his home town earns him the rank of lieutenant, and he is assigned his own squad.  Taking place in a solitary country being torn apart by a much more powerful invasion force, the country is forced to conscript the majority of the population, including women and children, to help retake their nation. The majority of your 54 squad members are under 20 years old, some even as young as 12, and have little to no combat training. As a member of the lowly militia, you and your squad are ridiculed and looked down upon by the members of the legitimate armed forces, and you'll often find yourself ordered on impossible and dangerous ""suicide"" missions that the experienced military won't take. Welkin is forced to use his vast knowledge of nature to find unique and unorthodox strategies, in his efforts to keep his squad alive. The story is told using CG cutscenes and simple dialogue sessions. While the story won't blow you away with unpredictable plot twists, (it's essentially a World War 2 allegory in an alternate history with magic) and it's not the most philosophical of war games, it at least tells a competent and emotional story, tied together with great character interactions, voice acting, music, and immersion.The game progresses from story to battle at set intervals, (linear progression), but in beween missions you have the ability to take on many optional missions, mostly unrelated to the story but related to your squad progression. All experience points earned in optional skirmish missions are carried over to the story, as well as earning you Ducat, the fictional currency, which can be used to upgrade your weapons and buy more optional missions. The weapon upgrade system is mostly pointless, as most weapons and armor are upgraded from a single linear branch, not allowing much room for customization. The character progression is also pointless, as the entire game can be completed without levelling your characters at all, though it will be slightly more difficult. You can also earn awards and medals as you play, interestingly tied to the Steam Achievements. Your character is awarded the medals through in game cut scenes as you unlock more Steam Achievements. It's certainly unique, and adds motivation to unlock them all, as your merits are usually accompanied by new weapons.The only downside to this game is poor tank controls. For some reason rotating the camera with the mouse causes your entire tank to turn, rather than just your turret. A small downside to an otherwise outstanding game. The upsides are a unique art style, unique third person/turn based tactics/RPG hybrid gameplay, intricately detailed squad interactions, tons of content, superb voice acting, perfectly suited music, tons of variability to your tactical approach, and every aspect of the game serves to immerse you in the life of a squad commander, including the uneccesary upgrade system that could've easily been left out. The unique but unimaginative story is neither a positive nor a negative, as while it's not nearly as philosophical as it thinks it is, it serves it's purpose well enough, and doesn't cast a shadow on the amazing gameplay.All in all, this game has become my personal best in class for tactical turn based RPG's, mimicking, evolving, combining, and surpassing genre greats like Growlanser, Disgaea, Eternal Poison, Final Fantasy Tactics, Xcom, and Fire Emblem, so if you enjoyed any of these games give Valkyria Chronicles a shot. It's simply fantastic.			"

												I will now decipher the events of the first ten minutes of the game that I played while waiting for Nintendo Treehouse's E3 event to get to the cool part.In the year 1935, the two main antagonist factions from Star Wars (Empire and Confederation) are fighting over titanite because they want to upgrade their Zweihanders, but Jakob, Cimb, and JD farmed all of it. As a result, they had a big war. My backyard, which was neutral ground, was discovered to have a lot of titanite slabs under it, so they came to dominate me. Before that, Robin (from Fire Emblem) sketches some fish but then gets arrested by some Bruh(l) guards, one of which is Severa (also from Fire Emblem), unless you're Gert, than it's just Asuka. Robin gets sent to jail for being voiced by David Vincent.It's pretty cool.			"

Where the storyline is concerned its been good up to now but lets be fair, less than 3 hours and chapter 3 is not enough to judge a game that looks like its hugely based around the story its telling.

												There are over 400 positive reviews within 24 hours of this game releasing, and only a few negative. More positives will be coming in, surely. If you're wondering if you will regret buying this game, let that be your indicator. I wanted to discuss something else. Nostalgia. If you're like me, and you used to play games that left an impression on you. Games like Lunar, Lufia 2, Grandia, and for me, even Final Fantasy Tactics. (The Tactics comparision had to be made, as Sakimoto, the composer is the same guy.) I feel there are too many games where you are the over powered hero. The ultimate swordsman (Except, you know, your rival) or you are the silent protagonist doing anything you want without a care in the world, such as in Fallout 3. Now, these games are great. They have a place. Valkyria Chronicles does not place you with a group of super heroes. It places you in a terrible position. A war ravaged fictional country, much like in World War 2. It does not glorify the war. In fact, quite the contrary. The main character, Wilkin, is fascinated by nature. He loves to draw in his notebook the different things he finds. He loves to create, rather than destroy. Now to my point. With the combination of being a character who only does what he has to do and take charge, it's like any one of us. You could be put in a situation one day where you either have to take charge and stand up for what is right, or just let others push you down. He isn't a bad♥♥♥♥♥soldier. Far from it. His group, in a way, represents everybody. How politics drag the average people into the most horrible of situations and they either toughen up or die.  And in the end, it wraps up. It lingers with you. I played this game when it came out on the Playstation 3. I rented it. I took it back to Blockbuster. (That's how long ago it was!) And I've been thinking about it ever since. I saw it in the store last week (LAST WEEK) and debated repurchasing it because it was such an amazing game but I heard about it coming out on Steam. I own thousands of games, and this is one game out of a few that have stuck with me emotionally. If you want a game that will most likely punch you in the heart and then comfort it, play Valkyria Chronicles. Because, really. When is the next game that is going to give you feelings going to come out? They are few and far between. Also, just play if you're a Skies of Arcadia fan. You'll see.			"

												This game is a true gem, I completed it on PS3 and I did not hesitate to double dip when I saw this coming to SteamThe game:The gameplay is somewhat similar to XCOM. It is a turn based tactics, in which you have a base where you improve/recruit your troops, and then you send them to missions. In those missions, you have a number of actions available during your turn that you can spend at will, but the enemies will fire on you while you move your soldier during your turn so it feels a bit more active than other turn based games.The story:It is about a ""reimagined"" World War 2, with several similarities to the real war, and some elements of magic.The campaign is quite lenghty and the story carries you nicely through it with its variety of situations, and diversity of characters.Graphics:Don't expect anything groundbreaking in terms of graphical fidelity, but the art style used more than compensates for its age, they managed to make the game look hand painted, this is one of those games that will stand the test of time due to its unique visual style.Port quality:Graphic options include: Vsync, Multiple resolution options and framerate capFully rebindable keys, with proper on screen prompts.Good in game mouse and keyboard support, though menus don't support mouse navigation.Movies are 720pI've been playing at 1080p 60fps with no slowdowns, smooth as silk.All in all, the port is pretty good for a game that was never intended to come to PC. SEGA has done its homework. I was expecting a lazy port like many others are doing lately *Cough* Dark Souls *Cough* Final Fantasy *Cough* But instead and while it could still be better, I have no real complains about it. So I hope it sells well and they port the sequels too. "

												A solid port with 1080p, 60fps, japanese and english audio with english subtitles, and no frame dips. What I did notice however is that it could use more anti-aliasing (if it even has any).So if you don't know the game was released in 2008 on the PS3. It's got great strategy, good gameplay, an amazing watercolor anime art style, a great soundtrack, and indepth squad creation and management. The protagonist is a young male named Welkin from Gallia who gets caught up in a huge war inspired by WWII. After that, he joins the army and becomes a Lieutenant who fights and commands his own squad against the Empire to liberate Gallia and so on. The story itself isn't too memorable or anything ground-breaking, but the characters are what really drive everything forward. Sure it has its share of cliches here and there, but we got some actually characters worth caring for. In the story, every has more impact on you, the player, than it normally would thanks to these characters. There's definitely some feels moments here and there that are enough to make the story more captivating. The game is turned-based. Not in the traditional, click unit, click position unit goes to, click enemy for unit to attack. Here you are given a certain amount of moves every turn. For each move, you choose one of your team members. You are then able to control that character, dodging incoming fire, going from cover to cover. However, each character has a bar that dictates how far they can move. After the bar empties itself, youre no longer able to move. Whenever during that character's move, you can go into aiming mode which will allow you to well, aim your weapon at an enemy and take your shots, or perhaps aim at a teammate to heal them. When I say aim, I mean actually aim, like with the mouse. Aiming center mass means the likelyhood of shots hitting will increase, while aiming at the head will have increased damage if the projectiles connect with their targets. Overall, it's extremely satisfying and quite liberatig to be able to have almost full control of the character.The most memorable aspect of the game for me (back when I played it on PS3) was the character recruitment. By that I mean, each character is special, they aren't just nameless soldiers with randomized stats that die off and get replaced like a pair of socks. All the soldiers you can recruit have their own voice actors, their own quirks, and their own back-stories. Of course, if they die you won't be getting any of that. The incentive is to make you want to keep them alive because they all have something that makes them unique and worth keeping around besides just differences in combat traits. I tried to keep them all alive, but it gets increasingly difficult once story chapters enter the double digits. It's pretty heart-breaking when you see them just dropping dead. Of course, there's a mechanic where if you can get to the fallen in time, a medic will come and whisk the unit away. The unit doesn't come back to life for that mission, but they'll still be around for you to select in future missions.There's lots of side missions to play around with, but the real fun starts in new game plus. In new game plus you retain all your class levels, but now have the option to replay any story mission (as long as you've completed them once in new game plus) alongside the side content in order to get S ranks on everything, level everything, buy everything, and discover all the hidden characters and ace rank enemies.Worth. Really worth. Definitely one of the best JRPGs you can get on Steam.			"

												What can I say... this is a must have game!!!  I've played the game on PS3 and now its on PC.  Beleive me, this a real good game, strategics are logical, artwork is incredilble (If you open your mind and appreciate graphics besides moderns engines).  Also, it's 120 FPS, isn't that all about PC master race?!  Buy the game, or wait for it to be on sale, you won't regret it.  A must have game for your your library.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles being one of my favorite games on the ps3, I was hyped when I heard it was getting a pc port and I'm glad to say that I was not left dissapointed. Within the first minutes of playtime, I could tell that a lot of efforts have been put into the controls to make the experience for pc gamers about just as good as it was on ps3, if not better. It's highly intuitive, quite simplistic and easy to grasp of unless you have exorbitant standards ( or suffer of autism ) Performance wise, the game runs smoothly without any issues so far and I highy doubt that a high end system would be needed to run it in its full splendor. The framerate has been unlocked and can go up to 120 fps if your monitor can support it. Same goes for the resolution as the game now carry as high as 7680x4320 pixels.Valkyria Chronicles would be well worth your money as it could take easily up to 35-40 hours to successfully complete the story. I would recommend to fans of JRPGs and specifically to fans of XCOM / Fire Emblem that are looking for a game with some similarities such as squad management and permanent death gameplay.  9/10 would buy again			"

												It's good to see that this great game finally got a port to PC, and that the franchise in general has gotten some long overdue attention.The game is well-paced, and has beautiful artwork and graphics for its time (still looks really good roughly 6 years on).It's an exciting game that has the right balance of difficulty of gameplay and focus on storytelling that is too rarely seen.If you're really interested in the story, but aren't a fan of the gameplay (to each their own, right?), then there's a prettydamn good anime adaptation of it made by A-1 Pictures.It's definitely a game that went largely under the radar, through no fault of its own.I really hope this port will sell well enough to incentivise the creation of a new game in the series – or at least ports of VC 2 and 3.

												Story wise:  It's like going to McDonald for a hamburger. They deliver, and you get what you ordinarily expect out of a hamburger.  It's no Mass Effect but you'll go home happy with a warm fuzzy feeling in your chest, with some fond memories of that chip with the right amount of crispness.  Gameplay:  You enter a new restaurant not expecting anything in particular, you have some general ideas what you're getting, but the place bears little resemblance to your usual food joints.  They deliver. Not the usual 5-course meal that you come to expect with X-COM but with different and no less compelling twists and turns.  Once you know how the different elements of your dish come together, it's easy to swallow everything in a bite.

												Wow, this is an absolutely *epic* masterpiece that is simply one of the best games on Steam. This is honestly not just a must-play for strategy and JRPG fans, but everyone with a Steam account. I'd like to give a few of the reasons why this game is so great, and I'll close with a couple of slight nitpicks that are good to be aware of before you start to play. Overall, just buy this game!+ The tactical strategy/action battle system is really unique. The game is turn based, but you get to manually control your individual units, so you can place them behind cover, duck down into tall grass, get into position, fire, and then scramble back behind a rock or friendly tank. You’ll be able to command your units’ actions at a very detailed level. It's really satisfying to play a turn-based strategy game where you have so much control over your troops.+ The level of mission variety is incredibly impressive. It's never just about killing all the enemy troops or seizing the enemy camp. You'll sneak through enemy lines with a wounded comrade, slow the advance of a monstrous tank, storm a castle, fight in the trenches, etc. Every mission is different and you always need to stay on your toes.+ Beautiful and unique art style. It looks like a storybook in motion, the character designs are instantly iconic, and your entire company of troops has tons of personality.+ The story is fantastic. It’s quite thoughtful about war, death, camaraderie, and racism. It was really interesting to find that Welkin isn’t the typical anime hero who complains and whines about battle and fighting until he is forced to change his mind. He’s a scientist and a student, but he knows the stakes and he’s committed to the fight from the very start. The art style may seem very “anime”, but the storytelling doesn’t really have any of the “Shinji no baka!” and “Kyaa!” type of stuff that you may be dreading. There are a few brief apperances from a kind of mascot animal and, admittedly, a scene at the beach, but all that is handled with relative taste. Overall, if you like anime/manga war stories like the original Gundam, Gundam 8th MS Team, Macross, or Legend of the Galactic Heroes, this will be right up your alley.+ So much content. The game is long, challenging, and packed with story and things to do. In addition to the main missions, you get skirmish missions to train your troops, and you can unlock extra story chapters, some of which will give you new missions to play. You also automatically get the two DLC missions, which are great. There's a lot here to keep you busy!+ You can play the entire game in either the really good English dub or with the original Japanese voices.= In order to get the best rank in each mission, the game wants you to complete the mission in a certain number of turns, which usually means that you need to play in a very particular way. I didn't really mind...it depends on how much you care about getting S ranks on everything. It's also true that, if you don't care about your rank, you're pretty much open to play each mission however you want, and you can win in all sorts of ways and with many different deployment options. This will mostly come down to how you like to play.- The RNG can sometimes be a little funky. It’s frustrating to miss a practically point-blank shot with your lance or tank cannon. This gets better as your units level up, but there will be a few annoying ""how did I miss that shot?"" moments.- The subtitles for the Japanese language mode are actually ""dubtitles""...you're given a transcription of the English dub line, which isn't always exactly what the Japanese-voiced character is saying.

												Valkyria Chronicles delivers an amazing story with interesting, original gameplay.I simply love how they delivered such a good story without easing on the gameplay; it's not the cutscenes that keep you hooked, but the played parts as well.The turn-based RTS combat is pretty fun. The game has a unique system, matching together turn-based combat with real-time elements. It also gives you a certain freedom: there are many different strategies you can use to approach a situation, (some better than others I assure you; sometimes one certain approach is forced) and many factors you can play with. For example, some people will perform worse when matched with certain characters; simply because they don't like them. In that way, you'll have to carefully set up the perfect squad that's also matching with the conditions on the battlefield.You can also level the characters in your squad and individually gear them. These and other factors, like permadeath(!) make the characters grow on you; you don't want them to die, and you'll start to take things personally (well, I did at least).It's not just the STORY that makes the characters grow on you, but the GAMEPLAY as well. In that way, the gameplay and story are matched perfectly.Sometimes the AI may perform bad. Though I'm thankful because if it didn't, the game would be too hard.This brings me to another point: the enemy is overpowered. They will always have better gear than you do. They are designed to actually make it feel like you're a small squad (militia at that, not a full army) just ordered to perfom some missions. Sometimes you actually feel underpowered but you still somehow find a way to beat the enemy, and this makes you feel like you actually achieved something. Again, story and gameplay fusing together very well.tldr; if story matters to you a lot in a game, buy Valkyria Chronicles. The gameplay does not ruin the story part at all; it's fused together.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is by far one of the best games i have played:- The story: is amazing, sure you have your ""anime 101"" some enjoy it and some dont. The story is a reinterpretation of WW2, with fantasy added to the story. as Juck Fames puts in his review: you will enter looking for fun but will emerge with feels- Gameplay: is a mix between 3rd person shooter and turn based strategy (3rd person x-com i've seen people call it). This sort of combat gets you in closer to the battle instead of just seeing everying from up high, and for me personally being able to control my Squad in 3rd person helped me feel more attached and bring the feeling of war far better. Unlocking special orders you can issue during combat for granting various bonuses is not only immersive but strategically important as you go along to put it in short: Your squad will die without orders from their commander.- The characters: you as a commander of Squad 7 is put in charge of gathering a fighting force and there is easily more than 40 different characters you can recruit into your squad each with their own name, backstory, strengths and weaknesses. Each character will have set of ""perks"" showing strengths and weaknesses for example some characters might have ""Sand allergy"" and thus thinking about bringing that particular unit to a desert battle is not a good idea as it will result in damage over time for due to the allergy but brining a ""City born"" to a fight in the city will increase his/hers defense. These characters can die on the field of battle and thus you will have to replace lost soldiers.- each battle scenario is scored with a grade A,B,C etc. and based on your grade the more XP and Currency you will recieve. I am not a huge fan of that as it temps the player to find the quickest way to complete a scenario(you dont have to look far on youtube before you can find a guide that shows which maps can be completed in 1 turn) but i can see the enjoyment of hunting A grades after completing the game therefor i would recommend when first playing this game to take it a bit slower and plan you moves.10/10 - Im off to do a 2nd playthrough! Squad 7, Move out!!			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is better than sliced bread.And I was pretty hyped for slice bread too.Valkyria Chronicles is a quality tactical turn based third person shooter, a concept unique in its own right and near groundbreaking during the time of its original release. The game is set in a world war II environmen drawing heavily on real world issues to fuel the story with that fantasy JRPG flair to it. The environments and artstyle have that cell shaded appearance and makes the world more immersive and allows the game to age like a fine wine. The gameplay mixes turn based combat where either side moves their troops and takes turns going after one another.  When it is your turn, you actively take control of your soldiers in a third person shooter style, whereby you move based on your stats and then enter a firing mode. The gameplay is mission based and the story component is told through cutscenes and mission dialogue, the mix works well athough it does seem a bit disjointed in terms of the journal setup. The classes are all moderately balanced although you will typically just focus on select characters as they ""carry the fight"" and the character cast makes every soldier feel unique. The cast of characters each have their own backstory with priority given to those in the main story arch of course, however completionists will enjoy utilizing all the characters and trying out multiple approaches to beat the missions. Full recommendation, regardless of whether you are a fan or this knd of genre or not, has tactical, JRPG, and WWII stylized elements all combined in the perfect blend to create an unforgettable gaming experience.

												Adapation is the name and WAR is the style, quickly learn how to attack and defend as to adapt to the ever changing presence of what is on the battlefield.I played from 9 AM my to 12 am in one sitting, so I think it's a good game, amazing blend of 3rd person shooter and tactics also takes a lot more into consideration than any RTS game such as a solider's individual personality's and troop cooperation. Also I guess if you like animu, then it's a +1 but even if you aren't that big into anime or never knew what it was, this is still a good game.7 of ? chpaters left to go.Only problem I find is that since I played such a long sitting is because the gameplay is very, very, time consuming.EDIT: Beat the game as in all 20 chapters and speedrunning for lowest amount of turns and New Game + make the game much more fun in the speed running and play back aspect.

												This is a simple but very enjoyable tactical action(ish) game.  Taking the role of an officer of a standard unit, you decide the best way to arrange and utilize your forces in a series of skirmishes.  Added to this plain setup is your own skill in determining limited placements in real time unit movement.  This is something that would liven up any sort of strategy game rather than being rather cleverly disguised hex movements.The art and design of the game is very pleasing, even to non-anime fans.  There are anime tropes involved, but being a Japanese production of late that can't be helped.  Even so, it's story is rather well thought out even with the more mystical elements in this rather subdued tale of kinda/sorta Dieselpunk action.I reccomend everyone try this one, and hop that they can port the sequels easily... even though they are on the PSP.

												The combat system is a combination of FPS and turn-based strategy like X-com. You have a certain number of ""control points"" to spend each turn on units. Each unit has a movement meter and can use a weapon for each control point used. So you can move a unit into position, and fire, and if there's any movement left, move them behind cover. This works better for some units, not at all for others (snipers). The problem comes in the form of difficulty, unknowns, and RNGs. -Some missions are easy enough to beat in one try. Others take 5+ tries because of hidden units, surprises in the form of hidden tanks, and general RNG aiming. Or the first half of a mission is easy, and the second half is super hard because of endless enemy reinforcements. Or an undefeatable enemy appears that you have to ignore. Or the fact that a certain weapon does significantly more damage than any other against a special boss, but that you could never know to use.-You have to grind ""skirmishes"" in order to not be outclassed by enemies by two levels (which means a lot) at al times. -When you aim rifle/machine gun/lance/sniper/tank gun, you have a small reticule that shots will land within. This is ok, but for medium range shots, you miss 75% of the time because even though you put your crosshair dead on the enemies' head, it will completely miss. This wastes your control point and, if the enemy is within a 'counter attack' range, will be able to shoot back at you. -Most of the missions require you to simply capture a flag. That's all. Despite it's shortcomings in design and thought, it's worth a play. But don't pay more than 10$ for it.			"

												Let's put out the negative point this game has first, which is the extremely awful tank controls like how you can suddenly have the Edelweiss and Shamrock violently shaking at the slighest push of the wasd. This can easily result in you losing your precious energy bar ridiculously quickly. However, aside from that, I see no other negative point of the game. The story itself has a nice blend of military action, fantasy and romance.The game itself has an interesting and fitting art style, with a ""pencil shade"" sort of effect applied which gives the game the impression that it's being told from a book, which it actually is and it is not the sort of realistic looking graphics you see in video games these days. Even though the game has third person shooter elements in it, it still retains the strategy aspect of the game. When you start the game, you realise that your units if used wrongly can be taken out easily, forcing players to strategise and plan out their next moves instead of recklessly rushing in to kill off the enemies.I could go on and on about the positive points but I feel that the points mentioned are the main aspects that I really love about the game. Hopefully they release the PC ports for the second and third installments soon :)			"

												If you ever need an example how a good console-to-PC port should be, look no further.This game was extremely underappreciated and underexpected when it came out way back when, so opening it up to a broader audience at lower pricepoint is very good for the series. And hopefully SEGA sees the signs this sets, as it occupies top seller at time of writing this.Technically, it's not the new gold-standart by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definately one of the best ports i have laid eyes on so far. It has actually working, good Keyboard+Mouse controls - which work really well with the gameplay being strategic map and third person. Though, gamepads are just as supported and it plays basically like the console version we remember playing.On top of that come modern resolutions surpassing the original PS3 one, alongside FPS/Vsynch and windowed Options. So some adaptability to individual parameters is possible, unlike most console ports out there.Similiar for sound and keybinds. Not super fleshed-out, but satisfactory.The game as such is a good mix of turnbased strategy and third-person action RPG. Using a top-down tactical map, one selects and places their units on the battlefield and then controls them individually in a third-person view. During this time, moving them around consumes Action Points and you get 1 opportunity to shoot/grenade/heal/repair/etc per unit every time you control it.Taking control of a unit costs Command Points, once you're out of CP, your turn ends and the Enemy takes theirs in the same fashion, except you will only see them move pieces that you have visual contact to with one of your units (you'll also see it from that unit's point of view) otherwise you'll be left in the dark with questionmarks indicating possible, rough enemy positions and and out of sight moves just showing ""Shuffle, Shuffle"" sound effects. This effectively acts as the game's variant on Fog of War.Your squad will consist of 6 different unit types usually. Scouts have the highest AP, so they will be able to quickly cover a lot of ground and take objectives or give visuals on areas of the map, like camps or streets. Schocktrooper are less agile then Scouts, but they carry MGs instead of the Scouts' rifle. This enables them to make short work of infantry, while also being armored against MG and rifle fire. The third class are Lancers, which are usually the only way to take out armored targets (like tanks). They are also very slow and armored against explosives, which luckily includes tank shells and mortars. The other fast-moving class are Engineers, who are able to repair tanks and sandbag-barricades as well as disarm mines. In exchange, their direct combat abilities are weak in both offense and defense. The last group is the snipers, who have the lowest AP, but also the highest firing range, accurace and anti-infantry damage.That's only 5 and the sixth kind is not so much a group, as you only get a single Tank. It obviously destroys Tanks, Infantry and Obstacles alike, employing shells, mortars and MG fire while also being able to run over sandbags or bust through (predetermined) walls.There's a whole lot of tinkering to be had between the different roles and who specifically you assign to your squad and deploy, as individual recruits have different traits like e.G. pollen allergy that makes them less effective in forested combat zones or terrible/amazing night vision boosting/reducing their accuracy in the dark. Also, friendships with other recruits are to be considered for bonus team attacks. RPG-like upgrading of weapons, units and traits exists, but it's mostly linear so your toys just get better and there's no wrong options to take. Not frustrating like other systems, but also no noteworthy variety.The game also looks great, even for it's age. Only the prerendered cutscenes are a tiny bit lacking on higher resolutions, as they are still only in 720p. As for the story, it's mostly just an anime-ish war story in alternate universe Europe around 1935. As with most things, that's down to taste and hit or miss, so no further comment on that.All in all: Solid game, good port. Also automaticalyl includes the content that was originally offered as DLC on the PS3. Well worth the money. You can pay more and get less  for it elsewhere.			"

The developers did a phenomenal job of recreating the pain of living through World War 2 by creating the most arduous, drawn out battle mechanic for an enemy I've ever seen.If you leave that part out, the game itself offers an entertaining, likeable characters that grow as the story progresses and superb game mechanics. 10/10 the ani-nazis stole my tank.

												8.1/10A nice mixup between battelfield and turn based strategy type games.The story is set in a WOII like setting but in an anime fantasy world. The evil Imperial forces storm into your Shire a like country Gallia to mine the valuable resource ragnite. You, Welkin, a young boy while doing research in nature meet with a young girl Alicia. A few moments later the Imperial forces storm in your village and you have to defend it. Together with Alicia you decide to join the army and fight for Gallia!The story itself is very predictable, but the gameplay has a nice twist if you are willing to take the time. You play like an rts alike game. You see the icons of all your units and you can order high level commands. But when selecting a unit, you switch to third person and you have to do the action yourself. This is a nice twist on the ordinary gameplay from battelfield, but it can be very anoying due some wonky ingame mechanics. So if you want to do something quick or easily, forget it, that won't work.The personages are written pretty good they have their own distinct characteristics which makes every team member feel real. When a teammate dies you really feel bad since it was your choice and your fault that he/she died. If a teammate dies they will be dead for the rest of the game. So the lives of your teammembers really are at stake. Unless you lose the battle overall, which means you have to replay the last one or two hours of battling. Overal Valkyria Chronicles is a decent game about war stories from you and your teammates but the story remains very predictable.+ Gameplay you don't see often it feels fresh, Nice anime graphics style,  Good level design, Okay story- Very anoying gameplay hickups, wonky controls, some ingame bugs, pretty big death penalty, not that much replay valueIf you like the gameplay idea, you should try it out. But since it is a 50 hour game, I don't expect many will see the end due to the predictable story and wonky gameplay.			"

												This is a great game.  It has an anime not-quite-WWII setting.  The gameplay is a series of turn-based tactical combat missions.  The combat includes a 3rd-person real-time movement mechanic that I haven't seen before (and really like).  There are 23 main story missions and 5 side mission that unfold as chapters in a book.  Each mission is accompanied by several (skippable) cut scenes that tell a well a really nice story.  XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great game with a similar combat system - I like this game better.			"

												Let me start by saying this game is definitely a must play if you are a fan of the strategy genre and want a storyline. Pros: Story was great, music score was very well done, the tactical aspects of the game were generally satisfactory, and finally the characters were what brought this series to life. The art is also something I found refreshing and well-done though it may not appeal to those who are not a fan of the paintbrush watercolor art style. Cons: As with many console ports the controls can be a bit cumbersome, but I found even without rebinding keys that I didn't have a problem after an hour or so. As well some of the mechanics may not always make sense but that comes with the turn-based genre. While the music was good I found there was a lack in variety but it may not bother most people.Overall: For the price (even without a sale) it was well worth my ~30 hours. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has the patience for a strategy game with a solid storyline.			"

												An awsome game! And gets even better if you play the game in original Japanese voice (available in setting).And don't worry, you can still play the game as all the text and subtitles are in English.Never played Japanese games? well, here's a good one to start with. Good story, good machanic and eventhough its a few years old, felt as good as any newgames out there. In playing this game, some of you might get fustrated by some over-achievers enemy and such, but that's kind of force you to push your imagination further in order to solves the situations which is nice and challenging. Speaking of cons, during individual battles you can't save! (could before though) And that could♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off as a some battle took quite a while and failing mean repeating the whole thing including Mid Battle Cinematic and dialogues.But on the up side, That's probably it that might stop any you from finishing the game in one go (Sleeping recommend).

												Thematically, it's like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem got together and had a love child.  A heavy dose of tsundere and cringingly corny dialogue, and you have yourself Valkyria Chronicles.Every soldier on the battlefield is a separate character, with a separate class, personality, different stats and buffs, and different terrain preferences (Ex. sniper Catherine is extremely ammo-conscious, and firing her last bullet will give her multiple stat penalties).  Everyone has their own backstory and playstyle, making for an impressive number of combinations with a relatively small roster.  (They even have separate voice actors).The actual gameplay is very solid, while also presenting a very unique mechanic.  Each mission is played out in turns, but as each unit is moved, there is real-time reaction fire, forcing you to act quickly *while moving*, but still allowing every action to be deliberate.A great strategy game, but only for those who can muster an appreciation for the anime/JRPG influences; otherwise, the abundance of quality writing and storytelling will be lost on you.Lack of a multiplayer option limits replayability, but still worth it.

												Having put many hours into the PS3 version and all its DLC I feel it is worth taking the time to review the PC port of this game.It is an amazing game that everyone who enjoys strategy games should try. The game is a turn-based srategy game but becomes a real-time game as you move your units - you have a limited number of actions each turn but each action allows you to move your unit around the game map in real-time, avoiding coming under fire, positioning them and attacking. It really makes you use your turns strategically but also think on how to move and position your units. There is also extra depth i nthe form of equipable weapons, upgrades, and personal abillties.The story is pretty cool too, a unique take on warfare that blends WW2 with magic and mysticism. It covers the woes and tradgey of warfare, persecusion and more. It is really good for a strategy game, making it more like an S-RPG than anything else. The characters all hold their own and even the non-story related characters (most of your playable units) have thier own distinct appearances and personailties, making them likeable (or not, in some cases :P)The art style looks gorgeous, featuring anime-like visuals presented in a unique water-colour handdrawn style that makes the game stand out from the crowd. It was a breakthrough when it first came out on the PS3 in 2008 and still looks great now.As far of the PC port of this game does it is pretty ace - you have full control over graphic settings which helps boost this game from its 720p/30fps roots on PS3 into whatever you are capable of running. The game has both controler and keybopard support but I only have tried out a controller so far as that is what I am used to from the PS3 version. The only downside with the PC port is that most of the cutscenes are lcoked at 720p/30fps because they are pre-rendered clips, not running in-game real-time - nothing major.Long story short - buy this game! It's a great turn-based/real-time strategy hybrid with a solid story that looks amazing.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a great turn based RPG with grid based strategy movements. The game will appeal to anyone who enjoys WW2 tank battles and likes to plan strategic moves to overtake the enemy forces throughout the story of the game. Key characters are worth protecting to enjoy their story lines and one liners throughout the game. With full controller support this game will be exciting to play on devices capable of game streaming like the shield.			"

												I have played the sequel on the PSP and like it (sadly i didn't finish it and wanted to also play the 3rd version which I hope makes it way on to PC) I'm glad I ordered it yesterday (yay I saved $2.) any way this is a fun game and possible one of the best games from SEGA in recent years and I would recomend this to any one that wants to try something a bit differnt because this isn't your typical turned based JRPG but a little something different. I liked the fact that I was reading Megatokyo and in one of the rant DOM was saying how much he liked the game.Now stop reading this ""horrible"" review and start playing the game already.			"

												If you ever need an example how a good console-to-PC port should be, look no further.This game was extremely underappreciated and underexpected when it came out way back when, so opening it up to a broader audience at lower pricepoint is very good for the series. And hopefully SEGA sees the signs this sets, as it occupies top seller at time of writing this.Technically, it's not the new gold-standart by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definately one of the best ports i have laid eyes on so far. It has actually working, good Keyboard+Mouse controls - which work really well with the gameplay being strategic map and third person. Though, gamepads are just as supported and it plays basically like the console version we remember playing.On top of that come modern resolutions surpassing the original PS3 one, alongside FPS/Vsynch and windowed Options. So some adaptability to individual parameters is possible, unlike most console ports out there.Similiar for sound and keybinds. Not super fleshed-out, but satisfactory.The game as such is a good mix of turnbased strategy and third-person action RPG. Using a top-down tactical map, one selects and places their units on the battlefield and then controls them individually in a third-person view. During this time, moving them around consumes Action Points and you get 1 opportunity to shoot/grenade/heal/repair/etc per unit every time you control it.Taking control of a unit costs Command Points, once you're out of CP, your turn ends and the Enemy takes theirs in the same fashion, except you will only see them move pieces that you have visual contact to with one of your units (you'll also see it from that unit's point of view) otherwise you'll be left in the dark with questionmarks indicating possible, rough enemy positions and and out of sight moves just showing ""Shuffle, Shuffle"" sound effects. This effectively acts as the game's variant on Fog of War.Your squad will consist of 6 different unit types usually. Scouts have the highest AP, so they will be able to quickly cover a lot of ground and take objectives or give visuals on areas of the map, like camps or streets. Schocktrooper are less agile then Scouts, but they carry MGs instead of the Scouts' rifle. This enables them to make short work of infantry, while also being armored against MG and rifle fire. The third class are Lancers, which are usually the only way to take out armored targets (like tanks). They are also very slow and armored against explosives, which luckily includes tank shells and mortars. The other fast-moving class are Engineers, who are able to repair tanks and sandbag-barricades as well as disarm mines. In exchange, their direct combat abilities are weak in both offense and defense. The last group is the snipers, who have the lowest AP, but also the highest firing range, accurace and anti-infantry damage.That's only 5 and the sixth kind is not so much a group, as you only get a single Tank. It obviously destroys Tanks, Infantry and Obstacles alike, employing shells, mortars and MG fire while also being able to run over sandbags or bust through (predetermined) walls.There's a whole lot of tinkering to be had between the different roles and who specifically you assign to your squad and deploy, as individual recruits have different traits like e.G. pollen allergy that makes them less effective in forested combat zones or terrible/amazing night vision boosting/reducing their accuracy in the dark. Also, friendships with other recruits are to be considered for bonus team attacks. RPG-like upgrading of weapons, units and traits exists, but it's mostly linear so your toys just get better and there's no wrong options to take. Not frustrating like other systems, but also no noteworthy variety.The game also looks great, even for it's age. Only the prerendered cutscenes are a tiny bit lacking on higher resolutions, as they are still only in 720p. As for the story, it's mostly just an anime-ish war story in alternate universe Europe around 1935. As with most things, that's down to taste and hit or miss, so no further comment on that.All in all: Solid game, good port. Also automaticalyl includes the content that was originally offered as DLC on the PS3. Well worth the money. You can pay more and get less  for it elsewhere.			"

												The combat system is a combination of FPS and turn-based strategy like X-com. You have a certain number of ""control points"" to spend each turn on units. Each unit has a movement meter and can use a weapon for each control point used. So you can move a unit into position, and fire, and if there's any movement left, move them behind cover. This works better for some units, not at all for others (snipers). The problem comes in the form of difficulty, unknowns, and RNGs. -Some missions are easy enough to beat in one try. Others take 5+ tries because of hidden units, surprises in the form of hidden tanks, and general RNG aiming. Or the first half of a mission is easy, and the second half is super hard because of endless enemy reinforcements. Or an undefeatable enemy appears that you have to ignore. Or the fact that a certain weapon does significantly more damage than any other against a special boss, but that you could never know to use.-You have to grind ""skirmishes"" in order to not be outclassed by enemies by two levels (which means a lot) at al times. -When you aim rifle/machine gun/lance/sniper/tank gun, you have a small reticule that shots will land within. This is ok, but for medium range shots, you miss 75% of the time because even though you put your crosshair dead on the enemies' head, it will completely miss. This wastes your control point and, if the enemy is within a 'counter attack' range, will be able to shoot back at you. -Most of the missions require you to simply capture a flag. That's all. Despite it's shortcomings in design and thought, it's worth a play. But don't pay more than 10$ for it.			"

												I've completed the game on the PS3, as well as the 2nd game on the PSP. Got to the 3rd from last chapter on Steam, so guess I'll go ahead and give my feedback. =)Graphics: 9.5/10    Very unique animation. Looks like everything was hand drawn and painted. Probably one of, if not the, most gorgeous styles I've ever seen. The animations as well are very well done, almost like a full on anime (which the series has). Would almost recommend the game on the graphics alone.Gameplay: 9/10    I loved the gameplay. It gave me the feeling of a Visual Novel for the side dish, and a strategic role playing shooter for the main dish. It was very well planned out and the tactical combat got very intense at some points. This is the second thing that would make me gurrantee recommendations to others. Most, if not all, SRPG lovers will adore this game, me being one of them.Characters: 10/10    The best part of the whole game. The characters were absolutely amazing. You will be introduced to only three at first, but will increase drastically throughout the story. All the main characters are highly memorable, and even all the side-characters have their own story in the game that you can unlock. Im'ma stop myself before I spoil, but know that this is the main reason I would recommend this series to people. Story 9.5/10    Just like with the graphics, I was this close  (|-|) to recommending the game based on the beggining of the story alone. The story is absolutely amazing, getting detailed from beggining to end. Heck, there was a anime made for the series due to how amazing it was. The only reason, I mean the only reason, I didn't put 10/10 for this series is due to the fact I have seen a select few flaws here and there. If not for those minor flaws, it would be a 10. Then again, most people wouldn't even notice them if they didn't play the game multiple times. XDOver-All: 9.5/10    I would most definately recommend this to anyone who loves a great story, SRPG, beatuiful graphics, or all of these. Valkyria Chronicles is a amazing game whom's disc I won't be getting rid of for a long time to come.Nominated for the ""Not mentioned"" reward as a ""Great Graphic style"" nominee.=)			"

The story is a combined dramatic and heartwarming story about war and love that bloomed in war. The music is also very heartwarming and a perfect match for the story because it is also very dramatic.

												Valkyria Chronicles was the reason I bought my PS3, After seeing the gameplay and how beautiful and unique the game looked I just had to buy the game and I was floored.  It has since become one of my all time favorite games and one that I've gone back and replayed many many times.  And as soon as I heard that this was being released on steam I was so excited that I had an excuse to support this game and play it again.  And after playing through the first few chapters on the Steam version, I am not Disapointed at all.  The game runs great, even on my poor laptop, the graphics look nice and updated (though I might be wrong about this).  But the Bottom line is you shouldn't miss out on a Fantastic game like this.  And hopefully with the support that this port gives towards the VC Series, we might be able to see the other 2 Valkyria Chronicles games re-updated and ported to Steam (Maybe with an Online features :3)  If you are a fan of Turn Based Tactics games, this is a must have.

												So...First off, don't listen to the folks who call it XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics style. This is something else that I can't quite classify. You have a certain amount of points you can spend on actions each round from an overview of the battlefield marking known troop locations and terrain features. Soldiers use one point, your uber-tank uses 2 per turn. You can use the same unit multipe times each turn, but you lose movement every time you do. When you select a unit, you're dropped into a 3rd person position in control of them and you have a meter that is burned while you run/take cover. During this time enemies are shooting at you eternally until you take the one shot you're alloted or end the turn. If you stand there not burning your turn energy, you'll die from enemy fire. When you go into shoot mode, the game pauses to let you line up your shot and take it. Then if you have any energy left you can dart back to cover, or just end the turn.Between rounds your units heal a little, or a ton if they are in favorable conditions, like a camp. It's pretty sweet actually.The real unique system here is that every troop you field (and there are dozens to pick from) has a unique set of personality traits that can give benefits and disadvantages during combat. As you train the squad more traits are unlocked, for better or for worse. Some units like others, and this causes special events to trigger when they are close to one another. It's as confusingly deep as any JRPG, but isn;t too hard to wrap your head around.You can spend XP and cash earned to upgrade weapons and tank modules. There is a set of skirmish maps that aren;t tied to the story you can repeat endlessly for XP/cash, but if you lose a unit in them they're still gone forever.Bottom line: 10/10. Solid port, fun story so far, and I want to keep playing instead of doing Dad stuff or sleeping.			"

												A very solid tactical RPG/strategy game in the vein of X-Com. Vakyria Chronicles puts its own spin on things, allowing you to directly control the members of your squad as if it were a third person shooter. This makes the game quite engaging as puts you directly in the battlefield instead of just being a cold detached overhead observer. Your units all have their own personalties (some better than others) and quirks, such as hating city environments, ""fancying"" a certain gender, or claustrophobia, all of which have an effect on that characters stats or their squads stats. Additionally money and experience earned on missions can be spent to upgrade your units and their gear.The game is quite story heavy at times, luckily it's actually a pretty good story with decent writing, better than ""Oh no, aliens are attacking, kill them. Oh no, more aliens!"" in any case. The setting is essentially ""WWII but not actually WWII"", pitting Western democracies of Europa (definitely not like Europe in any way, don't be silly) against the East Europan Empire which is Soviet Russia or National Socialist Germany or something. Sometimes you might wish they would hurry things up so you can get back in the action, but the story is engaging enough that you probably won't want to skip the cutscenes. The voice over work is pretty good overall considering it's a dub, at the very least it isn't distracting. Battle SFX are good as well.Some people probably won't be able to look past the anime-esque artstyle although it's not as in your face as some other games. This is a port and it shows: limited graphics options and the controls are bit odd. The mouse can be used in battles just fine but for whatever reason it can't be used to navigate menus. Tank controls definitely leave a bit to be desired at times as well.Overall a solid 8.5-9/10.			"

												If you like turn-based tactical RPGs, you'll love Valkyria Chronicles. If you don't, give it a try anyway, you might change your mind!Now that I've completed the game, it's time for a somewhat more elaborate reasoning why the game is worth your time. Visually, the game is very appealing unless you hate anime with a passion. The watercolour style art is pleasant for the eyes although it does diminish the warlike feel a bit. The sound component is not exactly stellar, but it's far from being bad. Voice acting: Regardless of which voiceover you choose, you shouldn't have a problem with it. All in all, the sound is good enough.So where does this game get to shine? It's of course the fun and challenging missions. Even though the AI tends to sometimes do ridiculous things, every victory feels like it's deserved. A fair number missions will truly test your strategies, and a few of them will test your patience as well. In particular, boss fights often require some serious thought. Be patient, observe and try things out. And if you do get stuck, the community is happy to help, just ask.Onto the flaws: It is mostly addressing people who love a good challenge and can appear unpatronizing to an average gamer. Second, the ranking system, which only rewards a quick completion of missions rather than tactics, which is a bit absurd, considering that a war-themed game SHOULD be a lot about tactics. But still, you can ignore the ranking system, as you can always replay the main story missions (and skip almost all cutscenes in the runs after the 1st) as many times as you like and try to get an A-rank.The verdict: 9.1/10			"

												First and foremost this is behavior we should applaud from a publisher. Even a big one. And even if that publisher takes notoriously bad approaches with other games (DLC's, etc). This one, they got it right. They brought a ""cult hit"" PS3 exclusive to the PC and took the time to do it right, without DLC's, and at a reasonable price. I hope it had (and continues to have) great sales and the publisher takes note.With that out of the way, on to the game. The port to PC is fantastic! I cannot undersell that at all. Obviously gamepad controls are flawless but the keyboard and mouse controls are fluid and what I used. Frame rate never dips below 60 and the game looks superb in modern PC resolutions. The game itself  is a slow paced tactical, turn-based, strategy game that looks beautiful and has a rich and deep storyline and characters. But it isn't without it's flaws and is probably going to be an ""acquired taste"" for many, if not most. I will touch on a few things below. Technical hiccups I encountered personally;-I had some crash on exit issues that seem to be related to Steam Overlay. Turning Overlay off stopped it. Though I often just dealt with it because I wanted Overlay for screenshots. And crashing on exit isn't the end of the world, I was exiting anyway!-Minimal tearing on some cutscenes. Non-issue for me personally but I mention it for the sticklers out there.-Steam now recommends a bunch of pervy anime games to me since I poured over 40hrs into this.Gameplay issues some might have. ""Fair warning"" stuff basically;-It IS slow. And failing a mission means going through the same slow steps again.-The game will breed impatience in some. Every mission does have an ""A"" rank way to beat it swiftly. So there is this inherent ""feeling"" that you can be brazen and act swiftly to beat any level. BUT, these tactics are mostly reserved for the second playthrough with a much much more powerful squad at your fingertips. Patience and caution is the name of the game the first playthrough!-Also on that note, the game will throw new obstacles, tactics, and effects at you each mission. Especially in the second half of the game. Not taking the time to read (also read between the lines of) warnings and plan ahead will result in what feels like a ""cheap"" death. But in reality the game lays everything out and you have the time to learn ""on the fly"" as long as you're taking your time. I learned my lesson the hard way more times than I care to admit before I slowed down my pace and started thinking like Welkin (protagonist) rather than me the modern impatient gamer.Regardless of any neglible issue or ""fair warning"", with sales at multiple online gaming outlets and here already reaching as low as $4.99USD it's worth the throwaway just to support the developer's behavior on this approach. Even if the publisher doesn't need the money and is huge. This is a rare (maybe only) moment where I can recommend a purchase even if you have no intention of playing. That said, if you DO play it and DO take your time to ""acquire the taste"" you will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts. This game was a thoroughly satisfying play and experience and ranks atop my short list of all time favorites. Yes, ALL TIME FAVORITES. It is damn good. The game is fun, lengthy, deeply well written, well voice-acted, beautiful, and smooth. A pleasure. I had great fun in my 40+ hours of play and I still have extras, hard and expert modes, and more left to enjoy should I want to! One last random note; I've never watched an anime outside of Cowboy Bebop so I can say with emphasis that the art style goes beyond that crowd. It really is a lovely game visually.Easily recommended.			"

												Honestly? This is the only war/military setting game I ever liked, ever. In a genre saturated with obtuse masculinity, obnoxious patriotism and armchair general daydreams, this character-driven tale that treats every piece on the metaphorical chessboard like a thinking, feeling entity is worth more than a thousand Call of Duty iterations. That alone, especially if you always wanted to experience the genre but were turned off by the above, is enough reason to try this game.But I understand that's a very personal stance, so let's speak objectively. The art direction is fantastic, the setting is satisfying and rich, the gameplay is a bit trial-and-error at times but it's only a problem if you absolutely must get that S-rank (remember, speed > efficiency when it comes to that). You're actually encouraged to treat your soldiers as people and not cannon fodder, because their individual potentials synergize with each other and friends will team up against enemies. Also the Steam port won't lose to the original console version in terms of quality and features.So in short: if you didn't play this game on PS3, play it now. You won't regret it.			"

												So...First off, don't listen to the folks who call it XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics style. This is something else that I can't quite classify. You have a certain amount of points you can spend on actions each round from an overview of the battlefield marking known troop locations and terrain features. Soldiers use one point, your uber-tank uses 2 per turn. You can use the same unit multipe times each turn, but you lose movement every time you do. When you select a unit, you're dropped into a 3rd person position in control of them and you have a meter that is burned while you run/take cover. During this time enemies are shooting at you eternally until you take the one shot you're alloted or end the turn. If you stand there not burning your turn energy, you'll die from enemy fire. When you go into shoot mode, the game pauses to let you line up your shot and take it. Then if you have any energy left you can dart back to cover, or just end the turn.Between rounds your units heal a little, or a ton if they are in favorable conditions, like a camp. It's pretty sweet actually.The real unique system here is that every troop you field (and there are dozens to pick from) has a unique set of personality traits that can give benefits and disadvantages during combat. As you train the squad more traits are unlocked, for better or for worse. Some units like others, and this causes special events to trigger when they are close to one another. It's as confusingly deep as any JRPG, but isn;t too hard to wrap your head around.You can spend XP and cash earned to upgrade weapons and tank modules. There is a set of skirmish maps that aren;t tied to the story you can repeat endlessly for XP/cash, but if you lose a unit in them they're still gone forever.Bottom line: 10/10. Solid port, fun story so far, and I want to keep playing instead of doing Dad stuff or sleeping.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a RPG that tells the story of a guy and his group of friends, who find an old tank group up to fight against an invading super power. The game is placed roughly in the 1930's and has about the same look and feel as the events that took place during the start of World War 2. There are a bit of fantasy elements as well but not to the degree of certain JRPG's. Valkyria Chronicles is the single best game I have ever played that is not an fps. This game is easily one of the most beautiful games I have ever had the pleasure of experiancing. The story and the art  are 10/10. The strategic manoeuvring of units combined with turn based RPG gameplay, all layered on top of the moment to moment action afforded by real-time controls as players command each squad member and tank in battle. Reminicent of Xcom but with third person over the shoulder and actual aiming. It feels familar but is still unique and approachable.This game is one of the sleeper hits on the ps3. Not many people know of it do to little marketing at the time, but it is one of the single highest rated games on that system according to both players and game reviewers.This was ported over to pc from the ps3. It should run really well, even for people playing on toasters. You can play using a controller, or mouse and keyboard.  Menus there is no mouse support, must use a keyboard.  In game, camera control and aiming has good mouse support and uses WASD to move your character.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles was the reason I bought my PS3, After seeing the gameplay and how beautiful and unique the game looked I just had to buy the game and I was floored.  It has since become one of my all time favorite games and one that I've gone back and replayed many many times.  And as soon as I heard that this was being released on steam I was so excited that I had an excuse to support this game and play it again.  And after playing through the first few chapters on the Steam version, I am not Disapointed at all.  The game runs great, even on my poor laptop, the graphics look nice and updated (though I might be wrong about this).  But the Bottom line is you shouldn't miss out on a Fantastic game like this.  And hopefully with the support that this port gives towards the VC Series, we might be able to see the other 2 Valkyria Chronicles games re-updated and ported to Steam (Maybe with an Online features :3)  If you are a fan of Turn Based Tactics games, this is a must have.

The story is fun, the characters are memorable and the music is brilliant. It was criminal that this game was largely ignored, and releasing the sequels on the PSP only made the issue worse. Being a fan of a languishing franchise is the worst.Sega have done every fan, and themselves, a favour by re-releasing this. Not only have they done a good job and released a game that *works* but they've ensured it runs well on less powerful machines.

												Valkyria Chronicles is a game that didn't recieve nearly as much notoriety as it should when it came out on PS3. It features a brilliant combat system that is a ton of fun to work out strategies for, and the story does an excellent job in supporting it. If you are looking for a strategy game to scratch an itch of that sort, Valkyria Chronicles should be right up your alley.Now in terms of the port to PC. Given its a Japanese company (whoes track record for PC hasn't been very good) porting, its far better than I expected or hoped. The game supports resolutions up to 4k (I'm running on 1600x900) and you can either set the game to 30fps or your monitors refresh rate. It looks excellent running at a buttery smooth 60fps, and from what I understand it works just as well at 120 fps. The keys are fully rebindable to boot. However, options don't stretch much further beyond that. And just a note, the pre-rendered cutscenes are in 720p so you will get jagged edges on other resolutions.Besides the resolution you're stuck with the graphical fidelity you've been given (which is extremely pretty), although that shouldn't be too much of an issue. The game was originally running on a PS3 and doesn't approach intensive in the performance department. But as always, make sure you can run it before buying the bloody thing.The port isn't perfect, but its serviceable, and in terms of performance and the included DLC, is objectively better than the PS3 version. If you missed out on it the first time, or are looking for an excuse to experience the game again, get it. Its an absolute bargain, and will provide a good amount of fun.			"

												First and foremost this is behavior we should applaud from a publisher. Even a big one. And even if that publisher takes notoriously bad approaches with other games (DLC's, etc). This one, they got it right. They brought a ""cult hit"" PS3 exclusive to the PC and took the time to do it right, without DLC's, and at a reasonable price. I hope it had (and continues to have) great sales and the publisher takes note.With that out of the way, on to the game. The port to PC is fantastic! I cannot undersell that at all. Obviously gamepad controls are flawless but the keyboard and mouse controls are fluid and what I used. Frame rate never dips below 60 and the game looks superb in modern PC resolutions. The game itself  is a slow paced tactical, turn-based, strategy game that looks beautiful and has a rich and deep storyline and characters. But it isn't without it's flaws and is probably going to be an ""acquired taste"" for many, if not most. I will touch on a few things below. Technical hiccups I encountered personally;-I had some crash on exit issues that seem to be related to Steam Overlay. Turning Overlay off stopped it. Though I often just dealt with it because I wanted Overlay for screenshots. And crashing on exit isn't the end of the world, I was exiting anyway!-Minimal tearing on some cutscenes. Non-issue for me personally but I mention it for the sticklers out there.-Steam now recommends a bunch of pervy anime games to me since I poured over 40hrs into this.Gameplay issues some might have. ""Fair warning"" stuff basically;-It IS slow. And failing a mission means going through the same slow steps again.-The game will breed impatience in some. Every mission does have an ""A"" rank way to beat it swiftly. So there is this inherent ""feeling"" that you can be brazen and act swiftly to beat any level. BUT, these tactics are mostly reserved for the second playthrough with a much much more powerful squad at your fingertips. Patience and caution is the name of the game the first playthrough!-Also on that note, the game will throw new obstacles, tactics, and effects at you each mission. Especially in the second half of the game. Not taking the time to read (also read between the lines of) warnings and plan ahead will result in what feels like a ""cheap"" death. But in reality the game lays everything out and you have the time to learn ""on the fly"" as long as you're taking your time. I learned my lesson the hard way more times than I care to admit before I slowed down my pace and started thinking like Welkin (protagonist) rather than me the modern impatient gamer.Regardless of any neglible issue or ""fair warning"", with sales at multiple online gaming outlets and here already reaching as low as $4.99USD it's worth the throwaway just to support the developer's behavior on this approach. Even if the publisher doesn't need the money and is huge. This is a rare (maybe only) moment where I can recommend a purchase even if you have no intention of playing. That said, if you DO play it and DO take your time to ""acquire the taste"" you will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts. This game was a thoroughly satisfying play and experience and ranks atop my short list of all time favorites. Yes, ALL TIME FAVORITES. It is damn good. The game is fun, lengthy, deeply well written, well voice-acted, beautiful, and smooth. A pleasure. I had great fun in my 40+ hours of play and I still have extras, hard and expert modes, and more left to enjoy should I want to! One last random note; I've never watched an anime outside of Cowboy Bebop so I can say with emphasis that the art style goes beyond that crowd. It really is a lovely game visually.Easily recommended.			"

												We should all be glad this one made its way to PC.  Having never owned a PS3 I'm glad I had a chance to play it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the unique and fantastic gameplay.+ Top-notch turn-based, strategy gameplay.+ A decent story.+ Unique art style which looks amazing and will ensure the game doesn't look dated for years to come.- Huge deadzone with xbox controller, small aim movements were a major pain (I knew about the dpad).- No auto saves (game explicitly tells you to save after missions).Playtime: ~ 36h9/10			"

												Excellent game. Not gonna lie, the story is cheesy and over-the-top goody goody, and many of the scenes are almost nauseatingly PG, but even so its a story that makes you care. If you liked FFT, you'll love this. Because its much better. Unlike the generic characters you get in games like that, these are characters that can die under your command and you will get to know as individuals through combat. Each character has unique slogans, sayings, and skills that will make picking your squad agonizing each time.As to the gameplay, watch some of the videos and you'll get the gist. Its basically perfect.So in summary. Not a great story, but great characters, and fantastic gameplay.			"

It takes the best from Third Person shooters and Real Time Strategy games and mixes them together to form an amazing game. Highly recommended.Also includes all PS3 DLC.			"

												Well considering that I have played 26 hours in a span of 3 days, if you were to ask me if I enjoyed this game I would slap you across the face and question your sanity. In short this game is a huge time waster for people that enjoy JRPGs and SRPGs.Whenever I play this game I get a feeling that only Fire Emblem has made me feel so far. Maybe that's the reason I adore Valkyria Chronicles so much!			"

												To me the game mechanic looks not suitable for a strategy game. Not being able to predict/plan movements and attacks is constant source of frustration.This gets even worse since the game actively promotes YLO-like plays to finish the mission as fast as possible.As for the story, it's mediocre at best and not nearly enough to compensate for broken gameplay.

												A Very Good and Overlooked Real-Time Tactics Game, Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 port to PC which in my own opinion transfered pretty greatly (Besides the save options being in PS3 overlay style and menu systems being odd to navigate)I have no real complaints about gameplay and or anything regarding to characters the story may not be as appealing if you're not into a WW2 type settings.Overall I would give Valkyria Chronicles a big 9/10 for being a solid and well put together port with minor menu issues and being an a fun game overall.P.S. if you do plan on picking up the game, Jann Walker one of the members you can put into Squad 7 is a must have he will pretty much make everything you do action wise halrious and even more enjoyable.

												This is not only a very good tactical RPG , but has a great story as well.The Tactical elements (with mission ranking from S down to Fail) keep you coming back for more, not only to win the battles but win them in the best way possible.  There are also nice elements within the RPG on building your squad up (certain members play better with others  ... adding some spice to mission selections) as well you can upgrade your tanks with various abilities.The story is centre to the game - and has many turns and twists. well worth the time you invest.All in all this is a superb tactical J-RPG, and if you have never played JRPG's - this would be a super first start.The Game is well worth the money (this is my 2nd play through  ... previously completing it on the PS3).I definitely recommend this game.

												Thematically, it's like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem got together and had a love child.  A heavy dose of tsundere and cringingly corny dialogue, and you have yourself Valkyria Chronicles.Every soldier on the battlefield is a separate character, with a separate class, personality, different stats and buffs, and different terrain preferences (Ex. sniper Catherine is extremely ammo-conscious, and firing her last bullet will give her multiple stat penalties).  Everyone has their own backstory and playstyle, making for an impressive number of combinations with a relatively small roster.  (They even have separate voice actors).The actual gameplay is very solid, while also presenting a very unique mechanic.  Each mission is played out in turns, but as each unit is moved, there is real-time reaction fire, forcing you to act quickly *while moving*, but still allowing every action to be deliberate.A great strategy game, but only for those who can muster an appreciation for the anime/JRPG influences; otherwise, the abundance of quality writing and storytelling will be lost on you.Lack of a multiplayer option limits replayability, but still worth it.

Just finish as fast as possible.Towards the mid game it gets pointlessly grindy though. Hits being pure % based (like any strategy game) but the game never informing you of this fact (no stat info for actual chance to hit).But the game as a whole from the story and the feel, it is great.

												When I got this game for the ps3, I never made time to play it. Now that it's been released for the pc, I completed it after a good 50 hours (I tend to take my time with games). My reaction to it is really positive. Positives - Beautifull anime styled graphics - A serious story with some elements inspired from WW2- Likeable characters - The gameplay and music- Most missions - Good port Mixed- Some parts of the story- Some people will not enjoy the anime like presentation Cons- Cinematics are in a lower resolution I liked this game a lot more than I thought. It is also a fine port (higher than 1080p and 60fps) in comparison with the ps3 version which could only produce 720p graphics. It's certainly a game I wish to play again sometime in the future and i hope sega will come around to produce more of this type of game. I can only recommend this game.			"

												Even if you hate RPGs with a passion, or even SRPGs in particular, this game is unique enough and charming enough to be enjoyable as it does away with a lot of tedious grinding and other such common problems. The battle system is quite unique and the individuality of the potentials for each character, granting positive and negative effects is both strategically very fun and also makes you love the characters more. It brings a lot of dynamics to building your team and really makes you care if a key person dies in battle. The main cast cant die permanently but secondary characters can, though it isnt as much of a pain as other permadeath systems as you're given 3 turns to touch the fallen character with another character, who then calls a medic to save them.It has a huge cast of really varied characters of all ages and walks of life, most of which are very lovable and funny with a couple being pointedly jerks to the extent of also being amusing. There are some truly epic set piece battles like nothing I've ever seen in a strategy game before, they're absolutely intimidating and overwhelming at first and give a fantastic sense of achievement when completed. It's dual audio but the dub is extremely high quality so you can feel absolutely safe to go with either option.			"

												I haven't actually played much of this game, maybe an hour or two, but I feel compelled to share my awe at how the characters in this game react to a full-scale invasion of their country. Everyone's always smiling as they stroll down the street, and regard war almost as though it were a weather event. ""The enemy can't be far behind, but I wanted to apologize for yesterday and baked you this bread. Tee-hee."" (girls must not let minor things such as war get in the way of flirting with the new boy in town)The amount of optimism displayed is no less incredible: ""I'm sure the village guard (or whatever they call it) will fend off the attackers! Oh look, the old windmill. Sure makes you feel at home, doesn't it?"" Are these people r3tarded? There's a g0ddamned army steamrolling the nation, but what the hell - there's always time to stop and smell the flowers. Let us have a picnic, shall we? Then, when the tanks roll in and start blasting down buildings, they go ""I can't believe it!"".*sigh*Thank you, Japan.That being said, the gameplay is pretty fun, and mixes turn-based strategic combat with real time FPS action. It is quite interesting. I'll probably update this review after I play some more.			"

												10/10 ""its like skyrim with guns but turn based"" IGN The good: -strong story that keeps you interested-Well developed characters including the 200+ side characters (Can remember the whole squads names, likes, firends etc. I could name maybe 4 characters in the whole of skyrim and tell you nothing about them by comparison)-Blend of turn based combat/ RPG progression/ 3rd person action. (these three things mesh perfectly to keep gameplay interesting and skill not just stat based.-Includes all the dlc packs. (actually a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of new content)The bad:-running the game at higher than 30 fps increases the amount units counter attack for some reason (console physics) basically making the game ""hard mode"", turning the frame rate higher than 60fps eg 120 fps makes it almost unplayable. Not really an issue just make sure you cap the frame rate at 60 fps.-720p pre-rendered cutscenes. There arn't too many so its not an issue.-certain tactics are downright broken making certain challenging missions super easy ( don't watch guides or you will learn these exploits and break the game)-Lots of upgrades need to be done between missions, can be annoying sometimes.Overall: Its a linear story driven game I played for longer than Dragon age Inquisiition. Thats all that needs to be said10/10			"

												Very fun game with adorable characters, but it is quite challenging after the first few levels! I have been stuck on the 7th chapter now and have died many many times on this single map (wont spoil it for those who havent played it).Pros: The game is very fun in many different ways. The story, though seemingly blending elements of World War II and Final Fantasy a little too closely, is very fun. The gameplay is balanced and this game's length will provide for months of never-ending entertainment. The anime-themed look of the game's environments and characters work extremely well in 3D; the rendering engine the game uses is superb. Even though it's an anime-styled game, it doesn't have any of that cliche ""kawaii""/""hot anime girls"" garbage that's seen so often in mainstream Japanese Anime culture. The game's content is surprisingly conservative really. It's well-fit for all ages. The English dubbing of the game is excellent; the voices are superb. No translation errors with spelling or grammar either. Excellent storyline; you will be very immersed in the game's world after only a short amount of time playing it. The developers put a great deal of good thought and effort into the storyline and the game's universe. Characters are very well-developed. They all have their own detailed biographies and personalities. You bond with them very deeply as the game progresses, and it can almost be heartbreaking when any one of them dies in battle. Plays slightly similar to XCOM but with a minor FPS flare (units are not fixed to grids; they can move wherever they want freely. The enemy AI is quite clever in how it becomes more difficult and adapts to the player's tactics as the game progresses. Any time they permanently kill one of your soldiers (by capturing them when they are unconscious), it makes you feel heartbroken and full of rage at the enemy. The different gameplay classes are well-balanced and fun to play. All DLCs from the PS3 version are automatically included. No ""pay an additional $20 for this extra little gameplay package"" nonsense. Game has practically no bugs at all.Cons: This list may seem fairly extensive but really the pros are still much stronger. These are all minor complaints. The game's drawbacks are mostly functionality/GUI issues. The actual gameplay and storyline are fantastic and they are the reason why this game is so good. Nevertheless, be wary of these problems if you buy the game: No multiplayer mechanics; game is exclusively singleplayer. This is considerably disappointing considering the potential it could have as an online strategy game between players. No escape menus in-game; exiting normally from the game takes a while. This game requires a lot of patience and forgiveness from the player. Battles take a very long time, and if you lose a battle, you must repeat the whole battle all over again from the beginning (30-120 minutes per battle gameplay time). Very frustrating on the more difficult game levels. The game has a lot of menus for all different things. A little too many. Menu GUIs are somewhat unfriendly for a computer with a mouse; all menu operations have to be done using a keyboard, shifting and scrolling through options slowly with way too many keys, rather than a simple click of the mouse. For a game that has waited some 6-7 years to be finally ported to PC, very few (if any) improvements to the game's graphics have been made. Controls for moving tanks are quite difficult, and using your mouse to maneuver the tank wastes a ton of movement ability. Most game config options can only be changed by launching a separate program; this means you cannot simply exit from gameplay real quick and change the control scheme. You have to turn off the whole game and go change the settings separately, then relaunch it. Pretty annoying if you forget the controls. The game claims to have a war cemetery ""place"" that you can visit where you can see the graves and whatnot of your fallen soldiers, but when you go to it, all it lets you do is talk to this old man whose only purpose is to sell you battle abilities. The developers of the game really missed a good opportunity there for players to be able to connect more deeply with the game's characters and story. Severe bug that disables the computer monitor when you exit out of the game via the windows home button and then try to re-enter the game. The monitor will go black and you will never be able to fix it unless you manually shut down your computer and restart it. Ctrl-alt-delete sometimes works but the last time it happened to me, not even that was able to stop the monitor blackout.All in all, this is a game that you should not miss out on. Get it! You won't regret it. I certainly don't!			"

Love this game, I'm a big fan of SRPGs like this, Shining Force, Fire Emblem, Advanced Wars and Langrisser. The dialog is a little hammy but the story is solid. The gameplay is what makes it shines love the combination of real time and turnbased combat.  I hope they make a true sequel. Also hope Sega keeps bringing over it's Japanese console games....I need some Yakuza in my steam life. haha			"

												This was a fantastically made game back when it was originally released on the PS3, and it's still an amazing experience now on PC. Of course, I would have expected nothing less from the wonderful minds that brought us Skies of Arcadia on the Dreamcast some years before - and it was great to see that the little Easter Egg of Vyse and Aika from that game making an appearance in this one was still there. Naturally, being an avid fan of that game, I made sure they were both in my squad <3 This game does an amazing job of weaving together gorgeous visuals, excellent characterisation, a compelling storyline, and a beautiful soundtrack. It's not without its flaws, certainly, but neither is any great masterpiece - and that is, after all, what this game is. The asking price is exceptional for a title of this calibre, especially given the amount of content the game has to offer. I am only about 30-ish hours in so far myself, and I know I am likely not even halfway through the game yet. Honestly, if you're at all unsure about it, take the plunge. You'll thank yourself later.			"

												First and foremost this is behavior we should applaud from a publisher. Even a big one. And even if that publisher takes notoriously bad approaches with other games (DLC's, etc). This one, they got it right. They brought a ""cult hit"" PS3 exclusive to the PC and took the time to do it right, without DLC's, and at a reasonable price. I hope it had (and continues to have) great sales and the publisher takes note.With that out of the way, on to the game. The port to PC is fantastic! I cannot undersell that at all. Obviously gamepad controls are flawless but the keyboard and mouse controls are fluid and what I used. Frame rate never dips below 60 and the game looks superb in modern PC resolutions. The game itself  is a slow paced tactical, turn-based, strategy game that looks beautiful and has a rich and deep storyline and characters. But it isn't without it's flaws and is probably going to be an ""acquired taste"" for many, if not most. I will touch on a few things below. Technical hiccups I encountered personally;-I had some crash on exit issues that seem to be related to Steam Overlay. Turning Overlay off stopped it. Though I often just dealt with it because I wanted Overlay for screenshots. And crashing on exit isn't the end of the world, I was exiting anyway!-Minimal tearing on some cutscenes. Non-issue for me personally but I mention it for the sticklers out there.-Steam now recommends a bunch of pervy anime games to me since I poured over 40hrs into this.Gameplay issues some might have. ""Fair warning"" stuff basically;-It IS slow. And failing a mission means going through the same slow steps again.-The game will breed impatience in some. Every mission does have an ""A"" rank way to beat it swiftly. So there is this inherent ""feeling"" that you can be brazen and act swiftly to beat any level. BUT, these tactics are mostly reserved for the second playthrough with a much much more powerful squad at your fingertips. Patience and caution is the name of the game the first playthrough!-Also on that note, the game will throw new obstacles, tactics, and effects at you each mission. Especially in the second half of the game. Not taking the time to read (also read between the lines of) warnings and plan ahead will result in what feels like a ""cheap"" death. But in reality the game lays everything out and you have the time to learn ""on the fly"" as long as you're taking your time. I learned my lesson the hard way more times than I care to admit before I slowed down my pace and started thinking like Welkin (protagonist) rather than me the modern impatient gamer.Regardless of any neglible issue or ""fair warning"", with sales at multiple online gaming outlets and here already reaching as low as $4.99USD it's worth the throwaway just to support the developer's behavior on this approach. Even if the publisher doesn't need the money and is huge. This is a rare (maybe only) moment where I can recommend a purchase even if you have no intention of playing. That said, if you DO play it and DO take your time to ""acquire the taste"" you will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts. This game was a thoroughly satisfying play and experience and ranks atop my short list of all time favorites. Yes, ALL TIME FAVORITES. It is damn good. The game is fun, lengthy, deeply well written, well voice-acted, beautiful, and smooth. A pleasure. I had great fun in my 40+ hours of play and I still have extras, hard and expert modes, and more left to enjoy should I want to! One last random note; I've never watched an anime outside of Cowboy Bebop so I can say with emphasis that the art style goes beyond that crowd. It really is a lovely game visually.Easily recommended.			"

												In general, I hate war games. I just bought this one because it had a female protagonist and a good price, and for the first time I've played, I just could not turn off the computer for the entire night!Everything about this game is incredible: the storyline, the music and, mainly, the awesome battle in turns and strategy, it's just fantastic. It offers you a good level of difficulty, and doesn't matter how many times you die until you get all mission with rank A because the graphics are so marvelous that you just don´t get tired of playing it.And yes, it's a war game with a lot of female characters (who fancies both men and women), and this is just awsome.Everyone should try this game for sure!

												A very solid tactical RPG/strategy game in the vein of X-Com. Vakyria Chronicles puts its own spin on things, allowing you to directly control the members of your squad as if it were a third person shooter. This makes the game quite engaging as puts you directly in the battlefield instead of just being a cold detached overhead observer. Your units all have their own personalties (some better than others) and quirks, such as hating city environments, ""fancying"" a certain gender, or claustrophobia, all of which have an effect on that characters stats or their squads stats. Additionally money and experience earned on missions can be spent to upgrade your units and their gear.The game is quite story heavy at times, luckily it's actually a pretty good story with decent writing, better than ""Oh no, aliens are attacking, kill them. Oh no, more aliens!"" in any case. The setting is essentially ""WWII but not actually WWII"", pitting Western democracies of Europa (definitely not like Europe in any way, don't be silly) against the East Europan Empire which is Soviet Russia or National Socialist Germany or something. Sometimes you might wish they would hurry things up so you can get back in the action, but the story is engaging enough that you probably won't want to skip the cutscenes. The voice over work is pretty good overall considering it's a dub, at the very least it isn't distracting. Battle SFX are good as well.Some people probably won't be able to look past the anime-esque artstyle although it's not as in your face as some other games. This is a port and it shows: limited graphics options and the controls are bit odd. The mouse can be used in battles just fine but for whatever reason it can't be used to navigate menus. Tank controls definitely leave a bit to be desired at times as well.Overall a solid 8.5-9/10.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a game that didn't recieve nearly as much notoriety as it should when it came out on PS3. It features a brilliant combat system that is a ton of fun to work out strategies for, and the story does an excellent job in supporting it. If you are looking for a strategy game to scratch an itch of that sort, Valkyria Chronicles should be right up your alley.Now in terms of the port to PC. Given its a Japanese company (whoes track record for PC hasn't been very good) porting, its far better than I expected or hoped. The game supports resolutions up to 4k (I'm running on 1600x900) and you can either set the game to 30fps or your monitors refresh rate. It looks excellent running at a buttery smooth 60fps, and from what I understand it works just as well at 120 fps. The keys are fully rebindable to boot. However, options don't stretch much further beyond that. And just a note, the pre-rendered cutscenes are in 720p so you will get jagged edges on other resolutions.Besides the resolution you're stuck with the graphical fidelity you've been given (which is extremely pretty), although that shouldn't be too much of an issue. The game was originally running on a PS3 and doesn't approach intensive in the performance department. But as always, make sure you can run it before buying the bloody thing.The port isn't perfect, but its serviceable, and in terms of performance and the included DLC, is objectively better than the PS3 version. If you missed out on it the first time, or are looking for an excuse to experience the game again, get it. Its an absolute bargain, and will provide a good amount of fun.			"

If you liked FFT, you'll love this. Because its much better. Unlike the generic characters you get in games like that, these are characters that can die under your command and you will get to know as individuals through combat. Each character has unique slogans, sayings, and skills that will make picking your squad agonizing each time.As to the gameplay, watch some of the videos and you'll get the gist. Its basically perfect.So in summary. Not a great story, but great characters, and fantastic gameplay.			"

Finished it about an hour ago, and I have that sunk feeling like after reading a really good book, or playing a good game like this ""well what do I do now?"".Even though the game has its corny moments,  I was on such an emotional roller coaster ride from the beginning to the end.  I'm pretty sure this game influenced me to feel every different common emotion--happiness, sadness, anger, tranquility, awkwardness, hopelessness, and triumph.I'll just end it there.  If I had to pay full price ($20) for it just to play through it again, I would do it, no questions asked.  If a new game was released and I knew that it would give me the emotions and feels that this game did, I would pay the $59.99.			"

												Honestly? This is the only war/military setting game I ever liked, ever. In a genre saturated with obtuse masculinity, obnoxious patriotism and armchair general daydreams, this character-driven tale that treats every piece on the metaphorical chessboard like a thinking, feeling entity is worth more than a thousand Call of Duty iterations. That alone, especially if you always wanted to experience the genre but were turned off by the above, is enough reason to try this game.But I understand that's a very personal stance, so let's speak objectively. The art direction is fantastic, the setting is satisfying and rich, the gameplay is a bit trial-and-error at times but it's only a problem if you absolutely must get that S-rank (remember, speed > efficiency when it comes to that). You're actually encouraged to treat your soldiers as people and not cannon fodder, because their individual potentials synergize with each other and friends will team up against enemies. Also the Steam port won't lose to the original console version in terms of quality and features.So in short: if you didn't play this game on PS3, play it now. You won't regret it.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a somewhat typical S/TRPG (strategy/tactical RPG) that's been wrapped in a beautiful artistic vision and unique gameplay persepctive.  Most of the common elements of tactical RPGs are here.  Take control of the units you've selected from your squad, place them within your starting area and using Command Points move them during your turn within their movement radius and take one action.  Once all the command points have been spent the turn is passed to the AI who does all their moves and then again back to you tiill either the objective is completed or failure on your part.  There are 5 of classes in the game, Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer and Sniper.  Also there is a tank(s) that you command as well as the different classes.  Before each map you can choose what number soldiers from each class you take into the battlefield, some maps may require to load up on certain classes while forgoing a class entirely.  Most of the classes are also able to choose between a couple of different weapons/load outs so you can either favour accuracy, damage or status effects.  In addition to different classes and load outs there are also various orders to be given in battle (each order costs command points).The best parts of the game to me were the Characters, level design and perspective.  The third person perspective made for a unique experience in a tactical RPG rather than a typical grid.  The Characters were great.  The design to them as well as their lore all worked to drawyou in to the RPG experience.  And lastly the level design.  There was a good variety of levels, from cities, to forests and deserts.  The levels also had different design elements and objective focuses to make each level interesting as well as replayable.Some of the things that I was Neutral on was the Story and Leveling/progression system.  After each victory you would be awarded a certain number of EXP points that could be spent on the training grounds to level up characters.  Leveling up the characters didn't really result in traidtional RPG gains but would be used to unlock various class traits that would affect how that a character of that class would react to certain battlefield conditions.  The leveling up seemed to have a minimal effect on things like HP (your starting HP won't be much different from end game HP).  I did like that there was a variety of skirmish missions that could be done to grind for more experience or gold. Some of the things I didn't like about the game were the Story, the interface and randomness.  The story was okay, but was very typical of a JRPG.  There was only one moment for me in the entire story that wasn't just generic JRPG storyline.  Some of the big suprises were not very surprising and a lot of characters took very generic character paths, which is sad cause the I like the characters themselves, they had charm.  As for the interface, there are a few things missing from the game that feel like it should be there.  You can only save outside of missions, there is no ability to save mid mission and with some missions that are on the longer side, it can be a bit of a pain.  As well you are shown how many shots it will take to kill an enemy (body vs head) but you are not given any percentages on if those shots will actually hit the target, so you are told that it will take 4 shots to kill an enemy but you are not told that you might only have a 50% chance of hitting the target.  The AI could also be kind of infuriating because there is no option to skip the opponents turn animations (as far as I figured out anyways) and on some of the maps there is a lot of enemy actions to go through.  Some of the Keyboard and Mouse controls can also be kind of wonky.  Driving the tank(s) with Keyboard and mouse can be very very frustrating.  One last thing I didn't really enjoy was that for the majority of the game you could load up on one character class with 2-3 other classes as support to power through the game.Overall I felt that the game is very solid and definately worth the time to go through.  The game can be found on sale pretty often these days for 5-10$ so it's pretty solid value as well.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a good game but, could’ve been a lot better.Gameplay/Mechanics –  First off, soldiers are leveled according to their class rank.  That means everyone is dispensable and the only thing you lose is their hidden potentials.  If we had a standard leveling system like Fire Emblem, I would’ve cared a lot more for my boys.  Secondly, orders are ♥♥♥♥ing OP as ♥♥♥♥.  *Goes to chapter 12, uses caution and demolition on Alicia, rush through to the end of the level, kill enemies in camp, occupy camp, ?????, profit.  Thirdly, I’m fine with having a standard model gun for every class but can’t we have special weapons?  Like good ones and not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns that Cordelia gives you.  “The game’s more strategy than RPG” is all I’m saying. Story – It’s good, moving on.Characters – There’s only four characters, Welkin, Alicia, Largo, and Rosie.  The rest are nobodies that barely affect the plot except for Faldio.  They’re all above average characters except Rosie.  If you want to learn more about your units, better go to the skirmish, select Welkin, aim at his/her head, shoot, call medic, ????, profit.  The biography system is underwhelming.  I was thinking “that’s it?” when I first played through the campaign.Soundtrack – The soundtrack is good; it fits the mood pretty well.Graphics – Wait, Valkyria Chronicles is 16gb because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 720p cutscenes? WTF? How’d they ♥♥♥♥ this up?  If it’s gonna be uncompressed and unhindered, WTF ISN’T IT IN 1080P???  Otherwise, it’s game from 2008, what’d you expect?Overall – 7/10 Jann X Largo 4life… "

												An interesting combination of turn based strategy and third person shooter. It's a definite play for any fans of games such as Fire Emblem or Advance Wars with each story map having a different objective and unique idea behind it the game pushes you to try different strategies continuously.The story is an interesting fictional take on Europe during the period of World War 1 and World War 2 as you play as the militia for a small, independent, neutral nation under invasion from the expansionist empire. It deals with some rather heavy themes, getting the closest I think any game ever has to talking about the holocaust in any significant manner. It tugs at your heart strings at times and the battles begin to truly ramp up and against your odds.More of my thoughts here:

												Anyone who has enjoyed a turn-based RPG, a tactical shooter like X-COM, or just a fun story should absolutely treat themselves to Valkyria Chronicles. The core gameplay is a hybrid turn-based shooter but it gives you the freedom to explore different routes and strategies. The story and characters are presented in a wonderful water-color/anime art style embedded in an old fashion story book. Seriously, this game's got everything: action, strategy, and God damn, even a bit of romance.  You should stop reading reviews and just buy the thing. For $20, it's an absolute steal.			"

												This is a simple but very enjoyable tactical action(ish) game.  Taking the role of an officer of a standard unit, you decide the best way to arrange and utilize your forces in a series of skirmishes.  Added to this plain setup is your own skill in determining limited placements in real time unit movement.  This is something that would liven up any sort of strategy game rather than being rather cleverly disguised hex movements.The art and design of the game is very pleasing, even to non-anime fans.  There are anime tropes involved, but being a Japanese production of late that can't be helped.  Even so, it's story is rather well thought out even with the more mystical elements in this rather subdued tale of kinda/sorta Dieselpunk action.I reccomend everyone try this one, and hop that they can port the sequels easily... even though they are on the PSP.

												This is one kind of a game! Is like mixing the good turn-based RPG style with some aiming/strategy/shooting action!! You really feel in a battlefield with all the nice sound effects (such as your allies calling for help or asking if you are alright!), the difficulty is a bit harder than expected but that is one of the good things!, you actually have to think what your next move is gonna be! (take a risk or play safe) even a single turn wasted could change everything!. Aside from all the sweet gameplay the history is pretty nice, is like watching an anime with a good plot...some drama, love, friendship, etc.Well to end this, I will just say that i played like 25 hours to just get to the end of the game (damn that freaking last boss is hard as hell). So if you love fire emblem/ advanced wars rpg you really need to buy this! don't even think it twice!			"

												Turn based military RPG. I never seen a RPG game like this. I was curious, tried out this game. And.. wow, it was actually fun. People tend to complain about voice acting on Japanese games, but voice acting was nicely done. One of the best voice acting on Japanese games. I'd have believed if it was actually made by US game company lol. The game gets quite easier as time progress, but it wasnt so easy, or hard. I think game balance was done nicely too. Downside is, this game might get boring because there's a lot of walking, and slow tanks.. game is slow. And some, weird story plot, tho story was good enough. I'd say it's worth the money. I had fun playing this game. Get this game.			"

												Really enjoyed this one.  Mostly turn-based with a little splash of real-time-ish components: when you activate a unit, you swap to a 3rd person over the shoulder. Movement is AP based, not time-limited, but units will fire in real-time at a unit that is in movement mode (applies for your units shooting at moving enemy units as well) so you still want to be mindful of cover while you move.Don't worry if you're not a FPS champ, once you switch to aim mode, enemy units stop getting that free suppresive fire, so you may calmly aim at your leisure (just be quick to hit the ""aim"" button when you're done moving, if you happen to be getting shot at there).

												Valkyria Chronicles is a really fun game, with an amazing story, awesome theme and great gameplay. BUT! Be warned! If you don't like random chances, unlucky shots and fatal consiquences based on both skill and even more luck then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It will frustrate you to death, because a random dice roll can throw away hours of earned gameplay, unless you save constantly. But if you can somehow get beyond that, this game is really wonderful.			"

												Having played Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, i can only recommend it for everyone that is a fan of original, round based 3rd person strategy.My personal challenge will be to not ONLY use Alicia to get all the A ranks. >_<I was a little surprised getting all the DLC too, but that's something i didn't do on the PS3, so i look forward doing that.

												by finishing the game, i has already completed the whole media of this franchise (beside the VC 2 and 3)manga  (Gallian Chronicles : Valkyria of the Battlefield)anime (Valkyria Chronicles)and the game itselfFor the gameplay,You can beat the game for +/- 40 hours of gameplay if you don't decide to accomplish all of the achievement.This turn-based mechanism is quite interesting by separating characters into 5 classes : scout, trooper, sniper, engineer, and lancer with their own pluses and minuses.You need to arrange the right composition of the army to get the best result of the battle (of course you need to get A rank for every map you met).The abilities for each character also drawn my attentionEach character has their own story that related to other charactersexample: if there's a character who had a grudge or hating a spesific character, their ability will develop into hater.and vice versa, if there's a characters who had feelings to other characters, their ability will develop into lover.For the story,I can find this game has many possibilities of stories, full of emotion and of course a taste of unrequited loveyou will find yourself neutral in this journey, from Gallian side and for the Empire sidefor the music,there's nothing special beside the battle-theme-songs to encouraging and boost your morale in battlefieldto conclude this preview, i want to say that this game is worth to be playedand if you are an achievement maniac, the completion for all achievements will be exciting			"

Even on normal difficulty some missions can provide quite a challenge and the ability to customise your squad and recover and swap weapons is really fun, even if nearly all the enemy weapons are terrible compared to the ones you can research. I would heartily recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun turn based strategy game loosely based on World War 1.			"

												A unique strategy game that perfectly blends real time strategy, turn based strategy, 3rd person shooter, and RPG elements. To top it all off, the art style of the game is really pretty and anime-ish, which I liked a lot. The story is also really well done. All of the characters in the game, even the non-main characters of your squad, have unique backgrounds that really fleshes them out as characters and sort of helps you form a bond with them. Really liked this part for it is something not found in many games. Btw, there is an option to use either the Japanese or English voices for those who don't like dubs.One thing I don't like though is that you can't skip or fast forward through the enemy's turn so you are just gonna have to sit there and bear with it. The tank controls can be a bit difficult, which costs you to use up AP unneccesarily. I heard this isn't a problem when using a controller though. Other than these complaints, this game is perfect!

												Honestly I don't even know what to say that would sum up how amazing this game is better than any of the top reviews. It was a fantastic game on PS3, and it's still fantastic all these years later on PC. This game has aged better than...... grape juice.It comes with all the previously released DLC and is already significantly cheaper than buying the game was for PS3 originally, so I'd say it's a really great deal. The story is relatively classic in the overarching plot, but the heartfelt characters, unique storytelling, and the mixture of realism and fantasy really makes it fresh and engaging. Meanwhile, the gameplay IS strategic but doesn't have as much of the ""chess game"" feel of the standard strategy tile/grid set up, giving you a little bit more action by giving you third person partially-real time control of each character one by one. They're integrated together really well, and make both planning and taking action quite enjoyable, although sometimes (especially in the first few maps) you may just find yourself charging the line instead of ""strategizing"" in order to get the best grade. This proves a lot less true as you progress in the game though, so that may just be from my viewpoint of someone who's played the game several times.(And remember to check your roster once in a while for new characters to enlist!)

												When I first saw this game, I didn't really think much of it at the time. After doing my research, I found out that this was a port of the PS3 version, and then I was now under the impression that it would be a horrible port, but I was wrong. This game managed to surpass my expectations many times over. It manages to combine the elements of a third-person shooter with a turn-based strategy game rather well, and it is backed up by a well written story filled with likable characters. The only complain I have about this game are the the god-awful, f♥♥♥♥♥♥ tank controls! They always f♥♥♥ up my strategies every time I try to move them around the f♥♥♥♥♥♥ map!!

												This game may not be for everyone, especially those who have no patience on cutscenes or those who hate losing so much. If you can get by pass that flaw, you're seriously awesome for trying. But if you judge the game based on negative reviews, you'll be missing out a lot from this gem. Gameplay It takes time to get used to the gameplay. You need to take note of character traits aside from class strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes you need to practice skirmishes to get a feel on the crew and note how far they can reach a certain point of the map.It's like playing chess, but instead of one move per enemy, you get a set of moves and you need to finish it before your enemies turn.The missions vary, most of the time you occupy enemy camps. There's a stealth mission where you need to rescue hostages on a special chapter, as well as hopeless mission where you need to be quick on taking enemy camps to avoid death.Also topology! There's a spiral mountain map in the game in the latter chapters and it was really fun to play it. The maps are really fun, sometimes you can find hidden clues on where the blindspots are placed.I find it challenging and very addictive, this game really needs tactics. My brain gets exercises from countless mission failures I've done. Well, as the saying goes ""Learn form your mistakes"". Valkyria Chronicles 2 VS Valkyria Chronicles 1 Why am I even comparing the two?  Like some of you here, I don't own a PS3 so the first VC game I played was its sequel. Upon playing I thought it would be as easy as VC2 but no...God damn this game is really hard! Probably because almost all flaws in VC1 are ironed out in VC2, especially the option to skip cutscenes or enemy movement cutscenes.In VC2 I can get away with a mission even if I suck at the game, however VC1 is rather unforgiving at that aspect. TechnicalI'm not experiencing any bugs on the game for now, and to think I'm just using a measly i3 processor.   It's unfair to rate the game down after reporting it's buggy in it's early release. They're not even trying to do a replay after the pushed updates. This is a great console to pc game port in my opinion. It works flawlessly with an Xbox360 controller.If you are experience crashing, update to STEAM BETA. Most of the problems are caused by Steam overlay in the game. STEAM BETA somehow fixed it.A two thumbs up to SEGAI've played Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on PSP and decided to buy this to support PC ports and tell SEGA, fans freaking care about the franchise. I am hoping SEGA would also release Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on PC, all the flaws in the first game are addressed and you can clearly see that the devs are very passionate about this game.Trully this is a masterpiece. :)			"

												The presentation and aesthetics of this game are simply amazing. It looks and feels like an anime, yet narrated like an audio history book. The vignette and color pencil filter also adds to the charm.The tactical battles are a little different than most, and not always in a good way, but overall the gameplay is very satisfying. The game rewards rushing 1-2 units behind enemy lines to capture points which is not what most strategy games promote. If you can get over this little weirdness, you'll enjoy this game.A lot of games have challenge scenarios that I normally just ignore, but the challenges in this game lets you unlock new weapons and gain xp/money for the main campaign, so I played them a lot more than I would have in other similar games. This adds a lot to the replay value and there's also a new game + mode. I normally only buy discounted games but I think this title is worth picking up at full price, If you see it on sale, and don't absolutely hate anime, then definitely pick it up.			"

												One of the very few single-player games I was willing to soldier through 60+ hours in order to beat the game. In short, this game is really good, but not without its fair share of issues as well.The combination of a tactical strategy game mixed with third person shooter mechanics to some degree is really interesting to see and somehow managed to pull off quite well. To be quite frank, there isn't much to talk about the strategy portion of the game and instead the third person portion takes up most of the spotlight. The real strategy is mainly figuring out how to make the most of your turn doing as much damage as possible to the enemy without getting your soldiers horribly murdered all while completing your objectives as fast as possible. In strategic mode, you are presented a map with the positioning of your soldiers and any enemy within line of sight with the badges on the top of your screen represents your total command points for the duration of your turn. Assuming direct control of a foot soldier will consume 1 command point while tanks consume 2 command points and any unused command points at the end of your turn will be carried over to your next turn. During third person mode, you have an action bar that will slowly deplete while moving around making positioning the key to your troop's survival and you can only perform one action per command point, all while taking interception fire so don't you even think about idling. You can take control of the same unit multiple times, but you can not move as far when moving them for the first time and your walking distance will continue to get smaller the more times you use the same unit to the point where they can only walk 2 steps until the beginning of your next turn. I can't properly critique characters in stories and I'm not going to pretend to, but for the most part I liked them to say the least, even the side characters you are able to recruit to your squad. Death of squad members are caused by enemy contact with their bodies or if none of your units are able to reach them within 3 turns after incapacitation so if you happen to have some sort of personal attachment, I'd suggest you be a bit careful. Sure, you can just restart the mission from a previous save file, but that defeats the purpose of permadeath and there will be no reason for you to be crying over their deaths. Oh, and the story is good. Just like characters, I can't properly critique story without spoiling anything so that's all I will say.At this point, I'm starting to run out of good things to say. First off, you would think new game+ would provide a more challenging experience. Instead, the difficulty of the AI does not change accordingly and in reality, the only thing that makes the game difficult is how to A rank every mission (a.k.a finish the mission as fast as possible), which most of the time involves bum rushing the enemy with fully upgraded stats and equipment turning Valkyria Chronicles into a puzzle game instead of the original intention of being a tactical strategy game. Now that I think about it, the AI doesn't feel dynamic anymore once I started my second playthrough. Even some of the special orders you aquire throughout the game kinda breaks the balance of difficulty at times so I mostly have no reason to use them since character and equipment upgrades already make you pretty powerful if you play smart. Speaking of difficulty, there have been occational difficulty spikes here and there, but once you're able to figure it out, congragulations, you have experienced the sweet taste of victory despite the overwhelming odds. On a technical standpoint, I have experienced drops in framerate at times making movement a bit clunky, but hey, it's not a twitch shooter so it's tolerable, although it's a bit annoying regardless. I did try playing some of the challenge missions and the English dialog seems to be bugged so I got nothing but silence so I tried the Japanese voices and somehow, they worked. What? Oh yeah, and there is no mouse control in any of the menus, but it's only a minor nitpick at best. Some of the options like locking framerate and resolution requires you to open a separate launcher in order to adjust those settings.Overall it's not a brilliant port, but it's competent and hey, at least it functions properly, unlike a certain cinematic AAA rooftop jumping simulator.

												Played this game on a friends system years ago, finally have the chance to finish it thanks to this great port. The book themed aesthetic with the vignetting and colorful shaders make this game a unique gem from the past, definately worth a look at and playable on most systems at a high resolution and framerate.

												It is true that Valkyria Chronicles is the best turn based strategy game of the previous generation.  It is equally true that it is one of the best turn based strategy games of all time!  This even more than the uncharted games are what I miss from my PS3.The game's story and art direction are great, gameplay is satisfying, and the overall experience is fantastic.The PC port seems to be really well done with no artificial locks on resolution and a pretty smart keyboard mouse interface.  There is a litty wonkiness using the menues with keyboard and mouse but it isn't to bad.  The graphical fidelity isn't modern day amazing but the art style doesn't lose much from being a previous gen title.If you haven't played this game it will be some of the best money you ever spend on a game period.  The is a MASSIVE thumbs up from me.			"

												I feel comfortable reviewing this based on my ps3 experience. It runs, looks and plays better than that version and includes all the dlc.    Now for the uninitiated, think xcom: enemy unknown, Advance Wars and Shining force combined into a psudeo realtime Fantasy take on world war II, complete with well written characters and lore. Valkyria chronicles is a classic not just because of it's story, which is as sober a take on war as you will find in all of gaming, or it's gameplay, which is a deep, varied and exciting take on the strategy genre which manages to be completely engaging and original. It's the fact that both elements are incredibly strong. it's a complete package, and something that will stick with you long after you've finished. Since this games succesful steam release, fans of the series are waiting for news of more Valkyria chronicles on steam and with good reason.			"

 Video Review Valkyria Chronicles has just been released on PC. For those who are not familiar with the series, Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical combat role playing game. It was developed and published by Sega and originally was released for the Playstation 3 in 2008. You take on the role of a young squad of troopers as they battle through a historical fictional war, loosely based on world war 2. Is this port a successful endevour by Sega? Or is this just another 3D Sonic failure for the company?The game was very successful for SEGA on the Playstation 3, it met critical acclaim upon it's release and it spawned many sequels, it also has had an anime series and several manga titles. All in all this is a successful franchise for sega.Unfortunately SEGA's success with the franchise has not followed through on the PC Port. Firstly it's menu system has not been ported very well at all. I'm sorry to say that there is NO mouse support in the menu's, everything has to be done by keyboard! And even then you are met with old left overs from the console version. For example upon starting the game you are asked to press start! Even when you do not have a controller connected! I'm sorry but if you are going to release a PC port at least spend some time adding mouse support in the menus! You just wont be taken seriously otherwise.The games presentation is beautiful, it is rendered with a comic book look and it's art style really takes advantage of that. As you run around blasting your foes to pieces, you do so in a environment that is pleasing for the eye! Unfortunately the cutscenes that are pre rendered have not been revisited and remain in their original 720 format. Also the game can only run at either 30 frames per second or that of the refresh rate of your monitor, it's that or nothing I'm afraid! Luckily we can play at 1920 by 1080 and once in game the game does look wonderful at that resolution despite it's limitations!All in all this is a quick PC port by SEGA and there isn't much in the way of options to make use of the horsepower of your PC. We are stuck with rubbish menu control also however once spending a couple of minutes in game mastering the controls it can be forgiven. It's not often Playstation exclusives come to PC and despite it's limitations I am happy to say I am glad this has been ported. "

												Absolutely wonderful game which should be a must have in every decent gamers library! Played it on the PS3 before that and bought it for PC without hesitation.Great story, beautiful visuals and innovative gameplay.The battles play similar to XCOM: Enemy unknown and relies a lot on tactical thinking.If you're looking for a story driven game with good gameplay this is the game for you.

It transitions rather well, other than a few awkward control issues using keyboard mouse.Tactical RPG, WW1-2 era technology, unique (to me) combat system.  Mind blowing art.  A bit wordy on cinematics, but you can skip them, or enjoy them.  I've found they aren't tedious (at least the first time through).			"

												This is my review after i finished the game, look at my hours. This game need around that number to finished with all of story and a few side stories + skirmishes.My Rate : 7.5 of 10 Love Tactical Games?or maybe Puzzle ?This game is semi Action and Tactical, You control a Squad,And each turn you can move one by one character in action mode. Action mode is basicly move and order your character to shoot,bomb,heal,etc. And there are also a limit to do it in every turn.Story :Its good but not great. The story is really what you can think of. But its really fun to watch, especially if you love Anime. Main Feature :- You can buff and spam one unit in one turn to Finish one match (not anytime) But Worth it- Cool Canvas style graphic- You can think this game as puzzle you have many unit with many abilities, you have commands to buff, and you have limit action per turn. To get best (A) Rank you need to think how to finish one stage in least turn. Its exciting. Other Feature :- You can save in a battle, so if you think you messed up a bit you can load it. - The Steam Achievement really makes you want to play it again after finished at least for a grinding lover like me. - This game using Book for the story telling, so if you think you missed a bit you can re-watched it.The Bad :- No Fast Forward or skip Enemy Animation at their turn. So you need to watch them, it really boring if the enemy moves a lot.- Some abilities & commands just to IMBA at the end of the game. It really makes the game easier a lot.- Sometimes the character didn't shoot at the right target and it waste your turn. It really makes me rage load. Some Tips for play : (Imba buff) Use Alicia + Awake Potential + Defense Boost + Double Movement Potential  it will make you reach enemy base fast, and yeah i use it a lot and easy win lol xo  My Verdict :If you really like anime, tactical, war, and shooting its worth it to buy it at full price. :)If not just wait for the discount to play it.

												Game is amazing. Perfect blend of stratigizing and pure force. This game incorporates xcom mechanics with third person shooter ideas. Overall I think this game is great. But so I can't be compeletly bias I will write pros and cons.Pros:-Great story line.-Great characters and character development.-Combat can be puzzling and complex-If you do not enjoy the puzzling and complex idea. You can go guns blazing.-Customizable team ability to switch them out in middle of operation.-Able to upgrade and progess team you create.Cons:-In some cases glitches can be found. (Shooting at a wall even though the circle is not near the wall.)-Enemys being able to get nearly imposible shots off onto you.-No ability to save in middle of operation. (I had to give up progess in a operation because of time.)Everything aside if you like civ 5. I would say this game may perplex you. If you play xcom this game will do more then delight you. If you like any third person shooter/turn based game if you don't play this game you are missing out. But that said if you do not like turn based games. Do not buy this game. If you do not enjoy third person games but can tolerate the aspect of turn base. I suggest to buy it. The game was worth the 20 dollars I spent on it and if it was 10 more dollars I would even buy it then.			"

												I'm watching an anime film and playing at at the same time :) The gameplay is turn-based and the graphics are smooth. The Batman style ""boom"", ""pop"" and ""kapow"" text adds a nice flavour, and the art style is well done. There are a couple of downsides though:1. There is no English translation - its actually American, and so filled with things like ""gotten"" and ""favor"". If you have the speech on American the accents are a bit grating, so its best to stick to the Japanese. Even then, because the text translation is into American it loses some of the real flavour. Probably great if you're American, but for everyone else it sucks. 2. The cut-scene moves show their age a bit with all the low-res jaggies and such like.			"

After the first couple missions, the PC control layout is easy to get used to.  For those new players interested in trying this out; I highly recommend this for the story, art, and great gameplay.Pro's:-Instantaneous saving.-All DLC comes with the main game.Con-Tank control by mouse is glitchy, so use only the keyboard for tank combat.-There's no clear way to get back to video/optimization settings (but I'm happy with the graphics thus far).

I'd buy it in a heartbeat.Side note: Low game time, does not really mean low game time. I like to play games in offline mode and really have no need for achievements.			"

												Pretty fun turn-based strategy game with lots of text to read about your characters, the world and the equipment they're using.  The story is engaging, though the characters range from one-dimensional to super interesting.  The ""difficulty"" in missions has mostly to do with incomplete information, where enemies will surprise you with set ambushes, unexpected environmental effects and other such nonsense that will likely lose you battles, a lot like the Fire Emblem series.  Similarly, once you know about them, the battles are usually fairly simple.  If the game gave you a better sense of what was dangerous and give you the option of taking risks instead of springing deadly effects on you, the fighting might be more interesting.  Nonetheless, worth a try.			"

												I was really on the fence about buying this game, but now that I have played it I understand why my friends keep talking about it. The storyline is enthralling, which would be enough to make it worth the meager 20 dollars required. But then the strategy makes it so much better. Its like a telltale game mixed with great strategy. I did not want to be wasteful and buy a game I would never play, and I would say this game was well worth the money. It does not have rediculous graphic requirements, nor should it. If you want a story driven strategy that is 10/10 great then you found it. Even if you are just looking around for any game then this one might turn you on to another genre entirely. 10/10 love it, never had a game move me this much, not even The Walking Dead(the Telltale series).

												Valkyria Chronicles is definitely one of my favorite games of the year, even though i never played the ps3 version i am enjoying the PC port a whole lot. This game is a strategy game which is very alike to XCOM enemy unknown. You get a lot of options when it comes to constructing your squad and how you would like to customize it in a similar, yet very different way from xcom. Likewise the combat system also has its similarities with xcom in the way that you move your characters forward shoot at something and have a % ofhitting whatever you're shooting at. That being said the two games are very different, for an example you have a map from where you choose which character to move and then move that character in from a 3rd person perspective. The combat system feels really challenging at times and you will see yourself redoing some battles more than one time. Even if this can make one quite frustrated it is not too difficult to come up with a new tactic so that you won't die in the same way again. I really enjoyed the way that it played and if you like other strategy games such as xcom or fire emblem you will probably like the gameplay of Valkyria Chronicles as well.Another big part in Valkyria Chronicles is Cutscenes and a whole lot of dialogue. In between every combat sequence there are usually a whole lot of dialogue and a cutscene or two to be had. That might be annoying for some since it's really one of the reasons why i like it so much but fortunately the cutscenes and dialogue are mostly skippable in case you dont want to see it or if you forgot to save or something like that. The artstyle of this game is basically your normal anime artstyle and i find it very pleasing. Since the game was made in Japan you also have the option to pick japanese as the voiced language in cutscenes and dialogue in case you enjoy your anime with subs. Did i mention that the game has full Voice-over for everything? The only problem i find with this is that the subtitles don't really match the japanese audio too well sometimes. It's more of a nitpick but it would be nice if they fixed it. Even if you dont watch anime or anime with subs you'll still most likely enjoy the game since the english voice actors are pretty good as well. The Story is also pretty good and it is set in a fictive world war 2-esque setting. I'ts not the best story ever but its still really good.Well what differences are there with the PC port and the game from 2008 then? The biggest differences are that you can run it in a better resolution. You got 4K no problem you can run it, however the character models  aren't updated so there might not be that big of a change. Other than that you mostly just have your standard options like Anti-aliasing and such. I had no problems at all running the game at 60 FPS in 1080 p even though it seems like some people dont seem to get it to work very well. On the other hand you should note that the in-game menus aren't mouse controlled you will have to control them with your keyboard. That being said it's not much of a problem and the battle sequences feature full mouse control, although you might have to fiddle with the mouse sensitivity a little. And for those who want to play it like the ps3 version you can plug in your ps3 controllers using better ds3 tool or something like it.Overall Valkyria Chronicles is a great strategy game with a above average story and a pretty lovebale artstyle. If you like anime or xcom you should buy this game its just 20 euro so what are you waiting for. If its on sale buy this game, come on what are you doing why haven't you bought it yet???. Don't however buy this game if you don't like strategy games or if you hate anime.			"

												Amazing game. If you like turn-based strategy shooters (Hogs of War, anyone?), this is a must-buy. I already had this on PS3 before it was released on Steam. Did not regret buying it twice. PC version comes with all DLC included. It's a great port that runs very smoothly. Just keep in mind that it's best played with a controller.			"

												Game is amazing. Perfect blend of stratigizing and pure force. This game incorporates xcom mechanics with third person shooter ideas. Overall I think this game is great. But so I can't be compeletly bias I will write pros and cons.Pros:-Great story line.-Great characters and character development.-Combat can be puzzling and complex-If you do not enjoy the puzzling and complex idea. You can go guns blazing.-Customizable team ability to switch them out in middle of operation.-Able to upgrade and progess team you create.Cons:-In some cases glitches can be found. (Shooting at a wall even though the circle is not near the wall.)-Enemys being able to get nearly imposible shots off onto you.-No ability to save in middle of operation. (I had to give up progess in a operation because of time.)Everything aside if you like civ 5. I would say this game may perplex you. If you play xcom this game will do more then delight you. If you like any third person shooter/turn based game if you don't play this game you are missing out. But that said if you do not like turn based games. Do not buy this game. If you do not enjoy third person games but can tolerate the aspect of turn base. I suggest to buy it. The game was worth the 20 dollars I spent on it and if it was 10 more dollars I would even buy it then.			"

												Another game ascends to PC and escapes oblivion by doing so. I really enjoy this game. The problem with it is that if you want to fully upgrade your weapons and skills (which you WILL need for later missions), you're going to want consistent ""S"" ranks for each mission which is VERY difficult to figure do, and more often than not there is only one real correct way to do it.  After a while, I found myself trying to mimic exact movements on Youtube for people doing ""S"" rank tutorials for each mission. Almost any slight deviation can cost you that elusive perfect rank.

												This is my review after i finished the game, look at my hours. This game need around that number to finished with all of story and a few side stories + skirmishes.My Rate : 7.5 of 10 Love Tactical Games?or maybe Puzzle ?This game is semi Action and Tactical, You control a Squad,And each turn you can move one by one character in action mode. Action mode is basicly move and order your character to shoot,bomb,heal,etc. And there are also a limit to do it in every turn.Story :Its good but not great. The story is really what you can think of. But its really fun to watch, especially if you love Anime. Main Feature :- You can buff and spam one unit in one turn to Finish one match (not anytime) But Worth it- Cool Canvas style graphic- You can think this game as puzzle you have many unit with many abilities, you have commands to buff, and you have limit action per turn. To get best (A) Rank you need to think how to finish one stage in least turn. Its exciting. Other Feature :- You can save in a battle, so if you think you messed up a bit you can load it. - The Steam Achievement really makes you want to play it again after finished at least for a grinding lover like me. - This game using Book for the story telling, so if you think you missed a bit you can re-watched it.The Bad :- No Fast Forward or skip Enemy Animation at their turn. So you need to watch them, it really boring if the enemy moves a lot.- Some abilities & commands just to IMBA at the end of the game. It really makes the game easier a lot.- Sometimes the character didn't shoot at the right target and it waste your turn. It really makes me rage load. Some Tips for play : (Imba buff) Use Alicia + Awake Potential + Defense Boost + Double Movement Potential  it will make you reach enemy base fast, and yeah i use it a lot and easy win lol xo  My Verdict :If you really like anime, tactical, war, and shooting its worth it to buy it at full price. :)If not just wait for the discount to play it.

												I was really on the fence about buying this game, but now that I have played it I understand why my friends keep talking about it. The storyline is enthralling, which would be enough to make it worth the meager 20 dollars required. But then the strategy makes it so much better. Its like a telltale game mixed with great strategy. I did not want to be wasteful and buy a game I would never play, and I would say this game was well worth the money. It does not have rediculous graphic requirements, nor should it. If you want a story driven strategy that is 10/10 great then you found it. Even if you are just looking around for any game then this one might turn you on to another genre entirely. 10/10 love it, never had a game move me this much, not even The Walking Dead(the Telltale series).

												This is a port of the wonderful PS3 action strategy game. But this isn't just any old port. This is a real-deal PC port. You want 1080p@60fps? You got it. Want it even bigger? No problem!OK, so settings aside, this game is really fun. It has engaging combat with memorable characters in a lore-rich (if not particularly original) story. This also includes all the DLC that was later released for the original PS3 title, which is a nice bonus.I would say that the best experience comes from using a controller with the voice acting set to the original Japanese. This game is pretty damn Japanese, but it's bearable in part thanks to its sketchbook-style art and fun gameplay.My one major gripe is that it is currently not possible to set any sort of anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering. It's not a big deal, but it would be nice to help smooth out the now high detail edges. Additionally, major cinematics are still from the pre-rendered PS3 version which is a bit jarring when transitioning between gameplay and watching something.In an ideal world, this game sells so well that HD ports are brought over of Valkyria Chronicles 2 (available only on PSP) and Valkyria Chronicles 3 (available only on PSP in Japan).

												Valkyria Chronicles is definitely one of my favorite games of the year, even though i never played the ps3 version i am enjoying the PC port a whole lot. This game is a strategy game which is very alike to XCOM enemy unknown. You get a lot of options when it comes to constructing your squad and how you would like to customize it in a similar, yet very different way from xcom. Likewise the combat system also has its similarities with xcom in the way that you move your characters forward shoot at something and have a % ofhitting whatever you're shooting at. That being said the two games are very different, for an example you have a map from where you choose which character to move and then move that character in from a 3rd person perspective. The combat system feels really challenging at times and you will see yourself redoing some battles more than one time. Even if this can make one quite frustrated it is not too difficult to come up with a new tactic so that you won't die in the same way again. I really enjoyed the way that it played and if you like other strategy games such as xcom or fire emblem you will probably like the gameplay of Valkyria Chronicles as well.Another big part in Valkyria Chronicles is Cutscenes and a whole lot of dialogue. In between every combat sequence there are usually a whole lot of dialogue and a cutscene or two to be had. That might be annoying for some since it's really one of the reasons why i like it so much but fortunately the cutscenes and dialogue are mostly skippable in case you dont want to see it or if you forgot to save or something like that. The artstyle of this game is basically your normal anime artstyle and i find it very pleasing. Since the game was made in Japan you also have the option to pick japanese as the voiced language in cutscenes and dialogue in case you enjoy your anime with subs. Did i mention that the game has full Voice-over for everything? The only problem i find with this is that the subtitles don't really match the japanese audio too well sometimes. It's more of a nitpick but it would be nice if they fixed it. Even if you dont watch anime or anime with subs you'll still most likely enjoy the game since the english voice actors are pretty good as well. The Story is also pretty good and it is set in a fictive world war 2-esque setting. I'ts not the best story ever but its still really good.Well what differences are there with the PC port and the game from 2008 then? The biggest differences are that you can run it in a better resolution. You got 4K no problem you can run it, however the character models  aren't updated so there might not be that big of a change. Other than that you mostly just have your standard options like Anti-aliasing and such. I had no problems at all running the game at 60 FPS in 1080 p even though it seems like some people dont seem to get it to work very well. On the other hand you should note that the in-game menus aren't mouse controlled you will have to control them with your keyboard. That being said it's not much of a problem and the battle sequences feature full mouse control, although you might have to fiddle with the mouse sensitivity a little. And for those who want to play it like the ps3 version you can plug in your ps3 controllers using better ds3 tool or something like it.Overall Valkyria Chronicles is a great strategy game with a above average story and a pretty lovebale artstyle. If you like anime or xcom you should buy this game its just 20 euro so what are you waiting for. If its on sale buy this game, come on what are you doing why haven't you bought it yet???. Don't however buy this game if you don't like strategy games or if you hate anime.			"

After doing my research, I found out that this was a port of the PS3 version, and then I was now under the impression that it would be a horrible port, but I was wrong. This game managed to surpass my expectations many times over. It manages to combine the elements of a third-person shooter with a turn-based strategy game rather well, and it is backed up by a well written story filled with likable characters. The only complain I have about this game are the the god-awful, f♥♥♥♥♥♥ tank controls! They always f♥♥♥ up my strategies every time I try to move them around the f♥♥♥♥♥♥ map!!

												My god is this one of my absolute alltime favorites. When I first heard about Sega porting this over to pc, it took me all of 3 seconds to preorder. This game has by far one of the greatest turn based systems I have ever seen and the port runs just as smoothly as the original console version. Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys jrpg's and turn based strategy.			"

												New review:Honestly, I don't know if I recommend this game or not. It has a lot of good things, but is has a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t too. The most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing are the invisible walls. I mean, If you shoot with a rock or a wall near where you aim, some bullets hit that obstacle, even when you clearly see that the bullet didn't hit them.Original review:It's like Fire Emblem with guns.The PC port runs great, you can use the mouse to chose the units and aiming... but you can't use it for menus. Why? It's stupid. Another thing that sucks is the UI. If you could use the mouse in menus it would fix this.Aside of that, the game is a great turn-based strategy game, where you select a unit and then control it, making it run, shoot or any other thing the unit type can do.This game is more forgiving than Fire Emblem in the permadeath topic. If a unit dies but you touch it, a Medic evacuates it so it doesn't die, but if the enemy touches it, hes dead. The good thing is that you level up the unit types, not the unit themselves, so if someone dies, the lost is not big, unless you liked that character.One think I don't really like is that you control the units more than you do in Fire Emblemm, and you depend more on luck here. For aiming you have on circle, and the bullet can go anywhere inside of it, so you may aim to the head but miss the shot. It's the worst thing in the game by far. It wouldn't be that bad if the snipers had a smaller circle and you could shoot rockets without being at 1 meter of the target. The enemies had this, so they can miss a lot too, but it still sucks. Later on you can upgrade your weapons, so they are more precise, but until then...Chpater 7 is cancer, but there are cheats avaiable.I recommend the game if you like turn based games and you don't hate anime.

												A fantastic turn based strategy rpg, fantastic game. With great characters, that you will really like. More then hard enough, But is fine that you can save in the middle of a mission unlike fire emblem. When ever you done with a mission you level up your classes and upgrade your equipment. I like the lore, or what there is of it , the weapon desription and so on. The soundtrack is great. The story is great and has some sad momoents. Yeah , highly recommended at least 9/10 if not even a bit higher, only grip i really have is some tank controls and that if you play to long you might need to take a break and head back to it			"

												I feel comfortable reviewing this based on my ps3 experience. It runs, looks and plays better than that version and includes all the dlc.    Now for the uninitiated, think xcom: enemy unknown, Advance Wars and Shining force combined into a psudeo realtime Fantasy take on world war II, complete with well written characters and lore. Valkyria chronicles is a classic not just because of it's story, which is as sober a take on war as you will find in all of gaming, or it's gameplay, which is a deep, varied and exciting take on the strategy genre which manages to be completely engaging and original. It's the fact that both elements are incredibly strong. it's a complete package, and something that will stick with you long after you've finished. Since this games succesful steam release, fans of the series are waiting for news of more Valkyria chronicles on steam and with good reason.			"

												Easily one of THE best porting jobs I've seen on PC in a long time.VC can be a challenging game (one of the earlier missions is obscenely difficult for where it is, but once you get past that it seems fine). If you've played Frozen Synapse you'll have a vague idea of how movement/combat works, but without the rewind mechanism - so it's important to get things right first try, because there might not be a second chance. With a variety of troop types and other mechanisms in play, the selection of your squad can mean the difference between victory and defeat, so the game has you on your toes from the start - and it's as unfair to you as it is the AI! The trick is in minimising the effects of the game's quirky approach to turn-based combat.It also has a reasonably interesting story, at least as far as this type of game goes, so that helps it be fun.

Posted: November 19, 2014
												This is honestly one of my absolute favorite games of all time. If you are a fan of turn-based strategy games, I would highly recommend giving this game a look. It offers a unique take on the genre with a combination of standard turn-based strategy and 3rd-person-shooter-esque gameplay, and it creates a beautiful world in which every single character (even non-story ones) has a unique personality and identity. The story is perhaps not the most revolutionary, but it is still compelling enough to keep the player interested until the end, and it creates a number of intriguing protagonists and antagonists. This is a game which may have flown under a number of gamers' radars when it came out on the PS3 in 2008, but it is more than worth a look for fans of strategy games. It's a fresh approach to the turn-based strategy genre and an overall beautiful game.Story-wise, the game is fairly decent, although it admittedly isn't exactly on the level of a BioWare game. The game is set in a fictional version of Europe in a small nation called Gallia which is caught between two warring super-nations to the east and west. Gallia is a neutral nation, but as it holds great mineral wealth the eastern Empire one day invades. You'll be leading a regiment of the nation's militia forces in battle to defeat the Empire, who are rumored to have a near-invincible mythical being known as a ""Valkyria"" on their side. There is heavy emphasis on the characters in the game, and although some of the character development is perhaps a bit predictable, the game does an excellent job of really bringing each character (even the minor, non-story ones) to life and giving them distinct personalities. So, the concept of the game: your role is to carry out the actual battles between the militia and the Empire. Battles are turn-based and proceed by moving your units one-by-one throughout the battle field. Where this gets interesting is in what happens after you select a unit on the overview map. Once a unit is selected, the game changes into a 3rd-person shooter: you will be able to move the unit in a 3D environment and must avoid enemy fire while moving into position to execute an attack. During their turn, a unit will only be able to move a limited distance (represented as the resource ""AP""), and they will get one attack per move, during which you line up their actual shot yourself. This may seem slightly strange, but once you play the first few missions in the game it will all make perfect sense. It's a battle system which is fairly unique in the world of strategy games and is executed very well. Perhaps the only thing I'd criticise is the inability to see a preview of some enemy positions on the map when you are choosing which units to deploy before a mission, but that's far from a game-breaking flaw. The mouse-and-keyboard controls are more than serviceable, and the game also supports using a gamepad, which may feel slightly more natural, but is by no means necessary to enjoy the game. Part of the fun of the game is in building your squad that you will be leading into battle. You can select from five classes of units in the game: scouts (high mobility but low power), shocktroopers (high offense but low mobility), lancers (anti-tank units), engineers (can resupply and disarm mines), and snipers (low mobility and defense but excellent range). You also have one tank in your squad, which you must keep alive at all costs (failing to do so causes a game over). Perma-death is a feature of the game (once a squad member dies, they're gone forever), so fans of Fire Emblem should feel right at home here. The game becomes a bit like an RPG by allowing you to hand-pick the units to use in your squad and how to upgrade their equipment and provide experience. Each of these units will have unique inherent characteristics (called ""Potentials"") which will activate during battle and either increase or decrease their combat capability in certain situations. For example, one unit may get improved attack when firing on a particular unit class, while another one might receive reduced defense when crouching behind sandbags, while still others may suffer a steady HP drain when in a sandy environment. These inherent qualities make you genuinely have to think when selecting the units to use in a mission, and they also do a very good job in bringing the characters to life and creating their own distinct identities even without them playing roles in the story. You can start to feel quite attached to the characters in your squad over the course of the game, particularly with the threat of perma-death looming in each engagement. You can also buy a number of upgrades for each unit class, including choosing different paths for weapons to be used by that class in battle. For instance, you can choose to equip one lancer unit with an anti-tank rocket, while another could use an anti-personnel mortar. Finally, when levelling up units in the squad, you level up entire classes at a time, which removes the need to babysit certain units to level them up (a la Fire Emblem). In terms of graphics, the art is absolutely phenomenal. Everything looks like a painting in motion. This is one of the first games I've seen that manages to make war look beautiful. The soundtrack does a very good job of bringing the game's world to life, although some of the tracks can become slightly repetitive. Still, it shouldn't really be a cause for annoyance, since the music is still quite good (composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, composer of the music in the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance series and for FF XII). Overall, the main campaign can take maybe 20-50 hours to complete, depending on how much time you spend customizing your squad and performing side missions for extra experience. For replay value, you are able to freely go back through the campaign missions after completing it once. There are also a number of side-missions (called ""Skirmishes"") which you can complete on various difficulty levels. The higher difficulty levels for skirmishes are also quite genuinely challenging, and give you a real sense of accomplishment when you complete them. So, my verdict. This game is a unique experience, and it's a very good strategy game which fully deserves your attention. If you are at all interested in turn-based strategy games, I completely suggest giving this game a try. I could not recommend this game more highly. I'm so happy that it's come to Steam since it didn't really get enough exposure on the PS3. So, would I recommend buying this game? 100% YES.			"

												Created by the team that made Skies of Arcadia, Valkyria Chronicles is a very unique SRPG that invokes the kind of creative spirit that was present at Sega during the years of the Dreamcast. The art style is like a drawing that has come to life and here on PC it is better than ever running at 4k really shows how beautiful the graphics are. It will no doubt endure long after all of today’s realistic style games start to look dated. The soundtrack by Hitoshi Sakimoto is just perfect. The game itself is a really interesting hybrid of turn based commands, real time movement/aiming, character management and a jrpg story. Squad members in the militia all have their own likes and dislikes that make them unique personalities (Vyse and Aika are among them) and which also have game-play repercussions in battle. In addition to this if a character dies they are gone for good which makes each encounter more tense and rewarding as you fight to keep every person from Gallia alive.The game originally released on the ps3 during 2008, unfortunately it was criminally overlooked despite being a critical success it was a commercial failure. The result was that the sequel moved to the Sony psp and the 3rd game? It was never released outside of Japan. Luckily the game is getting a 2nd chance here and it is a perfect fit for PC considering the success of things like Enemy Unknown.So if you like titles such as Xcom, Fire emblem, Final fantasy tactics or of-course Skies or Arcadia, then Valkyria Chronicles is the game for you.

I did not hesitate to buy it and nor should you if you like Japanese RPGs. Good story and gameplay, perfect with an Xbox controller. Only problems I have had is the game minimizing infrequently. Some DLC missions should have been intergrated into the campaign since doing them does not contribute to your experience or funds in the campaign (DLCs are accessed from Extras in the main menu).

												Great game.>Obviously beautiful artstyle and presentation. >Unique take on gameplay that proposes a blend of third-person shooter and turn-based strategy. >Awesome soundtrack; one of the few games where I actively go on YouTube out of the game to listen to the music.>Compelling story, even if it has it's fair share of tropes and cliches (but those aren't inherently bad; the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about cliches are critics. I encourage them to write a 100% original and revolutionary story).As for the cons:>An almost game-breaking bug in a mission where you have to scale a wall to destroy mounted cannons, there are ladders that you have to climb and the ones closest to the cannons make you fall through the map when you climb to the top. Thank god the ones further out work. Still annoying.>Besides the few set locations where you can crouch behind sandbags and in trenches, and going prone in grass, there isn't really a cover system. This stands out more in the city missions where, in other games where you can take cover around corners, is non-existent in this game. Makes me wonder why people compare it to XCOM in this regard.>Units don't really interact or support each other in any tangible way aside from either:A: Support resupplying other units with ammo as you walk near them, which refills after the enemy takes their turn anyway.B: Having the capacity to heal other units, but again every unit is capable of healing itself just as efficientlyC: Firing their guns at the target you're shooting at if you're standing close enough to them. Some units have different relationships with others, such as being friends with or being racist against, which affects certain attributes when in close proximity.And the biggest con in my eyes, and I'm sure in others' as well, is the broken beyond belief mission-ranking system that prioritizes sheer speed over anything else. This encourages the meta Scout rush strategy over any other strategy in any mission that requires the capture of the enemy base, which is a good 70%~ of the missions in-game minus a few huge story missions. I'm sure the devs didn't intend for gameplay to turn out this way, and if you play the game disregarding the scoring, it's extremely enjoyable. Unfortunately, the scoring also affects how much money and XP you earn to allocate towards troops and equipment, and missions are non-repeatable/non-radiant (which means no grinding), so it's sort of necessary if you want to get to the end-game weapons before New Game +. I guess the S rank stands for Sonic, considering both games are made by the same dev. The same dev that's autistic when it comes to speed.Regardless of how elaborate I was in my explanation of it's flaws, the pros are constant throughout the game and easily overshadows the bad parts. I give this game a 8/10, and being a console pleb that doesn't play PC often since I have a toaster laptop, this is one of my favorite and stand-out entries.			"

PROS: good/unique story,good gameplay, good love story, pleasing anime aesthetics.original japanese voice acting + dubbed voice acting available,  journal entries for characters places and weapons give the world depth,a lot of unique characters to put into your squadCONS: classes arent balanced, scouts are too useful and assaults cannot move anywheregame gives you less points than the number of characters you can move per turntactically its not really that deep(lack of options)the scoring system is based on how many turns it takes you to win. making cool strategic plays meaninglessall the characters are basically archetypes with not much depthlack of your regular squad members in cutscenes (if dead, chars could be replaced by generic militia in them)lack of information going into missions makes you go for pointless trial runs just so you know the map and enemy layout			"

												This is the reason why I felt justified in being an early adopter of the PS3, and it definitely still holds up after all these years. Valkyria Chronicles uses an interesting blend of real-time and turn-based strategy for its battles, and it works extremely well. Unlike games like X-COM, Valkyria Chronicles is more character-focused; each unit has a unique personality and you become attached to each one of them - it's quite a bit better than Fire Emblem's ""acquire-and-forget"" mentality. They all have strengths and flaws in the form of potentials.Also, the art style is great. I really can't recommend this game enough.			"

												I was not interested in this game. I don't like cartoonish style graphics and games that appear have a very simple plot. Nevertheless I've got this game as a part of a bundle and decided to give it a try simply due to community reviews.Honestly, I glad I did. Yes the controls are somewhat glitchi, yes, the story does appear to be simple, but, at the same time the game delivers a well balanced strategic element, but most importantly, when you read through the story and give it a though it draws very interesting parallels and observations.This is an interactive story with game elements (not the other way around) as it is the well crafted, even though simple story that wins you over.One Grumpy Russian score - 7/10 awwwwwwww, no vodka needed here.For more reviews join my group at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

												Valkria Chronicles is a game like no other. It successfully combines a historical fantasy setting with a deep strategic gameplay mechanic that while being multi-layered, is still easily accessible.The storyline is familiar (due to the obvious parallels to WWII) but still original and intensely rewarding.This was one of my favorite games on PS3 and the PC version is just as good and a fantastic bargain. Though the graphics don't really benefit from higher resolution they are still fantastic in style and presentation.			"

 Valkyria Chronicles TL;DR If you like turn based strategy games with a loose ""anime"" twist then you'll definitely get your money's worth!Things you should know before purchasingThe tank movement takes some time getting used to. Fuel can be drained VERY fast if you don't know what you're doing, leading to some frustration early on in the game.The levelling up system is a bit dry. You earn XP after each completed battle and choose one of 5 classes to allocate your gained XP to. That's pretty much it.Some maps favour certain classes/strategies far more than alternate playstyles.Late game: Scouts and Engineers become a bit too OP :pOutside of the main battles + skirmishes, there isn't that much to do. This is offset by a fairly lengthy storyline however.Driving over enemies with the tank does no damage to them? Wut? (This wouldn't even be OP if it were implemented so I have no idea why they didn't implement this.)What you can expect from the gameCompleting the main storyline A fun ~30 hours of gameplay + cinematics that doesn't feel like a grind.Completeing all skirmishesAbout ~15 hours of gameplay.Adding on the DLCAnother ~10-20 hours that is also very fun and fills some gaps of the main story line.Maxing all classes/weapons An extra ~10 hours of grinding that's not so fun but ahh well.Getting all achievementsAt least ~20 more hours of game time.OverallI bought the game at full price and was very happy with my purchase. If you like anime or are an occasional watcher of anime or if you like turn based strategy games then this is a must have title.Peace!			"

												Pros:Touches on issues not usualy examined in WW2 like games. Well built combat mechanicsInteresting storyCons:(my personal observation, may be different for others) The computer seems to bend the rules of the game slightly because it's a computer. For example, very rarely does the computer fire a shot that will miss. A sniper will spam body shots until your unit dies. Out of the blue, a tank on the other side of the map will somehow get line of sight on one of your soldiers, get a perfect headshot and kill them instantly with an Anti-Tank round, which would have had limited ammo. That is just not done in warfare. (picture me continuing this rant, I won't waste your time.)Some soldiers have metal alergies which cause them to lose health whenever they are near metal. I won't even start on how many problems there are with that. Nuetrals:There is a lot of down time between combat missions (like an actual military unit I suppose). This downtime is spent watching videos or clicking through visual novel type sections. Still a good story, but drags on a little. Interesting selection of soldiers, each with a different voice actor (so far) and personality. Some have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Some are perfect. There are also references to other games with the charcters (see Vice and Aika)Conclusion: You decide weather you want this game or not. I liked it myself (except for those tanks taking out my snipers in one shot. NO I WILL NOT LET THAT GO, NOR TAKE MY ANTI-PSYCOTICS!!!1!!!1@!14253$!@%$#^)			"

												At first I really enjoyed the game.  The battles are fun, and I enjoyed the strategy involved in completing a scenario.  Though I always wondered why I could never get an A rank, so I read some guides to see what I was doing wrong.  Turns out, speed only matters.  So all you really do, is take some scouts,  run up to everything, and shoot it point blank in the face.  Thats it.  Or have an objective you need to capture on the other side of the map?  Just run past everything with your scout, go to the objective, and shoot everything in the face.  A ranking.  It really takes the fun out of the game.  So I just play it how I want to, slowly and planned out.  I have more fun, but get less experience and money.  Which just means more skirmishes.  I'd recommend the game despite this.  It really is enjoyable when you dont worry about the rank after the battle, and I enjoed the storyline as well.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles.....To be honest i have never played a game like this befor. Sure i like anime and i have read/played some visual novels. But this .... Valkyria Chronicles ... its so good, so amazing so great! Im just ... omg! There should be more games like this. Anyways:If you like visual novel and or watching anime .... This is for you.If you like turn based 3rd person shooter .... This is for you.Thus being in an anime, partaking in the story and feeling as if your one of the crew, is just great.I highly recommend this game! I also recommend watching it in SUB not DUB (Go to settings and change audio to Japanese and add subs for those who dont understand Japanese)Cons:- Minor sound lag.- Minor aim issue when u get close and personal (use ur brain and its fixed).- Crashing upon exit (lol).- Limited saves, aprox 20 saves (ive used all the saves but tbh its easy to work around).- At a moment you will recive a vehicle (not saying what type and its prety much your main vehicle) during the ""Command Mode"" your vehicle will cost you 2 CP. Be warned when driving it at time you may loose your movments and not get anywhere. I recommend playing around with moving your vehicle so that you may understand how to move it efficiently.- If your a profectionist like me then you will spend alot of time reloading saves trying to get your sniper to do impossible shots, and making your troops move efficiently as possible.Enjoy!Side note:From the small research i did. I saw that it took over 8month to make and set the music for this game. From this i can make an educated guess that the game must have taken a year or more to make (only a guess i read some stuff from the wiki.). Thank you Sega for taking the time to make such a wonderfull game. :)			"

												The presentation and aesthetics of this game are simply amazing. It looks and feels like an anime, yet narrated like an audio history book. The vignette and color pencil filter also adds to the charm.The tactical battles are a little different than most, and not always in a good way, but overall the gameplay is very satisfying. The game rewards rushing 1-2 units behind enemy lines to capture points which is not what most strategy games promote. If you can get over this little weirdness, you'll enjoy this game.A lot of games have challenge scenarios that I normally just ignore, but the challenges in this game lets you unlock new weapons and gain xp/money for the main campaign, so I played them a lot more than I would have in other similar games. This adds a lot to the replay value and there's also a new game + mode. I normally only buy discounted games but I think this title is worth picking up at full price, If you see it on sale, and don't absolutely hate anime, then definitely pick it up.			"

												If you don't mind playing a strange and unstreamlined version of XCOM, the gameplay is for you! And really, the biggest problem with the gameplay is how slow and unintuitive it could be. (There's no way to quickly retry battles, for instance, and how to save within a battle takes a little bit of digging.) There's also a lot of... micromanagement--which may or may not be your thing--not only do you take your soldiers into battle but you have to train them, equip them, choose the ones with synergistic attributes, etc. The gameplay is not particularly remarkable but fun to play nonetheless.Story-wise, well, it's not amazing, either, but by videogame standards that translates into pretty good. There are moments which are surprisingly grippping but mostly it has a very campy charm to it. If you're a time-to-value gamer, expect a first playthrough to last 20 - 30 hours.			"

												It's a dieselpunk setting, with mixed WW1-interwar-early WW2 levels of development. They have superheavy tanks to put the Ratte to shame but flight is still in its infancy. Unfortunately, the storytelling ends up being typical JRPG fare and the  of the game kills any chance at a grittier, more realistic approach to storytelling that could have been done. A big disappointment to me, and I felt the same way about Shadow Hearts, taking an awesome, dark steampunk setting and turning itto to the usual save-the-world quest, as if people won't want to play it otherwise.

If you fall under that category, rest assured that the game is much better, the anime's storyline was butchered into a terrible adaptation.The game potrays Alicia (the main heroine) as a likeable character with clear motivations instead of as generic tsundere in distress.Gameplay is kind of like XCOM, turn based combat strategy. Graphics aren't as spectacular, but are uniquely appealing in their own right. Storyline of Valkyria is definitely better as well.A must buy for fans of Japanese games, support more SEGA games getting onto Steam! :P			"

												This game is by no means a masterpiece but it definitely gets close. The art may turn off some because ""hurr durr weaboos get out"" but the core of the game is still great. Strong gameplay mixed in with a good, albeit somewhat cliche, story and mixed in with so many characters that get fleshed out as you play. GameplayThe gameplay is a very unique mix of tactical shooter and rpg. It starts with a deployment team, letting you choose what kind of mix of units you want. The variety is pretty well balanced, with 5 units not including tanks. Scouts are capable of taking less damage and being able to move much more than the other units. Shocktroopers are the backbone of your squad, taking the least damage and holding the line. Lancers are the designated anti-armor unit, capable of destroying high threat targets with some support. Snipers are a coin toss. You either hit or you don't, but later on they bring some better numbers and become a vital asset. Engineers are crucial as well, being the only class to repair tanks which are your driving force of your squad.You get access to two tanks, one in the first half and another in the second half. The first tank acts as the main driving force of your squad, being able to take tons of damage and deal tons of damage. The second tank has the ability to change weapons according to what kind of battle will take play. More enemies? Flamethrower. More armor? Tank rounds. Etc.The enemy AI however suffers from some hiccups, sometimes moving back and forth without accomplishing anything or moving into enemy sightlines to be gunned down.And of course almost every attack is RNG based so some frustration will be an emotion present.Movement is very XCOM-esque, where in that game you choose a person and tell it what to do. In Valkyria Chronicles, you become the character and dictate every move it does. This allows for a ton of micro-management for hardcore gamers looking to break this game. There are also miscellanous things that make the game flow much smoother such as base camps. They allow you to withdraw and deploy squad members. This lets a sniper that was shooting from base to teleport to the new battle zone. Another thing is squad leader bonuses and attributes. Some characters, primarily the main characters, provide a bonus to your command points that let you make more moves with your units. Their lives are crucial in improving effectiveness of the whole squad. That said, the main characters have some of the most powerful traits, a concept I will talk about in a second, which means that you have to weigh the options and know when to risk one of these squad members or keep him/her back.An aforementioned mechanic is character traits. Each squad member has certain traits that let them perform better or worse. These traits are all pre-determined. This makes some characters much stronger than others in some situations. For example, there is a trait called Child of Nature. This makes some characters act better in places with more vegetation such as forests. It also however makes these characters weaker with paved roads, such as city fights. Mixing and matching these characters to fit your next battle is both challenging and fun.There are also abilities called orders, which can be used with command points. They grant bonuses, heal allies, and attack enemies depending on the order. These orders can turn the tide of the game and possibly save your allies. Some of the stronger orders, however, cost more command points meaning that your squad will be slow to advance.Overall the gameplay promotes strategy, tactics, and a little bit of luck to win through these fights. Many bonuses are offset with penalties, and finding the right balance is what makes this game so much fun.Plot/CharactersThe plot is basically this: An autocratic nation similar to Russia and a democratic collection of states are constantly at war with eachother, and the main character's homeland is independent. Mr. Fake Russia decides to attack your nation due to the high amounts of a certain resource in the nation's land. The plot overall is pretty fun and sometimes takes you deep into the meaning of war and such. It may come off as a bit pretentious and glorified in what happens but it's still a decent plot for such a good game.Every single squad member you can recruit has a personality, history, and relationship with others. The best thing about how they do the characters, is that they don't shove it down your throat. They don't tell you what happens to all of them in the main story. You have to look for it yourself in the logs of them. This makes it so people that don't really care can just focus on the main squad and the game, where others who are curious about the others can investigate their relationships. Their friendships with others even becomes a gameplay mechanic, where if you have someone who likes someone in close proximity, they gain a boost in stats. Which is pretty realistic imo.Also any squad member that isn't part of the main group can die and never be recruited again. This makes the management of each character's health pretty important in the game as to not sacrifice a certain strong character such as Vyse.MusicPretty good overall. Music is composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who has done scores for many games such as Finaly Fantasy XII, Tekken 6, and Final Fantasy Tactics. MiscellaneousThere is a choice between English and Japanese dubs for the game. English does more to give accents to some of the characters, such as giving an Irish accent to Catherine O'Hara. It's preference but it's nice that they give you an optionThe cutscenes are pretty nice for 2008. The visuals are akin to watching an animated water colored painting, resulting in some pretty unique and outstanding visuals.That said, however, some may see the colorful watercolor visuals as an affront to war games. The setting, if read without any visuals, is actually pretty gruesome in the amount of death that entails. The visuals sort of cushion that, letting people that don't like the tense and dark atmosphere of other games but still want a game like this. The camera is third person. While this isn't inherently bad it also sometimes makes some of the sightlines a bit wonky at times. There is also a skirmish feature which lets you go to previously played maps and play them out, earning money and experience points. They also cut out the dialogue making these games much faster.There are also two ""side campaigns"" in the game. One being Edy's Mission: Enter the Edy Detechment, which feels a lot more personal with the characters. Albeit it does not include the core members of the base game very much. It gives more character development with certain characters and provides seven more missions, the initial mission and the bonus six challenges that follow it. There is also a side campaign where you play the game as if you were in the position of the Imperials, named ""Selvaria's Mission: Behind Her Blue Flame"" It gives introspective on the Imperial's, and Selvaria's, thoughts during the war against Gallia. All of these missions also give something for the player in the main game, giving another incentive to play them out. Final ThoughtsOverall the game is very strong. Many critics give it the acclaim it deserves tbh. A fresh look on tactical squad shooters and a decent story, fitting music, massive amount of fairly well developed characters, and fantastic visuals for both its time and now. Its occasional stupid AI and my own frustration with this game make me give it a 9/10 "

												What XCOM: Declassified Bureau should have been, It's like playing XCOM, third person with constant overwatch and a really interactive shooting and positioning system. Even if you don't usually play strategy games, if you're into third person shooters and want to TRY a strategy game involving some aiming and actual thinking, then this game is a fun purchase that you won't regret.

												An intriguing tactica game buried in anime whining. Originally a ps3 exclusive for a long time but recently released on PC.When i played this on PS3 the load times and sheer number of cutscenes made it unbearable. With a good PC 6 years later the load times are minimal so the deluge of story is bearable between missions.Very worthwhile if you're bored with xcom at this price.			"

												Finally a great singleplayer game, this game made 2014 make a little better after all the s@#t that we saw.The Good+StoryThe story has a nice pace and keeps begging you to continue playing (after a session i looked at the clock and it was 2:00 AM O.o)There's action, comedy and drama. All used in the right time in the right place.It's kinda similar to WW2 but don't expect anything fancy such as Call of Duty, you are a comander that is just trying to protect your country and keep you and your teammates alive. I like to compare Gallia to Finland.  Why? Because both countries had to defend themselves against a bigger country with more military power (Finland defended against a USSR invasion in the Winter War and won).+CharactersNice character development, your squad becomes from people who couldn't understand each other to  a big united family. Unfortunately not all characters are shown in the cutscenes (only the main ones, the secondary units you can choose only appear in battle).But the characters that appear have their own unique personalities and traits.+GameplayIt can be difficult in the beggining since the battle system is different from other games, if you ignore the basics you will have your♥♥♥♥♥kicked. But once you understand the game mechanics the A.I. can be defeated easily (sometimes).I can compare it to XCOM: turn based, each unit can move for a limited distance and can only fire once. The only difference is that you have a X amount of CP at each turn, selecting a unit to control consumes 1CP point (2 CPs if it's a tank).There are missions that you'll say ""really?! That was easy!"" and other missions that you'll be sweating because the enemy has 3 tanks in your face.+GraphicsUnique artstyle. I'm happy that the developers tryed to create something unique and beautiful without trying to use super hyper mega ultra realistic graphics (I mean if you want realistic graphics, why not just go outside?)+SoundtrackNice. The right music in the right moment feels great.+BonusSEGA included ALL DLC that was released for the PS3 version for free, they could have been greedy like some companies *cough* EA *cough*.The not so good-RNG (random number generator)Sometimes the random values can ruin the moment. Ex: each weapon has a orange circle that represents where the bullets may hit, so you can get lucky and hit the headshots you need or the RNG will troll and 90% of the shots miss.-some bugsSome users reported some bugs that even prevents them playing the game, but that's only a minor part. If you find an issue go to the forums you'll find some people eager to help.			"

There is mouse support for aiming, moving cursors, and scroll wheel support for zooming in and out with sniper classes.Valkyria Chronicles is a great Real-Time Strategy Third-Person Shooter Hybrid game, and if you like deep story and emotional cutscenes, then this game is for you. (I played the PS3 version all the way through as well.)I just hope SEGA adds DLC that we can buy for the soundtrack, I'd listen to it for ages.			"

If you're an idiot, NO!!Edit: It appear the DLC is already inside the game, my bad.

												Valkyria Chronicles adalah game gabungan rpg dan turn based strategy. Game PC hasil port dari PS3 paling bagus yang saya coba.Cerita (9/10)Berkisah tentang Welkin Gunther, seorang pemuda Bruhl masuk menjadi anggota Tentara kerajaan Gallia. Kita tidak akan kesulitan memahami ceritanya karena game ini memang ditujukan untuk remaja (no blood, no head cut, no nude) namun tetap menarik dengan perpaduan cerita perang dan fantasi.Gameplay (8/10)Konsep turn based strategy di game ini cenderung membuat kita seolah bermain catur. 1 skirmish saja cukup membuat saya kesal & menghabiskan waktu seharian memainkannya. Saya pribadi cukup ketagihan dengan skirmish-nya dan penasaran dengan ceritanya.Setiap anggota skuad juga memiliki karakter khas yang memiliki nama, wajah, gaya bicara, kelemahan dan kelebihan masing2 (mirip skuad dalam tim sepabola). Anggota skuad juga bisa gugur dalam perang yang membuat mereka tak ada lagi dalam daftar skuad. Hal ini membuat kita harus hati2 dalam memberi perintah saat perang.Yang sangat disayangkan adalah gameplay yang linear. Seperti membaca buku cerita, kita hanya melihat cutscene, dialog, & perang. Uang dan exp langsung bisa didistribusikan di headquarter. Kita tidak bisa jalan2 di kota & bertemu NPC (namanya juga lagi perang :D).Grafis (7/10)Di saat kebanyakan game di era PS3 memakai konsep grafis dan tekstur yang realistis, VC memakai konsep 3D animasi namun yang unik adalah konsep semi lukisan dan bingkai putih seakan kita tengah melihat kisah dongeng menjadikan game ini layaknya sebuah karya seni lukisan yang bergerak. Sangat unik!			"

												Those who have watched the anime probably aren't too keen on getting this game. If you fall under that category, rest assured that the game is much better, the anime's storyline was butchered into a terrible adaptation.The game potrays Alicia (the main heroine) as a likeable character with clear motivations instead of as generic tsundere in distress.Gameplay is kind of like XCOM, turn based combat strategy. Graphics aren't as spectacular, but are uniquely appealing in their own right. Storyline of Valkyria is definitely better as well.A must buy for fans of Japanese games, support more SEGA games getting onto Steam! :P			"

I'd heard of the Series before but never really gave it the time of day, I regret that decision in hindsight as this game is fantastic. The only thing I would say is if you play above a 120hz refresh rate, the tank controls can get a bit wonky but with some clever mouse control things get right.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical RPG by Sega. More than that though, it's equal part game as it is story; half the entertainment comes from what happens outside of the battlefield.Unlike a game such as Mass Effect however where the story is driven by the player, Valkyria Chronicles takes a more classic ""Kinetic"" approach; there are no major decisions to make, yet watching the characters interact with each other in a Light Novel-esque approach definitely adds another layer to the game.There was clearly a lot of effort put into making the story what it is; there are mysteries, foreshadowing, drama and suspense at all turns. Even the way the game is presented - as a book where you flip from page to page to select episodes/missions - is well organized, and helps players keep track of what happened and when.But more than just the format, this is the kind of game where you start to grow for the characters. Not just the main characters either; there's a major involvement when it comes to selecting your squad. With dozens of members to choose from, even team members of the same class will not perform the same - they will have different likes/dislikes, different people they get along with, and different lines, somewhat in the vein of Fire Emblem. There is room for both the RPG fan who likes finding strategies and synergies, as well as the more casual RPG-er who wants to put together what is essentially a family. No, the secondary characters don't have many lines (there are dozens after all), but they each have their own touches that make them come to life; do you pick the character who has average traits (but gets boosts when near allies), or do you pick the character who has good traits (but hates your main character's guts)? Do you prefer the British sniper who provides boosts to her friends, or the lone huntress? There's a lot of fun to be had picking out your squad... and a lot of tearful partings, as it is possible to permanently lose your members in combat if they are not rescued after losing all their health.As a game, Valkyria Chronicles is both challenging and fun. However, there is such a thing as a ""right"" way to play, which is what prevents this game from being excellent. The issue stems with the ranking system; completing a mission faster means extra rewards which means less trouble further down the line. This makes it very tempting to 'save scum' before risky plays, as the game lets you save mid-game at nearly any point, including right before chance-reliant accuracy checks. This isn't helped by the fact that you CANNOT repeat Story Missions; if you lose out on the bonus experience of a high rank, you have to go and farm special skirmish battles to make up the difference. It is not that skirmishes are boring (some are quite fun), but no one wants to be pressured to do them because they missed a bit of EXP. You are also tempted to save-scum because you rarely know the exact layout of the battlefield beforehand; do you use your sniper? Can you even use one? If you have too many shocktroopers, will some get left behind on this map? The decision is a bit uninformed... unless you save right before deployment.The ""right"" way to play this game would be to adopt a 'try to save everyone' mentality. It gets very tempting to charge into gunfire when it is possible to restart at any point, but the game really is a lot more involved if the player is forced to carry out rescues over bad decisions rather than restarting before the decision took place. As well, players adopting this mentality should consider starting missions with underneath the maximum number of troops in order to call in what is needed further down the line; you can either take 5 turns to move a unit to the front line, or call them in halfway through the fight for two, for instance.Other than that one flaw of the ranking system, the strategy involved in planning out your advance is fairly solid. Not only that, but the game will throw some fairly impressive looking challenges at you, from open fields to towns to trench-filled war-zones, and it is easy to slip up. Yet there is immense satisfaction in winning; even getting a low ranking, being able to make it out rewards the player with more story and new ideas on how to approach different situations.Also, the game has a distinct lack of bugs. Grenades tend to go where you want them to, I've never had a scripted event occur incorrectly, and characters do not tend to get stuck in terrain or anything of the sort. Overall, it's a very well-polished and emotionally involved RPG; what is there not to love? This is a game that is definitely worth picking up at some point - to some, this game will be snagged at a 75% discount, but this is the kind of game you could justify biting the bullet and paying a little more for about 40 hours of good ol' strategy/RPG goodness.Alright, so maybe the main character IS a bit of a Gary Stu, and some of the plot twists are a little predictable. Despite that, many of the game's more emotional moments hit right on the mark, and many of the villains become quite interesting as the story develops. I'd be hard pressed to call it the best story evar (some characters could use a little more depth and there are occasional inconsistensies), but heck if it doesn't give you a little tug at times. If one does become a fanboy, there's an anime based off the game that follows a similar storyline to quell the hunger.			"

												Oh Sega. You have made a fantastic TBS game. To me, it's on par with Fire Emblem. Okay enough gushing for now. Best to give this a proper rub down.Pros:The first time you play this game [given if you don't skip the intro bit after the Sega Logo shows up] is that the art style that the game has is beautiful. It's like watching drawings come to life with how the effects work. If you ever get the chance, you could make a pretty awesome screenshot in the game that's wallpaper worthy for your computer. The story really gets to you as you play through it. You begin to form bonds with the cast of likable characters as soon as you begin playing the game, which is a great way to start any game. With characters in mind, you wouldn't believe how colorful they can be. You'd be surprised by some of them when you begin forming your version of Squad 7 when you, for example, pick a buff guy and heard his voice and personality shows he's more than meets the eyes. I'm looking at you Jann. Don't ever change. Gameplay's pretty good, save for one, but I'll get onto that later. It's a Turn Based Strategy game, but it has a bit of a twist. You select a character, and you go into third person with him/her and move them around, where which way you go and when has immediate consequences because you won't take back what you do, and the enemy [and your forces] will fire at the active soldier moves into range. This makes you really need to think about every move, or you will have a fallen ally on your hands. However, unlike the Fire Emblem games before Awakening, when an ally soldier's down, they don't die instantly. You can save them when an ally touches them before three turns pass. I loved that feature because I ALWAYS wanted to keep everyone alive. There's so many features that I loved about this game, but the good will have to end for now because of the...Cons:Back to gameplay, there's one feature I didn't like and that's the tank controls. I don't know if it could be the default controls for keyboard and mouse or what, but there were times where moving around makes it a struggle to get it in the right spot. It drove me nuts. The second, and last bad point is the music. Nothing seems to stick with me when I listen to them, but then again, it's my opinion. I bet there's fans that loves the music. [3/18/16: One song finally sticks with me. If you ever get the chance, listen to ""A Love Passed On""]Extra Bits: Now already, this game's a great game for those that love strategy games, and want a great story with great characters. What could make it better? The free DLC that comes with the game. You get more skirmish missions that focus on the various classes. A mission where you play as Edy's Edy Detactment, which is a pretty tough mission due to the characters you're stuck with. Some are great, good, or ugh... I'm looking at you Susie! You want a harder time? There's EX Hard Mode after you beat the game, which is really hard [which is a guess. I've yet to touch that yet. An update later?]. And for those that like to see the other side of a story, look at Behind Her Blue Flame, which you take command of the Selvaria's forces and learn more about her and her newest engineer.3/22/16: I got around with playing with the EX Hard Mode DLC, and here's the thing, it only counts for the Base Game's Skirmishes. After beating the game once, you unlock two more difficulties for the nine missions: Hard and Expert. Hard Mode, you're learn REAL quick that positions and/or the entire map gets altered. I bet with enough time and careful planning, you can clear it with no problem. Expert Mode kicks it up a notch and then some. First of all, You have no tank, which means Welkin will be on foot this time. This also means no Orders. It's just pure thinking and making each move count with this mode. Best of luck to you all if you play that mode and may the Valkyrur protect you.Final Thoughts: This is a must have if you don't have this game on PS3 or PS4 since it'll be getting a re-release as well, which is really neat. My only regret is that the series went onto PSP and we will most likely never see those games on Steam or the consoles. Then again, who knows what the future will hold.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles blends real time strategy with turn based tactics so well that it's basically a genre game of its own. It also has a highly unique story and setting that deserves much praise. The one area that I wasn't particularly fond of, however, was the extremely corny dialog in a number of scenes. Maybe that was to be expected, though, as this is a somewhat light-hearted anime that contrasts heavily with the dark overtones of war and deceit. The cheesy dialog comes in the form of in your face morals when confronted with growing friendships and relationships. Really though, it wasn't that bad, it just came off as super corny sometimes.Let's start with the story, the game is set in the 1930's in a fictional content called Europa (Europe) where an imperialist force (the East Europan Imperial Alliance) is attacking the Atlantic Federation. It's basically a fictional WWII, but here, it's called the Second Europan War. Well, the central character is Welkin Gunther, a citizen of the neutral country Gallia. Because of Gallia's abundance of Ragnite ore, which is the alternative fuel to petroleum, the Imperial Alliance attacks Gallia. Welkin, while visiting his home town of Bruhl, comes across Alicia Melchiott and find that their town is under attack. The two escape with several other civilians, including Welkin's sister, to the capital city of Randgriz. There, the pair join the Gallian militia and that's where the journey really takes off. Welkin becomes Lt. of Squad 7. The rest of the story involves militia based missions, including espionage, tactical operations, and full out war. It's really great. The story is amazing. And I really loved it.On the technical side of things, the game really is a tactical RPG, as you can level up the characters for more HP and what not, but it also employs what is called the Battle of Live Tactical Zones (BLiTZ) which is the real time strategy element I had mentioned. During battles, you have an overview map where you can view your characters' placements. When you select a character for movement, you transition to a third person view where you can traverse the map for a duration of how much AP you have. In the map, you can take cover, climb ladders for better views, prone around in grass to hide, and, of course, battle enemies. When you battle enemies, you freeze time, allowing you to aim, much like VATs in Fallout 3. All of these aspects are what make this game so unique. It's a tactical game truly like no other and another reason why I love it so much. Which leads me to the graphical side of things. Being an anime game, don't expect super realistic graphics, but allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised, anyway, when you see the detail put into the buldings, tanks, outfits, geography, etc. It's a very good looking game, and ported to PC with full HD resolution, the game looks absolutely fantastic. This is a great port. And a truly amazing game. What keeps it from being perfect is just my disdain for some of the cheesy/corny moments; like the pig you rescue that joins your squad. Like... okay.One last thing before I finish my review; this game can be really difficult. I mean, you really have to strategize and allocate your team to positions that favor winning. The slightest mistake or allowing an ally in your squad to stand out in the open could lead to their death. And if you make that mistake often enough, it'll mean losing the battle. There are probably 5 or 6 battles that I found really difficult and was frustrated throughout, but I eventually prevailed.9.5/10			"

												It took a lot of effort from me to uninstall this because I couldn't stop playing. It gets a tick in every department I can think of- gameplay, story, characters, art style, presentation, soundtrack etc. I like the refreshing take on tactical turn based gameplay done in real time 3rd person, allowing you to move, shoot, heal etc. There are other factors involved too which gives this system some good complexity and really spices things up. The story is simple on paper like most things out there but it's what happens along the way which keep you engaged. I felt attached to all the main characters in this and I really liked how the game explored these people's personalities and journeys, offering some really good character development and interaction. The only issues I have with the game is that there is a lot of dialogue at times (like how there is always a conversation at the start of a battle) and watching everything the enemy does in their turn can feel like a drag and overly long at times. This could be rectified by having a ""rush"" option some games have which fast forwards their moves at a decent rate. Other than that however, I'm REALLY satisfied with the game overall and it's definitely one of my favorite games of all time. I thoroughly recommed getting this game, which was originally a PS3 exclusive so you should be thankful for something like this happening as console exclusivity is moaned about a lot.All in all, this game still satisfied me in every way possible. Definitely an unforgettable experience and one of my all time favorites.			"

												In principle this game has everything you want in an JRPG. It has a beautyful artstyle. It all looks like a painting, with all the little girls looking great and so cute with their big eyes. The strategy is turn-based. This is how I like it and how it should be. But enough about the minor details and talk story. The story touches all the important bases for a JRPG. It is bubbly and upbeat, with lots of romances; with the main one between Welkin and Alicia. In addition, there is a cool bathing suit scene which I very much appreciated. Moreover, there is some light bondage and torture fanfic which fits nicely in the story and doesn't feel tacked on. In the end you save the world and get the girl, just like in all my dreams. This makes the game great but not perfect.There are however some gripes I have with it. Really missed the tenticles. There were many scenes which could be improved by it. For instance when the tank went through the river, Isara could have been fondled a bit by a sea tentacle. Another thing is that quite some backstories of the girls were lacking a bit. Dallas was into girls, but I never got to see her making out with for instance Susie, which would have been epic and sexy. Another problem is that the control scheme makes the game hard to control one-handed. You need to use WASD to go through menus and press the mouse button to select. Very annoying and this gets you out of the game.In conclusion, I rate this game a 8 out of 8:::::::D~~~Please read my Sonic fanfic on deviantart. Username: xxXSonicAssXxx. 911 was an inside job.

												This game has the most awkward fun curve that starts at the very bottom then spikes straight up towards chapter 8-9.  The beginning of the game, I thought this game was a strategy game with RNG, which is a terrible idea, but once your characters begin to rank up and you start increasing in accuracy, its more about positioning and unit management.Now I'm losing sleep.  Thanks for that, SEGA.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a game that I didn't expect to like at first. I was worried it was going to be too silly, that it was going to be over-the-top. It had been a while since I had really enjoyed a Japanese RPG style game as much as I had done in the late 90s. But this one surprised me. First, I'll mention some of the negatives. There's this one character who always has one eye closed and it really bugs me. There is a supporting character that is a small pig with wings. There's some fan service bits. It's occasionally very difficult. It's unplayable and ridiculously cheesy with the English voice acting (in my estimation). There are many positives. I like any game that enables me to form a team of distinct people from a large number of options (in this sense, it scratched my Genso Suikoden itch). It means that, while there are some characters that aren't to my tastes, unless they are part of the main cast, I don't need to suffer them. The characters I put in my team become heroes in my own mind, as I recall times in which they've saved me from almost certainly having to start a level from the beginning again. There is an extensive cast of female characters, with a diverse range of personalities and appearances. It's also worth mentioning that there are quite a few LGBT characters in the game, but they aren't particularly well represented in some cases. The game does have an anime style, but it's very subdued--everything from the colour palatte to the behaviour of the characters is mostly just a bit less in your face than what I've come to expect from modern anime things. The combat system is fairly intuitive and it can be very satisfying when you've developed a strategy for defeating a level with little to no casualties. The psuedo-European setting is a pull for anyone with an interest in historical things. All the details about guns and tanks will no doubt be of interest to people with certain inclinations. The story isn't amazing, but it's simple, and it's effective (and sometimes affecting). It touches on some delicate issues such as racism and slavery, and isn't too tacky about it. Soundtrack is also very nice. I was so involved in this game for a few months, I went to a themed cafe when the remaster came out on PS4 and there are really chunky art books to buy that flesh out the story, characters and development process. It was a good time.			"

												The critically acclaimed PS3 title 'Valkyria Chronicles', inclusive of all DLCs, was ported over to the PC by Sega and released on the platform late last year. It is a turn-based squad strategy game incorporating strong flavours of a third-person shooter. The game is set in a neutral and non-partisan fictitious small country, Gallia, situated in the continent of Europa. The land is rich in the mineral ore Ragnite, a much sought after ingredient due to its vital properties that see it being used both as fuel and medicine. The Empire, an alliance of autocratic Eastern Europan nations, declares war on The Federation, an alliance of democratic West Europan nations, to kick-start the Second Europan War (EWII). The Empire has its sights set on Gallia's ragnite rich deposits.You play as Welkin Gunther, a Gallian and son of celebrated war-hero, General Gunther, as you command a troop of organized Gallian militia soldiers known as Squad 7 whose job is to thwart The Empire's advances in Gallia. During the course of the playthrough you command foot soldiers and tanks as you set forward to complete objectives and, thus, win battles in the process. The game is divided into chapters which is further sub-divided into small episodes. First things first, the game is gorgeously good-looking. The art-style is inspired by Japanese animes while the visuals are unique, feeling as though the entire game is a sharp watercolour painting brought to life. The game has five combat Classes; namely Scouts (Rifle), Shock Troopers (Infantry), Lancers (Anti-Tank), Engineers and Snipers. In addition, you also get to control Commanding Officer Welkin's tank. All equipment is upgradeable, relying on XP points which are gained as missions are completed. The Combat system is an amalgam of turn-based and third-person elements. You deploy a squad of your choice and each time you click on a squad member, the camera pans to third-person and he can be moved to an appropriate place. The camera then swings back to the bird's eye view of the map allowing you to plan your next move. Combat is challenging and is easily the best part of the game. Level environments are well-designed and test your strategic skills to the hilt.The game's setting is inspired by real-life incidents, with a mix of fantasy and fiction elements thrown into the mix. The plot is, frankly speaking, nothing to write home about. It's B-grade anime with trope characters and a cliched predictable story. There are a few instances in the game where the plot impresses but, highly unfortunately, those are few and far between.I really liked the game. The war-setting negated some of the cheesy anime moments and the combat was fun and challenging. I'm glad Sega ported this over to the PC. Valkyria Chronicles is a definite recommendation from my side, if just for a refreshing change of art-style and grueling turn-based gameplay.			"

												The game is great.  Graphics are fantastic even all these years later, characters are very endearing, the story backdrop is an anime parody of WW2 pretty much, which doesnt detract at all.  Main story gameplay feels a bit scarce between all of the cut scenes, however, cut scenes are very well done.  However, at the end, the story goes almost full anime on you.  Including massive glowing swords, over emotional expressions and giant robots.  This may turn many people off, especially if you are just playing it for the WW2 aesthetic.  However, this only takes place briefly at the end of the game and doesnt really deter your gameplay much.Pros:  Amazing Art styleEndearing CharactersGood storyGameplay is unique and very strategic (though bugs will haunt you from time to time)Cons:Heavily anime inspired endingIn the end, amazing game.  Buy it.  Play it.  Love it.  But dont look for sequels.  2nd one came out on the PSP and graphics are aweful, though gameplay is still solid.  3rd one is just anime to the core, swords everywhere.  And the next coming out appears to be the same way.  So there is no other game out there on an accessable platform like this. Not sure if that is a good thing, or bad thing.  Let me reiterate for people who didnt bother reading this :  DONT LOOK FOR THE SEQUELS, YOU WONT LIKE WHAT YOU FIND. BUT BUY THE GAME.  IT IS GOOD.			"

												VC originally came out on PS3 in 2008. It comes from the relatively rare genre of turn-based strategy. FOr those who enjoyed the Front Mission or Final Fantasy Tactics, VC should also be enjoyable.   My favorite aspect of this game is the graphics, which are meant to look as though they are drawn in colored pencil. The storyline is somewhat like a Miyazhaki movie, in the sense that it takes place in a fictitious 20th century Europe. There is of course the obligatory evil Empire, and the less evil tiny country simply trying to survive. Like  Final Fantasy and many other console games over the last 15 years, it is rife with cutscenes. I chose the Japanese audio, so I don't know what the english audio sounds like.   The game play, while not exactly innovative, is still entertaining, and requires a lot of critical thinking on thge player's part.  "

												New and stunning graphics in a traditional water-painting art-like! Unique gameplay that combines real-time strategy and turn-based strategy! Enjoyable story that tells you in a form of a storybook that even rivals against other well-known anime! This is just too good to be true!Well, that's the good part but wait until you start playing the game because you need a lot of practice and probably 'trial and error' before progressing to a stage by one by one because how you plan on your tactics and deployment in each battlefield are vital to the gameplay. If you make one small mistake, it's over! You either must improvise carefully or give up and retry! So while the difficulty is very challenging at first, you'll get used to it later on.So, in conclusion, I would call this a masterpiece for a PS3 game in its time, ported to PC! The gameplay takes on a slow approach but you can finish a level earlier if you really know what you're doing. How you will enjoy this game is very different from other RPG games and that's new but you have to be a very skillful strategy player to fully enjoy this game without feeling frustrated.			"

												A very good example of turn-based and real time strategy hybrid, I definitely recomend this game to fans of the genre.+ Combat mechanics are unique and works really well.+ English voice acting is really good.+ Story is a little cheesy but it will carry you to the end.+ Lots of side quests, upgrades, skirmish battles, cutscenes.+ There are tanks! With tons of upgrades!+ Nice anime style graphics.- Cutscenes can be a little cheesy and cringy.That's all. Thanks Sega for bringing this game to Steam.EDIT: People are upset about the rating system in the game. They're right but I didn't care about it, I didn't let it tell me that I sucked even if it was an epic experience. I've never seen a Japanese game with a proper rating system, they all suck and will frustrate you. Just ignore it and game will become a lot better experience.			"

												I have nothing but good to say of this game. Runs perfectly on my PC, in great resolution. Perfect controller support, and a surprising emulation of the PS3 save screen. Sega should release the other games on steam, and for 5 bucks on sale IT SHOULD BE A CRIME TO SELL THIS GAME THAT LOW.			"

												This is a hidden gem. Tactical X-com style combat with Japanese animation characters, the difficulty can be quite high.You'll be surprised to see how you end up being emotionally involved with your soldiers.Each of them has specific individual traits, adding some finesse to the management of your team choices at the start of each mission.Achievements are really tough to unlock and for the completion freaks out there the unlocking of all scenes, inventory, and skills will require dedication!Strongly recommended.

												Valkyria Chronicles is one surprise after another. I for one did not expect to be hooked into this game within a few mins of the story unfolding. The story is outstanding with great character development. Many feels are held within this title. One that will not be forgotten for some time. With that being said, the art style of the game is unique as is rarely done with many AAA titles today. Which adds a unique feel to the storyline and how everything plays out. There are many great things about this title that I love. However, there are some things that are somewhat troublesome from a Console (30 FPS) port to a PC (Limitless FPS).This was of course a PC port from the console version that was release quite some time ago, and is a pretty well done port to say the least. However a few things I have to nag on. 1.	Poor Cut scene quality: Most of the cut scenes in the game are at their native created resolution from when the game was developed at 720p. This makes it somewhat unbearable when it comes to monitors that have standard 1080p or even higher. If it weren’t for the development for the story, it can be eye straining after a few hours. 2.	FPS Bugs Galore: This game is somewhat based on animations keyed on FPS. Seeing as the base game and all the animations were based on the console maximum 30 FPS, increasing the FPS to today’s standards of 60+ on PC and you start getting animation glitches and gameplay altering problems that make the game somewhat more aggravating. For example, Im running at 144hz meaning my fps will be 144 or higher depending on Vsync options. Characters will speak, turn their heads in response then “immediately” snap to another direction. This is not a game breaker but can be somewhat irritating if you’re trying to figure out what the character was trying to do. This issue persists on any FPS higher than 30. Another problem with that is that Tank movement and other “Gun Emplacements” or enemy tank fire will result in an instant death in almost any instance. Since the game is FPS action based. A machine gun from a tank firing say 7 rounds on 30 fps would practically double or even triple to 14 or 28 shots in the same given time if it were fired at 30 fps. Tanks will sometimes even snap and spin in circles due to the increased fps. This makes the later missions almost impossible as turrets snap and fire faster than miniguns at your characters or the scripted movement of a tank that ""has"" to get somewhere simply cannot due to overcorrection sometimes leaving you having to alt f4 as the turn will never finish. Overall the game is great, with a few PC port issues, it is definitely well worth every penny if you are one that loves great stories, in a anime looking environment. Many feels in this one. Of course, there is an official anime based on this game as well, that you should check out if you end up beating it and need more Valkyria Chronicles. ;)			"

												It took me quite a bit of consideration if I wanted to recommend Valkyria Chronicles or not. It does some things well, but it is far from the ""masterpiece"" many people label it as, because the gameplay feels just too flawed for me.I know that there's always a bit of randomness in this kind of game, but here it doesn't make any sense at all. Why would a tank miss a huge target right in front of it? Why are enemies still damage-protected through ""crouching"" or ""crawling"" when I'm standing right next to (or even behind) them without any obstacles in between? And why is neither Welkin's mortar nor artillery order able to destroy sandbags (or ANYTHING at all, actually)?  Such a lack of logic (not realism) shouldn't exist in a good strategic RPG in my opinion. Bugs like orders that sometimes just won't do anything, or getting stuck in the flagpole of an enemy camp (that only happened once though) certainly aren't helping either. Also, from chapter 7 onwards the difficulty is spiking up and down incredibly, which is why I found myself in the situation of breezing through one battle (like the final boss aswell btw, who was a joke) and almost getting stomped in the next over and over again.  This and the fact that the game explains too little or sometimes doesn't bother at all can lead to quite some frustration, especially if you aren't experienced in this genre.So, TL;DR, I don't really like the gameplay of Valkyria Chronicles. And still I gave it a positive rating. Because what saved this game for me was basically everything that didn't involve actually playing it, as strange as it may sound. The visual style is cool and feels pretty unique, the music is great, and a very likable character cast made the story quite emotional at times and, most importantly, really enjoyable. I love games that are story-driven, so that actually makes a real difference for me.Still, I'm disappointed. Maybe I had the wrong expectations, maybe they were just too high after all the critical acclaim. It feels like there is a lot of unused gameplay potential left in this concept, and I'll definitely play Valkyria Chronicles 2 someday to see if they improved on it. Don't get me wrong, I can see why people like this game. But I honestly don't understand why they praise it as much as they do. "

												I bought this for PS3 when it first came out and played through it several times. It is a timeless classic, definitely worth playing. The unique art style holds up and looks great even so many years after it was first released. The gameplay is a unique blend of SRPG and real-time action, and it has X-COM style unit interaction with research, perminant death and experience upgrades.I hope Sega considers releasing the sequels for PC as well. There are good games, there great games and there are special games which you will always remember, even years after you have played them. This is one of those games.			"

												I'd like to say that while the story isn't the most original thing out there, it's still fun and moderately entertaining. The art style is extremely unique and satisfying, and leaves nothing be desired in that regard. The gameplay itself is awesome if you're a fan of turn based strategy. I'm coming from a HUGE fondness of XCOM, Front Mission, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc... and this game is in a similar vain.While there are certainly deeper strategy games out there, this one achieves an awesome balance of playability, challenge, and novelty.

												Could this be the best optimized pc port ever? Looks gorgeous, runs at 60 fps on a toaster and saves so fast I have to double check it did it, every time. I don't even think they put effort into it, it's just the engine. I've owned this game on console before and played it to completion, so I'm actually at least 60 hours in. I just took the opportunity now to buy it during a sale. It's a steal at $5. It's good. Very good. It's the kind of game that, because what it delivers is so unique, you can forgive it for its flaws. Said flaws will not prevent you from enjoying the game, far from it, but they will probably deter you from delving into the combat mechanics too deeply. If you look at them too close, you might find them a bit shallow. But if you aren't used to strategy games, it will be challenging and fun. What it lacks in depth, it makes up for in character. Don't let the anime style put you off. There is little to no shameless weeb pandering, and both the JP and English audio tracks are excellent. I am using a DS4 which worked without issue, and that's because I'm used to playing the game with a controller on console, but the mouse and keyboard controls are superb. On the other hand, controller is excellent too, because that's what it was designed for. There is aiming in the game, with crosshairs, but it's only rudamentary and not time-sensitive.You should buy this game in a sale, get comfy, and prepare for a cliche story, endearing and memorable characters and some unique gameplay.

												Oh dear lord the bugs in this game...  But the game is good enough that i am reccomending it anyway despite the bugs. I will try to highlight a few of the major ones in hopes that whoever reads this review will be able to circumvent them. First off know that this is a port from console > PC and because of this the engine is wonky. The game is meant to run at 30hz/fps so if you run it higher then that things start to break/not work. For instance in one of the final leves there is a ramp that if you are running over 60fps you literally can't go up it. This effectively breaks the game...Sandbags... oh dear god the Sandbags they are so difficult to move around/over and things on the other side of said sandbags like dead bodies can prevent you from being able to go over them....   Not only the glitchyness to them but they pretty much make NPC's immortal while ducked next to them even if there on the wrong side of the bags...Tank movement.............................*whimper*  You will waste so much AP(movement points) Just trying to figure out how to move around in the tank. Let me help you out here, The tanks movement controls are entirely camera based. whatever way the camera is facing if you press W it will go that way, A is left of the camera, D is right of the Camera and S is to the rear of the camera direction.  Since the camera changes direction so too do the controls... constantly... Tank movement Cont.  Then there is the pebbles/ditches/holes/flowers on the ground that will completely screw you over.  I once was moving my tank forward hit a pebbly my tank did a 180 faster then you can blink and ate all my AP so I couldn't fix it. In this game the rear of your tank is a giant glowing weakspot, hitting it is almost always a one shot kill. Suffice it to say my tank went boom shortly there after...Covering fire/Cross Fire... So in this game while you are moving/aiming if an enemy is within range he will take shots at you as you cross an alley or try to get to cover. The enemy literally spams this for days, however the Computer is almost completely immune to Covering fire/cross fire because it exploits the poop out of the game. The covering fire stops when you initiate an action then continues after the action and stops again when you say your done with the unit. The computer completes all the actions at once in some type of batch command and usually only gets like a .25 second time frame of which he can be shot by covering fire. The rare situtations when the computer can be hit by covering fire usually involve them traveling a very large distance in one go. The controls are obviously made for console, but whoever ported the game did a fairly good job of converting them to pc standards. Now for the reason I still reccomend this game even over some of these terrible glitches. The story is great 10/10Game Mechanics 8/10Cute Girls with machine guns 10/10 =)Interesting Characters 9/10 Dude with one eye always closed even though it works fine 10/10Anime style, can change audio to japanese and put on subtitles 10/10 "

												This game has the most awkward fun curve that starts at the very bottom then spikes straight up towards chapter 8-9.  The beginning of the game, I thought this game was a strategy game with RNG, which is a terrible idea, but once your characters begin to rank up and you start increasing in accuracy, its more about positioning and unit management.Now I'm losing sleep.  Thanks for that, SEGA.			"

Valkyria Chronicles definitely needs to be part of your library if you’re into strategy games. Even though it’s a well-known title, it’s certainly deserving of praise. Plus, I don’t usually get the chance to play good games on the show, and this is an all-around good time. It borrows some ideas, this is certainly true, but it also innovates on them and introduces ideas of its own, and produces an experience that I’m going to remember, and come back to for a good long while. It’s got high-marks all around, and I recommend it. A-stars. Other buzz words indicating you should play it.			"

												It took a lot of effort from me to uninstall this because I couldn't stop playing. It gets a tick in every department I can think of- gameplay, story, characters, art style, presentation, soundtrack etc. I like the refreshing take on tactical turn based gameplay done in real time 3rd person, allowing you to move, shoot, heal etc. There are other factors involved too which gives this system some good complexity and really spices things up. The story is simple on paper like most things out there but it's what happens along the way which keep you engaged. I felt attached to all the main characters in this and I really liked how the game explored these people's personalities and journeys, offering some really good character development and interaction. The only issues I have with the game is that there is a lot of dialogue at times (like how there is always a conversation at the start of a battle) and watching everything the enemy does in their turn can feel like a drag and overly long at times. This could be rectified by having a ""rush"" option some games have which fast forwards their moves at a decent rate. Other than that however, I'm REALLY satisfied with the game overall and it's definitely one of my favorite games of all time. I thoroughly recommed getting this game, which was originally a PS3 exclusive so you should be thankful for something like this happening as console exclusivity is moaned about a lot.All in all, this game still satisfied me in every way possible. Definitely an unforgettable experience and one of my all time favorites.			"

												What can I say?If you enjoy the story aspect of games, and I mean REALLY enjoy it, than Valkyria Chronicles is for you. A bulk of the missions are actually brief episodes advancing character development and plot; to me, that's what really sets this game apart from the rest. Sure, the turn-based / over-the-shoulder shooter aspect of the game is creative and expertly done, but while the mechanics of the game are phenominal they are also overshadowed by what I believe to be one of the best narrative experiences on the market. It can get a little corny here and there, but Valkyria Chronicles easily made its way into my heart and my top games list. 9/10			"

												This is a highly polished, turn-based strategy rpg.  The story is great, and it's easy to become attached to the main characters, and to become invested in their struggle.  I'm a huge fan of the animation style, which reminds me of Wind Waker.The combat is highly tactical, and it's a lot of fun to plan out a strategy and carry it out successfully.  Each turn, there is a limited amount of commands to give out to your soldiers.  You have to decide who to move where, and whether or not they should attack an enemy unit.  You have to carefully plan when to be safe and when to charge in.  You are quite often at a disadvantage in numbers, so your strategy must be superior to the enemy's strategy. "

												This is a title that was the tipping point to cause me to purchase a ps3 many years ago. There are very few games in which I think every aspect of the game is done well. I'm more of a guy who enjoys gameplay over some deep story but Valkyria Chronicles is one game that stuck out in my mind. When I had first played the game I certainly got a lot more out of it than I had anticipated. Every character is unique and memorable and as you progress through the game you end up growing very attached to squid members that aren't present in many of the game's main cutscenes even. The difficulty curve is pleasant if scouts aren't being abused and all makes sense and flows very well. Leveling up units is done in such a way you can constantly be using differet characters and not be left behind as classes are improved as a group as opposed to the individual characters within those classes.Kudos to the team that ported this game to PC. The game supports any 16:9 resolution and refresh rate so long it is supported by your monitor. Not only that but the game itself is not too demanding. I've heard it can be played comfortably on integrated graphics cards even. I have been playing the game at 4k downsampled to 1080p at 60fps and have experienced no slowdown so far on my GTX670. The fact the game will button labels depending on if you are using a controller or keyboard+mouse is a very nice touch. Also I'd like to point out the fact that the game has achievements blows me away, as the original title did not even have trophies on the PS3. The price is also very agreeable. I would have paid 60$ for this title again as it is one of my favorites of all time but the price point it is currently at is very much worth it. I believe I got around 20 hours on the main game alone wwhen I played it the first time on the PS3.I'm still working through the game right noiw and loving every moment of it :)TL;DR Buy this game now.

			War is HELL, FIRE, AND- Oh are we just going to the beach? I mean, that's cool too. It's Season Two of GC Positive! Today GC gussies up for the Valkyries and learns about sad stuff!		

Valkyria Chronicles definitely needs to be part of your library if you’re into strategy games. Even though it’s a well-known title, it’s certainly deserving of praise. Plus, I don’t usually get the chance to play good games on the show, and this is an all-around good time. It borrows some ideas, this is certainly true, but it also innovates on them and introduces ideas of its own, and produces an experience that I’m going to remember, and come back to for a good long while. It’s got high-marks all around, and I recommend it. A-stars. Other buzz words indicating you should play it.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is among the most sombre jrpgs I've ever played. It's not depressing, but it is muted, by jrpg standards. Its characters speak in a constant concerned tone, even in moments of victory. The number of anime cliches it borrows can be counted on your fingers. Its colour pallett consists almost entirely of gun metal grays and desert sand browns. Its humour is often matted in irony, like Alicia's allusion to draft dodging every time she activates her ability Undodgable Shot - ""Don't even think about dodging!""Despite that, Valkyria Chronicles has a certain vibrance to it. The character design is where most of the charm comes from. To put this into perspective, Edy is a character with not even one line of dialog in the plot who is subject to permadeath if she goes down in battle and is one of over 30 avaliable characters you can have join your squad. Edy got her own DLC. That's honestly just how charming the average character is in this game - they don't all get their own side stories, but they could. Almost none of them look like capable soldiers, but that's all part of the story. Keep in mind this all takes place at the tail end of the war.Once you take control of your soldiers, you've got a blend of turn based strategy games and a real time tactical shooter, the type where you go down in one or two shots if you get spotted. Since every unit in the game is ranged, most of the strategy revolves around finding cover and cutting off the angles so that the enemy can't advance. Valkyria Chronicles is at its best when, in the course of a larger battle, you're forced to hold a position until you can eek out an advantage by diverting the enemy's attention or landing a decisive blow. Occasionally it shoehorns you into these situations rather than letting them happen naturally, and these missions are a drag. It's also got a few battles that are overly scripted for story reasons which are too linear to really be called strategy, but there are a few scripted battles worth remembering, too.			"

												Hands down one of the best games ive ever played, just buy it, i could point out some flaws of the gameplay, like how some of its mechanics is a bit exploitable and unbalanced, but the entire package wins out anyway. It's a japanese rpg game ported to the pc from the ps3 platform done in english version (but still has the japanese dub and va option), and it's a unique type of strategy turn based game that also implemets third person shooter type action, i played it and boom insta fav, addicted almost nonstop a week straight playing only this game. The story is fantastic and the characters are as vibrant as it gets, also you get to manage your own squad as the lieutenant of your team, and you get to pick your own troopmates, each having it's own different classes, and upgrade their weapons and potentials, you also get to control tanks and stuff, so if you're a war gaming fanatic, then this is another reason for it to appeal to you and those type of audiences.Overall rating it now: 10.5/10 yup, deserves it, lovin it, Vyse City OP!!

												- Battles lack a ""resign"" button and for some reason it's impossible to access the system menu during the enemy's turn, which sometimes is infuriating when all you want is to restart the mission instead of waiting the enemy's turn to pass.- There's no way to delete a save file in game, which is weird.- It's too easy, even in harder levels. Once you learn how to beat the mission, it will never again be a challenge.- Ranking system favors speed over quality. It's hard to feel motivated to complete a mission advancing all my characters carefully for a C rank, when I could just issue a couple of orders, rush my scout through the level and beat it in 1 turn for an A rank.- Besides the aforementioned lack of incentive to beat the levels properly, even if players decide to do so they need to consciously restrict themselves. The whole point of the inclusion of reaction fire was to avoid players rushing through the level, but including broken orders like Caution and Defense Boost pretty much defeats the purpose. And these orders are there, in front of us, to be used. They are an integral part of the game that players must deliberately neglect so the game doesn't get too easy. In my opinion, this is a serious game mechanics flaw.- Although I like the story, I get the feeling they interrupt the game too much to talk. I mean, all the time. Sometimes I wished they would just shut up and let me play already, especially when I'm just repeating the mission and have already read the damn dialogue. All it does is having the player mash the A button until it is over.- I don't like the anime-style highschoolish ""I-have-big-boobs-but-I'm-chaste-and-innocent-please-fantasize-with-me"" personality of some of the characters. I think it's juvenile.- Other than that, It's certainly a great game that deserves to be played. "

												Valkyria Chronicles is basicly a traditional war drama, set in a world that resembles Europe during World War II. It's your classic ""evil empire of evilness wants to conquer your country, longing for more power""-story for the most part, where you as a player follow the military resintance group who fights against the seemingly overpowered foe.It is, however, a JRPG after all. So, don't expect a retelling of historical facts or anything as it is still set in a fantasy world and also - while staying down to earth for the most part - adds a couple of supernatural elements later on.The story doesn't quite manage to stay clear of cheesy plot twists, especially towards the final chapter where it kind of disregards its own logic and artificially creates dramatic scenes just for the sake of being emotional. That aside though, the main plot is easy to follow and has a good, conclusive ending. As one would expect, it touches on topics like friendship and camaraderie as well as your token love story, but also anti-Semitism, betrayal, anxiety and of course death.What really makes the otherwise generic story shine, however, is the amount of detail they put into the characters. Not only the main cast, but every single character you use in battles has a unique back story and a reason why they joined the military to fight the ""evil empire"" in the first place, ranging from a 27 years old songstress who witnessed the inhuman ""hunts"" against the Darcsen race first hand, to a 37 years old widow who lost her eatery, or a 27 years old florist who discovered a strange joy in killing the Imperials after her shop was destroyed by them, or even a 15 years old boy who just wants to protect his brother, and many many more.None of the characters, main and supporting cast alike, follow your typical anime tropes. So, fortunately, there is no annoying tsundere girl, no airhead tomboy, and - first and foremost - no cheesy ""this is MY story"" hero.My favorite part of the game is, however, how the game doesn't just throw backstory about the characters at you to give you something to read, no, the individual character traits also play a major role in how you assemble your squad, because some characters just straight up hate each other lowering their stats when they fight side by side, or some of them have pollen allergies for example inflicting a negative status effect whenever they walk through tall grass, others have superior vision during night time, and some even get a damage boost out of pure joy of inflicting pain to the enemy.The gameplay in itself is pretty much standard turn based strategy. You choose your favorite units for each mission, select them individiually on a top down battle map which comsumes one action icon, and then change into a 3rd person view to directly move them across the battle field. It allows free movement for as long as the unit has AP, which continuously deplete with every step. (I played with a controller to more precisely maneuver my units around contact mines and over obstacles.)You can then choose to take one action with the character like shooting an enemy, throwing a grenade, healing allies, repairing vehicles ect. Interestingly, the character's turn does not end until you specifically select the 'end current action' command (so, move->shoot->move is possible and very much encouraged as clever positioning is pretty important).The game generally feels well balanced in terms of difficulty, although the AI sometimes gives the impression of not using their turns with all their units to their full potential. As in, you - the player - made a mistake and put your units in a suboptimal position . In theory, the enemy units could now kill your commander/ main character with one attack from behind, which is an instant game over. However, they all just waste their turns on attacks from the front or just straight up run into your (automatic) reaction fire and get killed.This is balanced out by the fact that the AI usually has more soldiers at their disposal and can call unlimited back-up units (this still costs an action per unit called).There is  a good variaty of mission objectives ranging from capturing the enemy base, to killing a specific enemy general or destroying a structure, or holding a camp for as long as necessary, to just moving one of your characters through a group of enemies to a specific point on the map. Several optional missions with extra rewards become available as you progress through the story. The faster you beat a main or optional mission the better your rewards, which can be used to enhance your characters' abilties and equipment.Tl;drTo conclude this review : if you're looking for a game with a beautiful art design, a nice, classic war story with not-so-tropey anime characters, and you're enjoying turn based strategy games like XCOM, by all means, buy this game.

												This game is great! Runs great on my 5 year old laptop with a 2.4Ghz C2D dual core and Mobility HD4670 1GB. At 1080p with vsync off there is a *slight* delay and lag. At 1080p with vsync on the delay is very noticable. So the game says requires a GTS 240 but will likely run on anything from the past 5 or 6 years that is not integrated graphics - at much reduced resolution. The game looks great despite it's age thanks to it's art design as well (2008 on PS3).The game clocks in at nearly 21GB. That seemed ludicrous to me, thinking it was just an RPG. Even The Last Remnant didn't clock in but a little over half that. Now that I have played through nearly half the game I think the size is warranted. If you need some space check to see what you have installed you haven't played recently to make room for this awesome game.It doesn't say anything about controller support and on the options page unless your controller is *currently* plugged in it won't let you select controller controls. After learning the game did in fact support a xbox360 controller from a friend who was playing it I found it worked beautifully! The one thing that irked me is the left and right on left stick are by default reversed. I noticed it the first time I went to setup my controller so luckily it did not affect me.Keyboard and mouse controls work perfectly with one exception. The tank. Took me THREE tries to finish the first mission with the tank. It is very hard to control because it does not have a 0 turning radius and if you bump into the smallest thing in many cases the tank will stop. Don't even think of trying to control the tank while backing up! To control the tank DO NOT use keyboard controls except to push forward, SLOWLY move the mouse left and right to turn while moving or release the forward button and aim the mouse where you want to turn and the tank will slowly turn to face forward. If you use a controller tank control is far less effort and bumping into things is much less likely.The gameplay is a demi tactics, 3rd person game. You get a set number of command points(CP) per turn. You may activate any unit as many times as youwant as long as you have CP remaining, however each activation past the first will result in a futher Action Point(AP) reduction. In a normal tactics game units can move AP number of tiles, in this you take control of the unit in 3rd person view. You get one attack per activation and if a unit comes into line of sight and range of a unit the enemy will reaction fire back - continuously.The other half of the game is the story. I said 21GB is justified. If you rush through the game probably half your time will be spent watching the CGs between each mission. Everything is voice acted as well, even checking the page to level your unit's classes will have a sargeant yelling ""YOU MAGGOTS HAD ENOUGH"" or similar. You also have a choice of ENG or JAP voice acting. Final result - I absolutely love this game! If you like RPGs and tactics games, this is a must play!			"

												Do I recommend this game? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥I do. This game is brilliant in so many different ways that at many points in the game I found myself verbally reaffirming my love for this game to my housemates. There will be spoilers ahead but I shall mark them like so SPOILER  blah blah blah  SPOILER so there you go.What first got me interested in the game was it's interesting combat, I mean, it's a turn-based, real-time, strategy, third-person shooter. I cannot describe the game in a simpler manner then this because it is all of these things. It's just such an odd concept that I had to give it a go myself and you know what it actually works really well. -So, running through what I have said, it's turn based as you and your opponent take turns, you get CP (Command Points) to move your units around and do things, once you use all of them, or some of them as you can save your CP for your next turn if you think you'll need them, then it is the enemies turn and the same thing happens. -It's real time because when you use your CP on a unit the game changes from a top down map to a third person perspective of the unit you have selected and then you decide what that character does from there, everyone has a selected amount of AP that they have to move and then they can take an action, shooting, healing, throwing a grenade SPOILER using a flame thrower/grenade launcher SPOILER, etc. And you'd think that that kind of thing may not work but it does surprisingly well in fact.-It's also an RPG because there are levels to your troops. There is so much going on here...I'm going to talk about the story till the end and I'll run through some other things first.Graphics- I love the artistic style of this game, it has that hand-drawn feeling while being fairly polished as a game. You can see in the characters shading what seems to be pencil lines and there is later on SPOILER you get smoke rounds for your tank and when you put a soldier into their the game looses most of it's colour but takes on a beautiful pencil like quality that I loved so much. SPOILER. There are some problems with the graphics however, the lip sync isn't the greatest but most of the time unless you were looking for it then you won't notice it, some of the character animations just don't work, like your engineers who can dismantle landmines with what seems to be a bolt cutter, which is magic because the same one can heal a tank, rebuild a sandbag wall and rebuild a tower, it's crazy really. Nevermind about that I'm rebelling now. Everything in this game is beautiful really, it's weaponry, the tanks, the characters all are individual, it's just a very pretty game being honest.Difficulty level, it's a fun game, being honest I played it on normal, the highest you can go for your first run through the game, and there were points where I really thought that I had done goofed, but besides the few landmine incidents and failed suicide runs to get behind a massive tank with, what I can only describe as, an rpg in the shape of a lance, like the ones knights used to use, the game seemed pretty easy to get through, now I am in no way saying I got an A rank on every mission, but I did well, no permanent deaths, no missions where I rage quitted, though there was one I came very close to doing so, so it was a fun experience, going to be interesting to play on the harder difficulties...Squad 7 - Squad 7 is your squad, it contains 20 people out of a possible 52(including hidden characters), out of which you can deploy a max of 10 in a mission, now you must be wondering why have the other 10 if you are not going to use them, but these are your reinforcement, if someone get's knocked out in combat you get your loyal medic to extract them and then you have to put another person into the fray, so it's a good idea to have backups of every member type.Fan service - Oh I wish I could leave this out of my review and I could do it too as to get to this it's gonna cost you 50'000dcts and it isn't required for game completion(You'll need to do it if you are going for all the achievements though) nor story progression. There is one instance of this happening and you know what by that stage I had fallen for this game so much that I didn't care. I mean I cringed for the entire thing but it really didn't lower the games quality for me, it's easily ignorable and it can just not be watched if you don't want to, I'll give you the tital of it if you want to avoid it, SPOILER Squad 7's R&R SPOILER. Okay story - I love the story so much. It's basically ww2/ww1 with Russia, I mean the empire, as the aggressors. You play, what basically is Switzerland who has massive deposits of ragnite, the mineral that is used in everything, from healing things to engines to explosives to streetlamps, everything. So you start in Gallia and you are immediately thrown into a bit of comic misunderstandings of identity, Alicia, the main female protagonist thinks the main protagonist, Welkin, is a spy. Bit of endearing comedy, the situation is resolved when Welkins sister Isara, clears up the problem. Then your border town is a attacked by the empire and Welkin is thrown into a war he is not expecting and a man dies in front of him. You are forced to abandon the town you've lived in all your life and run. Then it's an emotional ride from here to kingdom come all the way to the end, there are scenes that nearly had me in tears, and the epilogue, wow, just wow. The story is just some of the best story telling that I have ever seen in a game. There are a few story arcs including multiple main characters and they are all as interesting as the others. I can't give you any more information before I start treading into spoiler territory. To give you the proper effect of the scenes that got to me I'd have to tell you every little bit of character dialog just for it to have the best effect.There is one thing that got to me, just, bloody landmines, you will grow a hatred toward landmines like a cat to a dog. They can almost one-hit KO any team member so just avoid them or drive your tank across them.Hint - SPOILER Get your scouts and stormtroopers to level 11 as fast as you dare, then you get flamethrowers and grenade launchers.

												Is this a good game? Yes. The combat is a hybrid of tactical turn based strategy and over the shoulder shooting action, though I consider the latter to be something of a formality. Yes you can run your character around but all soldiers stop firing at you when you take aim and the game uses a random number generator to determine whether you hit or not, so it's not like twitch reflexes play much of a role. Still, it's nevertheless certainly a lot of fun and decently challenging (though at no point will it ever reach the challenge levels of XCom).Now, some of the game mechanics are certainly dodgy. Cover is pretty broken for instance. Sandbags provide a defensive bonus no matter which direction you're shooting from.  Lying down in the grass confers basic invincibility until you toss a grenade at the guy to make him stand up. So basically we can say that the cover system is made by a rather shameless Imperial Guard player. And the Scout class is sort of better than all the other classes. But none of these flaws are dealbreakers and it is immensely satisfying to bring down an enemy tank column or cut down enemy infantry with well-orchestrated tactics. If you're a fan of the tactical turn based strategy genre, you will find much to like here certainly. The problem however is the story, which the game hammers you over the head with no matter how much you want to skip it. It's this sickly sweet war romance that uses pretty much every anime cliche in existence. It also wants to teach kids a Valuable Lesson about racism by making it so that the people with black hair are a minority or something. I don't want to go into great detail about it (see my screenshots if you want that) but it's a demonstrably awful storyline that will grate on your nerves as you slog through cutscene after cutscene to get to the next battle. This thing was written right smack in the centre of that 2008-2011 period for anime, where the industry was sort of exhausted and spinning its wheels as it tried to figure out where to go after the greats of the aughts (Geass, Seed, the tsundere animes, etc) came to a close. It's a story with no ideas of its own that relies entirely on other (better) series for all of its material. It's honestly a little pathetic.But that said, as the game goes on I challenge you not to get attached to at least some of the cheesy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Certainly not the main characters, who are completely awful, but the side characters certainly. Like Marina the sexy sniper girl who hates everyone. Or Walter, the middle aged rocket dude with self-esteem issues. But yeah, do you like tactical games? Can you put up with one of the worst anime plotlines  of the last decade? If your answer to both those questions is yes, then VC is the right game for you.			"

												I really wanted to love this game and for the first few hours i kind of did. The art design is great, the story is well told and decently voice acted but i feel that it would work so much better as a movie than it does as a game.So i went in to Valkyria Chronicles expecting it to be an XCOM style turn based strategy game but it plays more like an awkward puzzle game where you need to know exactly where to move and when to shoot in order to complete each mission with the highest rank because there isn't much freedom of choice in how you play.Unlike in a game like XCOM there's very little room for improvisation and your troops move so slowly around the battlefield that you will probably just use the same 2 or 3 guys to kill all of the enemies in the level. The cover system seems to be broken and the enemy A.I is really terrible too as they spend many of their turns running in circles if you're not in their direct line of sight.Very disappointing.			"

												For a game that seems to think its narrative is important enough to constantly bombard you with cutscenes (albeit very pretty ones) both the plot and characters are woefully shallow.The battle system looked like it has promise, but it is meshed with a reward and XP system all about finding cheap ways to rush one scout directly to the enemy base without actually using any squad tactics or teamwork (for maximum rating and rewards).It helpfully provides battles you can grind to “catch up” on XP and cash. Overall the whole thing felt like it had no respect for the time I was spending with it - grinding, arbitrary battle elements and endless exposition (sometimes even in the middle of a battle you had to watch 4 cutscenes to get too…)			"

												One of my favourite games of all times, ported extremely well onto PC (a lot of PC ports have issues, VC does not).Can be played with either Keyboard + Mouse or the more natural feeling gamepad (it was a PS3 exclusive originally) equally well.The art style is beautiful and has aged (and will continue to age) very well while the music score is the best I have heard.Difficulty is just right, it may seem a bit harsh to start with, but enemies die just as quickly as you do (only boss type units are tougher than your own), and while you have a numerical disadvantage (up to 9 units) you have the benefits of being able to sling several (often game-breakingly good, but not essential to 100% the game at all (I've beaten every single non-DLC (well, it's pre-packaged DLC on the PC port) mission without them) orders as well as have better equipment.VC is also a heavily story driven game, with cutscenes (skippable, at least on the second run, haven't tried on the first run) and gameplay segments sharing equal importance.Like all good games, enemy AI does get derpy at times, doing things that would make their friends ashamed of them (like shooting their friends with friendly fire because they failed to realise that their friend was between them and their target).

												One of my favorite games ever.The story kept me coming back for more, but the best part of this game is the gameplay.The turned based action is very fluent and even tho it is turned based it keeps that feeling of constant action while you run from cover to cover dodging bullets and eventually shooting people through the head. Every kill always felt satisfying and most of the time fair if one of yours were to fall down in combat, because I forgot to put my soldiers under proper cover or left them alone. Thinking ahead and having a great strategy/position is key. Besides, this game's art is amazing. Visually it looks stunning and runs smoothly. Even on my potato. And it has good music, that sometimes amongs the battles every so often i caught myself just standing there listening.  The only real downside I experienced were the tank controls. Those can be kinda annoying from time to time.			"

												You have to press Start or Escape quite a bit to skip through all the terrible anime garbage.  After you skip about 6 or so, you get to play your first mission.  It seems this is how the rest of the game plays out as well, so get ready to skip all the awfulness before you get to play each time.  It mind sound exhausting, but trust me - push on.You can't skip the gameplay so don't worry about skipping EVERYTHING ELSE.  Any plot you need to know is summarized before each battle.  Once you make it there, you are rewarded with an awesome game that plays like a turn-based strategy with far more control than I've ever been given.  I'm heavily reminded of Operation: Darkness with a little bit of X-Com: Enemy Unknown.  You can move your players anywhere fluidly on the battlefield and the mechanics are easy to understand.I really enjoy this game, but don't know why it's hidden inside some trite and boring anime.

												This is the first review I have ever written for a game. But in my mind, Valkyria Chronicles is worth the accolades. I had originally mistook Chronicles for Valkyrie Profile, a game I was mildly interested in for the DS. After looking into it, I saw the gameplay and was actually hesitant about whether I would enjoy this type of game. I bought it and have not regretted it in the slightest. The story immediatley draws you in. The game, though anime and childlike in many aspects, has an amazing cast of characters and in depth backstories for all of the characters. I look forward to the updated entries after each chapter to see what new info I could get on Catherine or the easter egg characters Vyse and Aika. The gameplay itself is phenominal, and while I wish I could crouch anywhere, I enjoy the blend of real time and turn based strategy. The music and artwork hold nothing back and the penciled sketch look of the game complete the bookish nature of the story. To anyone who enjoys a good story, an amazing soundtrack, attention to detail in both presentation and background informatiuon, lovable characters, and gameplay that will both frustrate and thrill you, this is the game for you.

												The game itself is one of the best strategy games I've played, and I say that as someone who isn't even much of an anime fan.The reason I post is a giant port-specific caveat: 60 FPS is nice but it can cause issues.I couldn't finish Marberry Shores EX in one turn for the life of me; I kept dying to interception fire from gatling turrets that never happened on the PS3.  I figured it might be like Dark Souls where the framerate changes the timing for some things, and it was -- at 30 FPS the guns seemed to take roughly twice as long to track and begin firing and I completed the mission without issue. (and immediately re-enabled 60 FPS)So if you see wonky stuff like that, try temporarily setting 30 FPS.  You shouldn't need it for most of the game, but I doubt it's possible to one-turn Marberry Shores EX on 60 FPS.And PS3 vets: Remember this comes with the DLC so don't forget to do the Selvaria missions first.  After that it's Ruhmstein with Rosie.			"

												Possibly the greatest SRPG of all time. The blend of  turn-based combat with real time command of your troops makes the game feel action packed, while the battles are actually cerebral and slow paced, often resembling puzzles where you need to exploit the weaknesses of an apparently overwhelming enemy. The levelling system is also superb, completely avoiding any kind of grinding or need to let weaker units get kills. You simply focus on the tactics and can then choose to distribute XP to entire classes in between missions.The characters and plot are nothing special, but anime World War 2 is entertaining enough and the Japanese elements are subdued enough not to alienate western strategy fans, who will anyway be addicted to the combat system.The game's AI is quite rudimentary, with enemies often doing stupid things, but this isn't really relevant, when it's the map design and enemy placement that defines the missions more. Besides, it's also quite satisfying to have slightly dimwitted enemy stormtroopers charging into your perfect crossfire and getting slaughtered. The PC port is well executed, though a gamepad is the superior control experience. Strongly recommended.			"

												Definitely a game worth checking out. Why? Read on.The aesthetics of the game are borderline peerless, with every tank, character & class looking visually distinct from one another in what must be one of the most consistent pieces of art in the gaming space. It perfectly fits the motif of the games pretty unique setting, which is loosely based on the events of World War II, with its own fictional supernatural sprinkle on top. It's an interesting mix that thankfully treats the events of the War with the utmost respect, while also inviting us into it's wonderful & scary world in a relaxed manner.The characters are mostly great, with Welkin & Alicia's relationship surely going down as one of the greatest & most believable in the history of video games. A few of the villains are a tad predictable, and a lot of the minor characters are done to extremes (Jann & Leon being good examples of this), but they're for the most part ignorable, and do not detract too much from the overall enjoyment of the game. Sadly, the voice acting is nothing special, but the audio design as a whole really is top notch, and ties in perfectly with the games beautiful, unique style.Regarding the gameplay, combat is a bit hit and miss. It's overly simple & easily exploited, with a ranking system that makes little sense but still remains important, and minor issues like the odd invisible wall that bullets cannot penetrate, and tiny lips and dips that can foil the movement of a ten tonne battle tank. There are a couple of high quality combat mods that are supposed to be worth checking out, and while I can't comment on those personally, I'd definitely recommend checking them out if you have the time.Overall, as a lovingly crafted tactical JRPG, Valkyria Chronicles has a lot going for it, but there's also quite a lot to overcome if you're wanting to see it through to the very end. Very much worth your time, though! "

												Great game. It's definitely beautiful, and has a good to great story. Some game design choices are questionable, but it's a really nice turn based strategy game with a first person perspective. The highest downside is that it's by SEGA, and giving SEGA money isn't too great considering their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude towards youtubers. But if you're getting a game from them, get this one.			"

												Not only is this probably one of the finest ports ever made but it features a great game in a genre that even in PC can be lacking sometimes. The combination of tactical but character driven gameplay, the unique visuals, a hearty campaign, the included extras in the form of all DLC originally released for a fraction of the price and the unbelievable work that has been put into making sure that the game runs like a dream even on low end machines truly make this the definitive version of VC and nothing short of a Sega masterpiece.It does have its flaws, particularly with the first couple hours of the game being fairly slow and a tone that will make some people raise eyebrows at first blush; but there is no doubt that this game can stand toe to toe with some of the classics of the genre and stand far above modern renditions of some beloved franchises like Jagged Alliance.

												Pretty cool game (kind of like xcom with more anime), and Sega's ports have been on point lately; if there are any problems, I've yet to encounter one.My only gripe with the game is the design choice to allow a given character to act several times per turn. I feel this leads to balancing issues in what could otherwise be a fairly strategic game.Enjoyable nonetheless.			"

The game is very well made with a great look. its a game where you have to plan out all your moves and also make sure that you dont send one person charging in themselfs. it is a game where you have to really think about who you take into the fight with you.each person has their own skills and people they fight well with and people they just hate. one solder I used hates rose. so everytime she is near her she will lose chances of hitting people.Also as you play. you get a real feel of the people that you use. you start to feel like you have to do everything you can to make sure they live. sometimes it doesnt work. yes people can die in this gameno you cant revive them.This game has been my top game ever since i first played it.46/46			"

												You have to press Start or Escape quite a bit to skip through all the terrible anime garbage.  After you skip about 6 or so, you get to play your first mission.  It seems this is how the rest of the game plays out as well, so get ready to skip all the awfulness before you get to play each time.  It mind sound exhausting, but trust me - push on.You can't skip the gameplay so don't worry about skipping EVERYTHING ELSE.  Any plot you need to know is summarized before each battle.  Once you make it there, you are rewarded with an awesome game that plays like a turn-based strategy with far more control than I've ever been given.  I'm heavily reminded of Operation: Darkness with a little bit of X-Com: Enemy Unknown.  You can move your players anywhere fluidly on the battlefield and the mechanics are easy to understand.I really enjoy this game, but don't know why it's hidden inside some trite and boring anime.

												An utterly fantastic game from start to finish. Combines gameplay seen in the third-person shooter and strategy genres, with the strategy side heavily influenced by games like XCOM. In a fashion similar to XCOM, all characters are unique in identity and personality. However, if a unique soldier is killed and you do not rescue them within three turns, they are permanently gone for good. I find this to be a fair balance in comparison to games like Fire Emblem, as it promotes less save-scumming (which you can do anyway in battles, but it's just less fun that way).The graphics are timeless due to the exclusive CANVAS engine developed for this game, and is a fantastically optimized port to boot. People have been saying  that an Intel HD 4000 can run this game at 720p at 60 fps! The gameplay is not affected much by framerate anyway, and can easily be played at an FPS of 30, but damn, this game looks very slick at 60.Music is one of the biggest positives of this game. The score is nothing less of stellar and is a major achievement for the composer, Hitoshi Sakimoto. Listen to one of the tracks for battling as a sample:

The controls are completely fine with mouse and keyboard (although I used a gamepad a few hours in) with the exception of menus not being mouse enabled. This is nothing too horrible because aiming in-game and the unit selection map screen uses the mouse instead. This game also includes all four dlc's that were released years ago on the PS3.I fully recommend you play this game. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and even if you hate games that look slightly like anime, go for it. This is anime war where people seem more happy than usual, but at the same time stuff can get pretty grim and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by tackling controversial themes at points.

												This is a great game for strategy RPG fans like myself. Several years ago, I fell in love with turn-based strategy RPGs like the Fire Emblem series, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and this game is quite similar to those. So if you like them, you'll probably like this. There is a core of main characters who you'll end up taking in to battle pretty much every time, because of their benefits (and the fact they're some of the best units out there), but there's also a wide range of other characters you can take into battle too, who all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Valkyria Chronicles has a great blend of what I think of typical strategy RPG, with a grand continent-wide-war story, but also just the the gameplay itself, but it also incorporates a good action-style shooter type gameplay as well. When you take part in a battle, each turn you first get the 'Command View', where you can see a top-down-view rough map of the area, as well as where you're units are located on that map (represented by symbols), as well as any enemy units you know the location of (ie, one of your units can see them). When you select a unit to move them, you go into an over-the-shoulder 3rd person view, where you actually run the unit around the map and can then line up and fire a shot at an enemy unit before ending their turn. It was a little strange at first but I quickly became used to it and it's a great mechanic, allowing you to see both the strategic view a commander would have of a battle, but also the more personal view from each soldiers view point. It's great that even when you're controlling a unit, sometimes enemies can pop out of a hiding place in the grass etc. and surprise you, so it's great that you get to relate to each of your characters like that, and take care with how you move them, rather then just seeing them as chess pieces. The missions get increasingly difficult too, and there were some that required quite a lot of thinking and planning!The storyline is fairly typical, focusing on a group of characters in the Gallian militia, fighting off the evil Empire troops ivading their homeland. It's set in a sort of Alternate Universe version of Europe, called Europa. For me, there weren't many real surprises in terms of the story telling, but it was still really gripping, and there were some shocking moments still. The characters were quite well fleshed out as well, and some of them were really entertaining. Overall, this is a great game if you like strategical games, and I think it's action-style element will be a refreshing change for veterans of the the genre, but could also help bring in newcomers too. I've sunk quite a lot of hours in to this game, and started a new game plus as soon as I finished it, telling you how gripping I've found it. At the time of writing I've spent about 50hrs playing the game, and I think about a good 45 of them were on the first playthrough, the remaining 5ish will be on my new game plus. Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is a really great, engaging and gripping game, and well worth a play. I've heard that they made at least 2 other games in this series, and I really hope they make it to Steam too!			"

												Where to start? This game is outstanding. If you're a fan of tactics-based games, you'll almost definitely love it. There are very few bugs/glitches, (And the devs seem determined to find workarounds for them..) and only a few of the mechanics could cause you any grief. (An example: The times when an enemy trooper drops prone and dodges all your bullets. But this is balanced by the times your own troopers do the same thing to the enemy!)The story is enthralling, the graphics are, well, anime-in-3D but still well done. Well worth the price. Looking forwards to the sequels being brought to PC as well!			"

												First time I saw Valkyria Chronicles was about in 2008, where it was released for PS3, but never got its name. Luckily after 6 years without knowing it, I saw that it was coming to Steam. The pictures, the looks, the strategy, they all looked the same. I bought it.And without regret either.This game is simply put: Amazing. Why? You may ask. Well, VC is extremely well done, even the port is extremely well done. It has a strong story (for me that is... dunno about you), there is progress among our main characters, visual upgrade to the equipment, matching music for combat and cutscenes and best of all: Strategy (as in third person turn-based game). VC requires you to know when you should, and shouldn't attack, because: if you bluntly go directly into combat, then wave goodbye to your soldier! Honestly, I haven't played such a good game for a long time... Although the game has about 30-40 hours gameplay (which is short for some people), it offers a lot.I tell you this: You like story, use of your brain to when and how, this is what you ought to buy.This I personally give a full 10 / 10 for being Amazing with a big A.

												Originally described to me as ""anime xcom"", it's not quite exactly the case. Comparing it to XCom, Valkyria Chronicles has less tactical strategy (no overwatch/less attack options, less customizable character loadouts, less ""home-base"" decision making), but instead VC places a much stronger emphasis on the storyline, where you follow an episodic route. Unlike X-Com there's main characters that actually have personalities, and you'll probably feel quite attached to them over time. There is still xcom-esque strategy present with the presence of 5 different classes that all feel necessary, and you can upgrade them at will depending on your playstyle.The graphics style is charming, like something taken straight out of an anime, and all anime fans would be encouraged to play this. The soundtrack is also pleasant. I played the game with Japanese voices & English subs, but I heard the English voice dub is just as good. Oh, did I mention that the voice actor for Lelouch voices a main character?9.5/10 well worth your money			"

												Really nice, and I heartily recommend it. The storyline is rather painfully anime at points, and some of the missions later on get a bit grindy, but overall this is definitely worth it.			"

												Good guy SEGA releases game with all DLC's included instead of selling the DLC's separately.Also, it's nice to see a good PC port with support for higher resolution and more FPS.As for the actual game: an anime tactical RPG set in an alternate world where World War II has just started. If you like tactical combat and/or anime games, I recommend you give this a game a try.			"

												I remember playing this when it came out on PS3 but I was not the best as I rushed through everything and got stuck really quickly but when I got it on PC I started to take my time with everything and I managed to get futher than I have been before. I found that it was easier to aim with a mouse than the PS3 controller, but at first I found it really annoying to control the tanks but after a while I managed to get the hang of it.The story to this game really suits it and is broken up with cutscenes and the characters talking to each other so the story is really broken down so you are not sitting through cutscenes or them talking.The level system is nice and easy to use as you don't level up individual character you level up the classes and you can occasionally learn a new order to use in battles.The weapon and tank upgrade is also nice and easy to use and you get the credits and the exp after you do a battle, and as you get later into the game you get more but there are skirmishes to do to earn more credits that don't affect the story at all and you can grind them as well.If there is any game I would recommend buying it would be this game.

												One of the best and most innovative games I've ever played. Super fun, though the battle system takes a little while to get into if you've never played a turn-based style strategy game. The characters are all fun and lively, and the overall challenge level is pretty solid. I played the hell out of this when it first came out on the PS3, and I'm super happy PC owners will finally get a chance to play it now.Managed to put in (too many) hours yesterday, losing track of time as I found myself once more drawn in by the story and tactics of this game. Valkyria Chronicles is, perhaps, one of the best-written Japanese games I've ever played, in terms of the characters and the emotional arcs of the story. The artwork is gorgeous, the gameplay is fun and innovative... yeah, this game still holds up after 8 years.			"

												I was a long time old school gamer just getting back into gaming now, and this was a very enjoyable turn based rpg..reminding me of the old time Vandal hearts, but with a really great story, and cel shaded graphics. The difficulty on some of the later missions is challenging, but fun. Another game this reminded me of was fire emblem, so if that was your kind of gaming, you might want to give this one a try. =)			"

												An excellent tactics game!  People are marking this as an RPG/JRPG but I really don't know why.  The game isn't about building characters or even building a squad (given how you can swap people in/out between each battle) - it's about putting the right types of soldiers into the right positions and choosing the right targets for them.The story is an extremely cliche JRPG story designed for kids but the battles are quite challenging.  This leads to the game encouraging you to eat your vegitables then handing you your♥♥♥♥♥on a plate!  Heaven only knows what audience they were targetting but it's easy enough to skip through the story to get to the good stuff.The battle system is fairly unique.  Imagine something like XCom but, instead of moving soldiers around from overhead, you actually zoom in to a first person view until the soldier's turn is done, then pop back out to the overhead view.  The system works very well for keeping a perspective of the battlefield while still letting you see it as a real place instead of just markers on a board.  I hope more games use a system like this!The port of the game is OK.  There are still some wonky controls (especially for the tanks) and you have to go through a ""title"" screen just to quit the game but it has got a fine save game system.  (You'll need it, too!  Save at the start of every turn and I don't mean over the top of your previous save.)  There are also some map bugs floating around in the game that will either stop your character for no reason or will drop them right through the floor.All in all the game is well worth $20 if you like tactical level squad games.  Just sing real loud and hit the skip key when the cute pig shows up and try not to think about what the Geneva Conventions are going to say about the age of some of your soldiers.			"

												1 line version:The only RPG that the strongest woman in the game ends up in the kitchen. 8/10Full Version:[This review has some minor spoilers about the game]Well, if you're reading this, Valkyria Chronicles (or Senjou no Valkyria, in Japanese) has already picked your interest. Be it because some of your friends have, or because of the massive amount of people who liked it, because you like RPGs and want something fresh or because Sega has some broad range games that commonly goes on sale. Either way, VC is a prime example of how RPGs can still evolve and implement new things without sacrificing the story-telling.STORYThe story revolves around a conflict between nations during the Second European War (EWII), in which nations of the Empire (East) and the Federation (West) battles between each other for power, territory and resources. One specific nation, Gallia, tries its best to remain neutral, but it is still taken amidst the conflict with the invasion of the Empire forces. Welkin Gunther, the main protagonist, is one of the inhabitants that is caught on this invasion in his home city, Bruhl, but with the guidance of Alicia Melchiott, the town watch captain, they manage to evacuate the city to the capital city of Randgriz. There, they join (compulsorily) the 7th squadron of the town's militia, and from then on you must complete some missions that end up engulfing the entire squadron against the Empire's best forces, including even a Valkyria, a being of mystical powers that can basically one-shot-kill tanks and is virtually invincible.It has loads of references to WWII and Cold War in real life: alliances battling for oil (or, in this case, ragnite); wanting other nations to join their cause (and even deal with backstabbing); massive destruction weapons (did I hear nuclear bomb?) and, of course, the sense that stronger weapons and more soldier numbers meaning better army getting crushed with intelligence and strategy. Some Japanese elements are still there to soften the mood sometimes, but be sure, the story itself is marvelous.Along those lines, an obvious love story evolves between Welkin and Alicia, but in a heartwarming and slow way instead of it being rubbed in your face every mission. Even if some plot points you can see from miles away, some are genuinely breathtaking (like one of your squad members that is killed along the main plot). The main story has some 20 chapters neatly divided as sub-chapters of a book, each containing a certain cutscene or sequence of dialogues... oh, and the book wasn't a figure of speech, you can even change tabs if you want to read more about the squad members, weapons, cities and even see some side events.GAMEPLAYI was really impressed when I read ""mix of real and turn-based strategy RPG"" on the game's description, but it's exactly how you play in every mission. Basicaly you are the commander who can spend command points (CP) to control individual units around the battlefield (that can suffer damage if nearby units or turrets see you while you move), but once you raise your sights to aim at the enemy, all enemy units halt their actions and it works like a 1vs1 battle.There are lots of mechanics between my explanation, really: your unit consumes AP points (which differs from each class) to move around, and once it depletes, you'll be stuck; you can move units multiple times, but you must spend a CP everytime you want to move a unit, and as you select the same unit over and over, their available AP drops, meaning they're getting tired and will walk less further; you have classes that counters each other (shocktroopers deals lots of damage to less defensive classes like Scouts, but they also have less AP than Scouts; Lancers are good against tanks, but are slow and have low accuracy; Snipers deal tremendous headshot damage but are also slow and fragile; engineers can disable mines and heal tanks, but aren't good at the battlefront), along with RPG elements like status ailments and ""orders"" that can raise units status briefly. It's really complex, but the game introduces those mechanics little by little, so you'll have plenty of time to practice and master those. Just be sure to save inside missions, as some of them can easily take up over an hour depending on your luck.THE GOOD - Dual audio available with English subtitles - The sense of danger and challenge of the missions - Plentiful of things to do with EXP and money earned - Combat feels balanced for the most part - The story (and the satisfying ending!) - Quite a few things to do and read besides the main story - Around 20-30 hours of gameplay just for the main storyTHE BAD - No online play - Some plot points are just rubbed on your face too much (yes, that member that dies) - Not saving inside missions can lead to frustration due to bad unit positioning - Luck is quite a factor to be considered in this game (from acurracy of shots to enemy unit spawn) - Takes a little while for you to become used to the terms and political movements - It feels like some missions must be started a couple of times to get the hang of what exatcly you must do and how fast to proceed - I WANT A VALKYRIA UNIT TO OWN EVERYONE ELSE!!OVERALL8/10An awesome story, equally nice combat mechanics, sense of challenge in almost every mission and the broad range of things to be done and accomplishments to... erm... accomplish, Valkyria Chronicles is a must for every RPG lover, or even those who don't like sole turn-based strategy games. Definitely worth buying even without any multiplayer (because, really, if it existed, each game would take up hours easily). Just keep your eyes peeled in case the PSP exclusive's Valkyria Chronicles 2 is ever ported to PC, because it's even better!!			"

												I typically hate strategy games. I look at the screen and I immediately think,  When am I gonna have time for all this (hearts)?  This game is draws me in though. I'm excited to manage my unit of crack fighters and varied specialists to thwart the evil machinations of a megalomaniac. Gallia is my home and no one's gonna roll over us! The characters are fantastically fleshed out. The progression is perfectly paced. The experience, while linear, is so well written and executed that I don't even mind coming back to my military organization throughout the week to manage our frontline excursions. The only negative thing I have heard is ""yeah but it's made by sega and those guys are mean."" So (hearts)ing what? I don't run a gaming co and those decisions are theirs to make.  The only negative thing I have to say is, there should be more games using this CANVAS engine. It's sterling (hearts)ing beautiful.  Get this game.			"

												I was really hesitant to try this game because of very little medio coverage but I ended up picking it up after Totalbiscuit heartily recommended it even though he was doing a sega boycot.I must say I am impressed.This game is a very nice turn on the classic turn by turn tactical RPG.If you like shadowrun, wasteland 2, and X-com, you shoudl love this game.I also particularly like the anime style (because I  am  a fan of anime and manga).However there are some thigns I can not accept.Having unbeatable bosses that are literally invincible have a huge stamina pool and one shot anyone they shoot at regardless of distance? NO. NO. and NO. that is so effing unnaceptable! especially when said boss appears halfway through  the level!And you have to start teh whole level again every damn time!One of my most frustrating moments in gaming (alongside broken camera / long range sniper deaths in assassin's creed unity).I still love the game though and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. This is a purchase you wont regret.			"

												This is a review intended to previous owners of the game on the PS3 version. It may still help you decide if you're interested in the game all-together.Here we go. First review in quite awhile.Valkyria Chronicles was an early PS3 game that was well known for it's twist on a tactics game; being somewhat of a third person shooter at the same time. You had to think out every move, and make them count as a Militia squad of Galia against the massive army of the empire. The story is amazing to this game. It makes you feel immersed as the struggles continues. The gameplay will make you think twice about your actions in the field, and consider what's best for your hand-picked team to do.""But how's the new pc port? Is it the same as the PS3?""Early on the release on steam, there were a few problems here and there. Although with the patches that came quickly to the game's aid, nearly all of the cons about the port were fixed.Pros:- Now supports 60FPS and above.- New higher resolution support.- Keyboard and Gamepad support. (360 buttons also patched in to replace the original PS3 buttons.)- All DLC included.- Permanent price reduction compared to the original.Cons:- Enemy reaction shots are much more agressive than intended at anything above 30FPS. Some people say they enjoy this change, but as this is a mixed feeling it's recommended that newcomers play at the original 30FPS for an easier time.So, all in all, after the small bumps in the road of bringing this to the PC, it's an amazing port. In my opinion, a game completely worth the time you put into it.			"

If you are one that can actually care about people, this game will make you cry.[I'll admit that it gets me everytime during a certain part of the story, even though I know it's coming.]Gameplay:If you're the type of person that is turned off by Turn-Based strategy because it doesn't let your units fight back, don't worry, the ""Blitz"" engine turned that on its head.  If you are of the tactics school: ""Fire and Maneuver"", welcome to your new crack.[Note:  This game can be addictive, I nearly got demoted because I forgot to go to work while playing this game.]			"

												Where to start? This game is outstanding. If you're a fan of tactics-based games, you'll almost definitely love it. There are very few bugs/glitches, (And the devs seem determined to find workarounds for them..) and only a few of the mechanics could cause you any grief. (An example: The times when an enemy trooper drops prone and dodges all your bullets. But this is balanced by the times your own troopers do the same thing to the enemy!)The story is enthralling, the graphics are, well, anime-in-3D but still well done. Well worth the price. Looking forwards to the sequels being brought to PC as well!			"

												This is a great game for strategy RPG fans like myself. Several years ago, I fell in love with turn-based strategy RPGs like the Fire Emblem series, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and this game is quite similar to those. So if you like them, you'll probably like this. There is a core of main characters who you'll end up taking in to battle pretty much every time, because of their benefits (and the fact they're some of the best units out there), but there's also a wide range of other characters you can take into battle too, who all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Valkyria Chronicles has a great blend of what I think of typical strategy RPG, with a grand continent-wide-war story, but also just the the gameplay itself, but it also incorporates a good action-style shooter type gameplay as well. When you take part in a battle, each turn you first get the 'Command View', where you can see a top-down-view rough map of the area, as well as where you're units are located on that map (represented by symbols), as well as any enemy units you know the location of (ie, one of your units can see them). When you select a unit to move them, you go into an over-the-shoulder 3rd person view, where you actually run the unit around the map and can then line up and fire a shot at an enemy unit before ending their turn. It was a little strange at first but I quickly became used to it and it's a great mechanic, allowing you to see both the strategic view a commander would have of a battle, but also the more personal view from each soldiers view point. It's great that even when you're controlling a unit, sometimes enemies can pop out of a hiding place in the grass etc. and surprise you, so it's great that you get to relate to each of your characters like that, and take care with how you move them, rather then just seeing them as chess pieces. The missions get increasingly difficult too, and there were some that required quite a lot of thinking and planning!The storyline is fairly typical, focusing on a group of characters in the Gallian militia, fighting off the evil Empire troops ivading their homeland. It's set in a sort of Alternate Universe version of Europe, called Europa. For me, there weren't many real surprises in terms of the story telling, but it was still really gripping, and there were some shocking moments still. The characters were quite well fleshed out as well, and some of them were really entertaining. Overall, this is a great game if you like strategical games, and I think it's action-style element will be a refreshing change for veterans of the the genre, but could also help bring in newcomers too. I've sunk quite a lot of hours in to this game, and started a new game plus as soon as I finished it, telling you how gripping I've found it. At the time of writing I've spent about 50hrs playing the game, and I think about a good 45 of them were on the first playthrough, the remaining 5ish will be on my new game plus. Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is a really great, engaging and gripping game, and well worth a play. I've heard that they made at least 2 other games in this series, and I really hope they make it to Steam too!			"

												This game was clearly meant to be an anime. Clearly.It has what I like to call the 'Metal Gear Syndrome'; an expansive plot that had a lot of work put into it which is detailed through long cutscenes and in-game files. The creators of Valkyria Chronicles didn't just create a plot to carry the game, they made it the centerfold and filled the concotion more than halfway with it before adding in the 'gameplay' itself.Initially I wanted to get to the missions themselves and grew a little aggravated with how much plot there was. Around chapter 6 I came around though, and towards the end I found myself wanting to get PAST the missions to see more of the story. Your enjoyment of this game is going to depend on your enjoyment of the plot, since it takes up so much of each chapter's time. Plus, there are game files that are gradually unlocked and either add to or explain the game's lore/developments. You don't have to read them, but they do help, and there are a LOT of them.Story was decent. I thought it was going to be more political in tone and play on wartime international politics, but it winds up being about an ancient race of people (the Valkyrur) and a prince's race to claim their strength for his own ambitions. Meh, kinda simplistic but it plays out well and is paced remarkably good. Nothing is daunting and information unfolds steadily-this is how you craft a comprehensive plot and unfold it at a pace that ensures gamers are grasping all information relayed. The characters are also solidly crafted and don't fall into the typical anime tropes you'd expect. If you have prejudices against the artstyle then rest easy, no one asks if Senpai noticed them.The only criticism I have is in how war is sometimes portrayed. The reaction both sides display (at different points in time) when materials banned in treaties are used in warfare is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's as if this game came from a nation that has no standing army and attitudes of what warfare actually entails are really, really, really naive.Seriously, sometimes the game comes off as incredibly naive and almost childish. 'The soldiers on the other side have families too!' no ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's not often, and it isn't that big of a deal, but I did groan a few times when it did occur. Just a small mark, though.As for the game itself, it's coo, it's cooooo. I can't say how it ranks in the strategy RPG genre, since this is my first such title. What I can say is that its pretty good on its own merits, but the challenge starts dropping off towards the end. You have 5 classes that are levelled up with XP points attained after completing missions, with the amount given depending on how quickly you finish the mission (in terms of turns, not time). You level up the class, not individual units. Levelling up a class gives you more health for every unit, with 'potentials' unlocked as you continue to level up. Potentials being inherent abilities within each individual unit that vary. Shocktrooper A might be able to attack twice per turn, whereas Scout C might gain the potential to increase the potency of your healing item. Honestly, I didn't pay much attention to potentials, since they occur randomly in battle and very few of them can be 'controlled'. The real control comes in 'orders' that are gained when you hit certain levels for each class. They cost you movement points each turn, but they range from increasing evasion to decreasing damage sustained from intercepting fire as you move across the map.This is where the game starts becoming easy. You can pass the Bruhl reclamation storyline mission in one turn, with one unit. Perhaps it has more to do with proper balancing of some of the orders rather than an inherently easy game. There's also the reality that replaying a map is much easier since you're familiar with where the enemy is and what awaits you. But it still shouldn't be possible to pass a mission with one unit in one turn, complete information or none at all. Alicia, one of the storyline units, becomes REALLY unfair towards the end. Story-wise I understand why, but it's so incredibly broken. She gets a chance to get a full heal after attacking, and a chance to double her movement points. With the 'caution' order she can literally run across a field with tanks, troopers with machine guns, and all sorts of mayhem and survive. It's RIDICULOUS.I know of one other mission where you can pass it in one turn by using cheap tactics, but there are probably more. They would've done well to balance some of the orders (well, just two, 'caution' and 'unlock potential') and Alicia. That being said, it's still an enjoyable game with the later maps initially presenting a challenge due to your unfamiliarity with them. It's a shame the difficulty drops off later on, but the plot picks up. So it's a give and take. The upside is that the difficulty only comes down after one of the hardest missions, so I guess it isn't a total loss. But enough about my ♥♥♥♥♥ing, I enjoyed the game and that's all that matters.

												First time I saw Valkyria Chronicles was about in 2008, where it was released for PS3, but never got its name. Luckily after 6 years without knowing it, I saw that it was coming to Steam. The pictures, the looks, the strategy, they all looked the same. I bought it.And without regret either.This game is simply put: Amazing. Why? You may ask. Well, VC is extremely well done, even the port is extremely well done. It has a strong story (for me that is... dunno about you), there is progress among our main characters, visual upgrade to the equipment, matching music for combat and cutscenes and best of all: Strategy (as in third person turn-based game). VC requires you to know when you should, and shouldn't attack, because: if you bluntly go directly into combat, then wave goodbye to your soldier! Honestly, I haven't played such a good game for a long time... Although the game has about 30-40 hours gameplay (which is short for some people), it offers a lot.I tell you this: You like story, use of your brain to when and how, this is what you ought to buy.This I personally give a full 10 / 10 for being Amazing with a big A.

												Originally described to me as ""anime xcom"", it's not quite exactly the case. Comparing it to XCom, Valkyria Chronicles has less tactical strategy (no overwatch/less attack options, less customizable character loadouts, less ""home-base"" decision making), but instead VC places a much stronger emphasis on the storyline, where you follow an episodic route. Unlike X-Com there's main characters that actually have personalities, and you'll probably feel quite attached to them over time. There is still xcom-esque strategy present with the presence of 5 different classes that all feel necessary, and you can upgrade them at will depending on your playstyle.The graphics style is charming, like something taken straight out of an anime, and all anime fans would be encouraged to play this. The soundtrack is also pleasant. I played the game with Japanese voices & English subs, but I heard the English voice dub is just as good. Oh, did I mention that the voice actor for Lelouch voices a main character?9.5/10 well worth your money			"

												Imagine that you are reading a book.  The visuals are bright, but somewhat washed-out, almost like a watercolor.  This book is written by a woman author from just prior to the Great War, emulating the jingoistic stories of duty, honor, and glory that filled the heads of young men off to war.  Then the horror of burning metal, smashed buildings, and broken lives.  Yet in this carnage is humanity.Babies are born, flowers bloom, and friendships far deeper than any experienced in peace are forged.  Like Ersnt Junger's ""Storm of Steel"", excitement and glory can also be found in the horrors of modern conflict.Complex, yet sincere, this game is an excellent introduction not only to war stories, but JRPGs in general.  My own son (of 11) has started his own games to see the story for himself.			"

												Great Game,but there are some huge flaws.Playing Valkyria chronicles is like seeing the best Dancer in the world dancing with an iron cannonball attached to a leg.The game has so many great things.Graphics are good, the Story is good, soundtrack is fantastic and the gameplay is great.The big problem of the game are the winstates.Most maps are won by capturing a Flag X in the enemy basecamp.The problem with this is, that the game rewards not to be a good general, but a fast General.There were endless situations where the logical solution would have been to go around the enemy and hit them from the back, but that would have needed one more turn and a worse mission rating.The game often forces you to use suicide tactics  to capture the flag as fast as possible.This often also leads to endings where ""winning"" doesn´t feel right, because half the map is still full of enemies but to get the best rating, speed runs to the enemy flag are often necessary.Because speed is so important, half of the soldier types in the game become useless for most missions (apart from some special missions where normal tactics don´t work) since scouts are so much more superior to all other classes.Thats especially sad for the tank which in most missions is just standing arround, because moving him costs far too many Command points.Its like a shooter where you are given the best weapon in the second mission and there is no improvement in picking other weapons. Its a real shame.If the game would rate the mission on soldiers killed or wounded. plus enemies killed PLUS a sort of Time limit as another factor, it would be so much better.			"

												This is the first review I have ever written for a game. But in my mind, Valkyria Chronicles is worth the accolades. I had originally mistook Chronicles for Valkyrie Profile, a game I was mildly interested in for the DS. After looking into it, I saw the gameplay and was actually hesitant about whether I would enjoy this type of game. I bought it and have not regretted it in the slightest. The story immediatley draws you in. The game, though anime and childlike in many aspects, has an amazing cast of characters and in depth backstories for all of the characters. I look forward to the updated entries after each chapter to see what new info I could get on Catherine or the easter egg characters Vyse and Aika. The gameplay itself is phenominal, and while I wish I could crouch anywhere, I enjoy the blend of real time and turn based strategy. The music and artwork hold nothing back and the penciled sketch look of the game complete the bookish nature of the story. To anyone who enjoys a good story, an amazing soundtrack, attention to detail in both presentation and background informatiuon, lovable characters, and gameplay that will both frustrate and thrill you, this is the game for you.

												I remember playing this when it came out on PS3 but I was not the best as I rushed through everything and got stuck really quickly but when I got it on PC I started to take my time with everything and I managed to get futher than I have been before. I found that it was easier to aim with a mouse than the PS3 controller, but at first I found it really annoying to control the tanks but after a while I managed to get the hang of it.The story to this game really suits it and is broken up with cutscenes and the characters talking to each other so the story is really broken down so you are not sitting through cutscenes or them talking.The level system is nice and easy to use as you don't level up individual character you level up the classes and you can occasionally learn a new order to use in battles.The weapon and tank upgrade is also nice and easy to use and you get the credits and the exp after you do a battle, and as you get later into the game you get more but there are skirmishes to do to earn more credits that don't affect the story at all and you can grind them as well.If there is any game I would recommend buying it would be this game.

												I was really hesitant to try this game because of very little medio coverage but I ended up picking it up after Totalbiscuit heartily recommended it even though he was doing a sega boycot.I must say I am impressed.This game is a very nice turn on the classic turn by turn tactical RPG.If you like shadowrun, wasteland 2, and X-com, you shoudl love this game.I also particularly like the anime style (because I  am  a fan of anime and manga).However there are some thigns I can not accept.Having unbeatable bosses that are literally invincible have a huge stamina pool and one shot anyone they shoot at regardless of distance? NO. NO. and NO. that is so effing unnaceptable! especially when said boss appears halfway through  the level!And you have to start teh whole level again every damn time!One of my most frustrating moments in gaming (alongside broken camera / long range sniper deaths in assassin's creed unity).I still love the game though and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. This is a purchase you wont regret.			"

												I said to myself that I wasn't going to get this port; but I'd be hard-pressed to say I'm thankful to have this port.Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing turn-based game series that deserves to be seen and played by all. I highly recommend the game to anyone who is genuinely interested into trying it out; it is a fantastic game when I first played it on the consoles. Over-all, this is on my personal list of great PC ports. SEGA, if you somehow read this, I'd appreciate seeing the sequels ported to PC one day alongside other SEGA games.			"

												This is a review intended to previous owners of the game on the PS3 version. It may still help you decide if you're interested in the game all-together.Here we go. First review in quite awhile.Valkyria Chronicles was an early PS3 game that was well known for it's twist on a tactics game; being somewhat of a third person shooter at the same time. You had to think out every move, and make them count as a Militia squad of Galia against the massive army of the empire. The story is amazing to this game. It makes you feel immersed as the struggles continues. The gameplay will make you think twice about your actions in the field, and consider what's best for your hand-picked team to do.""But how's the new pc port? Is it the same as the PS3?""Early on the release on steam, there were a few problems here and there. Although with the patches that came quickly to the game's aid, nearly all of the cons about the port were fixed.Pros:- Now supports 60FPS and above.- New higher resolution support.- Keyboard and Gamepad support. (360 buttons also patched in to replace the original PS3 buttons.)- All DLC included.- Permanent price reduction compared to the original.Cons:- Enemy reaction shots are much more agressive than intended at anything above 30FPS. Some people say they enjoy this change, but as this is a mixed feeling it's recommended that newcomers play at the original 30FPS for an easier time.So, all in all, after the small bumps in the road of bringing this to the PC, it's an amazing port. In my opinion, a game completely worth the time you put into it.			"

												This is a pretty solid game. Set in a fictional world during the WW2 era, you play as Welkin Gunther, a tank operator, and leader of the Squad 7 militia. There are 5 classes to choose from:Scout,Shocktrooper,Lancer,Engineer,Sniperand then you have Welkin who is mandatory in every battle with his tank, who is pretty much his own class. This is a good game at a good price. The world is believable and I love the art style. "

												One of the best and most innovative games I've ever played. Super fun, though the battle system takes a little while to get into if you've never played a turn-based style strategy game. The characters are all fun and lively, and the overall challenge level is pretty solid. I played the hell out of this when it first came out on the PS3, and I'm super happy PC owners will finally get a chance to play it now.Managed to put in (too many) hours yesterday, losing track of time as I found myself once more drawn in by the story and tactics of this game. Valkyria Chronicles is, perhaps, one of the best-written Japanese games I've ever played, in terms of the characters and the emotional arcs of the story. The artwork is gorgeous, the gameplay is fun and innovative... yeah, this game still holds up after 8 years.			"

												Has good art, gameplay and music. Also has a lot of content (both main game and optional) to play through. If you can look past the fact that the characters are a bit ""anime cliche"" then you'll find they grow on you. Story-wise it's pretty generic, big bad Empire wants to rule the world but a rag-tag team is out to take them down against the odds, but it's still engaging and has some nice twists.The only real downside I can think of is that the game can be a bit buggy sometimes, especially when controlling the tank with a mouse - it just seems to go crazy. I'd recommend to use a controller if you have one, but it's still perfectly playable if you don't.Basically it's a scaled-down RTS with more focus on individual character abilities and putting them together to work as a team.Or just max leveling your scouts and cheesing every stage with them. Good fun if you like RTS and maybe RPGs - you can customise and level up your squad throughout the game, and there's always the ability to play in new ways.It's not without its flaws, but overall it's a really nice and fun game.

												I don't know if I should warn people about or recommend that people play Valkyria Chronicles. I have a very split opinion about the game where I absolutely hate its insipid and shallow story so full of anime themes and tropes that I can't help but feel like I was being transformed into an otaku playing this game. But, the combat system is so robust, strategic and rewarding you really won't find anything superior to it in even modern games. The only real competitor it has is the XCOM series and even that series has a slightly easier and more traditional combat system than the one in Valkyria Chronicles in my opinion. All I can say is that being a fan of strategic turn based combat games I was able to weather through the♥♥♥♥♥♥storm that was the narrative in this game in order to really enjoy what was a fantastic and rewarding game that still out classes modern games in respect to gameplay mechanics despite having come out over seven years ago.If you want to read my indepth review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/03/valkirya-chronicles.html.

												A JRPG with a very unique XCOM-lite sort of combat system. I'm very ambivalent regarding it, maybe 5.5/10.The setting is excellent and feels quite original - a lot of effort went into world-building and it shows. The story is pretty good, with the exception of being completely riddled with all sorts of cliches. The dialogue, anyone with the most basic knowledge of Japanese can tell that the translators took HUGE liberties with the dialogue, and not really in a good way. As for the gameplay, it initially looks like it allows for some extreme strategic depth and I was originally optimistic. However, you eventually figure out the game and all of its nuances, and those nuances suddenly bring the strategic pool a lot shallower, once you understand the mechanics.The level design starts out really strong and maintains that strength all the way until about 2/3 into the game. After that point, I feel that mission quality falls flat on its face and I'm ready for the game to be over. I have no complaints nor major points to comment about the porting to PC.The artwork is easily 10/10. Superb.In summary, I think Valkyria Chronicles is a very flawed gem, whose major saving grace is that none of its flaws are deal-breakers, and it still is quite novel and that is to be respected.

												Valkyria chronicales is an odd game to say the least. And yes it is a game about the ""Europiean"" front of ""WWII"" made by Japanese. Well that is kinda a lye since they made their own world for this to take place in, and there is enough world building to get away with it I do have to ask why? Maybe the dev team thought it might be to hypicraticle to make it about the acutal nazi's.The game it's self has it's ups and downs: for instance the game looks beautiful with it's picture book style asthetic, allot of the story is really well done with one moment that I thought was going to be a genaric ""Oh the enemy is just as human as us"" but then a moment afterword it really knew how to twist the knife to make me really feel that moment and the game play is unique amongst turn based combat for better or wrose.The bad parts are that among it's other wise well crafted story is a character who with just a few tweeks to dialog could have been a very interesting character but I suppose the goal of the character was to show the downside to military leadership. In one scene he disrgards another another characters opinion for no reason when with just a few different lines it could have shown him as a man just trying to do his job the best he can given the circumstances. As far as the game play's fualts... Well it's biggest fualt is level design, one time spawning my tank (which I need to survive to complet the mission) in front of an anti tank cannon, or other levels which are poorly designed in other ways.I still recommend Valkyria chronicales, it does make a very interesting story that couldn't really be expressed in the real historcal world without extream changes to history. The game play is interesting, if a tad on the easy side, with allot of different sinarios to expand the game play.			"

												Graphics hold up amazingly regardless of age just because the water-color aesthetic is so good that the design really makes tech limitations effectively vanish. I'd even say the art and style make it even nicer to look at than many newer games.Story is phenomenal. Kind of implemented in a way that it's mandatory, but it's engaging enough and such a major part of it that there's no reason to skip it unless someone's just apathetic towards it, in which case it's understandably not for them. Anime tropes might be offputing for some but they're not overwhelming. Lots of excellently done character development, in and out of battle, even for troops who don't really play a role in the main plot. Found myself picking ""worse"" troops for my squad just because certain personalities and designs were so charming.Loosely based on WWII, but makes the soliders feel a lot more human, and tackles the heavy subjects involved like racism much more effectively, and with a lot more power and openness, than I'd expect from a stereotypical WWII shooter. Solid difficulty curve and fun, strategy-heavy combat throughout. Can easily sink a good number of hours into it. Ranking system incentivizes speed a little too much, but it's easy to ignore and I'd recommend doing exactly that just to get the most out of a first playthrough. For anyone concerned about whether they'd like Tactical RPGS I'd recommend the free XCOM demo for a loose idea of what they're like, but VC is hardly expensive, especially on sale.			"

												I'm a huge Fire Emblem fan and this is the one RPG on PC that gets near that experience.Great story, characters with something behind it and levels you can complete in different ways + a stunning game experience. An instant classic for me and I'm sure I'll play it again in the future.			"

												Awesome but insanely frustrating turn-based strategy game.Most scenearios boil down to how you can abuse what you have and outmanouver the AI.Team characters and the cheesy anime story make it cute and the visual style is beautiful. Definitely some questionable missions especially later in the game unless you have min/max'd throughout.			"

												I remember playing this when it came out on PS3 but I was not the best as I rushed through everything and got stuck really quickly but when I got it on PC I started to take my time with everything and I managed to get futher than I have been before. I found that it was easier to aim with a mouse than the PS3 controller, but at first I found it really annoying to control the tanks but after a while I managed to get the hang of it.The story to this game really suits it and is broken up with cutscenes and the characters talking to each other so the story is really broken down so you are not sitting through cutscenes or them talking.The level system is nice and easy to use as you don't level up individual character you level up the classes and you can occasionally learn a new order to use in battles.The weapon and tank upgrade is also nice and easy to use and you get the credits and the exp after you do a battle, and as you get later into the game you get more but there are skirmishes to do to earn more credits that don't affect the story at all and you can grind them as well.If there is any game I would recommend buying it would be this game.

												One of the best and most innovative games I've ever played. Super fun, though the battle system takes a little while to get into if you've never played a turn-based style strategy game. The characters are all fun and lively, and the overall challenge level is pretty solid. I played the hell out of this when it first came out on the PS3, and I'm super happy PC owners will finally get a chance to play it now.Managed to put in (too many) hours yesterday, losing track of time as I found myself once more drawn in by the story and tactics of this game. Valkyria Chronicles is, perhaps, one of the best-written Japanese games I've ever played, in terms of the characters and the emotional arcs of the story. The artwork is gorgeous, the gameplay is fun and innovative... yeah, this game still holds up after 8 years.			"

												A great strategy game similar in many ways to Xcom, but set in a WWII type scenario instead. It also adds its own unique additions to the various mechanics. The class upgrading is done across the board, so when you upgrade a character class(Scout, Shocktrooper, etc.), all characters of the scout class get upgraded to the next level. Same with upgrading weapons and unlocking new ones, everyone that can use it can equip it immediately without having to pay for it. And the game is very story rich.Whey it comes to the actual combat, it's turn based, where you have a bar that depletes as the character moves, and can shoot once per phase. You get a certain amount of 'Command Points' per turn, and you use that to make character act. So I can select Character A, in which I can now move and attack(or use an item). Then I can select another character and do the same until I finish using my Command Points. But I can also select Character A again if I wanted, but each consecutive 'selection' lowers how much movement points they get.Valkyria Chronicles has full controller support, however the Keyboard/Mouse controls are also wonderful, which is practically unheard of with PC ports. It also has 60FPS support too.If I had to desribe it in short, it would be like an Anime XCOM with far more depth and set in an alternate World War II. All in all, I definitely recommend this game, especially to Turn Based Strategy fans. Amazing game.			"

												This is a very well-executed port of one of the PS3's earliest exclusive masterpieces, the most creative and innovative strategy game of last generation.If you've played it previously on PS3, this is the same game, but with a few upgrades and additions: the inclusion of all DLC, a better framerate, achievements, and keyboard+mouse controls.  It's worth noting that this same port is now on PS4, but I chose this version simply because aiming with a keyboard and mouse is a bit easier than with analog sticks.  This version does support the XBox controller layout right out of the box, though, so you can use that if you do prefer analog sticks.That's what's new in this version.  If you've never played the game, read on:This is a turn-based strategy game with some innovative twists to the mechanics.Half of the gameplay is familiar: you deploy units onto a map, and then order them to move and attack, one-by-one, until you've exhausted moves for your turn; then, the enemy does the same.  Repeat until your objectives are met or failed.What makes the game unique is what happens while you're ordering each individual unit.  The camera shifts from the overhead map to a third-person camera, and you control the character in a way similar to a third-person shooter.  Your shots aren't fired in real-time, however; it still maintains the strategy custom of lining up your shot and pressing a button to execute your attack, at which point the attack process happens automatically, factoring in elements like cover and angle.  You must be quick and focused while moving your characters, however, as enemy units positioned along the map can still fire at your character in real-time (and the opposite is true as well, so it's on you to position your units in ways such that they can take shots at advancing enemy units during the enemy's turn phase).This blend of turn-based strategy with semi-realtime interaction makes for a unique and creative style of gameplay that's never been previously seen, making Valkyria Chronicles one of a kind.

												Let me start with age-old sentence. This game was under my radar for long time, until it became game on my radar, but never on top priority list.Then voucher popped in my inventory and tought to finally try it out. At time of writing this review, im just 5,3 hours in and im still what feels very much in beginning. And this game is fantastic. Despite its cheerful looks, it also has dark side, as well as rather complex and interesting gameplay. Only real gripe i have is with using a tank. Though if you look for lot of action, you might not also like it, as it has LOT of story.Gameplay wise, one other thing needs mentioning: while it is fairly well ported, you can get somewhat confused at start by controls. But be assured- you can get over it fairly quickly (except mentioned tank).As for story? Well, its set in fictional world, where continent named Europa is in 2nd great war in 1935. While war is between 2 major alliances, Gallia is small country thats neutral. But one side- the empire (which i find great that it is based on both starters of ww2 (signers of molotov-ribbentrop pact), not just one)- decides to attack Gallia.And even with just those 5,3 hours, i've found several themes, that make it easier for me to relate my nations history (not as lucky as Gallia in ww2).EDIT: 10,3 hours in and story just keeps getting better.

												I don't know if I should warn people about or recommend that people play Valkyria Chronicles. I have a very split opinion about the game where I absolutely hate its insipid and shallow story so full of anime themes and tropes that I can't help but feel like I was being transformed into an otaku playing this game. But, the combat system is so robust, strategic and rewarding you really won't find anything superior to it in even modern games. The only real competitor it has is the XCOM series and even that series has a slightly easier and more traditional combat system than the one in Valkyria Chronicles in my opinion. All I can say is that being a fan of strategic turn based combat games I was able to weather through the♥♥♥♥♥♥storm that was the narrative in this game in order to really enjoy what was a fantastic and rewarding game that still out classes modern games in respect to gameplay mechanics despite having come out over seven years ago.If you want to read my indepth review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/03/valkirya-chronicles.html.

												If the AI for this game had been great instead of terrible, this game would be a masterpiece. It's got a CP system that actually works, you can choose to attack with the same unit 10 times in a single turn, but you usually don't because of interesting complexities in board state that require you to counter various things using a wide assortment of units. It's sort of like Chess, except the reasons you don't move your Queen every turn (enemies can often easily dodge a single attacker, your own pawns get underfoot, and attacking units can't really use hit-and-run tactics) don't apply here, and instead, every unit is a very different kind of Queen in its own right.Unfortunately, the AI is seriously brain-damaged with flashes of mild competence, the worst combination. When the enemy actually remembers to attack with the same unit more than once in a turn, it's often a surprise, and sometimes results in instant defeat. The enemy often spends its time walking units back and forth out in the middle of nowhere, running up in front of your tank and getting mowed down, and ending its turn even though it has tons of CP left and hasn't really done anything of note this turn yet.The dialogue in this game is a bit hypermundane in places too, although I did slightly warm up to the plot at about chapter 7 or so.

												Anime-styled story in a ""not-WWII"" setting. Characters are charming, although they fall into common anime tropes fairly often. The overall story is engaging and has a few strong set-piece moments, while also leaving time for quiet reflective moments.Combat is very well-designed, and the player units become a force to be reckoned with later into the game, when strong weapons, skills, and equipment have been obtained. The combat system is turn-based, but moving units and attacking occurs in real-time, and the player has full control over which units they will spend their turn controlling. Unit classes are fairly imbalanced, with scouts becoming horrendously overpowered by the end-game. This means that many missions can be cleared while only using a single unit. This diminishes some of the squad tactics and positioning required, which is unfortunate.Missions do a good job of staying fresh, with different objective types and environmental challenges on a regular basis keeping the player on their toes. The difficulty curve falls off a bit after the mid-game, when the player can obtain some of the late-game weapons and skills for their units. There are a couple difficulty spikes, but nothing too unreasonable.The art style of the game is gorgeous, and the characters and environments have a gentle color palette and a sketched appearance. It looks good in stills, and even better in motion. The soundtrack fits the game very well, providing both whimsical and serious tracks that fit right in with the alt-history setting.			"

												Do you like Final Fantasy Tactics or the Ogre Battle series? Do you enjoy XCOM? Do you like anime? If you answer ""yes"" to any of those questions, you owe it to yourself to try this amazing game. Particullarly so if you enjoy turn based tactics game. So, what's so good about this game? Let's dig right into it.1. STYLE: This is, probably, the most obvious feature of this game. It looks incredible. Cel-shaded graphics tend to age way better than realistic ones, and even though this is a PS3 era game, the graphics are extremely pleasant to look at even today. The game mixes celd-shaded characters with an anime look with a beautiful kind-of-grpahite-looking aesthethic that's just a joy to behold at every time.2. SETTING AND STORY: Let's state this: the story is good. Let's frame this statemente: the story is good for a JRPG title. It's, of course, plagued with tropes you've seen a million times before, and almost every character has that one defining characteristic that makes his or her entire personality. Unlike other japanese anime-inspired games, however, this is not a major issue since it's not overplayed, and the story presented here keeps a very serious and even mature tone at times. Since this is technichally a ""war"" game, it's refreshing to play a teen-oriented game that doesn't shy away from complicated subjects such as death and racism. Don't get me wrong: it's still a japanese, anime-stylized and teen oriented game, which means fanservice, stupid over the top♥♥♥♥♥♥like Valkyrias doing flips over tanks and overly-dramatic dialogue, but, for what it is, it could have been so much worse.3. GAMEPLAY: This, in my opinion, is the defining feature of this game. Gameplay is thight as it can be. Simple in its basis - thus, easier to explain to a newbie - but very deep on the long run. The game is divided in two major parts: your headquarters, where you level up your units and equip them with whatever new stuff you've developed, and the proper action scenarios, which are played out in turns. During your turn you position your units, move them around the map trying to get to vantage points or hiding areas and then attack the enemy, trying, most of the time, to take their camps and win the map, while the enemy tries to do the same to you. Both systems complement each other very well and you get a real sense of becoming more and more like a seasoned millitary man the more you advance in the story. The most important part, though, is  that the game never feels boring or repetitive, even though you're basically doing the same thing over and over. Since it's so well paced, you never feel like being ""cheated"". I've played in the Hard difficulty and it certainly is hard. I've had to replay many maps multiple times, trying to get the ""perfect"" combination of units and positioning in order to advance. It's challenging, rewarding and I've never felt like it was cheap. 4. VARIETY: The game never feels stale because it's always throwing new stuff at you withouth being overwhelming. No map is played exaclty like the one before. I remeber one map where I had to stop this massive, gigantic tank, taking out its turrets from a distance and then disabling it's engines, WHILE stalling it with debris on the field, WHILE running away from a psychotic killing machine that was constantly on my heels. Another map tasked me with killing two smaller, yet still gigantic mortar-spewing tanks located at both edges of the map, WHILE avoiding constant mortar fire, WHILE dealing with respawning snipers on the ledges above my camp, WHILE trying to contain their infantry so they didn't occupy my base camp. I had to replay both maps at least 3 times before I realized where to move and how to counter each of the many different threats that kept popping up. This makes each map feel very intense and packed with obstacles, which is why I never play more than one or two at a time. Yet, when you finally manage to overcome adversity and win, it feels incredibly rewarding.5. EXCELLENT PORT: 1080 HD resolution, has both keyboard and controller support, keeps both the original japanese and english audio files with subtitles, can create different save files. Nothing to say, one of the best PC ports I've seen.6. LONGEVITY: Each match can last from 10 minutes to 60 minutes, depending on your playstyle and the different objectives. This makes it a game that's better appreciated by playing it in spurs instead of one long sitting.I seriously reccomend this game. I first played the second part on the PSP and thought it was fine, but I dind't like the goofyness of the characters and the overall ""light"" tone of the narrative. This first part is, at least on that front, way way better. Try it, you won't regret it.

												Excellent gameplay, good music, interesting art style in game and in story book mode, emotional story with memorable characters. Didn’t expect much when I first saw this game, but I enjoyed it very much and competed it 3 times now. Oh and I recommend playing with Japanese audio so you can hear the amazing voice actors, more than a few are quite famous.			"

												Now that I've 100%'d this amazing game, having all the achievements, and getting A rankings on every battle, I might as well leave a review.I bought this game because I was attracted to the interesting gameplay screenshots (and the anime-esque graphics), and I must say, I am so glad I bought it. The gameplay experience was completely new to me, and it kept me hooked throughout the entire game. The plot wasn't mind-blowingly awesome, but it was definitely fantastic. The music and voice acting accompanying the battles/story scenes really fit the atmosphere.The difficulty of the game ranges from I'm-gonna-walk-through-the-crossfire-of-dozens-of-enemy-soldiers easy to full-hp-to-dead-while-transitioning-to-aim-mode hard. Don't push yourself for the A rank (winning in less turns means a better rank, A is the highest) on your first play through, especially with the story missions. Yes, you will get less EXP and DCT (money) for a lower rank, but that's what skirmish missions are for. You'll enjoy a slow and strong tactical advance rather than saving and reloading for the perfect outcome. Once you beat the game, then you can go for perfect runs. Personally, I never had a problem with the wide range in difficulty (there exists a balancing mod though). The only real gameplay problem I had was the tank controls.The plot wasn't mind-blowingly awesome like a Witcher game, but it was definitely fantastic. Each of the character designs were pretty good, but I wish SEGA had shown more on the back story on each of the major characters like the anime did (yes, there is an anime).On the technical side, the game does not frame skip. So if your computer can't keep up with the FPS setting in the configuration, then the game will slow down in order to render each and every frame. For example, if settings are at 30 FPS and your computer can only do 15 FPS, the game will run half as fast (but sounds will continue at the full speed). This allowed me to play this on my crappy laptop without worrying about dying because I couldn't see the enemy in time. I find this as more of a blessing rather than a curse.I fell in love with Valkyria Chronicles, and even shed man-tears at one point. I definitely recommend this game—totally worth the full price. 9/10.Additionally, if you loved the game, go watch the anime for it. It is definitely a ride of emotions, and stays mostly similar plot-wise to the original game, as well as elaborating on each of the pasts of the major characters. If you haven't played the game yet, though, I personally recommend at least beating the game before watching the anime.			"

												Playtime: I played through the whole game 2.5 times on PS3. Will eventually get around to play it on PC, too-Know that kind of games that innovate genres by creating interesting new gameplay concepts, instead of re-iterating stale franchises?Valkyria Chronicles is one of those. It combines squad-management(with limited upgrade-possibilities and character-specific boons and drawbacks), a turn-based battle-concept(where you get a limited amount of activations per turn, but CAN spend multiple activations on the same unit(which gets less movement with each activatio)) and semi-real-time during those activations(best watch a video on this, it would take take too long to explain in a way that could not be misunderstood).The plot and characters are good, if somewhat over-the-top, but if you played any japanese games in the past 20 years, you'll know what to expect. The art style is as unique as the gameplay, very fitting, and I definitely wish more games would use it. Sound is good if not outstanding.Most importantly, the settings(urban, grassland, desert, woods...) and mission objectives(interception, defense, reach point, destroy specific enemy, capture base, eliminate all enemies...) are varied and interesting. There are a few slight balance-issues(Scout OP), but on the whole, it's awesome, and not easy getting the best ranks.(Unless, of course, you play on NG+, which is a thing).TL,DR: I found this game and concept so awesome that despite already having played it several times on another system, I got it on Steam in the hopes of eventually getting the sequels released on steam as well.(even if the second part for PSP was inferior). It's a fresh new concept with unique gameplay, and the positive aspects vastly more dominant than a few small drawbacks.Thumb up, no doubt.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing RPG and I think SEGA did an amazing job on developing this game, it has memorable characters, beautiful artwork, and the storyline is original which this game is set during the World War II era. You can also play with tanks in this game. If you're a fan of RPGs and SEGA like myself, you definitely should play Valkyria Chronicles.			"

												This game is amazing not only does the combat system pay a close resemblance XCOM Enemy Unknown but the way please out as well the story is long and engaging almost 25 hours of gameplay not counting the Skirmish Maps depending on how you play the only con in the game is that you can't restart battle and rethink your strategies all of your units Must Die in order for the match to restart another thing worth mentioning is that this game tends to be difficult at times so you really need to use your brain power to think of a great strategy other than that I would definitely recommend picking this game up PS: the game has a lot of plot holes that don't get explained so I would definitely suggest watching the anime.

												A great strategy game similar in many ways to Xcom, but set in a WWII type scenario instead. It also adds its own unique additions to the various mechanics. The class upgrading is done across the board, so when you upgrade a character class(Scout, Shocktrooper, etc.), all characters of the scout class get upgraded to the next level. Same with upgrading weapons and unlocking new ones, everyone that can use it can equip it immediately without having to pay for it. And the game is very story rich.Whey it comes to the actual combat, it's turn based, where you have a bar that depletes as the character moves, and can shoot once per phase. You get a certain amount of 'Command Points' per turn, and you use that to make character act. So I can select Character A, in which I can now move and attack(or use an item). Then I can select another character and do the same until I finish using my Command Points. But I can also select Character A again if I wanted, but each consecutive 'selection' lowers how much movement points they get.Valkyria Chronicles has full controller support, however the Keyboard/Mouse controls are also wonderful, which is practically unheard of with PC ports. It also has 60FPS support too.If I had to desribe it in short, it would be like an Anime XCOM with far more depth and set in an alternate World War II. All in all, I definitely recommend this game, especially to Turn Based Strategy fans. Amazing game.			"

I guess that's just the way they designed that particular mission.- When assuming control of one of your soldiers, enemies can shoot you for a breif second causing you damage if you're scout rushing, you sit there for 1 second taking damage before you can actually move.

												Let me start with age-old sentence. This game was under my radar for long time, until it became game on my radar, but never on top priority list.Then voucher popped in my inventory and tought to finally try it out. At time of writing this review, im just 5,3 hours in and im still what feels very much in beginning. And this game is fantastic. Despite its cheerful looks, it also has dark side, as well as rather complex and interesting gameplay. Only real gripe i have is with using a tank. Though if you look for lot of action, you might not also like it, as it has LOT of story.Gameplay wise, one other thing needs mentioning: while it is fairly well ported, you can get somewhat confused at start by controls. But be assured- you can get over it fairly quickly (except mentioned tank).As for story? Well, its set in fictional world, where continent named Europa is in 2nd great war in 1935. While war is between 2 major alliances, Gallia is small country thats neutral. But one side- the empire (which i find great that it is based on both starters of ww2 (signers of molotov-ribbentrop pact), not just one)- decides to attack Gallia.And even with just those 5,3 hours, i've found several themes, that make it easier for me to relate my nations history (not as lucky as Gallia in ww2).EDIT: 10,3 hours in and story just keeps getting better.

												Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy game set in a fantasy World War II like time. This is a game I pretty much bought expecting a fun time, and it was much more than that. The story is rich and the characters feel real. They have personalities and backstories. They have relationships with eachother and you see that grow as you play the game. I wont lie itll tug on your heart strings at moments, but thats what sets this game above the rest. It handles how the war has its effects and impacts on each side and makes you feel for the characters. It paints the reality of what war can bring and the price of what it costs unlike other games. Last but not least the music is so on point for this game it brings every scene to life. The whole game is really a gem and i really believe it should win for the ""Im not crying, there's something in my eye"" award. The game mechanics are fun. One that I like is when you select the characters for any mission each one has people they like. Each will also have positive traits and negative traits that can come up durring a mission if you do something to trigger them which i thought is neat. gives you a reason actualy think about who to pair up. There are diffrent units who serve diffrent purposes like most other turn based games. The storys is decent lenghth. Not to long and deffinetly not to short. All in all this is a game that you should deffinetly pick up if you looking for a fun time and an incredible story to be told. 10/10 with out a doubt			"

												Hey you!?!? Yes you there, reading this review.Do you like turn based strategy games?Yes? good because this game has thatDo you like third person shooters?YES AGAIN?!?! well this game has that too....""but random dude on the internet, how can this game be both a TBSG AND a 3PS?"" well let me tell you dear Billy, can I call you Billy?....no? that's not your name? tooooo bad Billy because it is now. This game has a unique mix of turn based strategy and third person shooting because you control a rag tag Militia group ,fighting the evil Imperials in a pseudo WW1 setting. When you take control of a unit in the strategy mode, you'll go to a third person view of that unit, and the game goes full on real time on your♥♥♥♥♥just to ♥♥♥♥ with you, making enemies shoot at your poor little militia dude (most likely a Teen or an tiny little kid) as he/she follows your dumb♥♥♥♥♥orders Billy.Do you want a game filled with great charecters? (even if some of them are total weeb animu 1 dimensional characters)Yes? fantastic because this game has a huge selection of characters to choice from, and all with thier own little back-story, personallities and futures (that's assuming they survive your orders and dumb♥♥♥♥♥ideas BIlly)Do you want to give yourself a challenge and min/max the living f out of a game?Yes? GOOOOODDD because trying to win mission and senarioes on an A-rank, with the minimum amount of turns and units used is a gives you a truly great feeling of achievement, which we all know Billy that you crave like a crack ♥♥♥♥♥ craves money (unfortunately there is no S-rank for this version becasue this is the Weeb version and not the proper Asian version, because in nibon land A's just aren't good enough, that's why they aren't dumb dumbs like you Billy)Do you want a game with a unique style to it?Good, because this game looks like a drawn anime book, and let's face it Billy......you're pobably a total weebs and you're gonna buy it for thatNow doesn't that make you wanna buy this game Billy?.....no?..........did you just say NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO?!?! PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE THE SEQUALS IN THE WEST BILLY, GO DIE IN A FOREST FIRE WHILE BEING GANG♥♥♥♥♥♥♥BILLYTL:DR: BUYS THIS GAME SO WE CAN GET THE OTHER VALKYRIA CHONICLES GAME FROM THE STUPID♥♥♥♥♥ASIANS!!!

												This game deserves more praise than it gets. Despite fumbling around with the controls at the beginning, the gameplay is very enjoyable, similar to that of Fire Emblem. However I'd say the strongest point has to be its story, being one of the most memorable plots out there in the gaming market, a gem among gems. I highly recommended giving this game a shot, especially when a new game from the franchise is in the works.			"

												Really awesome game where it takes a unique twist on the turn-based tactics strategy gameplay. Its art style is beautiful and so does the story which make you part of the characters and the people who you wish to be fighting with you, that is if you followed the story xD. The controls are alright for me using a keyboard and mouse since this is an excellent port from the PS3(Also on the PS4 as a Remastered Edition).The description says what it is basically. Positioning is key here and sometimes there are moments that have hard missions with infinitely respawning enemies until you complete the objective, at the same time there are also easy missions which makes for a nice change of pace. Also, there are HUGE Maps which may take you longer than average to finish and it affects your mission rating. The game still has many things to do during or after the main story, and most of them have replay value.NOTE: Be prepared for grinding, though because of the DLC it actually lightens it if you can get an A rank, plus you get an awesome gun for the scouts in some DLC missions, save for the Ruhm as one of the best weapons in the game.Too bad this was not advertised anywhere. Though there is Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on other platforms, I just hope it gets ported(properly) to the PC in the future.Bought this since 3/21/2016 once I had a job, so yeah I admit I pirated such an awesome game.Rating:Gameplay: 9/10 (Some bugs and glitches encountered but nothing major)Story: 10/10Music: 9/10Graphics: 10/10Replayability: 9/10Value for Money: 10/10 (Even at full price or on sale like right now as of this writing)Overall: 9.4/10 - Highly recommend this game! Anime fans or not.			"

												I put in a lot of time with the original PS3 release and thought enough of the game to add it to my library and work my way through it once again on Steam.The art direction is top notch, and the cel shaded look will help to ensure that the visuals stand the test of time.  The soundtrack is solid, while the effects are nice and satisfying.  The story is very straightforward but remains fairly engaging due to an interesting cast of characters.With all that said, the gameplay is the real standout here.  A glorious hybrid of strategy and real time elements makes this game truly unique and engaging.  The top down map view lets you plot your next move and observe friendly and enemy positions, assuming you currently have eyes on them.  Spending CP during you turn will then allow you to either issue orders or jump into the shoes of one of your units on the battlefield.  Once you're directly in control of a soldier or vehicle, you'll be free to move about the field and fire - or be fired upon - in third-person mode until you've exhausted the unit's AP and/or manually end the turn.  The whole thing works beautifully and really opens the door for a wide variety of attack strategies depending on map layout and squad composition.  Sprinkle in some nice leveling and crafting mechanics, and you've got one heck of an SRPG.			"

												10/10 Game. Finished 4/01/17 at 20 Hours.Pros:- Fantastic Story- Fun and creative battles- Great progression system- A happy ending that's totally worth it- Wonderful Soundtrack- Cell shaded anime art style is superb- New game plus- Includes all DLC, perfect.A few complaints:- One mission in particular where enemies can call for reinforcements without a base camp. I guess that's just the way they designed that particular mission.- When assuming control of one of your soldiers, enemies can shoot you for a breif second causing you damage if you're scout rushing, you sit there for 1 second taking damage before you can actually move.

												Background: Played it on the Playstation back in the day and I am delighted to see DLC added.Combat Mechanics: Open Map, Strategic Turn based - Look its hard to describe this one. So you have a number of Action Points per round and each point can control an Infantry unit or 2 points for the Main Tank. There are various classes with set equipment and max movement allotment. Shooting wise, you line up the shots and then the computer takes over dealing with range, accuracy, etc. Line of Sight plays a big part in this game and should be thought about when forming a strategy.Military Downtime: Between your combat sequences there is a Huge amount of Lore behind this game and each character. Snippets of Conversation, movies, pictures all paint a rich detailed world with people who have families, wants and needs. It gives the game a more real feel and makes you care about the characters you control.Final Thoughts: I love a good story. Even though this one is 100% linear and very grindy at times it showcases what developers focused on back in the day. Great Art, good story, and thoughtful mechanics.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a little gem I never expected would hold my attention so firmly.  The game is effectively a small unit tactical strategy in the same vein as UFO: Enemy Unknown and similar games.  Your units use points to get around and have  one significant action per activation.  People who know this style of game will undestand this mechanic.  However unlike other versions of this mechanic you may activate untils based on Command Points which allows you to activate the same unit several times if needed though each time they have a reduced Action Point pool.The game was ledgendary on Sega and the port is a little clunky but still quite usable.  The biggest frustration is driving the tanks.  The graphics is intended to look like a comic book.  A series of animated sequences in panels.  The game play has the same look but using 3D models with rag doll physics.  So it keeps the feel of a comic book but has more modern engine.The real attraction to this game is the story. Once you get to know the characters you will put hours into the game to follow the story to its conclusion.  In addition, every character and soldier in the game has a back story you unlock during game play.  A single run through the game wont unlock them all so finding about about everyone takes some effort.Overall I think I'll be playing this game through at least two more times.  I will probably come back to it over and over for years to come.  Highly recommended and worth it.			"

												Easily one of my favorite games of all time; I wracked up 150+ hours on the PS3 version, and mainly bought this version just to support franchise, and holy crap is this game amazing.Story-wise, Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best stories on the market, at least in my opinion. It tells the tale of Welkin Gunther, the son of a famous EW1 (Europan War 1) hero and his rise to fame as the commander of Squad 7. I personally really enjoyed all the characters and lore, and while the story becomes slightly fatigued by the end, it still remains very strong overall, consistently giving great characters and fantastic story development.One of my favorite aspects of the game is how it handles this universe's equivalent to the Holocaust. The Darcsen - VC's stand-in for Jews - are shown to be consistently persecuted and even put in concentration camps, just like the real deal. The fact that the game showed how horrible these events were and done so with respect to the victim showed how big Sega Overwork's nuts were, as even today, discussing the Holocaust in a WW2 setting is something we rarely go forth and do. I won't spoil too much, but the way game tackles sensitive subjects in a realistic yet non-offensive way is something we really need in today's industry. Long story short, this game's story is fantastic, and is something that I wish is more reliably emulated today.As for the gameplay, think of it as a fusion between Fire Emblem and XCOM; the Fire Emblem element is present with SRPG themes and permadeath, while XCOM has real-time combat elements like cover systems, overwatch firing, and tactical squad gameplay. It overall works brilliantly in this game's favor, as every battle feels unique, and even grinding to become stronger is a hoot, especially with all the unique variety of battles you fight throughout the story. The only complaint I have is how awkward the controls are for tanks, but hey, I ain't complaining.Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is easily one of the best games I've ever played. Great story, great gameplay, beautiful graphics and music, fantastic port, AAA production values and indie-level quality. We need more games like this in the industry.Go get it. Now.			"

												There are plenty of things that make this a good game: from the fun gameplay, to the interesting story , to the large cast of characters. But there have been plenty of other reviewers who've already gone into much more depth then I have; So insted, let's talk about why I'm voting this as the ""Best use of farm animal in a video game award""And it's all because of this loveable flying pig here, HANS


Hans 
A Screenshot of Valkyria Chronicles™
By: MrSuicide




  Now you may be asking, ""What makes this little guy so special?"" well besides just being a cute flying pig, he's actually helped out his squad in plenty of other ways. While not a direct help on the battlefeild he proved his worth on the first day of the job. Hans finds 2 flank routes behind a enemy base in the woods, and with a 3 pronged assult on the base the enemy retreated, saving lives on both sides of the conflic. But he's not just usefull in the feild, he's also a great companion back at home base. Despite what you might think, he's actually pretty good help in the kitchen as he's helped the squad baker on several occasions. He's helped the boys blow off steam as he's wrestled with the strongest men in the camp. And he's he has a nak for burrowing his into the hearts of even the coldest people in the regiment like the sniper Marina, who never opens up to any of the people in the regiment but can occasionaly be seen hugging hans when she thinks no one is looking. I hope that I at least made some of you give this catagory a little thought, be it to remind people who played this game about this loveable little flying pig, or to those who haven't to see there are a few good options out there for this catagory... (even though something like goat simulator will probably win, but dang it, I'm going to try anyway)			"

Cringy.Well, what do you expect from an anime?UPDATE:The music, now that I've been playing it for a bit, has a...""Band Of Brothers"" vibe to it.

												This game pretty much nails controlling multiple characters in third person.You are asked to accept that gameplay mechanics require some suspension of disbelief (enemies don't shoot while you're aiming, weapons become ridiculously oversized as they are upgraded), but how is that different from any other video game? Gameplay is well balanced so that the first playthrough is sufficiently challenging, while the second playthrough is a speedrun for acheivements.Character development is really nice, with all ~55 squad members having cute/amusing/intersting backstories, personalities, and relationships with other characters - all of which is discovered through utilising each soldier.Story is fairly good, features the expansive worldbuilding and attention to detail in the writing that you generally expect from big JRPG titles.Did I mention that VC1 is really pretty? Because it is. This cell style looks good no matter how old it is. The visual style is sorely missed in later Valkyria games.TL;DR Fantastic game would 10/10 recommend.			"

												A fun and challenging strategy RPG that holds up by today's standards. It may not be too old of a game, but it did what it needed to do to engage players. Interesting art style: Definitely unique. Well-focused Narative: This could be the plot of a book or movie and it would be a hit. Memorable Characters: With the DLC that comes with the Steam purchase, even your  enemies  that you only fight one time get more character development than the main characters of some games get in their  ENTIRE  series! Challenging gameplay: This game does not have a massive learning curve, but certain levels in this game can be truly sadistic evil.  Assault rifle wielding boss who can dodge ALMOST ALL headon shots and can hit you with the accuracy and range of a SNIPER RIFLE anyone?  My one major gripe is the music is hit-and-miss at-times. Want to test your strategic might in a wartime scenario? Want to enjoy a compelling story? Want to get a challenge that will put your wits and sanity to the test? If you said yes to any of those questions, then what are you waiting for?P.S. If you think I was paid to give this review, the answer is NO! I respect the game and SEGA, but I will still point out their flaws. I see it as my way to help these companies evolve.			"

												I played this game when it was first released on PS3 and it's great through and through. This is a fantastic port, I was thoroughly suprised by how everything works perfectly, no control needed. I actually like the mouse and keyboard layout better for this one. If you like games like Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem then this game will fit you like a glove. The World War asthethics also makes the game very immersive. If you grew up playing japanese games you owe it to yourself to play this through this gem. Definitely a classic.			"

												One of my favourite games from the PS3, I played it through atleast four times back then.From what I have played here so far this looks to be a perfect conversion.Has a good storyline with well developed characters and better voice acting than I have seen in some PC games from the last two years. I have seen some people complain that it has a too sunny view on war which I find laughable as just in the opening 5 minutes you see the Empire displaying racism and willing to shoot women and children. I will admit that it does not go into the extreme darkness that can be seen in war but this is a game and if it were too realistic no one would play it as it would be no fun.You can easily play for pure fun and finish missions with a C or D grade but also you can choose to aim for B or even A grade and it is quite challenging and you will need your thinking cap to succeed.Some of the PC controls were a bit confsing for me but I have an XBox One controller and once plugged-in those controls are perfectly natural.

Valkyria Chronicles is a game that you either love or you hateThe game features a large cast of characters as you can build your squad, each member is well developed and has a story as to how they joined the force. The games story is well made and takes influence from WW2.The combat is sometimes challenging and you may end up restarting multiple times in order to keep certain units alive, but ultimately it is fun to play. The level scoring is based on turns taken to complete the level so this adds more challenge to the game if you wish for it.Ultimately i recommend this game and also hope for the psp sequals to be ported to steam			"

												I like to start with the bad first: I am not a big fan of anime, and a some of the tropes from that culture work their way into the game. Also, the game gives the impression that it may take the Fire Emblem route, and try to flush out the third-tier characters (as opposed to the main characters and the immediate supporting cast) but alas, aside from their brief sound bites and short bios you don't get much. The learning curve is a bit off, and the missions often tell you what you are supposed to do several turns in- after the point when you should already be executing the plan. Controls, particularly tank controls, are wonky on the PC port. There also seem to be characters which are far superior to others, cutting down on the mixing and matching you would normally do. The voice actors/animation for the two lead characters is sometimes cringeworthy. The good: A completely unique blend of tactical gameplay that kinda reminds me of Batallion Wars. At its core it is turn-based, but has enough real time elements to keep it interesting. It is also a game that really made me want to 100% it- getting A ranks on all the missions and having fun trying to figure out how to overcome each obstacle. The supporting cast to our two leads is impeccable, with interesting characters and great (albeat sometimes cheezy) acting. I got invested in the story, well, at least the first time through, and there are good moments which subvert the trope of treating warfare lightly in games. The verdict: Not in my top tier of games, but for the combat system alone I say that this game is a must-play for any semi-serious strategy fan. 8/10			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a little gem I never expected would hold my attention so firmly.  The game is effectively a small unit tactical strategy in the same vein as UFO: Enemy Unknown and similar games.  Your units use points to get around and have  one significant action per activation.  People who know this style of game will undestand this mechanic.  However unlike other versions of this mechanic you may activate untils based on Command Points which allows you to activate the same unit several times if needed though each time they have a reduced Action Point pool.The game was ledgendary on Sega and the port is a little clunky but still quite usable.  The biggest frustration is driving the tanks.  The graphics is intended to look like a comic book.  A series of animated sequences in panels.  The game play has the same look but using 3D models with rag doll physics.  So it keeps the feel of a comic book but has more modern engine.The real attraction to this game is the story. Once you get to know the characters you will put hours into the game to follow the story to its conclusion.  In addition, every character and soldier in the game has a back story you unlock during game play.  A single run through the game wont unlock them all so finding about about everyone takes some effort.Overall I think I'll be playing this game through at least two more times.  I will probably come back to it over and over for years to come.  Highly recommended and worth it.			"

												Background: Played it on the Playstation back in the day and I am delighted to see DLC added.Combat Mechanics: Open Map, Strategic Turn based - Look its hard to describe this one. So you have a number of Action Points per round and each point can control an Infantry unit or 2 points for the Main Tank. There are various classes with set equipment and max movement allotment. Shooting wise, you line up the shots and then the computer takes over dealing with range, accuracy, etc. Line of Sight plays a big part in this game and should be thought about when forming a strategy.Military Downtime: Between your combat sequences there is a Huge amount of Lore behind this game and each character. Snippets of Conversation, movies, pictures all paint a rich detailed world with people who have families, wants and needs. It gives the game a more real feel and makes you care about the characters you control.Final Thoughts: I love a good story. Even though this one is 100% linear and very grindy at times it showcases what developers focused on back in the day. Great Art, good story, and thoughtful mechanics.			"

												Easily one of my favorite games of all time; I wracked up 150+ hours on the PS3 version, and mainly bought this version just to support franchise, and holy crap is this game amazing.Story-wise, Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best stories on the market, at least in my opinion. It tells the tale of Welkin Gunther, the son of a famous EW1 (Europan War 1) hero and his rise to fame as the commander of Squad 7. I personally really enjoyed all the characters and lore, and while the story becomes slightly fatigued by the end, it still remains very strong overall, consistently giving great characters and fantastic story development.One of my favorite aspects of the game is how it handles this universe's equivalent to the Holocaust. The Darcsen - VC's stand-in for Jews - are shown to be consistently persecuted and even put in concentration camps, just like the real deal. The fact that the game showed how horrible these events were and done so with respect to the victim showed how big Sega Overwork's nuts were, as even today, discussing the Holocaust in a WW2 setting is something we rarely go forth and do. I won't spoil too much, but the way game tackles sensitive subjects in a realistic yet non-offensive way is something we really need in today's industry. Long story short, this game's story is fantastic, and is something that I wish is more reliably emulated today.As for the gameplay, think of it as a fusion between Fire Emblem and XCOM; the Fire Emblem element is present with SRPG themes and permadeath, while XCOM has real-time combat elements like cover systems, overwatch firing, and tactical squad gameplay. It overall works brilliantly in this game's favor, as every battle feels unique, and even grinding to become stronger is a hoot, especially with all the unique variety of battles you fight throughout the story. The only complaint I have is how awkward the controls are for tanks, but hey, I ain't complaining.Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is easily one of the best games I've ever played. Great story, great gameplay, beautiful graphics and music, fantastic port, AAA production values and indie-level quality. We need more games like this in the industry.Go get it. Now.			"

												Excellent turn-based action/strategy game. If you love oldschool turn-based RPGs you'll probably love this game.This game twists the old turn-based formula and makes units reactive outside of their turn, units attacking and counterattacking each other within a certain range. It really makes you plan your assaults.   That being said, there are only two real downsides for me.  1) Lots of cinematics between battles. Most of them are only 30 seconds to a couple of minutes long, but there are a lot of them. They set the story before battles. 2) This game is hard as balls if you're rusty on the strategy front, the tide can turn quickly for either side. You may find missions drag on until you get that one break in the enemy's defenses. It can be merciless, and you will lose units (permanently if you don't put another unit in danger to call a medic to the downed soldier).   Example: 3rd move into my turn, my scout turns a corner and just gets mowed down by a tank and two machine-gunners. He didn't stand a chance. If the enemy isn't in your line of sight their position and movements are unknown to you. Makes for some really hilariously bad situations.   Graphics: 10/10 - You can play in 1080p 60FPSAudio/Voice Acting: 9/10 - A decent variety of voice actors, though some are a bit too quiet. There isn't much talking outside of the cinematics or radio chatter while on the battlefield.Gameplay: 8/10 - Moving around some terrain is difficult with a mouse and keyboard. You clip edges of various things and get stuck, wasting a portion of your AP you need to move at all. However you can control the same unit multiple times (though with further reduced AP each time you control them) to advance them quickly. This helps to get machine-gunners and snipers with low AP caught up with the rest of your troops, at the cost of your command points each time. Plan accordinglyStoryline: 7/10 - The story is pretty neat. There's a lot of storytelling cinematics if you're into that. You may get annoyed by it if not.			"

												So many PC ports have dissapointed me, planting seeds of doubt and despair as to whether I'll ever see a halfway decent PC port in my lifetime. Until Valkyria Chronicles came along and invaded that land, uprooting those seeds, salting the grounds so that they may never take root again. Except Valkyria Chronicles isn't about invasion, so the analogy doesn't hold, yeah. I know. I'm sorry. I tried.This game is part Fire Emblem, part XCOM, and part pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dope. Characters are endearing, and the anime toon-shading here is absolutely gorgeous. This is one of those games that will age well, a la Windwaker, in both it's relatively simple, but elegant gameplay, as well as it's effortless charm. It didn't feel like a standard JRPG, so I'd even recommend it to friends who aren't quite into that genre. In fact, you know what? I'll end this review and do that now.Don't pass up this gem. If you do, I'll... I'll... well, I'll be sorry for your loss, I guess. It'll make me feel pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

Valkyria Chronicles is a game that you either love or you hateThe game features a large cast of characters as you can build your squad, each member is well developed and has a story as to how they joined the force. The games story is well made and takes influence from WW2.The combat is sometimes challenging and you may end up restarting multiple times in order to keep certain units alive, but ultimately it is fun to play. The level scoring is based on turns taken to complete the level so this adds more challenge to the game if you wish for it.Ultimately i recommend this game and also hope for the psp sequals to be ported to steam			"

												Do you like turn based strategy games? Do you like rolling up on mofo's who don't think you have a tank when guess what you have a tank?  Then this is the game for you!No but for real this is a game I knew nothing about for years then it popped up in an episode of Unskippable and then it popped up in a recommended for me in steam.Lets get something straight if you don't like turn based strategy games move on if you are like me and can't get enough of all of em again this is the game for you.  It mixes it up by swapping from  a map view to you pulling in third person and running them around the map and aiming manually.  It's more forgiving than say Fire Emblem or Xcom when it comes to damage and death.  If some one gets downed and you can run and touch them you can medivac them out with no repercusion, unless they are in a tank it's hard to recover from being in an exploded tank.But it's not with out challenge espeacially if you aim to s rank all the mission's like a sadist. Story wise I love it, the character's are great and diverse and learning more about them makes them more effective in the field undercertain conditions. Like say not putting you closterphobic engeneer in a trench where their accuracy goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥ grummble.Also holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's pretty, not your standard run of the mill bloom filled anime looking thing but more of a handdrawn pencil aesthetic.

												Definitely an amazing port from the PS3 as well as an amazing strategy game. If you enjoy the Fire Emblem games, I think you'll enjoy this as well. I found it on sale for $4.99 which is a steal considering you get the main game PLUS all the released DLC. It's definitely story heavy as the game is broken up into chapters with around 6 or so parts to each chapter with only one of those being a battle.From what I understand, it's loosely based off of WWII with a bit of a fantasy element to it as well. The story is amazing and the art style of the game is gorgeous. I thought originally that the ""cloudy"" border was going to bother me, but it turns out that eventually I just tuned it out.I was very on the fence about buying this game, but I'm SO glad that I did and would recommend it to any strategy game lovers.Oh, and most of the story parts are fully voice acted. Which I absolutely love.			"

												One of the best strategy games I've played in a long time. You'll laugh, you'll get angry, you'll feel sad and you can have hours of content. The story is amazing! I was always into it and I didn't see any problems with it.The art style is like a book. It will, at first, throw you off with the paper-like boarding around the screen when moving a soldier, however, I got used to it. It might have gone away because I didn't even stop to think about it.When playing this game, make sure to do the side missions a bit or you will loose a ton. The game is completely possible to beat without doing side battles, but you won't be having fun skipping a ton. Later game I didn't see much problem with it as I knew exactly what to look out for and I could upgrade my units for that. Oh and you will loose, you will loose a lot of late game missions. Just because you have to do a certain thing and you won't know til you loose. Maybe thats jsut me being bad at this game.At the current price of $20, it would no be a bad buy if you are willing to sink the time into it. If it is on sale for even 10%, you should buy this!

 Valkyria Chronicles	-  Fun turn based third-person shooter gameplay that requires you to think in each battle. -  Excellent customization; buying new equipment, weapons, armor, uniforms, and upgrading your tank(s) provides more than enough additions to keep your squad ever evolving. -  Running over enemy bodies can sometimes provide 'loot' giving new weapons and equipment at the end of each battle. This is a nice addition to the fairly large customization options. -  Recruiting members is a must at the start of the game if you wish to progress, a decent amount of stats are displayed for each character as you decide who to bring in to your squad. Each character is voice acted and has their own name which keeping you caring about each squad member as the non-story characters could die at any point if not healed by a medic. Each character also has their own set of 'potentials', for the most part this is extra stat boosts that can help mid-battle. These can also be un-helpful as some characters may have specific attributes that decrease their stats if put in a position that makes them uncomfortable. -  The story is layed out in chapters, and each chapter has episodes. It has a good length so you won't be left thinking the story is too short. Along with each chapter battle, there's a lot of cutscenes that are for the most part required to tell the full story. There are also side-episodes that you have the choice to watch, they go into great detail about the story so I'd say it's definetly worth going through if it's your first time playing. -  Works well with a controller or mouse and keyboard, I prefer mouse and keyboard but each to their own. -  The PC port is fantastic and it's presented no issues. I've had a better time with this port than the PS3 version so that says something. Overall it's a brilliant game that deserves more fans.I'm hoping the sequels get ported to PC but we'l find out in due time. I think the game could have used an online multiplayer feature since it has single-player skirmishes but I can't fault it for that. Valkyria Chronicles is an excellent singleplayer experience and well worth your time.9/10			"

												I like to start with the bad first: I am not a big fan of anime, and a some of the tropes from that culture work their way into the game. Also, the game gives the impression that it may take the Fire Emblem route, and try to flush out the third-tier characters (as opposed to the main characters and the immediate supporting cast) but alas, aside from their brief sound bites and short bios you don't get much. The learning curve is a bit off, and the missions often tell you what you are supposed to do several turns in- after the point when you should already be executing the plan. Controls, particularly tank controls, are wonky on the PC port. There also seem to be characters which are far superior to others, cutting down on the mixing and matching you would normally do. The voice actors/animation for the two lead characters is sometimes cringeworthy. The good: A completely unique blend of tactical gameplay that kinda reminds me of Batallion Wars. At its core it is turn-based, but has enough real time elements to keep it interesting. It is also a game that really made me want to 100% it- getting A ranks on all the missions and having fun trying to figure out how to overcome each obstacle. The supporting cast to our two leads is impeccable, with interesting characters and great (albeat sometimes cheezy) acting. I got invested in the story, well, at least the first time through, and there are good moments which subvert the trope of treating warfare lightly in games. The verdict: Not in my top tier of games, but for the combat system alone I say that this game is a must-play for any semi-serious strategy fan. 8/10			"

												Background: Played it on the Playstation back in the day and I am delighted to see DLC added.Combat Mechanics: Open Map, Strategic Turn based - Look its hard to describe this one. So you have a number of Action Points per round and each point can control an Infantry unit or 2 points for the Main Tank. There are various classes with set equipment and max movement allotment. Shooting wise, you line up the shots and then the computer takes over dealing with range, accuracy, etc. Line of Sight plays a big part in this game and should be thought about when forming a strategy.Military Downtime: Between your combat sequences there is a Huge amount of Lore behind this game and each character. Snippets of Conversation, movies, pictures all paint a rich detailed world with people who have families, wants and needs. It gives the game a more real feel and makes you care about the characters you control.Final Thoughts: I love a good story. Even though this one is 100% linear and very grindy at times it showcases what developers focused on back in the day. Great Art, good story, and thoughtful mechanics.			"

												Valkyria Chronicles is a little gem I never expected would hold my attention so firmly.  The game is effectively a small unit tactical strategy in the same vein as UFO: Enemy Unknown and similar games.  Your units use points to get around and have  one significant action per activation.  People who know this style of game will undestand this mechanic.  However unlike other versions of this mechanic you may activate untils based on Command Points which allows you to activate the same unit several times if needed though each time they have a reduced Action Point pool.The game was ledgendary on Sega and the port is a little clunky but still quite usable.  The biggest frustration is driving the tanks.  The graphics is intended to look like a comic book.  A series of animated sequences in panels.  The game play has the same look but using 3D models with rag doll physics.  So it keeps the feel of a comic book but has more modern engine.The real attraction to this game is the story. Once you get to know the characters you will put hours into the game to follow the story to its conclusion.  In addition, every character and soldier in the game has a back story you unlock during game play.  A single run through the game wont unlock them all so finding about about everyone takes some effort.Overall I think I'll be playing this game through at least two more times.  I will probably come back to it over and over for years to come.  Highly recommended and worth it.			"

												Easily one of my favorite games of all time; I wracked up 150+ hours on the PS3 version, and mainly bought this version just to support franchise, and holy crap is this game amazing.Story-wise, Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best stories on the market, at least in my opinion. It tells the tale of Welkin Gunther, the son of a famous EW1 (Europan War 1) hero and his rise to fame as the commander of Squad 7. I personally really enjoyed all the characters and lore, and while the story becomes slightly fatigued by the end, it still remains very strong overall, consistently giving great characters and fantastic story development.One of my favorite aspects of the game is how it handles this universe's equivalent to the Holocaust. The Darcsen - VC's stand-in for Jews - are shown to be consistently persecuted and even put in concentration camps, just like the real deal. The fact that the game showed how horrible these events were and done so with respect to the victim showed how big Sega Overwork's nuts were, as even today, discussing the Holocaust in a WW2 setting is something we rarely go forth and do. I won't spoil too much, but the way game tackles sensitive subjects in a realistic yet non-offensive way is something we really need in today's industry. Long story short, this game's story is fantastic, and is something that I wish is more reliably emulated today.As for the gameplay, think of it as a fusion between Fire Emblem and XCOM; the Fire Emblem element is present with SRPG themes and permadeath, while XCOM has real-time combat elements like cover systems, overwatch firing, and tactical squad gameplay. It overall works brilliantly in this game's favor, as every battle feels unique, and even grinding to become stronger is a hoot, especially with all the unique variety of battles you fight throughout the story. The only complaint I have is how awkward the controls are for tanks, but hey, I ain't complaining.Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is easily one of the best games I've ever played. Great story, great gameplay, beautiful graphics and music, fantastic port, AAA production values and indie-level quality. We need more games like this in the industry.Go get it. Now.			"

												There are plenty of things that make this a good game: from the fun gameplay, to the interesting story , to the large cast of characters. But there have been plenty of other reviewers who've already gone into much more depth then I have; So insted, let's talk about why I'm voting this as the ""Best use of farm animal in a video game award""And it's all because of this loveable flying pig here, HANS


Hans 
A Screenshot of Valkyria Chronicles™
By: MrSuicide




  Now you may be asking, ""What makes this little guy so special?"" well besides just being a cute flying pig, he's actually helped out his squad in plenty of other ways. While not a direct help on the battlefeild he proved his worth on the first day of the job. Hans finds 2 flank routes behind a enemy base in the woods, and with a 3 pronged assult on the base the enemy retreated, saving lives on both sides of the conflic. But he's not just usefull in the feild, he's also a great companion back at home base. Despite what you might think, he's actually pretty good help in the kitchen as he's helped the squad baker on several occasions. He's helped the boys blow off steam as he's wrestled with the strongest men in the camp. And he's he has a nak for burrowing his into the hearts of even the coldest people in the regiment like the sniper Marina, who never opens up to any of the people in the regiment but can occasionaly be seen hugging hans when she thinks no one is looking. I hope that I at least made some of you give this catagory a little thought, be it to remind people who played this game about this loveable little flying pig, or to those who haven't to see there are a few good options out there for this catagory... (even though something like goat simulator will probably win, but dang it, I'm going to try anyway)			"

												Mindless fanboys and downvoters are not welcome. Read on only if you actually are interested in what I have to say.Valkyria Chronicles by its anime adaptation and slightly belated PC portover from the consoles it was originally made to run on is without a doubt one of the better known Japanese games on the Western market with a fairly significant fanbase, and at first glance seemingly well deserved reputation. Shortly after the initial release on Steam, it quickly became popular even among those who have never heard of it before for the setting it takes place in and a peculiar kind of gameplay people often liken to other titles such as the X-COM series. Unfortunately however, while it does have its good points, it is not a masterpiece which only becomes appearant later on.It all begins with a short but very atmospheric introduction to the story taking place in an alternate timeline, where political struggles and frequent conflicts over the dwindling supplies of a precious resource lead to increasing tensions between the major powers of Europa, either side only waiting for the moment to strike at the other. A conflict which may seem insignificant to those involved in it on the surface, but in a single moment may become the flame that engulfs everything, leaving the ones facing their adversary with seemingly no choice but to surrender. Unless something that counters the invading forces breaks to the surface, a power that transcends the mists of time and within hold the key not only to our oldest legacies, but to who we are as well.FIRE ONE: COMBATLikely not a surprise to say that either in games or elsewhere when you try to shoot someone, they shoot back. This is one of the first points where VC falls short on expectations, because due to some strange design consideration the moment you pick up your weapon, the AI stops completely, allowing you to take your time aiming before emptying the magazine into their heads, sometimes from point blank range. Even more interesting is the fact that 3 out of 5 classes will NEVER try to resist even if you are right in front of them, further emphasizing the problem.It is also possible and a known exploit to position your troops in a way that will make the AI shoot its own soldiers, since the inherently flawed script cares not if anything happens to be in the way when they attack. One could certainly find this amusing since it gives the player many opportunities to have a good laugh, but after a few times it just becomes sad, especially since many hail this as one of the best features it has.FIRE TWO: PSEUDO RPGAnother prominent feature is VC's own version of the classic level up system which rewards XP and credits at the end of a mission, that can be used to upgrade units in the training grounds or the garage. The problem with this is the fact that instead of individual units the game raises the stats of entire classes at once there leading to another serious exploit, since by grinding a class challenge from early on in the game you can farm ridiculous amounts of XP and funds which quite literally turns otherwise precious reward into a cheap currency that can be amassed as long as one likes. You also get near limitless access to one of the most powerful scout rifles you can find and enough money to buy everything from the shop for the tanks without ever being close to running low, meaning you can blitz through most if not all missions without much effort even at the very end of the story.Then we also have the characters who make up Squad 7 with all sorts of interesting backgrounds, which may give the impression that they are all unique sorts of people. They are not.The traits unlocked at various stages are all variations of the same copypasted abilities, some of which are gamebreakingly strong once invoked randomly or by orders, while others make half the cast a liability, never to see the day they sortie. This is especially obvious with Alicia who can win any mission that doesn't necessitate tank hunters by herself, with complete disregard to enemy fire ranging from infantry rifles to heavy machine guns. No matter how one would try to explain this, it is a very poor design, killing any semblance of challenge and realism especially when the infamous tactic known as scout rush is involved too.FIRE THREE: THE PLANSince the game rates one's success not by how effectively they complete the operation but by how many turns it takes, it pretty much forces the player to hurry as much as possible regardless of danger if they want to get the related achievements. The problem with this is that without advance knowledge of the enemy positions there's little chance of getting A rank on a mission because the tactical map is worthless and until visual contact there's no way to predict what's behind the next corner. As a result the player could get caught in a crossfire out of nowhere anytime, leading to significant delays or possibly loss of troops if you're not quick enough. It is worth to mention that not even fatal head injuries will kill friendly units outright so long as they get a medic which can't be said about the enemy.There's also the random nature of this game which is the epitome of chaos theory itself with complex mathematical factors inconceivable to mortal men influencing the AI's decision on where to direct every bullet and artillery shell, sometimes right on target, other times going way off the map. On the other hand, if you happen to find just the right spot and direction, it's possible to destroy several targets without actually engaging them, relying solely on shots that were not supposed to happen.The finishing blow is that while some Gallians can be incapacitated by enemy fire, everybody seems to be immune to runovers from tanks, as any attempt from doing so will only shove them to the side. Most unusual, given what a vehicle of such proportions can do.FIRE FOUR: PLOTHOLESWhile it may be more noticable to some it should still be mentioned how many plotholes and openly presented deus ex machinas can be found here at closer look, turning an atmospheric story into one of great disappointment. These are but a few, as listing all of them would fill a smaller phone book.The Edelweiss. I'm fairly certain no army would just let a civilian keep a functional tank in their garage with fuel AND ammunition to boot. The ingame explanation for that is insufficient since designing a vehicle doesn't mean they get to keep one. Especially this kind.In a certain battle one character curb stomps another without even breaking a sweat. There's no logical or even illogical explanation for that to happen with the exception of being protected by plot armor, since the scenario writer decided to make that loss a focal point in the story, regardless of how unreasonable it is.FIRE FIVE: BEHIND HER BLUE FLAMEThe only saving grace of VC at this point is Selvaria's mini campaign which lets the player take control of her and a small Imperial unit around the fortress of Ghirlandaio. It is everything the main storyline should have been actually challenging, a sense of accomplishment and the final mission which could bring tears of joy to the eyes of those who can appreciate it. The difference in quality is so stark, it couldn't be more obvious and raises the question of why not making a storyline for each side, one from Squad 7 and the other from Selvaria's viewpoint. It would have alleviated much of the misgivings about this game without actually giving victory to the Empire.Valkyria, valkyriaAs promising as it started out Sega's popular title turned into only a mere shadow of what it could have been, giving up the possibility of a great chronicle for a game of superficiality that leaves a different kind of lasting impression. Therefore, one should be careful with their expectations before playing it, lest they become disappointed. Only buy it when on sale and only after giving careful consideration.			"

												Okay so I've only played around 2 or 3 missions so far but I must say this game is pretty great, and that's coming from someone who absolutely despises both strategy and turn based games (especially strategy.)I've tried older and newer Fire Emblem games and I tried incredibly hard to like them but I find it hard to enjoy the games even for 10 minutes due to the strategic combat. As for turn based games, I can count the ones I enjoy on one hand and I probably won't use all 5 fingers of that hand.Even though I've just started Valkyria Chronicles, I am already enjoying the story, characters, and gameplay. I expected to enjoy the story as I've heard good things about it, but it was a big gamble whether I would enjoy the gameplay or not, but I do indeed enjoy it.As for graphics, I prefer style over texture/resolution any day. I've heard people say a lot of bad things about the graphics, but honestly they don't bother me a bit so I don't know why people care so much.I will update this review once I get farther into the game, but I wanted to hurry up and upvote the game asap because I was enjoying this game too much.

This game really does show a lot about how war can change everything. For a game that takes place in European World War II so much happens in that span of time. Losing family members and soldiers that are close to you and others is heartbreaking. Gallia and the Empire have been in war for quite a bit but yes Gallia does win the war (Spoiler Alert). Our main characters Welkin and Alicia really do learn more about each other as they fight through war and start to create their own relationship between each other but Welkin creates the Squad and Squad 7 is born and on their way to stop this war once in for all and get their hometown back again Bruhl.As for gameplay goes, this game can be very strategist because you really need to think about who you send out for Operations and how you will carry out your plan to win that Operation. The combat system is pretty simple but all Soldiers gain more power as they level up with experience and find more guns to upgrade. And the tank Edelweiss is your only tank that you will need to use and protect and upgrade that's until you met Zaka who is also a Tank Commander and you will have two tanks to use and upgrade.This game has a great story and it's soundtrack is wonderful as well. Strategist games really do help me think about my actions more so I don't make stupid moves. A great game but also hard as well if you don't know what you're doing.I'll rate it 8/10.  "

												I wasnt planning on buying VC again here on Steam, I've logged over 200+ hrs on Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, I even bought a PS Vita just to play VC2 (even better than VC1). My jaw literally dropped when I saw VC on the Steam store page earlier this year. Finally! PC users who werent exposed to this console gem were in for an amazing treat. In my personal opinion Valkyria Chronicles was the best RPG/Tactical game released on the PS3, and one of my favourite games of all time. The art style is just stunning and really suits the atmosphere and presentation of the game.COMBAT:The combat system is unique and something that I very much enjoyed. It is turned based, you are given a specific amount of AP per round, generally 1 AP per turn but you are able to move freely for a limited time instead of x-amount of tiles or squares per turn. You are able to use line of sight and crouch or lie down for cover. There is an overwatch type system in place and you can get support fire from friendly units who are near by. Ofcourse the enemy can do all this as well and the A.I. on the PS3 wasnt too shabby.Each class has is specific roles and compliment each other on the battle field, some classes neutralize each other in a rock/paper/scissors way. Finding the right mix of what class to fill out your squad with for each battle is also part of the strategy. Even more impressive is that depending on which characters are in your squad their class abilities can become enhanced with perks/skills specific to that character. Then there are commander battle orders you can use for a cost of AP that can effect the map in a variety of ways depending on which ones you've unlocked/learned.There is a ton of relplayability with VC since you can go back and repeat missions previously cleared and take on some of the bonus EX extra skirmishes. These are great ways to level up your squad and gain materials for upgrading gear and weaponry.THE STORY:The cast of characters is large, espcially with your squad. Everyone has their own reasons for joining the war and each squad member has their own personal line of missions to complete. The personalities between squad mates is great, some mesh better with others and some negatively... so much so that it can effect the way things play out on the battle field for certain squad mates.There are a lot of game companies that have done titles on war or great wars and generally leave it on the large scale end of things inregards to story telling and dont get to invested with the personal aspects of the struggles and horrors that war brings. VC does not shy away from this and even though the characters and events are fictional, the story touches on some sensative matters that few games in the war genre have.The Valkyria Chronicles franchise is truly something special, the overwhelming number of positive reviews across the media prove this. If you are still on the fence about wether to purchase this or not, do yourself a favour and pick this up.			"

												What an amazing game! The anime and soundtrack are beautiful, and the story blows you away. It's so well made. I never thought I would enjoy an anime game this much (animes aren't really my cup of tea). I got really attached to the characters and couldn't do anything else in the same day than playing the game. It's so addictive, you just want to keep playing more and more, and when the game is over you still want more and more. Such a shame the 2 sequels were PSP-exclusive though, it's about time they make one for PC players. It also has turn-based combat mixed with third person, which is very interesting. It's just brilliant.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The artwork is nice and the game mechanic plays well. The story line can drag on at points, with many visual scenes to watch between the combat. It is possible to pseudo-cheat in these battles, as you can save at any point and so can repeat battles phases when it doesn't go your way. That being said this doesn't make the combat less enjoyable. There is also a lot of enjoyment watching your scouts blow up enemy tanks and bunkers. If you are a fan of Advanced Wars, I would recommend this game for you.			"

												I still do not understand the reason Steam cannot transfer playtime over from offline mode, but I would like to mention my playtime has been over 80 hours for three good reasons: combat with that slick free roaming tactical shooting, storyline with a rich retelling of a scenario we played a thousand times before (even if the anime-shojo stereotypes in this game make me want to punch a wall) and the endless replayability of the core structure. I will say this game is not perfect though. The menus are annoying to navigate, the game chugs massively at random spurts of time during key moments of outflanking or outrunning, the tactical approach can be laughable if you consider taking all of your turns with one character to clear a field out (though in reflection the same could be said with the enemy luckily rolling a 20 and having the same chance once ever blue moon) and the length can be on the short side depending on your measure of a long game.Some other points I did like to put toward the games favor is the voice-acting and the amazing visual appeal. Some other points directly against it, however, is the dialog (depending on if anime is your thing).Honestly though, this game is a time-absorber. I spent 20 hours playing before realizing the new day approached. Get this game because you wont see anything like it before or for a long time in the future. At least until they get smart and release the second (ARRRGH ANIME SUCKS!) and third one (WHY CANT ANIME BE LIKE THIS GOLDEN GEM!)			"

												I don't think I've ever seen a combat system that is so teribly much based on rock paper scissors...handgrenade kills a scout, but does 5% dmg on a lancer. Shocktroopers kill heavily armored soldiers within 15 meters easily, but if they're 18m away, they only do like 3% dmg ?! This is ridiculous.Bottom line is, you exactly need to know in advance what's happening and what troops you'll need and where, or you won't stand much of a chance. Either be ready for some serious try-and-error or read a walkthrough before every mission.The story itself is nice, and I like the idea of having extra skirmishes to level up, but the combat system is just a shame.

												From a Fire Emblem and complete fan at tactical games... This game is fantastic!!! (Its like a WWII Fire Emblem)  I did not have a Playstation 3 which means I did not know of this game until I read about it while playing as one of the characters in Project X Zone (don't judge me XD), so I went to check it out and to find out it was on steam.  I was not dissapointed at all and got far more than my money's worth.  The gameplay is fun and original.  I love how important it is to place people and how crucial it is to have a proper matchup depending on the weapons class.  I like that you get to play in third person shooter.  The story is well developed and interesting which fits the characters in this game.  The characters are fun and unique and I think its super cool that each person's personality and background affects their potentials in battle.  I also love the sketch book water color art style which in its own way makes environments quite wonderful to look at. The one trouble I have with it is that the story seems to end too short and I can't get enough of this masterpiece.  Also there are animation errors when it was ported.  Like the eye patch floating around on the training instructor, or the detached arm on Maria, or the crown on Maximilian.  I also wish I could skip or at least fast forward enemy turns that end up not attacking you.  Though those minor errors is nothing to make me love this game less.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a good			"

												This game really needs an autosave feature.Game hangs several times now to which I losses the xp and upgrades I did which is very annoying as I need to do it all over again from the previous saves.If you don't save often, then your out of luck as you need to do it all oven again from your last save game.Saving everytime takes the fun out of this bloody good game.

												One of the best games I've ever played. Rich narrative, gorgeous visuals, strong mechanics and all in an excellent port.It's more than worth the $20 price tag; don't be turned away because it's a port of a six year old game; besides the video cutscenes, which are a little grainy, the game looks wonderful on my 1920x1080 monitor.

												I have not completed the campain yet (getting close - I'm taking my time with it and have spent 63 hours in the game this far), but this is a great game. I was worried that the real time parts of the turned based gameplay wouldn't suit me (I can't handle shooters), and it was slightly disorienting at first, but after the first two battles, I'd gotten the hang of it.It is fun to play, and I also find the characters engaging.

												From a Fire Emblem and complete fan at tactical games... This game is fantastic!!! (Its like a WWII Fire Emblem)  I did not have a Playstation 3 which means I did not know of this game until I read about it while playing as one of the characters in Project X Zone (don't judge me XD), so I went to check it out and to find out it was on steam.  I was not dissapointed at all and got far more than my money's worth.  The gameplay is fun and original.  I love how important it is to place people and how crucial it is to have a proper matchup depending on the weapons class.  I like that you get to play in third person shooter.  The story is well developed and interesting which fits the characters in this game.  The characters are fun and unique and I think its super cool that each person's personality and background affects their potentials in battle.  I also love the sketch book water color art style which in its own way makes environments quite wonderful to look at. The one trouble I have with it is that the story seems to end too short and I can't get enough of this masterpiece.  Also there are animation errors when it was ported.  Like the eye patch floating around on the training instructor, or the detached arm on Maria, or the crown on Maximilian.  I also wish I could skip or at least fast forward enemy turns that end up not attacking you.  Though those minor errors is nothing to make me love this game less.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a good			"

												Be advised, this isn't a full review (mostly just me ranting about bugs and poor gameplay choices) so take this into perspective along with someone else's review.I want to love this game. I want to embrace it's uniqueness and charm, but the details turned it sour. The game has bugs. Alot of them since it was ported to PC. Tanks get caught on parts of the environment which causes them to move slowly and can't turn unless you completely stop the tank, but by then you already used a quarter of your movement and can't  execute your plan. Soldiers shoot walls that are a foot left from where they're aiming and waste your entire action. Soldiers get more accurate when they can see an enemy and from your third person perspective, you can see a dude only slightly that your character can easily shoot from theirs, yet the targeter is finicky and even if their bullets can hit the dude, if you don't see the whole guy, they are essentially blind firing. Things like that caused me to get easily frustrated and made me reload time after time, but there's more. The game doesn't give you many specifics and displays some strange choices. Like how you don't know the radius of mortars or grenades and that you character can only throw grenades one meter. Shraight shot explosives like their infantry anti-tank lancers and AP tank rounds have an obnoxiously large circle for their spread. The game uses two reticules for spread on a shot: one which shows the maximum spread of that weapon and a smaller one which shows whether or not you can see a target/within your maximum range. For some reason the smaller is the one that gets smaller when you can see a target and your accuracy increases. This leads to a confusing predicament of trial and error on how much more accurate your shots can be and on one shot weapons, this can be killer. The overhead map that they show you also isn't very detailed at all and you can't see if the enemy is behind a sest high wall or waist high sand bags and also whether or not that enemy is crouching or stnding (which is a big deal in this game). The list goes on: Your units can't crouch behind anything that isn't sand bags, trying to position a unit to be slightly covered by wall but still be able to shoot an enemy is a nightmare, etc, etc.Look, the game has a great storyline and it's combination of RTS and Turn-based strategy is really cool. You will reload so that no main character gets knocked out ever, because you care that much. In case you haven't noticed, I've only played like 6 hours on this. While I can't tell you about the endgame, I can say that I already consider my buy worth it, even with all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But I cannot in good judgement recommend this game without a lengthy warning exactly like this.			"

												TL;DR: There are very little strategy or tactic components in VC; it is more like an animate visual novel that allows players to re-enact the battles following a pre-written script. Watch the animated version if you don't have time to spare.I actually somewhat don't hate this game, especially given the fact that it's first published on PS3 in 2008.The graphic is ok, the fully animated and voiced cutscenes shows good effort, the plot is kinda cheesey but still acceptable ( just like most of the Japanese animates), it also offers a good variety of weapons and skills to choose from, it's somehow an acceptable turn-based strategy/tactical game. However, I still cannot recommend it.The biggest problem VC has is it doesn't really have any AI system in it's NPCs and enemies. All enemy units just move to their predetermined positions and using specific skills every turn regardless of the situation, and will sit there until the end of the world if you don't bother to get in contact with them. There is little (or next to nothing) ""creative"" or ""your own way"" of playing this game except following the walkthrough. Almost every stage can be solved in less than 5 turns if you follow the walkthrough to the very extent (by that I mean: move the specific character to a specific location and doing exactly what the guide tells you to), otherwise you will have a quiet difficult fight and receive low score. It's somewhat sad to see how this game fails to deliver more tactic or strategy essences to its players. I mean, it has a decent basic system and good graphic (2008 standard) with full voice cast, and will be a great game if you can play it like XCOM, Shadowrun, or Heroes of M&M. BTW, if you really are interested in the story of VC, but don't want to go through the whole game following guides, I would recommend you to watch the animate version of Valkyria Chronicle. It has 25+1 episodes that basically follow the plotline in game with some minor variation and additional stories.ps: as a Japanese speaker, I must say the translation of English subtitles are horrible, although they somewhat make senses by themselves, the meanings are often way off the original voice casts. ex: Selvaria is a Colonel, never a Brigade General, and she was almost always being addressed as ""Daisa""(romanji pronunciation for Colonel in jpn) by her comrades and soldiers instead of her name.

												The single most frustrating game I've ever played. It's XCOM on steroids. You have to take risks and if you miss because the enemy randomly ducks (they do this, a lot) or because 99% isn't 100%, just reload your save. I was to the point I was save scumming EVERY MOVE because the missions are tuned so tight that one bad RNG and everything falls apart. Missions include shooting a tank 50 times while an invincible mega chick runs around 1 shotting people every turn. Or shooting an armored car point blank for 5 turns (about 25 moves) and reloading everytime the machine gun headshots you. Dare I talk about the grading system? You get a grade based on how quickly you complete the mission. If you want a good grade, you buff a scout and run straight to the end camp. If you do literally anything else you will get a C or worse. You get poor grades and you'll be grinding skirmishes to unlock upgrades so that some missions are even possible.The art is great, the story is great, the voice acting is great, yet I still can't get through the game. There's no difficulty settings and the game is downright infuriating every step of the way. Such a disappointment.			"

												TBS RPG combo is my favorite game type, but there aren't too many great ones out there. To do well in this game requires a strategy that is counter-intuitive and not fun to me. If you play a more standard strategy (using cover, advancing as a team) the game gives you a bad grade at the end of each mission and you're rewarded with less XP and money. While it doesn't make the game unplayable, it does make it less enjoyable to not be equally rewarded for playing a different playstyle than what the game intended.The tank is very hard to control in any direction that isn't forward. Since you action points are directly related to movement, it makes the tank not even worth using on certain missions.It has a pretty standard story with some decent humor to it, but nothing that I would say is worth it to play the game just to experience.As much as I really wanted to enjoy this game, I can't.

												This game is pretty bad and has alot of flaws that make it very frustrating to play. RNG being the main factor in the outcome of most attacks makes no sense in a tactical game. Setting up a great strategy just for your character to miss a point blank shot makes this game bad. The game does not take things like distance into consideration when attacking and leads to many failures, especially where snipers and lancers are concerened. The characters are very cliche but are done very well. However where the game gives you many options to add to your squad I find I use the same ones over and over due to them having better traits. The game does a bad job on pacing also. Where you can get new types of weapons they are often terrible in terms of range and accuracy causing the bad RNG to pop up more often. This can be offset by buying upgrades for these weapons but the upgrades are not available until towards the end of the game. As of this review I have been through 8 chapters and still no upgrades for weapons that I have taken off of enemies leaving my only option the starting weapons.Balance is very poor also with scouts being your best unit in almost all battles and lancers being some of the worst, only really good for taking out tanks and getting the very rare lucky shot. The game also gives you access to skirmishes which are good and allow the player to repeat past battles but they also give the player access to special class only skirmishes which are outright impossible in the beginning.All in all it is a shame as this game has all the bearings of a classic but the devs took it into a lazy direction. If the devs put a little more time into the game and did not rely on RNG so much then this would have been a must have. Do not buy it unless it is on sale and your thing is trial and error gameplay rather than tactical planning.			"

												Played this on the PS3 and played the PC version for only the DLC while I also played a few chapters to get back the feeling on how the game worked.Its one of the best games I played on the PS3. Its closest game I can compare is XCOM.The only thing ""bad"" I would say is that the Rating system (on some stages) is designed to make you play the game without actually enjoying it. It forces the player to be precise with its actions and actually disregarding your main force and to use only a few characters.  to be as efficient as possible.For example in the DLC the only way to be Rank A on your 1st playthrough is to know already that one of the characters you are using MUST already be on the other side of the Map. You literaaly have no reason to even go there but as soon as the story tells you, your rank is already degraded to B.			"

												This is by right THE best RPG/turn-based strategy game I have ever played or seen. The graphics are also truly exceptional. This game was released in 2008, probably about 6 years before its release on Steam and almost 7 until the writing of this review, and the graphics are still stunning. The unique engine the game uses literally makes the scenes in the virtual book to come alive, while they still look like drawings with pencil and watercolours. Even if you normally don't like anime, you should still play this game. It is exceptional. The plot is also amazing. I don't normally watch anime or play anime-based games, but this one is exception. This is the example of what an amazing story can be told through a video game and of how well it can be told.The characters are really life-sized. Like what you could normally find in a book - and  I mean, a really, really good book - here, the characters are also so alive, so real, that you forget that they are imaginary.The characters you meet in the game are very diverse and in many cases simple black-or-white morality would not apply to them. You are a squad leader in militia and all of your squad members are individuals with certain likes, dislikes, medical conditions, phobias and talents. Some of your key squad members are racist or sexist while others can get distracted by their squadmates to chitchat. At the same time, in certain conditions, they are able to perform significantly better due to them being in a very familiar environment or surrounded by close friends. Many of the enemies are not really just ruthless psychopathic murderers either - many of them were really just made to fight you by their superiors while actually they easily relate to you and on certain occasions when it matters, they will arrange your survival even though it thwarts the goals of their commander. The gameplay is fun and frequently is also very tactical. You will have to use the advantages the given terrain offers you and exploit weaknesses in the enemy's defence to your advantage.  There are several unit classes and as I previously said, each of the units is unique in his/her way.Really buy this game. You will never regret playing it. I assure you. 10/10			"

												This is by right THE best RPG/turn-based strategy game I have ever played or seen. The graphics are also truly exceptional. This game was released in 2008, probably about 6 years before its release on Steam and almost 7 until the writing of this review, and the graphics are still stunning. The unique engine the game uses literally makes the scenes in the virtual book to come alive, while they still look like drawings with pencil and watercolours. Even if you normally don't like anime, you should still play this game. It is exceptional. The plot is also amazing. I don't normally watch anime or play anime-based games, but this one is exception. This is the example of what an amazing story can be told through a video game and of how well it can be told.The characters are really life-sized. Like what you could normally find in a book - and  I mean, a really, really good book - here, the characters are also so alive, so real, that you forget that they are imaginary.The characters you meet in the game are very diverse and in many cases simple black-or-white morality would not apply to them. You are a squad leader in militia and all of your squad members are individuals with certain likes, dislikes, medical conditions, phobias and talents. Some of your key squad members are racist or sexist while others can get distracted by their squadmates to chitchat. At the same time, in certain conditions, they are able to perform significantly better due to them being in a very familiar environment or surrounded by close friends. Many of the enemies are not really just ruthless psychopathic murderers either - many of them were really just made to fight you by their superiors while actually they easily relate to you and on certain occasions when it matters, they will arrange your survival even though it thwarts the goals of their commander. The gameplay is fun and frequently is also very tactical. You will have to use the advantages the given terrain offers you and exploit weaknesses in the enemy's defence to your advantage.  There are several unit classes and as I previously said, each of the units is unique in his/her way.Really buy this game. You will never regret playing it. I assure you. 10/10			"
