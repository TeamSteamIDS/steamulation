												Pros:1. Simple but good graphics. Graphically the best Panzer General Clone in the market2. Long single player campaign. I think it take you more than 30 hours to compelete it3. More accesible to casual gamers than Panzer CorpsCons:1. No multiplayer2. No additional single player scenarios 3. No adjustable difficulty level. Actually there are three campaigns there (Germans, USSR,Allies), that ascend from easy to hardIf you like this genre, there are few new game right noe in the market, so if you fully exhaust Panzer Cops and all of it's DLC, You can give this game a chance. Buying in sales recommended.			"

												This is a port of an old Nintendo DS game. Back in the pre-smartphone days of 2007, if you wanted to conquer Poland during your commute (and who doesn't?) this mediocre Panzer General clone was your only choice. I played through the whole DS version, and although I enjoyed it, I also became very familiar with the game's GLARING flaws - a very passive AI, silly power-ups (magic forcefields!), useless tank destroyers, etc. I haven't played this port long enough to confirm that all of those OLD flaws are still present, but there are some obvious NEW flaws including a ridiculous death explosion for every unit (I guess it would have been too much trouble to animate the infantry figure just falling down), and a ""fast movement"" option that makes it impossible to tell what the AI is doing during its turn. The game also starts off with an awful tilted perspective (like the one from Advance Wars: Dual Strike) but you can mercifully turn that off. It's also kind of impressive just how badly this port squanders the vastly greater resolution of a modern PC monitor compared to the DS's tiny screen, forcing you to click to secondary screens to see basic information like how entrenched an enemy unit is, or what type of unit a transport ship is carrying.If you're looking to play WW2 strategy on the PC in 2014, you have several good options. This DS game from 2007 is NOT one of them.			"

												Good game,but too simply in comparison with Panzer corps or the old Dos based Panzer General series. The different types of the units arent useful because the only different because of them is that the modern ones better in all way (except price)the older one. So u will always use the moderner types of the units. The missions have also not really challenge cos there are only a few missions in all campaign and the missions are linear,there is not difference if u win or lose (if lose game is over)-except 1-2 bonus mission-but in comparison with Panzer General series (from the 1990's) there is much fewer missions and units. It would be better to create a game with only one side of the fighting forces (allies/axis/russia/japs) but with more interesting and bigger numbered  campaigns and more different units. I also didn't like the game cartoon-style graphics and  I missed some  WWII picture /movie in game to increase its entertaining value for a WWII fan.In all,the game is not bad,the main feature of it is the generals,but after you ended a campaign you wont want start the next,cos it became soon boring.

												Do not buy this game if you are familliar with Panzer General series. This game is not nearly is interesting as Panzer General. It lacks many features, for example you cannot postpone action of the unit within the same turn. Like moving infantry first, then moving artillery, firing artillery, then attacking with infantry you moved first place. And feature of Panzer General 3D called ""suppression"" is priceless.Again I've thrown my money away when I bought BitComposer title. Never again.			"

												I have been now playing this game for 6 hours straight on the German missions.  I have a ton of xp playing the panzer general series, commando and hearts of iron so I know this kind of game and you are getting a decent game here.  There are some cool things in this game like the commando units and the leadership attachments.  The visuals are great and there are no cut scenes that slow the game down or distract you.  And for what your paying for your are getting a deal I think.There's only a few minor issues I have and that's things like playing the Afrika Korps and seeing Panther tanks and me going huh as they were never in Africa the tanks that is.  The campaigns don't seem long enough or involved enough.  And the army you build seems sketchy as im not sure I keep my units from one mission to another.  But the rewards system is great and love what we see there and secondary objectives is cool in the fact that many games would have given no incentive to capping those obj's.  But this game there are cool perk's.  But wont ruin for you.  Id love to see more missions and make the fate of your world for your faction seem to be bigger and I could see story added to these games one day as I like what has been done with this game so far but i always have so many ideas how these games can be pushed.  This game is crisp and clear and is not too difficult and not too simple and if you are looking for a relaxing war game this is a good one to try.Thanks to the developers.			"

												 If you are impatient here is the short version. This game is easily the best turn based strategy war game I have ever played in my life. For only 11 bucks I have already had over 23 hours of enjoyment and probably have about another 40-50 to go before i ace all the missions in the 3 campaigns. The game looks and sounds great, it rewards strategic thinking and tactical planning, it is fun, the logic of the game is based on real life so it makes sense (units run out of fuel, ammo, tanks are at a disadvantage fighting in mountains/cites etc. a bit more details if you care: Easy to pick up, lots of depth and a tutorial that actually teaches you things! shocking i know right...seriously though, play the tutorial and the ? at the top right of the screen if you click it will break down to 4 screens explaining all of the stats for your units. Weather reports will let you know the forecast so you can plan for your or the enemies airforce. This game forces you to use combined arms tactics if you want to excel. You must also spend your resources wisely...at the same time though, while losing a core unit can be painful, it does not ruin the experience and actually makes you plan a bit so you don't needlessly squander your units. Also, FYI the units already on the map that are yours when you first start, are non core units (i.e. they don't persist after the mission) so if you know you are going to have to lose a unit...risk them..don't risk your core units, and whenever possible upgrade them too to make them more effective. Anyway, can't say enough good about this game. IF you like turn based strategy, pick this up, you won't be dissapointed. For cons there are a few minor niggles...like when switching the view bt air/land units sometimes the cursor will show the air unit but when you click on the tab to move it to, it switches back to the land unit under it (solution is to just click HQ tab and then back out of it, this will reset the tab and you can start again. Not a huge issue but does crop up occassionally. occasionally, some of the optional secondary objectives don't really give you enough info at first and you kind of have to figure out what you need to do or the best way to accomplish the mission (a few times i restarted a map because of making a crucial error...at the same time however, towards the middle of the campaign i finally had a pretty diverse group of core units that could handle whatever came their way if i read the map and mission brifings as well as reports to guess the enemy intentions and deploy and utilize my units effectively. Again, not a major issue since not everyone likes to get perfect mission ratings on every map..but i do so if i screwed up i started over and then applied my lessons well. -only other minor issue is that there are only 5 save slots and the music could be a bit better (its pretty decent but not amazing). The sound of your units, graphics and weather effects definitely overshadow that minor issue and make you forget and lose yourself in the game. Bottom line...i have had several concussions and thinking a lot gives me headaches...despite this i sometimes play this game and lose track of time and quit only when my head feels like it shrunk and is two sizes too small...lol its that good!Buy this game already! it is amazing!

												Just wanted to say thanks to the devs for this game. I was a huge Panzer General fan, back when 32MB of RAM were op and a good computer had 133Mhz. Sadly, I didnt knew this game existed until I saw a random video on youtube about it. Instantly got it and its great. I had to try the 2nd mission 4 times in order to get *** and the secondary objective. Havent played challenging game in a while so this was a great change.Yeah, there are annoying things in the game, like having to confirm each movement after you make it, or the lack of tooltips. But all in all, its a fun game, and highly recommend it.			"

												On sale, I recommend it. I think I paid $15 and the German campaign alone was worth it. It requires much more smarts than Panzer Corp, for sure.The only problem for me is the Russsian campaign was simply too tough for me. And without cheats, I had to give the game up. Skill-wise, I am probably a ""4"" out of ""10"" and I'm sure some people completed the whole game. But the time I did put into it was thoroughly enjoyable and challenging.I now hereby beg the developers for an unlock so I can finish the game :)			"

												In 1939, German troops attacked Poland and plunged Europe into the Second World War. Experience intense battles in three extensive campaigns. More than 150 units and countless tactical options offer hours of fun. Relive the offensive of the German troops, the Soviet counter-attack and the liberation of Europe by the Allied Forces across three campaigns. Panzer Tactics originally launched in North America on November 7, 2007 and in the rest of the world on the following year on February 15, 2008. Panzer Tactics was also launched only for the DS but won the German Developer Award for the best console game in 2008. It has been developed by Sproing Interactive and going to be published by bitComposer Games, respectively. Panzer Tactics HD is a remake of the original Panzer Tactics but with a few changes; including new textures, better gameplay, and launches on PC iPad! The game promotes hex turn-based warfare. You are also able to play as the Axis, Soviet Union (Russia), and the Allies. Panzer is available on the Steam Store for $29.99.When companies decide to remake their games with new HD textures, you believe it's because they need more money and just want to shoehorn some clunky game and call it a remake. Panzer Tactics HD is definitely not a money grab, and am thrilled to say that. If you check out a comparison of the old version comparing to the new, you can see that the textures have definitely improved, and for the better. The game looks unreal compared to the original.When you start off as the Axis (unless you have the guts to play as the Soviets or Allies; which are set with much higher difficulties), you are able to play through a tutorial that is great for new players. I was able to learn the gameplay through the tutorial and it's very simple to learn the controls. Panzer Tactics is also marked with the non-complex UI which allows players to not have to struggle with reading small messages or find a command with a ridiculous amount of steps.Historically, the game does well on battles that happened during World War II. I am a huge World War II guy who gets his hands on any World War II game he can get. There is also a large arsenal in the variety of units to pick from, in which all have strengths and weaknesses in which players must use to win a battle. There are also a huge diversity in the terrain that you are able to have battles on which creates many different types of scenarios for you.8.5/10 - Great for any strategist or World War II fan, or both! Panzer Tactics HD brings back the fun of the first one and adds with some great visuals as well as better gameplay!			"

												Only real men can get all 3 stars in this game.  It's impossible not to get a real lesson in history and tactics.  You WISH chess could be this fun.  I play this game, or whatever remake they have of it, every 5 years becuase it's the only game that still bends my mind. Please message me if you know something as smart as this.  Here's some things I've learned both about this game and the real WWII:  Pioneer infantry is more useful because they can cross rivers faster.  Germany had design issues.  Like old VWs, sometimes older models worked better than the new stuff.  You can win the entire war without a single anti-tank unit.  Just recruit more tanks and just embrace violent and glorious tank-on-tank battles.  Paratroopers are glorified suicide squads.  You're not really suiciding units if you're using them to win as fast as possible.  War sucks bro.    Roads are death.  Forests are life.   Taking risks with your aerial units never works.  They will get blown out of the sky the moment you lax on the paranoia.  The French lost that war on purpose.  Nobody can be that bad.  ""Stay together, or die.""  You don't need to take EVERY French village... even if you have fantasies of getting free food for liberating them.    This war was so fun, it's sad when it's all over.   "

												For a wargamer like me who play wargame more than 30 years (no lie), to skim, before purchasing it, I noticed that it is simple, but with good quality that the game was made graphically speaking, in leads you to believe in it, and we hope that some factors in the game better, (being the intention of the creators), otherwise, if they wish to keep it in level of beginner / intermediate, is EXCELLENT for those who want to start in the world of wargames!For already passed this stage will have a good game to remember the basic functions of a wargame, if you have been a long time without playing.I do not mean to complicate it, and NEVER insert absurd functions as ""superpowers"" (who want fancy wagame there are many), but insert simple factors however important, as supply line, and improve the movement of factors, as respect to units that use trucks to go faster ...Para um wargamer como eu, que jogo wargame a mais de 30 anos (sem mentira), ao passar os olhos, antes de compra-lo, notei que ele é simples, porem com a boa qualidade que o game foi feito graficamente falando, nos leva a acreditar no mesmo, e  esperamos que alguns fatores no game melhore, (sendo a intenção dos criadores), caso contrário, se os mesmos desejam mante-lo em nivel de principiante/intermediário, é EXELENTE para quem quer iniciar-se no mundo dos wargames!Para os já passaram desta fase, tera um game bom para relembrar as funções basicas de um wargame, caso tenha ficado muito tempo sem jogar.Não digo em complica-lo, e NUNCA, inserir funções de absurdas como ""superpoderes"", (quem deseja wagame de fantasia existem muitos), mas inserir fatores simples porem importantes, como linha de suprimentos, e aprimorar os fatores de movimento, no que tange a unidades que se utilizam de caminhões para irem mais rápido...

												If you have a hankering for some good old fashioned turn-based war without the dept of a grand stratergy title, this title is for you. As a matter of fact, I found out about this game just a week before it was released when I randomly had a craving for Panzer Tactics.Pros - WW2 setting for those who like itGood range of unitsChallenging mapsCons -Some units feel badly restrained into roles, such as fighter-bombers being unable to engage enemy aircraftUI is made for touch device, you have to CONFIRM click every decision you make, which gets old fastDoesn't seem to be much dev support looking to patch it into a stronger PC portIf you wanted to play this in a serious way I'd say buy the touch-device version.Similar games I'd recommend -For your real-time WW2 fixings ""RUSE"" is a great game with a different feel to most RTS gamesFor an indie turn-based war game look at Battle Worlds Chronos			"

												One of my favorite turn-based strategies. There isn't a whole lot of replay value, since once you beat a campaign level you know how you should approach it in later attempts and since the AI is fairly consistent in its playstyle.

												Entertaining and well polished game.If you're new to this kind of game it's probably your best bet on the steam store. If you're used to more advanced strategy games like Panzer General and its clones, you will feel like the game lacks many features and your freedom of movement is limited. The AI is very passive and most missions are repetitive in the sense that you are always on the attacker side and never get to experience an offensive AI. Sadly the game doesn't feature a multiplayer mode which kinda sucks.The graphics look really nice in general but the UI was not very well thought.Other than that, it's a nice small game to pass the time.

												With over 150 different units to play with, plenty of maps to strategize on, and a level of difficulty in tactics needed to not let you walk all over this game, Panzer Tactics HD definitely has a lot going for it. It’s fun and all, but it is not an easy game. You’ll actually have to do some thinking here. I say that less to scare and more to prepare. I’m decent at planning things out when I have less choices so this game will take some major getting used to. However, it’s not going to be one that I’ve seen the last of after having written the review. It’s aggravatingly fun and I want to win! I can easily recommend this game to any WWII fiend or fan of planning intensive strategy games.Full Review: TheVideogameBacklog.com "

												I just got this game the other day and I most say, its very fun. Takes me back to the early 90s where Panzer general was my game of choice. Some of these maps and missions due remind me and look alot like the old Panzer General. I think this game is the best remake to be close to Panzer General. If you like Panzer general you going to love this game. Pro:Great MapsNice units Great missions that make you think and earn your way.Game allows you to keep 20 units ( Core units ) and grow them throughout the game. Very long game, you can play Germany, Allies, Russia. Cons:It was made for touch screen, so confirming every move gets old. Fighter Bombers can't be a fighter, just a bomber. I would have loved to see the action screen ( Battle Movie) when in a battle. Some turn this off, but wish this was moved over from the old DS version. Wish the units on the map had a little more detail in color. Some of the bombers are just one color.They look like plastic one color toys on the board.  "

PANZER TACTICS HD - WW2 TBSGood TBS WW2 game ( for a casual gamer ) - it lacks the complexity of panzer corps ( wich i rate 10/10 compared to this one ) in actions ( suppression absent / surrender absent from what i could see ) - ( the biggest flaw is that once you moved a unit in to position you can only attack or stay in that position - you can not postpone your immediate action until other friendly units from your corps comes in support or try to make an encircle move - but i like the addition of officers ) also the game is VERY EASY for an experienced player like myself - anyway a nice game for the fans of this kind of niche game like myself :)  6.5/10EDIT - also your core number units ( 20 ) never expands along the course of the campaign wich is bad - because it shows the lack of complexity in scenarios  ( thats why i taken a point of and now its 6.5/10) - of course you still have auxiliary units to support - and if you win the scenarios in the campaign you are given way to many points mostly you can recruit the officers with them - because upgrading your units presents NO challenge ! - the most positive thing about this game for me was that i could find a retail box copy of this game in Romania ( i bet that i buyed the only copy wich was bought in the country and quite expensive 25 Euros- ha , ha , ha :) !In conclusion my vote is positive for this game ( recommended for the casual gamer / not recommended for the experienced gamer ) because there are not to many TBS WW2 thematic games on the market !

												Lately, I have been finding myself having to be not so critical of games that I buy, this is not the case with PT. The gameplay is very smooth and well thoughtout. There is a storyline and the graphics and animations are legit. In conclusion, I can not find anything but nitpick things wrong with this game and I would reccommend it to my friends.			"

												Really great turn based strategy game, Its very similar to the advanced wars series.Pros - Just plain funStarts off pretty easy but gets more and more challenging Similar to advanced wars but with more features and unitsCons - No map/scenario makerDoesn't tell you what units are ""core"" or notEmphasis on conserving units should be more optional			"

												Very much like Panzer General II. Not being able to move after attacking can be a little frustrating.			"

												This Game is money well spent. The first few times I played it I got beat. Once I learned the strengths and weak ness's  of the units I was able to win all 3 campaigns. My opinion the Germans are the easiest to win. Next is Russia and the hardest to win I think is the U.S.A.  I hope they release new content for after beating the 3 campaigns  a few times I am now bored. 2			"

												Panzer Tactics HD is a Turn Based Strategy that comes from the past. After Panzer Tactics 3D and Scorched Earth it was about time to appear a new game of this all time classic franchise, Strongly recommended for those they like single player action and they are not impressed only by games which need high end graphic cards in order to play them. Replayability on maximum gives all the time to the gamer to think about his next move and to apply his-her tactics. Hardly waiting for another franchise of this Nintendo classic.			"

												Really good game.  You're not going to get massive graphics but that's not what you buy this for.  You buy an entertaining rock/paper/scissors, strategy game.For £7 you can't go wrong.  Compare this to Warhammer Armageddon, which looks to be incredibly simular but is something like £30 for a 2 year old game.  ♥♥♥♥ that.7/10			"

												As a huge fan of the original Panzer General, I must say this is a great addition. I actually think its better than Panzer General because of the added depth the officers and special forces units add to the game. I hope the developers add additional content, as I would quickly purchase it. I am truly mystified on why some people actually gave this game poor reviews. All I can do is quote the great Randy Moss, ""Haters gonna hate"".			"
