												Dawn of War is one of the first ""real"" Warhammer 40k RTS games to ever hit PC´s.You get to follow Gabriel Angelos as he uncovers a major plot in the Tartarus campaign, this is the first game in a long series of Warhammer 40k games that was created by Relic while they where still owned by THQ, also the very first game where we got to see the Blood Ravens as they where created purely as a ""PC Game"" chapter.Story wise the game is as good as you can do with an RTS, you get a deep sense of where Gabriel Angelos comes from and what his goals are as you get deeper and deeper into the game the story changes and there are some major plot twists all the time. Graphic wise Dawn Of War is an old game and that is visible, however SEGA (now owners of Relic) keeps supporting the game and recently even released a patch to deal with some of the issues that had been around for awhile, this is despite the fact the game came out in 2004 which makes it over 10 years old now.Gameplay wise DoW is very straightforward, you build bases and kill stuff as any other RTS, however the way that Relic gave us the Warhammer universe with the Dawn of War series is amazing, you get a deep feeling for your chapter and your enemies, you get some great story and a great experience as you go through the missions one by one. Even now the multiplayer is very much alive and working very well, you get to pick between Space Marines, Orks, Elder or Chaos Space Marines which gives you a great chance for some epic battles, Relic even included the option to paint your own army and use it online. All in all a great game for old RTS fans and even more so if you are into the Warhammer 40.000 Universe.			"

This is a long review, so if you just want a summary of why I recommend Dawn of War Gold Edition then skip to the Results section and reading from there.Relic Entertainment works with Games Workshop to produce an epic real time strategy game that pushed the boundaries of the genre. Dawn of War offers economics, base building, military tactics, and unit management. Story:Dawn of War, the first installment on an incredible Warhammer 40,000 saga. The game is based on the planet Tarturus where Ork forces are out of control ravaging the planet and destroying Imperial Guard moral; but, how are they winning so easily? Of course the forces of Chaos are behind the whole war. Dawn of War is the story of Gabrial Angelos and Isador Akios and how they work together to figure out the whole reason behind the presence of Chaos on the imperial garrison at Tarturus. Campaign:The campaign offers an epic tale into the 40k lore with amazing twists and turns around every mission. Coupled with the amazing combat system, base management, and resource management this game really packs a punch. The campaign is divided into eleven missions which put you to the test fighting against the Orc Horde and the Chaos Might. As you progress through the campaign you work with the Eldar to defeat a common foe, but as the game dictates the Enemy of your Enemy is not always your friend. The game pits teams together, but at the same time continually draws them apart. Gameplay:This game was one of the first to successfully introduce rapid base expansion by requiring players to capture strategic points, which give the player a trickle of endless resources over time. The fast paced gameplay coupled with the macro and micro unit management really made this game a force to be reckoned with. Although the unit population seems rather low (20 personal – 10 vehicle) because the units are based in squads the real unit count is much higher. The battles seem more like full scale wars with you gripping to manage all your units at once. The best feature of this game (and all the Dawn of War games) is that each team is completely different. They have different units, different buildings, upgrades, tactics, resource types, hero units, and strategies. For example the Orc play completely different from the Eldar while both the Eldar and Orcs play completely different from the Space Marines and Chaos Marines. The only two similar teams are the Space Marines and Chaos marines which offer a good learners curve to Dawn of War by giving providing a basic approach to strategy: build barracks, build turrets for defense, use main base to upgrade to new “age” to receive better buildings, build power plants to get power, and upgrade units within armory, etc. Teams:There are four teams: Space Marines, Eldar, Orcs, and Chaos Marines. Each team poses different tactics/strategic elements which make you play them differently. The Orcs are based more around unit massing and rapid base expansion. While the Eldar are more about unit specialization and micro base management. The Space Marines and Chaos Marines are essentially the same team set, and fit between tactics of the Orcs and Eldar. Each of the teams units have upgradeable attributes which customize them for specific purposes: weapons, additional squad members, and squad leader units. Each team has special commander units which can be used as heroes buffing the team and supporting military units.Results:All and all Dawn of War is a must get game. If you can play older games without constantly yearning for the graphics of the modern day games then you’ll enjoy this game. The gameplay is not outdated, but rather refreshing. As it seems most strategy game developers have diverted from base building, resource management, and mass scale war to simple micromanagement tactic games. I loved this game and all the installments so much I repurchased them all on steam. Despite that I still have all the discs, in functional condition, right next to me. Pros:+Economic, Base building, and macro unit management+Fantastic story and campaign (which is very rare in a strategy game)+Amazing teams which each play completely differently.+Fast paced gameplay which requires expansion to acquire resource nodes (but those nodes do not run out like in most games)+Unit customization allows you to create squads for specific tasks+Fantastic computer AI that puts you to your witsCons:-Cannot play this game while having another monitor running (if you have two monitors the game will launch but every time you move the mouse to the edge of the screen where your monitor extends the mouse exits the game as if you are playing in Windowed mode).-Lots of unbalances (don’t worry they fix all of these in the later installments)			"

												WAAAAAAAGH!!!SPESS MARHEENS! ADVAHNCE!!!!This game... Dawn of War is a timeless RTS classic that bumps hips with legendary RTS titles like Starcraft, Age of Empires, and more. The Warhammer 40K universe is mostly about the Blood Ravens (the space marines) and their hellbent (or is that... heavenbent...) mission on purging the world of heretics, and other filth.It is simply awesome. I played this game religiously (haha... it's a pun because the... oh nevermind just play the game and you'll understand) when I was a kid and I finally decided to get it on Steam as well due to other Warhammer titles coming out (some main ones being REGICIDE and WARHAMMER 40,000: TOTAL WAR <-- real stoked about that one).The nostalgia is real.If you are an RTS fan, then you'll love this game. It's a bit clunky, but then again it's an old game. Everything about this game screams 10/10. But because it's in the Warhammer universe, I'm rating it 40,000/40,000.Get this game. Heck, grab the entire collection when it goes on a sale. Every single game has its own value and they're worth every dollar.			"

												This is one of the best (and not just best ""10/10 IGN') games of my life and also one of the most important. I love it just as I love the 40k universe. When I first played it (and I was a young kid) my brain just exploded with awesomness. The stroryline, the gameplay, the races! Everything is so great in this game! Back in those days there was nothing better than crushing the enemies of the Emperor under the boots of the mighty Space Marines!To be honest - there is no other game that is so close to me - I was growing up with it and now I'm am a great fan of this universe.Get it, play it and enjoy it. If not - burn you heretical scum!			"

												Dawn of War is a fantastic modern RTS that measures up very well against the greats in the genre like Starcraft and Age of Empires. It takes place in the Warhammer 40k universe but manages to appeal to players who aren't familiar with the tabletop or lore such as myself. Dawn of War unlike most ""older"" rts games isn't focused on building or resource gathering. You gain resources automatically through capturing ""strategic points"" around the map and stealing them from other players. This encourages exploring the map and assaulting other players very quickly early on. Building is also done very early on so the majority of what you spend your time on is creating units and attacking players.Combat in Dawn of War is done very well. Because there's very little micromanagement with resources and buildings you spend most of the game creating squads, upgrading those squads with different weapons and assaulting the enemy. Each of the 4 races are familiar but different enough so that you'll quickly pick out a favorite among them. Dawn of War's greatest asset is speed, games go by very quickly and you are always getting rewarded for the smallest of accomplishments like capturing strategic points. Which stack up greatly as the game goes on. There are also a lot of little details to the game like how Space Marine buildings are generated by being dropped from orbit. The real unfortunate aspect about this release (The original Game of the Year edition) is it's arguably the one I'd recommend the least. It only contains four of the core races (Space Marines, Eldar, Chaos Space Marines and Orks) along with a fairly lackluster Blood Ravens campaign. I still do recommend getting it since it does introduce you to the mechanics of the game very well, and those races do port over to the multiplayer of the subsequent expansions. But by itself the Game of the Year edition isn't as impressive as Winter Assault or Dark Crusade.			"

												10 Years Later, And It Keeps On Giving!Ive always been a massive fan of the Wh40K Universe, and my love for Games Workshop and all things related, started 10 years ago with this game! I remember my brother pre-ordering  it, and he introduced me into the Universe, and I spent many years watching him play DoW. A few years later, I managed to get my hands on the great title, having been handed down a little beast of a PC ( or had been at the time anyway), and it was my first chance to unleash the power of the Space Marines unto those nasty orks, and the heretic forces of chaos. It was a 3 disk installation, and about a 3 hour wait ; before the game was properly onto the PC. It was well worth it, and the expansions that came out along the years added to the mayhem, it was all part of the experience. I stopped playing DoW as I got rid of my computer, as it was well outdated, and then I suppose it got forgotten in time.Now back in present day, I became a part of the Steam community, and thought id dig around the room for some games I could add to steam. I found this little gem on my top shelf, so I thought I would give it a go and enter the cd key into steam, I was awfully excited! Put it onto my little laptop, 30 minute installation and I was away, ( so much for those 3 hours installs eh). It all came back to me when I started playing it once again, the music, the classic call of the space marines charging into battle. Me chanting “Burn The Heretic!”, while my Space Marines shoot the hell out of a squad of Chaos marines. Yes, all those requirements of a great RTS game, with hours and hours of enjoyment. You cannot go wrong with good old Dawn Of War, or rather i cannot anyway. The graphics may be quite outdated, and the multiplayer doesn’t hold much of a feature in the game nowadays,  however that certainly does not hinder any enjoyment at all.  Fan of the Wh40k Universe? Used to own the game, but not sure whether to return to serve the emperor? I recommend purchasing this game, and having a whole lot of fun playing it! I personally have a great deal of more of hours to enjoy on this game, reliving the moments of destruction and chaos. In terms of gameplay elements, Dawn Of War still does not fail to be a very fun, and a practically great game. 10 Years Later And It Sure As Hell Keeps On Giving!Overall:+ Everything a classic RTS needs+ Clever resource system+ Immersive campaign to sink many hours into+ Must buy for Warhammer 40k fans+ Still great at 10 years of age- Multiplayer servers not great- Outdated Graphics- Minor bugsSolid 9/10That goes it for my short Dawn of War Steam Review.Thanks,The-Sentinel-Gamer			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Game of the Year EditionDeveloper:  Relic EntertainmentPublisher:  SEGAGenre:  Real Time StrategyGeneral ImpressionOne of the best Sci-Fi 3D RTS to date and the classic of an established franchise which sparked a Dawn of War trilogy as of 2016. With just the right amount of base management and plenty of brutal combat, it is far better than many similar RTS games. I remember the first time playing it, more than a decade ago and I was amazed by the fact that you can have hundreds of fallen units on the battlefield and they wouldn't vanish within seconds, like they do in almost all the other real-time strategies. The graphical details have aged well and they can be enjoyed even without texture mods. If you would consider skipping this title and going directly for Dawn of War II or play the upcoming III, think again. DoW I is still a worthy RTS experience and always will be.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics and sounds.+ Excelent setting and storyline.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- No Achievements.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Watching a beloved franchise move between mediums is always difficult. Sometimes it is the awkward transition from movie to videogame. Other times it is the even more awkward transition from videogame to movie. However, every once in a while a franchise weathers the change well, some might argue better off because of the move. The Warhammer 40,000 universe, deftly crafted by the folks at Games Workshop, has attempted the move to videogames before, meeting with varying levels of success. However, it is truly Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War that has made video game players aware of the tabletop brand. Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a real-time-strategy title that recreates the epic tabletop battles of the Warhammer 40k universe, almost perfectly, on your PC. Epic is truly the best word to describe some of these battles as Space Marines and Imperial Guard do their best to hold off the war hungry Orks, the mysterious Eldar, and destroy the twisted forces of Chaos. Dawn of War does an excellent job of staying true to the source material, both in story and gameplay. Specifically, the gameplay for DoW has shifted the focus from individual troops to squads of soldiers. Morale of these squads also plays a role in how combat plays out with ""broken"" squads becoming significantly less effective until they can regroup. Just as special characters also play a large role in the tabletop game, they make a significant impact on your Dawn of War army. Force Commanders, Librarians, Sergeants, and Apothecaries can all be attached to your Space Marine squads to imbue them with additional powers and improved combat skills. Access to these characters, as well as certain types of buildings, research topics, and vehicles is granted through a construction tree that will be instantly recognizable to anyone that has ever played a RTS game. That is one of the great things about Dawn of War, it is, at once, both familiar and new. As the heir apparent to the StarCraft legacy, Dawn of War had some large shoes to fill. Fortunately, it didn't try to replicate the StarCraft experience step for step. The shift to squad-based combat and completely redesigned resource management system have taught us all that there is no room in this world for a lone soldier or gathering crystals, gas, and trees on the battlefield. These adjustments fit the Warhammer 40k game model extremely well and keep the focus on the action, where it belongs. The 3D graphics engine behind Dawn of War's action does a great job of making the epic combat of the 40k universe a personal affair while maintaining the global view that you need to keep track of your forces. Zooming your camera all of the way into the action allows you to see every detail of what is going on in the middle of combat. The animations are tailored fabulously to the characters at hand and are extremely satisfying for those of us that have spent countless hours playing the tabletop game. There is nothing quite as satisfying as watching your Dreadnought grab an Eldar soldier, lift him into the air, and rend his body into a bloody pulp. Okay, maybe watching your Whirlwind's missile battery send Orks flying across the battlefield can match it. Whatever your preference, the combat is visceral when you get up close and personal. It is just a shame that the camera can't back out just a little bit farther as the somewhat limited field of view makes it a little bit tricky to keep an eye on a large force. Because of this, using rally points and the quick assignment keys become mandatory in managing your troops. Multiplayer is standard fare in real-time-strategy games and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War dishes up a pretty satisfying variety of maps and races with which you can wage war. Each of the game's four main races, Space Marine, Ork, Eldar, and Chaos are playable in multiplayer and while the matches can degrade to a battle of numbers, the inclusion of strategic points definitely mixes things up a bit. How does Dawn of War stack up to the original tabletop game? Some of the Warhammer 40k nuts out there might disagree with the RTS adaptation of the turn based game. They also might complain that not every vehicle or troop made the jump to the PC. These kind of objections to DoW are nitpicky and don't take into account that this is truly a great real-time-strategy game.There is no question why so many gaming enthusiasts voted Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War the top real-time-strategy game when it came out and the game is still one of the best RTS titles in existence. A few minor camera flaws are easily overshadowed by the visceral combat experience that Dawn of War offers.			"

												I wanted to play this recently (owned it on disc for 12 years) so, on the off chance, i emailed Sega pictures of my orginal dics plus Winter Assault and Dark Crusade. Soulstorm, actually activates on Steam with the supplied key code. To my amazement Sega emailed me keys for all 3 games for me to add to my steam library within a day. Delighted was an understatement, its not often a publisher is not just after your money.On to the game, the story is good and easy to follow. Graphics, the cut scenes have aged obviously but in game its not so noticable. Most of the missions amount to building up your forces and destroying the enemy. How you choose to do this is up to you but eventually you will settle on a few select units and just mass build these.Dawn of War is easily the best W40k series and a must buy if you are in to warhammer. 8/10			"

												Don't get me wrong when you see that i don't recommend this, as it is a very fun game to play, and i will continue to play it. But the reason why i don't recommend it is due to the false labeling of the game itself. Now, it being a game of the year eddition, one would think it comes with some, if not all, of the DLC, right? WRONG! The only benefits that it gives you are a few extra maps (that you will be unlikely to find yourself playing) and multiplayer functionality (which should have been in the game originally, so the developers really represent american financing at its finest). The point is, the game should not be listed as a ""game of the year edition"" if it does not deliver on any game of the year edition content. It is falsely labeled and advertised, causing misunderstandings that should not occur in the first place.			"

												I'm a huge RTS fan, but for whatever reason, I never picked this up until recently. I was introduced to the Warhammer 40,000 universe by way of the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine third person shooter, which I greatly enjoyed. This universe has intrigued me since then, and I have tried to catch up with the more long-term fans of the franchise by reading up on the lore and such online. It's quite different from most fantasy; where magic and medieval type weaponry is common in fantasy, Warhammer has a refreshing spin on things, relying more on machinery and gunplay while keeping the magic and awe the fantasy genre offers to players. It also falls in the area of dystopian, which is by far my favorite genre of any entertainment, and it is interesting to have a protagonist in this game whose ideals and beliefs could be viewed as fanatical by our standards, but would be understandable in such a future where he serves beneath a totalitarian empire.Moving on from the universe to the gameplay, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is an RTS that is unique in its approach to a genre that is tried and true. Whereas many RTS games focus on base building and annihilation, this game simplifies the base building and relies more on strategical points that you must capture for resource generation throughout the map. Each campaign or skirmish mission ""gets going"", so-to-speak, much more quickly than other RTS games. You spend less time buiding and more time moving your armies along the map. For those that find some in the genre to be slow moving in the beginning, Dawn of War brings a welcome change. Something else that Dawn of War does well that not enough RTS games do (sometimes at all) is reinforcements and upgrades. Where some games have you upgrade units from their respective recruitment centers and it encompasses all units of the same type, Dawn of War gives you more choice in how you want them upgraded. You can build a group of Space Marines, add reinforcements (making an initial group of four into up to eight), add sergeants later on, commanders, etc. In addition, with upgrades you can have a few men within the group upgrade their weapons, and the selection of weapons is up to you. You can have four rocket launchers, two rocket launchers, one flamethrower, and a laser pistol, or any combination between. This gives the player an ability to build up a small army for one intention (rocket launchers are great at taking out vehicles and buildings, for example), while creating another for a different intention (sending a differently equipped army to fight infantry). Even within firefights, you can reinforce your army if you possess the resources, giving the player a second chance in battle when most RTS games give none.Lastly, it should be noted that I am a single player only strategy player, so I buy games like this for the campaign and skirmishes. In saying that, this game's campaign is fantastic. While somewhat short (eleven missions and about 15 hours of gameplay; note that Steam did not track all of my game time), the story is quite good and involving, taking you across many different types of landscapes and introducing you to different races to fight against. The cutscenes are a bit stilted due to the game's age, and the voice acting (while over-dramatic at times) is fantastic. The missions are vast and varied, and the game never gets in the habit of annoying you with time limits (I hate timed missions in any game, personally). The missions were challenging without being impossible, and they were friendly to both players who like to rush and complete the missions, and players like me, who like to leisurely explore the whole map and take over all positions before deciding to fully vanquish my enemy. Skirmishes are available, offering a few dozen maps that you can choose to play on, giving you choices as to what colors your army wears to which races you fight against, along with a whole myriad of other choices to make to tweak your gameplay if you so choose. In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a fantastic RTS title that makes me very happy I purchased the Master Collection of games, because I am looking forward to experiencing more of this interesting universe. I would recommend it to any fans of RTS, as well as those looking to get into the genre, as this game is extraordinarily user friendly and has a fantastic tutorial. If you are unsure, I urge you to try the demo. I played the demo some time before buying the game and loved what it offered, so it is a fair representation of the game. I can see myself adding this to a list of games I come back to every now and then, because it offers a truly unique strategy experience that stands apart from others. I went into this game with no expectations other than what I'd read through some of the reviews, and after beating it, I consider myself a fan.			"

												""Beware the Alien, the Mutant, the Heretic""'Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War' is, simply put, one of the best Real-Time Strategy games on the market - A blood-soaked odyssey through the Warhammer 40k Universe - filled with Imperial Space Marines, Ork Hordes, Eldar and The Forces of Chaos. Campaign: Released in 2004 by Relic Entertainment, 'Dawn of War's' brutal opening cinematic sets the stage for what awaits within - a savage battlefield across the Imperial Planet of Tartarus where the local population have been suddenly beset by Ork Hordes. As Commander of the Space Marines (The Emperor's Personal Guard), you begin a quest to push back the Orks and determine why they are on the planet. A deep and engaging story-fueled campaign takes you from cities to lost ruins, from mountains lairs to the planets icy tundras, leading a tech heavy force of Space Marines, Mech Walkers, Artillery Tanks, Predator Tanks and Terminator Assault Squads, to unearth the cause of this strange heresy plaguing the planet. Gameplay | Graphics | Sound:  Gameplay is centered around a combination of basebuilding, resource management, unit management, and battlefield tactical combat. Unlike other RTS games however, you will not spend a lot of downtime collecting resources as the game is focused on capturing 'Strategic Points' on the battlefield which keep the onus always on the forward movement of your army. The action is always fast, frenetic and bloody, and always around the next bend in the road. For a game released in 2004, the graphics are a tad dated, but generally hold up extremely well during gameplay. Great sound quality, a phenomenal soundtrack and responsive M&K controls round out a well polished title.Overall, 'Dawn of War' is a title of legend - one of the finest RTS games of its generation and a must-have for any Strategy gamer. The campaign is deeply satisfying, gameplay is polished, the battles are bloody and unapologetically violent, and somehow you cannot help but be drawn into the Warhammer universe of Orks and Mutants, Heretics and Socerers, Daemons and Blood Gods. ""Forward, ..For the Emperor!"" - (Rated 9.5 /10)			"

												9 years later, I'm still playing this game with my friends more than Planetary Annihilation, Company of Heroes, or even the newer Dawn of War II.I can't give it a higher recommendation than that.Dark Crusade expansion is absolutely my favorite. Necron all the way. Genocidal Death Robots and a strategic map for infinite replayability... who could really ask for more?Check my play time, and realize, I owned this first on PC Store Bought Disk, and then bought it again on steam when those wore out.Highly Recommended. 9.8/10.

												This game is part of an iconic series, and I'd be a fool not to recommend them.  Probably the best strategy game of all time, it is definitely something you should pick up.  Grab the whole series, they are worth it.Now, beware, the first two games have resolution problems and the Steam version of this one has a couple of bugs, but don't let it fool you; the games are better down the line anyway.  Grab this game for the campaign, and for the extra units in multiplayer.  Guaranteed to be worth the cash.			"

												I remember walking through the store and finding some milk. I held it up and looked at the price tag. I remembered that I already had two cartons of milk at home, and I though to myself ""What am I buying this for?"" Then suddenly, as if possesed by a ghost, I screamed aloud ""FOR THE EMPEROR!"" That was the moment of my enlightenment. I had discovered my puropse in life. Whenever I see someoe backing into a parking space I roll down my windows and yell ""Claim it in the name of the emperor!"" I find myself painting blood ravens on yield signs and kneeling down in front of them. When a freind asked me if I wanted to go see Captain America I responded ""Faith is my shield"" My doctor said that I have a benign tumor in my brain. I slaughtered the heretic, the mutant, the alien. FOR THE GLORY OF THE IMPERIUM!			"

												WAAAAAAAGH!!!SPESS MARHEENS! ADVAHNCE!!!!This game... Dawn of War is a timeless RTS classic that bumps hips with legendary RTS titles like Starcraft, Age of Empires, and more. The Warhammer 40K universe is mostly about the Blood Ravens (the space marines) and their hellbent (or is that... heavenbent...) mission on purging the world of heretics, and other filth.It is simply awesome. I played this game religiously when I was a kid and a friend got it for me on Steam recently, due to other Warhammer titles coming out such as Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide (Yes of course I have the public beta) this game is still one of the best games I've ever played.The nostalgia is real.If you are an RTS fan, then you'll love this game. It's a bit clunky, but then again it's an old game. Everything about this game screams 10/10. But because it's in the Warhammer universe, I'm rating it 40,000/40,000.Get this game. Heck, grab the entire collection when it goes on a sale. Every single game has its own value and they're worth every dollar.			"

												An absolutely brilliant adaption of the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to real-time strategy.  Relic hits it out of the park in nailing the look and feel of Warhammer 40K, while providing for fluid real-time gameplay - including base building.  There is suprising depth to the strategic elements of the game, and the sides are well balanced despite being very distinct.  Incredibly fun to play.  I'm still playing it 10 years later, which really says it all.   Most highly recommended.  Dark Crusade and Soulstorm add even more fun and depth to the mix.   Also, be sure to check out some of the incredible mods for the game.			"

												One of the greatest tactical RTS games of all time.  Dawn of War has aged fine, but the expansions are somewhat questionable.  Vanilla + Winter Assault seem to be the best versions of the game.  The races added in the other two add variety and fun, but there are some balance issues later on, most likely attributable to the game studio going out of business.  If you're a fan of sci-fi RTS, these games are a must-have.			"

												I have to admit, this game really surprised me. Not only is it a solid strategy game in its own right, but it's a fantastic gateway into a universe that's simulateniously a grim, miserable world of a humanity in constant fanatical fear of treachery and kind of an insane goofy sci-fi version of ""Orcs vs. Humans"" with guns and a unapologetic disregard for life. I find it kind of funny that the unit designs are what I expect the minitures to look like. Mechanically, it runs like a mutation of all the other strategy games I've played, such as StarCraft, Star Wars: Empire at War, and even Army Man RTS.Most of my problems with the game are largely technical, such as I think the camera is a little small. I only learned units could be added into your group with a Crtl-click 10 hours in. I do like that units can be part of more than one group, that's proven helpful. The only problem is that when I try to move my epic Space Marine army en masse, they can easily get in their own damn way through what I can only assume is a combination of troublesome collision programming and pathfinding AI. I don't know if this is Relic's way of encouraging me to split my forces, but that seems more like something you would do after hours of experience and not right off the bat so it just felt frustrating.While these problems are note-worthy, they do not detract from the experience in any meaningful way. I have no idea what the expansions and sequels are like, but I'm definitely interested in buying them.9/10			"

												Dawn of War, if I was held at gunpoint and had to choose one RTS out of all of them, it would be this. I love Warhammer 40,000 with a passion  and I love RTS games. With that simple mixture it has easily won my heart over. However with the up and coming Dawn of War III is Dawn of War still relevant after all these years? It's been over a decade now and many people have mixed opinions on that subject. My objective with this review is to inform consumers whether or not they are making a good purchase as well as share my own view if the game is still worth getting even after Dawn of War III's release. The Plot In the grim dark universe of 40k we start the story like any other in the Warhammer universe, massive invasion of Orks attacking an Imperial controlled world blowing stuff up and slaughtering thousands of innocents for ♥♥♥♥♥'n'giggles. Our hero and Force Commander is Gaberial Angelos, captain of the Blood Ravens. He has been sent to Tartarus to counter attack the greenskin scum and look bad ♥♥♥ while doing it. While on the planet Angelos, and Isador Akios (a Psyker) discover that Orks are not the only thing on Tartarus. The Eldar have set up a beach head and are trying to protect an ancient relic from being discovered by the evil forces of Chaos.And that's basically the story without spoilers. I think it is to be expected out of RTS games that the developer's attention is more on the mutliplayer than the campaign. So expecting a space opera of some sort in an RTS is the first step on the road to disappointment. But at least it gets the job done and it introduces the player to the mechanics of the game through a narative. The Multiplayer Since I am assuming you are either buying this game for the base factions, or you are getting into Warhammer 40k for the first time, I will dig into the real gutts of this game. The mutliplayer.Let's start off with the factions: Space Marines Space Marines are genetically and cybernetically enhanced super humans that were created by the holy Emperor to conquer the galaxy and maintain order when that objective was completed. This faction is highly recommended for new players simply for how durable, defensive, and fairly adaptable they are. They start out with simple bolt guns and bolt pistols but you can customize some squad's loadouts on the fly like for example; Tactical Marines with the following: Flamers, Heavy Bolters, Plasma Guns, and Rocket Launchers. Each of these serve a purpose for different enemies you may encounter on the battlefield. They also have melee units such as Assault Marines that can jump in and out of combat. Making them great for breaking enemy morale and breaking ranged unit lines. Space Marines also possess a wide range of vehicles to crush their enemies with holy fury. Overall the Space Marines are just a great faction. They look cool, they function properly, but they aren't overly powerful. The Orks Orks are chaotic, dangerous, silly, and insane all at the same time. They eat they sing they laugh and they slaughter and that's pretty much all Orks do. Make the tribe bigger and rush the enemy with a lot of numbers. Of course for balancing reasons you can't just trample the guy/gal you're fighting 2 minutes into the game. You have to build what is called ""WAAAAAAGH! banners"" let's just call them WB's for short. You have to build WB's in order to gain the WAAAAAGH! resource as well as increase the population cap. This can take a while for an inexperienced player so I recommend reading guides. I've played for hundreds of hours and even I have trouble keeping up with their tiers.But when you do get a ahead? Orks are a tough bunch and will not go down easily. Their advanced units are also pretty brutal to anything they come into contact with. Thus it is important to stay ahead of Orks as best you can or else it is game over. Now I can see people saying they are OP because of this, but their basic units can die pretty easily. They may have some decent super units, but they still need the numbers and resources to maintain themselves. The Eldar The Eldar are a dying race of (basically) space elves. They have increadibly advanced technology as well as a vast wealth of knowledge of the webway. It is because of their webway mechanic they are considered OP. They can go almost anywhere on the entire map with their webway gates as well as support themselves with their stealth and healing auras. If you are ever fighting an Eldar player or A.I opponent, expect to be going on an hour long goose chase to find where their real base is. Generally people just give up and rage quit leaving the Eldar player victorious for doing absolutely nothing but move to a new hiding spot every time the transport cooldown is over. So it basically rewards players that didn't try to preserve their army and are more than willing to hide their base rather than play the game. The only real drawback to this is that Eldar as a whole require a lot of RTS experience and mirco in order to play properly. Chaos Space Marines Chaos Space Marines or CSM for short are a horny asset flip of the Space Marines....Alright alright I'll go into more detail. CSM were loyal Space Marines that turned to Chaos during the Horus Heresy. An event that caused a civil war between Space Marines, the Emperor, and his own children. CSM are not necessarily as durable or adaptable as their loud and proud brothers. But make up for this with raw DPS, devastating armored vehicles, and teleporting Daemons they can drop in to cause more havoc. There are only two problems with the Chaos faction as a whole, one: Chaos Heretics have one of the most annoying voices I have ever heard in a videogame. And two: Other than Daemons, they don't have much that makes them stand out or make them act differently from the Space Marines. Same models (but with horns) same, animations, and half of the same weapons. I personally think Dawn of War 2 did a much better job at depicting CSM and making them stand out....Well there was this one time Alpha Legion broke the lore by summoning a Daemon of Nurlge but that's a story for another time. The Final Verdict For a 40k game, 4/5. For an RTS game? I would say 8/10 is pretty fair. It has stood the test of time proudly, and while it's game balance is questionable Dawn of War has provided something very few 40k games have managed to capture. And that is the vast combat of the universe and setting it is in. 40k games these days have either had potential but squandered it, or the developers have no idea what they are doing with an IP they barely understand. By all means leave your opinions down in the comments and if you have something to point out in the review I would be happy to hear it!			"

												Solid start to the franchise however it has a few technical issues initially (lack of widescreen support, sluggish mouse/camera controls compared to its expansions and sequels).The story is regular grimdark stuff you'd expect from Warhammer 40K. It primarily focuses on the Blood Ravens chapter of the Space Marines so if you want a campaign which allows you to play other factions, then getting Dark Crusade would be a good idea as well (Soulstorm too, though that game also has its issues).Gameplay-wise this is the solid RTS we've come to know and love over the years. You control squads rather than individual units, some squads are customizable in terms of weapons such as Tactical marines to fit the current situation or need. If you really want to test yourself, play against the insane AI on quick start either by yourself or with friends, you will experience some of the most frantic and gloriously messy RTS battles of its time.All in all this edition of the original game is solid, though Dark Crusade would be an easier recommendation for those who do not want to deal with some of these technical issues.

												The crimson armoured figure strode across rubble, burning vehicles, and corpses alike. Blood caked it's armor, wide sploches of darkened ruby which were spread all over it's once majestic- yet still formidable -armor, and made it even more terrifying in the shining light of dawn. It stood at nearly 9 feet tall, fully armored, twin massive shoulder plates on each side of it, and a helmet of grinning death, piercingly green optics burning through the haze of weapons discharge and smoke alike. it raised it's massive blocky bolter rifle with exaggerated movements belying the immense strength behind it's arms, as it slowly aims it at me. It would be the last sight I would see, as drop pods streamed from the heavens behind the giant.This was the day the Ork Tyrant of Galgaris fell, alongside the rest of his Ork WAAAGH.This was also the day I shoved my power armored boot (and PC) up said WAAAGH's collective @$$ and joined the Space Marines. 40,000/10, would run over Ork encampments in a Land Raider, screaming ""FOR THE EMPRAHHHHHH"" as loud as the vox-systems in the cabin would allow me again with the rest of my squad watching on.

												A classic real-time strategy game with excellent balance and an interesting campaign story.  Though the graphics may be well past their prime the mechanics of the game are still fun to this day.  I assume Dawn of War was truly a trendsetter in its time though this review in particular is being typed up by someone who first laid their hands on it in 2015.There are several aspects of this game that really hooked me in.  The fact that your units are -actually- units (small bands of soldiers) was a pleasant surprise.  Each unit can be reinforced, given time and requisition (currency), so it will continue to be an active part of your army as long as you replace your losses.  This prevents replacements from clogging up your new unit construction at your base and allows you to keep pressing your advantage without worrying about logistics as soldiers arrive on your frontlines instead of far behind them.  Additionally, I enjoyed being able to personally customize my own units.  If I wanted one unit of Space Marines to excel at eliminating other heavy infantry I could deck them out with a few plasma rifles while if I was going for more an anti-vehicle/building approach with that unit I could supply them with rocket launchers instead.Though I personally can't think of any complaints on the game as a whole other than stretching and pointing at the outdated graphics, I can say that I enjoyed the campaign far more than I did the random scenarios or multiplayer.  I found that I had a blast playing the game with objectives and a story but the Starcraft model of 'create a horde as fast as possbile and zerg the other base' got old quickly.  However, I am aware that there are -plenty- of players out there who would find that a great addition to the level of fun that they experience, not a detriment.I recommend this game to all RTS fans especially those who enjoy the more old-school variants.  I picked it up in a sale and got almost fifteen hours out of the Game of the Year version by itself; fifteen hours that I still believe were very well spent.			"

												Dawn of War is an RTS set in the 40k universeStory:The game starts with a company of blood ravens being sent to the planet Tartarus to help the Imperial Guard with an Ork invasion, but shortly after they arrive they find evidence that the Orks aren't the only threat to the planet, with twists around every corner that ramp up the stakes.Gameplay:When it comes to macro, the only thing that I found to be different is that you get one of your resources by capturing points, other than that, micro isn't that special. Micro on the other hand, is made unique thanks to the squad system(there may be a game that has done this before but as of this review I don't know of an game before this that did the squad system) basically when you make a unit you don't get just the one unit, you get a squad of 4(initial units in each squad does vary for each race/unit type) and can then add more to the squad, and give them special weapons. This is nice mainly because it does mean that attacks where barely anyone survives won't be as devestating since you won't have to make a new batch of units and send them accros the map, as you can just reinforce squads, also it makes selecting a large group of units easier. And the fact that you can give your squads weapons means that you can make each squad have multiple purposes. Still if you've played an RTS before then this will feel a bit familiar but the things that the game has that most rts games don't will make it seem new and not more of the same. Overall this is an amzing game that I would recommend to anyone who likes rts or Warhammer 40k(it actually made me really intrested in 40k I even got the Dark Vengeance set because of this game).Note: This is my first review that took me more than a minute to write, if there was something that I could've done better or if there's something I forget to mention feel free to let me know(I already know my intro is kinda lackluster).

												It's a Warhammer game. What's there not to love?The game can run smoothly without any major FPS hits. Plus the game helps you ""set"" up and test your settings before you play the actual game. Which is nice.The tutorial is really easy to understand. Lol, its an RTS game. If you play these sort of games before, then this should be no problem. You can customize your ""armies"" color, and insgina which is nice. Plus you can play online and/or skrimish mode as a way to help you train yourself when playing this game.This is my first Warhammer game. And I'm enjoying it so far. I won't spoil the story in the game, but Warhammer still stands as an enjoyable game to play.			"

												Brilliantly articulated models for a game of it's age and very customisable in colours with 8 presets for each of the four main races. The Orks have there main strategy, outgun and outman the opponent and then overpower them. The Eldar have there snipers and magical elements with warlocks and the seer council showing their spedialty being long range then slice n' dice. The Space Marines are the standard force but seemingly the only ones (apart from the Chaos Space Marines) who can give a good defensive against the Orks and when they band together, they destroy the Orks with ease. The Chaos Space Marines are as close as you can get to pure evil and very similar to the Space Marines and if you spawn next to them from the start, there is no escape. This game plays very well and I can't compare it much to the boardgame as I never played it but the story is pretty good, I have nothing to argue there. This plays more like an RTS rather than Dawn of War II which is a TC or Tactical Command but both are still amazing and giev good variety between games. I recommend this game to RTS fans and Warhammer fans alike.			"

As a fan of the tabletop game I have been wanting to try out dawn of war for a long time and decided to give it a go when it was free for a weekend, needless to say I was not dissapointed, the gameplay was engaging despite being a little repetative (it's an RTS though so that's to be expected), controls were easy to pick up and the game wasn't difficult to follow.

												""WOW!"" Is what I said to this game when I played it. This game in particular, excluding the Second Dawn Of War, is addicting, fun, down right amazing! I fell in love with this game at the moment I layed eye upon its beuty! The gameplay is really well rouned, the UI is pretty steady, the gameplay gives the ""mission accomplished and I'm a BADASS"" feel. The Story is pretty interesting as you progress through it, there's no multiplayer due to GameSpy shutting down, but you can still setup a battle with the CPU, up to roughly 8 players, or 4v4 on a map. Definitely worth the payout! I give this game a 10/10. Just because it's old doesn't mean it sucks......well that's debateable, but still, GET IT !!!			"

												Dawn of War is a timeless classic. I've played this game years ago but it seems it hasn't lost any of it's sweetness.Here are some things that make Dawn of War different:Gameplay:1. Resource management is basically reduced to territory control. The more strategic points you control and the better you fortify them, the more of the 'requisition' resource you get.Investing into strategic point fortification, makes them harder to capture and after simple upgrade, they can shoot at your enemies. So you're basically building sentry turrets that mine resources for you. 2. Squad reinforcment Most units operate as squads. You get a squad of 4 marines, and you can add to it (reinforce) untill you got 8 marines. With upgrades you can add a sergeant who has a skill to rally them and instantly restore Morale. If few of your marines die, you can just reinforce the squad, and they will appear at the squad position at the fraction of a cost of a new squad. This allows you to push forward after a battle with little delay without moving new forces from base to the frontlines. 3. Squad equipment You can equip your squads with weapons effective against certain types of units, you can mix them up in one squad, or just have a dedicated squad for every type. This provides interesting choices and allows for more variety in your tactics.4. Cover Having your units sit in a bomb crater, behind a wall or in the trees, makes them harder to hit and they also feel better (see Morale)5. Morale Certain situations make units lose their composure and lower their effectiveness. Especially when they fight outnumbered, or against intimidating opponents or weapons (flamethrowers, snipers).6. Space considerations with 'macro'You need to think about the space your forces are going to operate in. You wont fit 3 tanks and 4 squads of infantry into a narrow street, without totally compromising their ability to efficiently move and operate. They will get stuck, bump into each other and wont be able to all get to the front to shoot the enemy you encounter. Some people say it's a downside and speak about ""bugged pathing"". Pathing is ok, it's just that Space Marines have ""Space"" in there for a reason :>If you fail to chose the path wide enough for your forces to move through comfortably, you're going to have to accept the fact they take much longer to get into position, and if they get attacked while the squad is not in tight formation, some of them will be in range to the enemy while others might not be. Settting:It's Warhammer 40k. In the Dark Grim Future there is only War. Space Marines aka ""Adeptus Astartes"" operate in chapters similar to battle-orders of old and live to fulfill the will of the God Emperor. They routinely drop from orbit in droppods, aWhole WH40k universe is full of awesomeness and I guarantee you wont regret getting into it. High production value:Dawn of War has some of the best voice acting in videogaming of last decade. Most buildings you build are dropped by your battle barge Litany of Fury from high orbit with a very loud ""thump"" when they impact (it's hard to call it landing). Animations of a dreadnaught cherry picking an orc from enemy squad, breaking his back while setting him on fire and then tossing him in an arc over 2 tanks and a squad of infantry are priceless. Blood is everywhere and in general you can set perment scaring and bodies, so your progress through the map can be marked with bodies of your enemies. TL;DR:Dawn of War is a game like no other, except it's successors in the Dawn of War series: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, SoulstormTotally recommend to any and all fans of RTS games and/or WH40k universe.If you think you could like this game, but would like something with a bit more replayability (Dawn of War only has Space Marine campaign and skirmish/multiplayer) take a look at Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, which are a source of endless entertainment with their conqeur-the-planet style of gameplay and 7 different races to choose from.  Also be advised, that it's an old game and it has problems with wide-screen resolutions which might or might not be fixed.Myself I just played it in a 1280x1024 window. The same problem exists in Winter Assault, but Dark Crusade and Soulstorms are ok with any resolution in fullscreen.			"

												I'll finally be reviewing this game and I'll do it now.This game is a gem, the game itself is great, it has a lot of content if you compare it to modern video games.The same could be said for its expansions, great expansions with lot of new content, something that you do not see anymore nowadays.If you want the true experience then you should get this game and Dawn of War II.That's it that's all, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is also worth buying but not as much as those two games, I don't know about Endtime - Vermintide and of course I don't know about Total War: Warhammer but all I can say is this: If you want the true experience then play this one, forget about every other Workshop games (Warhammer's universe), this game, its sequel and Space Marine are the only ones to get it right at the moment.The factions are awesome, the music is simply epic, the campaign is great, the skirmishes is one great addition to the game, everything, or almost, about this game is awesome.You should buy right away it even if it is not on sale, It is totally worth it, especially if you love strategy games in a dark Sci-fi World.9.5/10			"

Found one so far and I loved itI recommed this game. 9.5/10 would slaughter Orks again!			"

												""In the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, there is only War"" And thus was born, the most brutal tabletop game ever created. Loved by Painters, and board game addicts alike, the game finally jumped the boarder from tabletop to strategy game in 2004. Amoungst the StarCraft's of the industry, where E-sports are the primary focus sits this game. Absolutely terrific, fast paced, strategic force deployment where you're bound to see a 'Bloodthirster' tear of the head of the nearest spacemarine given the chance  This still remains my favourite RTS game all of time. Not to mention the terrific story which inspired multiple books and plot strings which carried over into it's latest sequel 'Dawn Of War II. If you any kind of fan of strategy games, you will no doubt, love this. A true gem in a sea of mediocre Warhammer games. (Firewarrior any?) If you can find this on sale, dont hesitate to snap this up. And as the Orks would say; ""WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!""**************************************************************I would like to note that I've played this for years, just not on the steam version.

												One of my favourite strategy games, and I am not a big strategy player at all. This game was the dawn of the Dawn of War series, and an outstanding game in its own right.In the single player campaign, you play as the Space Marines. Through various maps and settings, the story builds towards a handful of epic confrontations, and the difficulty progresses in like manner. Playing on normal is a little too easy, but push the difficulty up and you will find yourself challenged (disclaimer: I'm not very good at RTS games).Venture into multiplayer, and you will have four races at your disposal, each with their pros and cons: Chaos Marines, Elder, Orks and Space Marines. I found the multiplayer portion of the game to be well-balanced, with end game units strong but not so readily accessible to make one race overpowered.Lastly, if you're playing on any system built in the last seven-eight years, I HIGHLY recommend following the below guide to get widescreen resolutions working (all credit goes to OP):

												This is the game that introduced me to Warhammer 40k. I love the game and the franchise as well as the universe of Warhammer 40k. The campaign is really enjoyabled to play. Although eventually I find it that it's a bit boring fighting Orcs over and over and over again. But then fortunatly we change to fight the Eldar and after shortly we fight the Chaos Space Marines.The game is about the Blood Ravens protecting an Imperium world from an Orc Invastion. Later the story folds out that other forces are at work on this planet and that their is an aftefact that if controlled by the wrong hands, it'll realse a Deamon Prince. The game is total worth playing and you should play this first before you play the other Dawn of war games: Since this is the one that started it and contains important information about the chapter which will make it easier for you to understand on what is going on later in the franchise.I'd give this a rating 9/10 since it's one of the best RTS games and it was realsed in 2004. However the only thing I think this game should of had was an map creator. As this would suit the game perfectly and an RTS game called Age of Myhtology done it back in 2001. But overall, this game is defenitly worth buying.			"

												I bought dawn of war in preparation for the 3rd Dawn of war that is supposedly getting released in 2017.The story, atmosphere and voice acting is just great.Im new to the warhammer lore but this game made me more curious about it and i even read up some stuff about the lore.They choose the perfect voice actors for the different main roles and atmosphere wise you really feel like you are on a war ravaged planet. I enjoyed the story till he end.What i didnt like that much was the gameplay. It's kinda okay but nothng outstanding. Guess there is a reason why they totally revamped it for the second game. Besides that there were games that used the capture the strategic points mechanic better (like z2)Anyhow all in all i would still recommend this game for the story/lore and atmosphere.Would recommend on sale.

												If you are a warhammer 40k fan you should get this gameIf you like real time strategy, or strategy in general, you should get this game because there is a lot to love about itBut what will you like?-Base building-real time strategy combat-The choice of playing as the Classic Space Marines, the Heresy of Chaos, The mystic Eldar, and The Whopping Orks-the skirmish matches are amazing and the multiplayer is fun too-you can have paint jobs for your troops; for example you can have the space marines with the ultramarines paint job, blood Angels, space wolves, and more or you can make your own unique paint jobs-there are different difficulty levels that you can choose fromNow what will you not like?-short campaign-only Space Marines get a campaign-if you have read the books there is one aspect of the campaign story that has been a bit done to death but I will keep this review spoiler freeBottom line:I really love this game and will get the rest of the series. I have spent 100+ hours playing this game and have never regretted buying it.My final verdict is that this is a great game and you can rest assured that your money is well spentI give this game a 10/10 with a title of Divine			"

												There are two ways in which a real time strategy game can easily screw up.The first is to have far too much micro-management.The second is to feel limited in scale, ability or grandure.Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War expertly sidesteps both issues and delivers a fun, engaging campaign to save a planet from Ork invasion.Of course more is going on, and you will soon meet all of the other factions as well.What works so well in this game compared to most other strategy games is the fact that infantry units are comprised of squads of up to 10 individual soldiers. These can be tuned with new gear and restocked when they fall.It allows for an easy way to still have an impressive army steam-roll an enemy encampment without having to micro-manage everything.I had fun, and will definitely pick up the sequel (EDIT: Then I did, it's great too. Review here)Avoid this game if you can't stomach the dead-pan Space Marine seriousness though, it can get a bit much (and it's the only faction that has a campaign).			"

												DOW is an RTS with a bit of a deviation from the standard resource/base model seen in the likes of Starcraft or C&C. Instead, you obtain resources based on captured points and relics found around the map. Doing so prevents the ""turtle in/mass army"" tactic, as you are forced to expand outwards in order to gather. Gameplay wise, the game is very clearly a Relic game; and anyone who has played Company of Heroes will pick it up right away. Rather than build one unit at a time, you build squads of units. These squads can be upgraded with special weapons, or even link up with hero type units to greatly boost their ability. While members of the squad can die, you can reenforce them on the fly, making a squad feel more valuable than the sum of it's parts. Give it a try!			"

You can build giant mech warriors that grind orks to pieces and blow the cr** out of anything that gets in their way. You have to be quick at building stuff and quick to get your defenses up against whatever is being thrown at you but once you get it, you can march right up the enemy's rear and blast them to pieces.The way the soldiers run is hilarious and the ""epic"" sounding quotes are awesome. ""Heresy grows from idleness"" is stuck in my head haha.Awesome game play, big explosions, and enough to make this game really fun for a game that is a decade old.

Allows for a lot of different tactics to be used due to the variety of units.

												This game is one of the finest RTS games ever to grace the genre. The game truly holds well even to this day, well over a decade afters its initial release. The game offers an interested and very fun singleplayer campaign where you play as the  Blood Ravens Space Marine chapter as they fight against a massive Ork force on an imperial planet. It's up to you to use your brain and tactical sense to destroy the Ork menace. But as time goes on the forces of Chaos arrive as well as the elusive Eldar and the stakes only begin to rise. The gameplay is solid. From the army commands as well as base building and management. Unlike other, older, RTS games the way you gain recources is by capturing and holding points that are around the battlemap making those areas complete hotspots for some epic large battles. You get to command large armies and pit them against other large armies, unique units and buildings per factions (four factions are available in the game), an army painter (very basic, but still fun to use custom armies in skirmish), and overall the game has a lot to offer. There are some downsides sadly, but these are more in the technical side rather than the game itself, the game does not support 16:9 resolutions, but with some mods you are able to force a 16:9 resolution in the game, but the mini map tends to bug out. The unit path finding can be a bit wonky at times as well and artillery units can be a real pain if you don't know how to properly use them, but overall nothing too serious, just minor inconveniences. This is a great game for both RTS fans and Warhammer 40k fans or if you're a fan of both, you're doing yourself an unjustice by not owning and playing this great game.			"

												Wish I had gotten into this series back when it first came out but I benefit via lower prices :P. Game is like a COH older brother where you can see where they got many of the ideas for the squad based hold point means of strategy. If you want just the campaign get DoW Platinum. Dawn of War Platinum has the expansion packs with the campaign in them. If you want for the skrimish/mp you might want to also get Soulstorm since it adds quite a bit for that purpose. Its a fun game worth getting Platinum for if you want just the story. Game feels like it could of been something on the scale of Supreme Commander Easily with large caps of units.

												Brand new player to the series (beyond Warhammer Online).  With 3 new big titles (The MMO, The Space One, and the Total War One), I figured I should go back through for story and such.No spoilers, but I'm several missions in; and enough to be caught up in the plot.  The game is a bit aged in the graphics, but the story and action immerses you enough that you won't notice.Unit controls and micro functions are lacking, but this is back in the day of 20 or 40 unit population limit, and 8 squads to a keybind.  So.... they don't matter as much (because it's not thousands of units).On the graphics front, turn on all those super fancy things your card does to the max!If you bought that big pack, or bundle, this is the game I've been told to start with.  Then just wiki the DLC/Expansion packs and play in order until 2!			"

												Dawn of War is one of the greatest single-player RPG's I have ever played. The WH40K franchise stories might sound incredibly cheesy on paper but you get control of your own company of Space Marines it just comes to life in a way few other franchises does. It makes you care about winning, it makes you care about the Empire.The gameplay is solid but nothing impressive. It maintains the standard resource based RTS gameplay but just replaces gold mines with strategic points. The units work great though, the sounds and looks of Space Marines and Ork's alike make them come alive and brings a great level of immersion.What takes Dawn of War from being just another solid RTS game to being a great RTS is not something that can be easily explained.It is the satisfaction you get from hearing the thump of a Thunderhammer impacting an Ork's skull. It is the sound of a heavy bolter opening fire from concealment. It is the Space Marine captain screaming ""CHARGE"" and rushing into certain death...			"

Sometimes units just stand around not following orders.-Dated graphical elements that break or don't work at higher resolutions, such as an invisible mouse or out of frame minimap.-Doesn't support modern resolutions.-Game apparently doesn't work on Windows 10.

												First of all, I'd recommend the Master Collection as a whole. The games are all worth playing through, and you have to own them all to use every race for online multiplayer in Dark Crusade/Soulstorm, if that matters to you.But let's say you're hesitant and want to buy them one at a time. That's cool too, and I'd certainly recommend starting here even if you buy the Master Collection. The Space Marine campaign this game offers is a great introduction to the series, and will serve you much better than throwing yourself into one of the more organic campaigns of Dark Crusade or Soulstorm.The gameplay is rather hard to describe, but the essential is that you build up your base, proceeding through tech-levels to unlock/produce more powerful units/vehicles, all while fighting for control of the resource points (the resources are needed for units/vehicles/buildings/upgrades) on the map and trying to destroy the enemy's base/not get yours destroyed. The victory conditions can vary, from destroying the enemy's headquarters, needing to eradicate them completely, or fighting for control of the difficult to defend ""Critical locations"" and holding a majority for a set amount of time (or completely eradication the enemy to end it faster).The base Dawn of War offers four races to skirmish with. The Space Marines, who are the only playable faction in the campaign, the Eldar, the Orks, and Chaos. One of the images in the slideshow shows the Sisters of Battle assaulting a Dark Eldar base, but that's from Soulstorm and shouldn't be there. Every faction plays differently, with the only overlap being some very similar units between Chaos and the Space Marines, but they have different stats/upgrades and have their own faction art. You're also able to customize the factions with the Army Painter, or use one of the several presets corresponding to different factions within the Warhammer universe.The campaign is, in my opinion, the best one in the original set. You only plays one faction, accomplishing static goals, and so it's only good for one runthrough, but that allows it to be the most polished of the bunch. It eases you into the game, introducing concepts slowly enough for you to grasp it all, but you will fail if you don't use everything it teaches you.]So, if you're looking at the series for the first time, or have already decided to buy the set, I'd recommend this one first. It's the best introduction to Dawn of War there is, unless you've found you prefer the incredibly different style of Dawn of War II.			"

One of the better ones that I've played in recent times.I did have a couple qualms with the game. Mostly in that the story never resolves in the storyline (And the sequel doesn't really help a whole lot). Who knows? perhaps it will be resolved in the third. The other thing I had an issue with was the fact that there were no scenarios where you could play as the Eldar or Chaos Marines. I honestly was looking forward to that.8/10 I'd say.			"

												By creating WH40K:DoW, Relic Entertainment has brought into existence the best Warhammer video game adaption up to date. Dawn of War is a title which doesn't just simply entertain, it takes a special place in the player's memory, and it does so due to two reasons. The first and the more considerable of these two reasons lies in the very fact that this game is set in the grim future of the 41st millennium, a future where there is only war, death and the laughter of thirsting gods. However, in order to adapt such a brilliant setting to the screen of computers, experienced, devoted and skilled game designers had to take matters into their own hands. This is where the second reason for the titles success comes into play - the developers. Relic Entertainment had the right framework to build their RTS upon from the very beginning, but even with such a great basis as the WH40k universe, talent and thoroughness were required so as to make a good quality game. Before DoW, several WH40k titles were already developed for the PC, with most of them being released in the 90's. While these predecessors were usually of good quality, certain factors prevented them from being as accomplished as DoW, graphical limitations being one of them. Relic Entertainment utilized the technology which was available in 2004 to implement the best possible graphics into their RTS, and graphics are indeed one of the most remarkable attributes which Dawn of War possesses, even to this day. The gameplay mechanics are also unique and exceptional, as are all the other aspects of the game.In Dawn of War, Relic Entertainment employed a semi-innovative resource control system. Unlike in some older, well known real-time strategies where the player had to directly gather resources which fueled his armies growth, in DoW the economy revolves around control over strategic points that are scattered all across the battlefield. The amount of the strategic points controlled is crucial since they directly affect the players requisition income, thus forcing the opposing combatants to constantly fight for the control over territory. In addition to strategic points which play the primary resource role and grant requisition, DoW also has a secondary resource called power. This resource is just as essential as requisition, since power is required for researching or upgrading technologies and abilities, and is also spent when deploying advanced units and vehicles. In order to gain power resource points, the commander must build power generator structures either near his base of operations or at special slag deposits which grant more power income. By the time Dawn of War was released, the requisition control system was new but not unheard of, since there were already games that utilized a somewhat similar concept. Massive Entertainment's Ground Control II for an example, which was released approximately three months before DoW, used a system called acquisition in which points were earned through the capturing of victory locations. Later on, Massive Entertainment used the same system in their well acclaimed RTT World in Conflict. In fairness it must be said, that even though Relic's resource control system was at that time both original and well designed, it wasn't actually their invention. They did, however, put this system to good use, because in terms of economical balance, DoW is a perfectly designed RTS. Missions in-game usually alternate between jungles and ravaged urban ruins, with Fog of War being persistent in those areas of the map which either have not yet been uncovered or were abandoned by allied forces. In battle, the environment plays a minor strategic role as well, on account of that in Dawn of War, certain types of terrain can provide troops with either good cover, granting them a protection bonus, or harmful cover which exposes the troops and makes them vulnerable to enemy fire. In general, terrain and the surrounding environment both contribute to the tactical detail of the game, with infantry traversing faster over certain terrain types, while treaded vehicles will move slower. Infantry squads all have morale that affects their combat effectiveness. An infantry squad with broken morale will be much less effective in combat, and will need to retreat in order to replenish their fighting spirit. Squad leaders also give each squad a significant morale boost. Enemy infantry has morale as well, and certain weapons, such as for an example a flamethrower, can break it faster, rendering enemy formations broken and in a state of moral dismay. In Dawn of War, there are four different factions which are anything but similar and are all driven to annihilate each other. All four of these factions have their own distinctive units, structures and strategies. Units can be divided into infantry and vehicles, with infantry groups usually being versatile and possessing the ability to capture strategic points, while vehicles often take an assault force role. Dawn of War provides the player with an immense arsenal of weaponry, including artillery, tanks and walker vehicles. Unlike some RTS games where opposing armies often have visually different but functionally identical units, in DoW units which are exclusive to one certain faction are unique in the sense that they rarely have a counterpart amongst the three other factions. Therefore, all units in DoW are not only distinguishable by their appearance, but also by their abilities and properties. The Tech-Tree in the game is well developed, each faction has numerous types of infantry, vehicles, skills, technologies and upgrades. The player can also upgrade his primary and defensive structures to go higher in the tech tree, further benefiting his fighting force. In the single-player campaign, the player will have the opportunity to play as the Space Marines Blood Ravens chapter, taking the role of Force Commander Gabriel Angelos. Throughout 11 bloody missions, players will first fight against the Ork menace, will struggle against the mysterious Eldar, and will then finally engage against the traitorous Chaos Space Marines. Most of the missions are focused on elimination of the enemy base and army. Dawn of War offers three levels of difficulty, with the ""Insane"" difficulty level being the most entertaining and challenging one. The gameplay in Dawn of War can be described as balanced, intense and loaded with ceaseless combat action.Dawn of War has detailed, beautiful graphics which appear terrific and well modeled even up to today’s standards, regardless of the fact that the game is over 11 years old. The palette in DoW fits the WH40k's universe perfectly, with darker tones overshadowing the brighter ones. The colors in game are full of contrast, all is dark yet by no means monotonous. Also, the darkness which pervades in the game by no means makes it faded or bleak; the game is rich in color, and everything has it's unique shade, from crimson blood spilled over the crusted earth to the smeared paint on war-scarred vehicle armor. In my opinion, the graphics in DoW are beyond any criticism, and were obviously created by competent individuals. The UI was elaborately designed to resemble a futuristic electronic panel, whilst the menu backgrounds appear as old parchments (with holy dogmas and aphorisms adorning the corners of these parchments). DoW isn't merely a well designed, good quality game, it is a game with a soul, and that alone says much, because such games are very hard to come by. It is worthy of staying in your heart, for once you play it, you suddenly acquire understanding of what an RTS should be like. Relic Entertainment has successfully brought a WH40K RTS to the display of computers, and for that they deserve honours. Dawn of War is the definition of an outstanding real time strategy, and whoever plays it can be fully confident, that his expectation won't be ruined.			"

												One of the best RTS games ever made I used to have the CD version when it first came out it got stolen by one of the neighbor dudes guess I can't blame him it's worth stealing lol. So my hours on steam don't even compare to how much time i've spent in this game from the CD version. But if you don't have this game then you are a RTS noob and I recommend you getting it even if it is 10 years old and don't look blingy like games today that just means you can max out settings and do large scale battles better aha.

												I played this game, as well as all of its expansions, back when they were launched. I'm a Red Alert kind of guy, having played Red Alert 1 on the PS1, and Red Alert 2 on the PC. I really didn't care much for other RTS like Age of Empires, which were big at the time.When I got Dawn of War however, it grabbed my attention instantly. It didn't have the humours nature of RA, or the actors during the Cutscenes, however it was dark and the voice acting is full of charisma.The Warhammer 40k universe is a dark one, full of twisted religious notions, which was something new, at least for me.Having had the chance to get Dawn of War on Steam recently, I jumped on the oportunity and I must say that even though the graphics and the interface are dated, the game is as enjoyable to play as ever.The adventures of the Blood Ravens carry on, and I'm delighted to join them once again.I bloody love this game :D			"

												A fun, if somewhat standard base building RTS.  With plenty of expansions to add in all of the major 40K races, DoW does a great job of representing the brand. A fun army painter lets you create your homebrewed forces to use in the game.  A good purchase, though it doesn't support some of the higher resolutions.			"

												First I have to say that this is my second time clearing this game, because I bought the compele DoW Pack, I had to play through the completet story once again. This time it was a lot easier, maybe because I am more experience with RTS now. Anyway a nice game, the unit spawn right into the army is cool, or equipping the units right away. But sadly I dont like that the population is only 20. Of course I could still defeat the PC with much much lower population, but before I could kill them all, I always have too many ressource and mostly nobody of my units died. But after all still a great game and I will continu8e my trip with Winter Assault now.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Dawn of War series, I have most of the games (as boxed non Steam copies) but I am looking into getting all my Dawn of War and Dawn of War 2 stuff onto my Steam. I love the Warhammer universe and it fits very well into the RTS genre. In my opinion the Dawn of War series is one of the best RTS series out there, its easy to learn but hard to master and that makes it fun to start playing and never stop! Each pack of expansion content adds a new single player campaign and more playable races/ factions to the game, and most of the packs are even stand alone so you can pick and choose what you want to buy and play without dropping a huge amount of money on all of the content. I feel if you ever get the chance to try the Dawn of War games you should go for it, especially if you like RTS games or Warhammer.We fans dont often get ""good"" Warhammer games, like one in every 5 games ends up being decent, especially since most of the Warhammer games as of late have been mobile or some variation of cheap/ money grabbing. Dawn of War series has none of that. So again, you will probobly like the game if you have read my review this far. Try it!Update: I went through Sega of America support and they gave me new keys for the Platinum edition of the game, I now have my Dawn of War, Winter Assault, and Dark Crusade on Steam.			"

My only issue, gameplay wise, is the pathing issues.  I'd direct my forces to one location and they'd split into multiple directions, especially when vehicles were involved.  You really just have to get used to directing your squads one by one at times.  For those that like to play full screen, you'll need to know that the game doesn't support 16:9I've played a little bit of the multiplayer and it's fantastic if you have a friend to play with.

												A great, classic RTS game and part of the greater Dawn Of War series which is also a treat for RTS and Warhammer 40,000 fans. You can play through multiple storylines as different races that are part of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and go in depth with the stories as the campaigns progress. The game did a good job of not only mastering the RTS aspect, but also of capturing the essence of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Capturing key points is a key part of battlefield gameplay in this RTS, and it should be enjoyable for anybody that likes RTS games in general.Once you are done with the campaigns, you can also play in Skirmish mode, or play Online against other players. This game should give you many hours of quality gameplay and I would recommend it to anybody that is interested in the Warhammer 40,000 universe - as well as for new players that want to start getting into it as well.

												Relic once again proves that they're masters of RTS development with Dawn of War. While it has some balancing issues here and there, it's an excellent example of a game that sticks to well-established conventions (general playstyle) yet injects its own, Relic flavoring. On top of that, it captures the Warhammer 40,000 universe's lore phenomenally. You can tell a lot of effort went into making this game challenging and fun to play. Definitely worth grabbing, especially if you're a Warhammer 40,000 fan!			"

												So this is my first entry into the Warhammer 40,000 universe and I must say I was very impressed. Simple to understand, excessively violent and nearly a perfect strategy game that marks the pinnacle of RTS games of it's era.The story, not to spoil a single thing is superb for an RTS. In my opinion, the story is easily better than that of many games today. With it's twists, turns and full stops, it's a rather moving ride. As you complete missions, the story unfolds a little more until it all breaks down and becomes less of a story to do with missions than all out annihilation. Spending 15 hours with the Blood Raven Space Marine chapter tearing apart Ork by Ork, Eldar by Eldar and Chaos by ♥♥♥♥ing Chaos was a blast and even towards the end never lacked for excitement. However that leads me to slight dismay with the game. Even early in the 15 hours I got sick of playing the same units and the same strategy, the campaign never challanged me to try something different. Maybe it was because I was playing on Normal rather than anything hardcore, but it felt that way. The only time it made me do something strikingly different was when I was pushing away at early linear tutorial missions. However despite this, it's still an excellent game - especially for it's time. Relic, the guys who developed this, along with other award-winning and highly recommended RTS games such as Homeworld and the Company of Heroes franchise did an great job polishing it, making it look strikingly beautiful (of course for it's time) and simple but not bland.Now onto the Skirmish/Multiplayer. Basically the same mode where on varied maps players/AI must battle it out to complete different objectives based on game modes and on many different maps. Map variety is great, even without the expansions and despite not doing much in the skirmish, you could tell that you'd be in for something different just looking at the startup skirmish screen. Whether you play as the Eldar, Orks, Space Marines or Chaos (plus more if you have expansions and use the CD keys on those expansions) you have a varied playstyle and each race is balanced making skirmishes fair each time. However, another point I must bring up, and I've noticed in Relic's other game - Company of Heroes is, that the AI seems to just do the same each game. I may have said the maps make varied gameplay, but mainly against players or if the bots are decently hard. The AI 9/10 do the same thing each time and makes them very predictable leaving them easily destroyable. If you skipped reading that, you're ♥♥♥♥ing lazy, but I came prepared:Pros- Varied Skirmish Maps- Balanced and different factions to play as on skirmish.- Great story was it's twists and turns.Cons- AI often predictable on skirmishes.- Campaign, despite fun, becomes rather repetitive towards the end. One term: Annihilation.Overall I'd rate it easily a 8.5/10.			"

												BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!(ThanksBuketIloveyounohomo!!) Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® is a RTS game by Relic, who did all the other (Good?) Warhammer  games, along with Company of Heroes.  The gameplay revolves screaming out SPACE MARINES ADVANCE!! and generally capturing strategeic points, which gives you one of the game's currencies, Requisition points. The other is obtained by building generators, which gives you power. You do this all while being attacked by Orks, Eldar, and Chaos Marines. Luckily for you, you have Space Marines, along with a large arsenal featuring units, weapons, and vehicles. So do all your enemies, however, so you must reach your vehicles and other powerful units to give you the advantage you need, before your foes reach it and start smacking your face with their stuff. Yeah, its pretty awesome.  I highly recommend this game as it features a great campaign along with some suprisingly humorous dialouge(Mainly between Bale and Sindri), along, and multiplayer with a Skirmish mode(Standard RTS fair, select a faction(s) and fight them), and, of course, multiplayer(Each player controls a faction. Who'd want to play Eldar, I have no clue.).  I recommend this game to really, just about anyone. I'm terrible at strategey, but I loved this game. (And remember, Even in death I serve!) "

												Played this game like 6-7 years ago and played a lot more than stated by steam.IMO dawn of war is defenitly one of the best RTS games of all time and I reccomend you get the whole franchise.Pros--Large control groups compared to other RTS's of the time, allowing you to control huge amounts of units at once-Great camera system allows you to see the battlefield the way you want to see it withought having to use a completely different set of keys-Training squads instead of individual units makes battles seem more large scale and ""war like,"" compared to other RTS games. -More diverse upgrades than  most RTS games.-COMPATIBLE WITH DARK CRUSADE HYPE-Stunning graphics for its time and since the game is old it will run even on the ♥♥♥♥♥iest of todays computers, bringing fun to all computer gamers :DCons--Multiplayer will ♥♥♥♥ on you-My second/third favorite war40k factions are not in the game :( -Resource system is different from almost every other RTS i've ever played and im frankly not a huge fan, although some people enjoy it.-Army painter isn't as in-depth as you would hope, but is still fun to play around with.-Campaign is relatively easy and then has a sudden difficulty spike, which turns off both veterans playing on hard modes and new players trying to learn the game.

												The Warhammer 40k series of games from Relic Entertainment is a series that never fails to let down, always capturing the feel of the tabletop game in a completely new fashion that is always fantastic, through the Dawn of War series of games and the third person shooter, Space Marine. Dawn of War 1 has a unique gameplay feel to it, as relic made the 2nd one also have a unique feel - giving this game a slot of originality that no other game, not even it's own sequel, is capable of matching. The voice acting, music, and storyline are superb not just by the standards of a real time strategy game but all games in general. And of course, there's the online or offline multiplayer on many maps, all custom made rather than campaign maps simply with redone start posistions and such.This is a fantastic game that stands up to even modern day RTS games with no trouble. I highly recommend getting this game, whether you are a hardcore RTS fan or not much of one at all. It will deliver to everyone, and that is a promise.			"

The asymmetrical nature of the different ""sides"" that you can play is a good change.

Surprisingly no, this is Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War where you will experience plenty of it. PROS:- Crisp, Detailed Animations (Excellent for it's time period of release)- Great Voice Acting- Each Faction Has It's Own Unique Appeal Along With a Sense of Balance Gameplay Wise- Strategy is Actually Required Majority of the Time- Skirmish Mode and Multiplayer Add Replayability with Plenty of Maps to Play On (Keep In mind that this game came out in 2004 so expect a smaller player base)- Army Customization with The RGB Color System, Emblems, and BannersCONS:- A.I at Times Is Very Dumb Not Properly Following Commands- The Campaign Can Feel Dull and Linear- When Selecting Pre-set Sub-divisions for Customization There Are a Few MIssing from Lore (Such as the Salamanders Space Marine Chapter)Verdict: This is the very first RTS game that I have ever played and has completely pulled me not only into the awesome Warhammer 40K universe but the genre as a whole. I think everyone once in their lifetime needs to check out this title 9/10. Now hurry up and purchase it so that you can get your WAAAGH! on (Also keep in mind that the game does have a learning curve and you will not become an elite badass overnight).			"

The whole DOW series is amazing (apart from the voice acting in soulstorm). Just be careful as the trailer is very misleading.			"

												The tutorial mission and first campaign mission are, as a pair, a good example of RTS game design - you get a little more choice of units first, then you're limited a bit, teaching you the value of those units.Plot is kind of underwhelming, but this is only the first entry in a decade-long franchise and the gameplay is the focus.If you like 40K or RTS, check out Dawn of War.

												Great game, bonus points if you like the warhammer universe. Unit variety is great especially since you get Winter Assault along with the base game if you purchase the Gold Edition. If you get Dark Crusade it adds a new campaign with new mechanics making an already great game better. Definitley worth the purchase. I played this game when I was about 13 and revisiting it now at an older age gave me a whole new appreciation for not only this game but the entire Warhammer universe.			"

												On the bright side, it's an undying classic, which provides a strong foundation for the series. Radiating that unique halo of the Warhammer 40K franchise, it appeals to any fan tremendously, while still holding a certain entertainment value to a complete stranger, too. Concerning campaign, the plot is traditionally brutal and somewhat enigmatic, and the roleplaying aspect is rather decent for an RTS. In two words, there are Space Marines, and their famous Tartarus campaign (with Imperial Guard cameo, sort of). Concerning skirmish, the tech-trees are quite clear, and the resource management is pretty straightforward. The game is about battle tactics and strategies, and in this field it delivers fairly deep and dynamic experience. In skirmish, Orks, Eldar, and Chaos factions are all playable, too. And re-playable, and enjoyable, of course.Talking cons, the textures and video FX are so... oldschool, and the music is rather naive to my taste. Besides, the in-game tooltip fonts are so small that it's almost unreadable, and also unscalable, just like this Steam's built-in browser. But the most annoying thing in the whole game is the dumbest pathfinding ever, which makes fielding large armies quite a challenge. See, the map landscape is typically uneven here, the terrain is rough, and the ruins are everywhere (supposed to be tactical, I think). That doesn't work well with bad pathfinding, - when you issue a move order for several squads at once, you can see them crowding, loosing formations, getting stuck, holding each other, then running away or apart from each other, and begging to be shot during all the hilarious process. Now, THAT is not something to which you can accomodate, not after playing so many modern RTS with brilliant pathfinding. That's why, against modern standards (e.g. DoW II), the game is a bit too uncomfortable to play on a regular basis.Verdict: definitely a ""must have"" for the fans of Warhammer 40K universe, and well recommended for the students of classic RTS. For everybody else - it's your call, but I'd recommend starting with DoW II instead.			"

												I've logged over 200 hours between this game and it's expansions. Incredibly fun and addicting, the expansions offer familiar gameplay but throw in major additions that bring tons of replay value. Campaign and ""skirmish mode"" against AI help you ramp up for online multiplayer very well. Also, very faithful to the Games Workshop IP and Warhammer 40k universe as a whole. Honestly, I love every aspect of this game!11/10			"

												For all Warhammer 40,000 fans, you'll find a sumptuous, satisfying look at the age of war, with units that are both familiar and completely faithful, including the impressive Avatar of Khaine. Those of us that are RTS fans will find a game that has some deep gameplay elements, furious action, and absolutely gorgeous art design. Dawn of War's tremendous unit design and the resulting balance makes for some addictive, tactical gameplay. In all,  well-balanced, good-looking, deep multiplayer game, with a fun story and a good RTS element.			"

The classic Warhammer 40,000 RTS by Relic from 2004. Must-play for all 40K fans. Even if you aren't, the RTS is really, really solid here, so get it just for a campaign run or two anyway. The gameplay is squad- and upgrade-based, basic cover and line-of-sight mechanics are used (not as advanced as Company of Heroes or Dawn of War II). Great music and atmosphere. FTE.You'll want the first two expansions and possibly the third (which was not developed by Relic and isn't quite the same quality).			"

												TL;DR:A fantastic game that still holds up surprisingly well for its age, Dawn of War is a solid strategy game that does double-time. It serves as a solid introductory porthole into a universe filled with history and lore that spans dozens of rule books, character sheets, and novels. It also provides hours of entertainment as a founder of new types of real-time strategy gameplay that breaks away from the Blizzard norm. If you have exhausted your strategy game library and have never tried Dawn of War, I highly recommend it.For the full review, go here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/01/06/dawn-of-war-late-bird-review/ "

												Just like the other 885,363 PC gamers out there, a few weeks ago I picked up a copy of the Humble THQ Bundle. Not only was it a great deal for some games, it was also a way to help a company in need.  Now everyone can argue the ‘Hows’ and ‘Whys’ of THQ’s current situation, but at the end of the day gamers aren’t overly interested in their products.  And its hurting them more than it has in years.  But this isn’t an financial overview of the current fiscal situation of THQ.This is a Bargain Bin Breakdown, and the game is Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.  And you may have figured out prior to the break that I’ve never played anything Warhammer 40,000 before.  So its another unbiased review that falls completely on the games merit!  I love it when that happens.  However, with schedules tightening and life being life, I’m not always able to play an entire game.  Its actually a difficult choice on what to play when and for how long.  And having nine new games added to my Steam games list only makes it more of a challenge.  Do you realize I’ve had L.A. Noire for months and have yet to play it?!But I’m rambling again…My plan with Dawn of War was to play at least 3 missions of the main campaign then a skirmish as the enemy faction.  This, in theory, would give me enough to rate the games mechanics, story, and balance.  After which point I could continue to play, if the game had captured my interest, or begin writing my review.  Everything started well.  I played the tutorial so I could see which type of RTS this was.  Then I started the first mission.I was impressed at how well they tell the story with the opening sequences.  Even if I wasn’t really following what was going on with the story, the way in which it was given was very well done.  Unfortunately, to me its just another Orc vs Human story that I can’t find interest in.And unfortunately I've never had any interest into the types of worlds where Orcs are present.  I am a fan of Science Fiction, but Fantasy hasn't ever done it for me.  Orcs, Elves, Humans, Middle Earth, whatever or where ever it is, hasn't been my thing.  I've played the WarCraft games, I’ve seen the Lord of the Rings movies, I attempted to read a few different stories in the past.  But none of it really sparks much interest in me.  So the real challenge with games of this genre is to excite me in other ways.  Which has happened, but is a rare occurrence.I can’t find any of the Orcs terrifying, or anything other than plain stupid, and in this game its no different, they just look goofy.  Sure the graphics are dated, but not so bad, and I kinda enjoyed them since they reminded me of Star Wars Galaxies.  But the models themselves, and the designs that were chosen.  A part of my lack of interest in the fantasy worlds fall under technology.  The worlds always look very similar to the Middle Ages, but then there will be some sort of advanced technology that just doesn't fit.The Humans are actually fine in this regard since everything of theirs looks and matches the advance space faring race type.  However the Ocrs look like a lesser advanced race, until they bust out the battle units.  And I just can’t accept being so far advanced on one side and looking a few centuries behind on the other.But story and setting or not I can still play a game.  So I brushed aside my opinions of the story and played on, enjoying the games itself.  And the mechanics are amazing.  The first mission did a great job of holding my hand and guiding me through the process of playing.  Sure, I had learned a bit from the tutorial, but had quit that about halfway in.  It didn’t take long to finish the mission, and even take a moment to realize that I have genuinely enjoyed playing the game.Then came the second mission.  And while I did enjoy myself for most of it, my enjoyment started to ween.  There came a point in the mission where my troops, just a couple of infantry squads, felt so overpowered.  There wasn’t anything they could’t take out in a matter of seconds.  I expected it to be on the easier side this early in the game, but this was ridiculous.  The hand holding was still there, which wasn’t a big deal, just not really necessary.In between he missions are more story pieces.  And I’m not sure what to call them, since they’re not FMV or cinematic’s   They are scripted sequences that take place on the map itself.  Often before you take over control of the game and start the mission.  It was really well done, and probably my favorite thing out of this game.I did also love the dead units not disappearing from the battlefield.  There’s just something about watching your enemies slain pile up.  It really brings to light just how many souls you’ve taken in your quest for vengeance.Onto the third mission, this is where everything changed.  This is where the game got real.It starts with a pre-built base and units guarding checkpoints.  It starts with you coming under attack.  And the attacks don’t waver.  Now I will offer the chance that I was completely missing some important factoid that makes the mission easier.  But I did try it three separate times.  Each time I was unable to build up or maintain a defense force while also building an attack force.  And after awhile the tanks rolled in, and I hadn’t a chance.That’s when a friend informed me of a Mech unit that was located on the map.  So on the fourth attempt I managed to hold my ground long enough to seek out this unit.  I found it and unlocked the ability to build more of them.  And with these new units I swept through the lands slaughtering all that came in my path.  And completed the mission.But here is the problem.  While on previous missions my infantry units mowed through people and buildings like they were all made of paper, now the enemy has tanks and is mowing through me in the same fashion.  Until I get these Mech units, and it sways back into my favor.  I don’t like this.  This doesn’t feel like balance.  It feels like the scales are swaying back and forth.  One side always has an advantage over the other, its just the who that changes.So I tried a Skirmish, just to see.  A standard 8 team Free For All, where I played as the same faction that I was in the campaign.  It was pretty uneventful, I may have had it on too easy of a difficulty.  But I managed to build a base and maintain my defenses from a few attacks, and then build up my attack force.  Then I sent them out to battle, and they walked right through the enemy like paper…Now, when I play a mission I tend to have double the needed units to succeed, sometimes triple.  I love nothing more than having units in the triple digits.  Dawn of War, like most others of its RTS type, has a population limit.  Sometimes I can work with this, but I always feel like its not enough.But don’t think I’m going to trash this game because of the apparent major change in the difficulty curve from mission two to mission three.  Or because the balance feels to be in constant shift.  Because of what I did play of this game I did enjoy.  A lot of this game I thought was great and pretty ground breaking for its time.  I just can’t create any connection with the characters, units, or setting.But I have no plans to uninstalling or forgetting about Dawn of War, I will keep it there, ready for when I’m ready to come back to it.  But most of all this time spent has shown me where Company of Heroes really came from.  Which seeing as I’ve been obsessed with that game is a great way to open my eyes to its evolution.  Things that I don’t like, or don’t feel like they work in Dawn of War are not present in Company of Heroes.  While other things are expanded on and evolved into better thing			"

												So this is my first entry into the Warhammer 40,000 universe and I must say I was very impressed. Simple to understand, excessively violent and nearly a perfect strategy game that marks the pinnacle of RTS games of it's era.The story, not to spoil a single thing is superb for an RTS. In my opinion, the story is easily better than that of many games today. With it's twists, turns and full stops, it's a rather moving ride. As you complete missions, the story unfolds a little more until it all breaks down and becomes less of a story to do with missions than all out annihilation. Spending 15 hours with the Blood Raven Space Marine chapter tearing apart Ork by Ork, Eldar by Eldar and Chaos by ♥♥♥♥ing Chaos was a blast and even towards the end never lacked for excitement. However that leads me to slight dismay with the game. Even early in the 15 hours I got sick of playing the same units and the same strategy, the campaign never challanged me to try something different. Maybe it was because I was playing on Normal rather than anything hardcore, but it felt that way. The only time it made me do something strikingly different was when I was pushing away at early linear tutorial missions. However despite this, it's still an excellent game - especially for it's time. Relic, the guys who developed this, along with other award-winning and highly recommended RTS games such as Homeworld and the Company of Heroes franchise did an great job polishing it, making it look strikingly beautiful (of course for it's time) and simple but not bland.Now onto the Skirmish/Multiplayer. Basically the same mode where on varied maps players/AI must battle it out to complete different objectives based on game modes and on many different maps. Map variety is great, even without the expansions and despite not doing much in the skirmish, you could tell that you'd be in for something different just looking at the startup skirmish screen. Whether you play as the Eldar, Orks, Space Marines or Chaos (plus more if you have expansions and use the CD keys on those expansions) you have a varied playstyle and each race is balanced making skirmishes fair each time. However, another point I must bring up, and I've noticed in Relic's other game - Company of Heroes is, that the AI seems to just do the same each game. I may have said the maps make varied gameplay, but mainly against players or if the bots are decently hard. The AI 9/10 do the same thing each time and makes them very predictable leaving them easily destroyable. If you skipped reading that, you're ♥♥♥♥ing lazy, but I came prepared:Pros- Varied Skirmish Maps- Balanced and different factions to play as on skirmish.- Great story was it's twists and turns.Cons- AI often predictable on skirmishes.- Campaign, despite fun, becomes rather repetitive towards the end. One term: Annihilation.Overall I'd rate it easily a 8.5/10.			"

PROS:- Crisp, Detailed Animations (Excellent for it's time period of release)- Great Voice Acting- Each Faction Has It's Own Unique Appeal Along With a Sense of Balance Gameplay Wise- Strategy is Actually Required Majority of the Time- Skirmish Mode and Multiplayer Add Replayability with Plenty of Maps to Play On (Keep In mind that this game came out in 2004 so expect a smaller player base)- Army Customization with The RGB Color System, Emblems, and BannersCONS:- A.I at Times Is Very Dumb Not Properly Following Commands- The Campaign Can Feel Dull and Linear- When Selecting Pre-set Sub-divisions for Customization There Are a Few MIssing from Lore (Such as the Salamanders Space Marine Chapter)Verdict: This is the very first RTS game that I have ever played and has completely pulled me not only into the awesome Warhammer 40K universe but the genre as a whole. I think everyone once in their lifetime needs to check out this title 9/10. Now hurry up and purchase it so that you can get your WAAAGH! on (Also keep in mind that the game does have a learning curve and you will not become an elite badass overnight).			"

The classic Warhammer 40,000 RTS by Relic from 2004. Must-play for all 40K fans. Even if you aren't, the RTS is really, really solid here, so get it just for a campaign run or two anyway. The gameplay is squad- and upgrade-based, basic cover and line-of-sight mechanics are used (not as advanced as Company of Heroes or Dawn of War II). Great music and atmosphere. FTE.You'll want the first two expansions and possibly the third (which was not developed by Relic and isn't quite the same quality).			"

												DoW is fairly enjoyable for me. It's fairly easy to play, and squads are somewhat balanced, but end up being kind of broken depending on which race you play and qhat weapon upgrades you choose, as one can have a few of the earliest squads avalible take down the last group that you can unlock. Granted, some maps don't include relics, which means that you lose access to the end stage squads, but since they tend to be the smaller maps desined for 1v1, it may not be as much of an issue for some. Base building is farily enjoyable as you need specific buildings in order to advance further, although the small projections around the two (three if you play Eldar) make it a pain to place things without running out of space if you aren't clever with placement. Overall I think it's fun to mess around in for ~25 minutes in a game just grinding down the opponents.			"

I like to set up a base and crawl into my shell until I have a massive army. Just don't play on Easy and expect fun...because it's REALLY REALLY easy. Out of ten? Compared to other strategy games, probably about a 7 or 8/10. If it had more modern graphics and more interesting replayability, I would give it a 10/10, but since it was made a while ago, they're not to blame. Jesus is.			"

												Great game. As both a W40K fan, and a big fan of RTS games, this was a game made in heavan for fans of both or just RTS games in general. Excellent sound design, options, graphics, and the gameplay is fantastically well designed. It's a tad traditional, but it does enough to make itself stand out, such as focusing on reinforcing squads, and the unlimited resources adds an extra source of tension since both you and your enemy could end up slugging it out until the last man falls if you dont equip them properly or suck as a general.Overall, great experience, but the expansion packs, specifically Dark Crusade, are better in terms of content and unit variety, but still worth a playthrough for completionists sake as the story is followed up on in DoWII8/10			"

I love the individual races and their unique strengths. It is a pristine rts on par with warcraft 3 in the very least one of my favorites. The lore is cool and leads to awesome character design i just love the defilers they give off this horroresque vibe of possessed killing machine strapped with flamethrowers and artillery cannons and i get simmilar variously almost ""themed"" vibes from every type of unit. The game is amazing and runs very smoothly on my crappy integrated graphics.

												I've got a 75% off coupon for this game, so you can have it for $3.25 US if you hurry. I can't use the coupon, so I'd accept just about any offer.This game is good. It fixes most of the common flaws of the RTS genre (lookin at you, Starcraft). Small, plentiful units are grouped into squads and basic/obvious tasks are handled automatically, so there's less micro-managing/actions-per-second and more actual strategy. It's nice to command troops that aren't totally incompetent. The point-capture-for-resources gameplay is reminiscent of the Battlefield series, and a little bit of an improvement IMHO. Balance is decent but not great, but you're playing it on PC, so mods.			"

												Dawn of War is Warhammer 40K's first Real-Time Strategy game in the collection of Warhammer 40K videogames.  Since there's quite a bit to say, I'm just going to categorize the different sections of the game.-Story:  Combining aspects of fantasy and science fiction, you are tasked to lead Gabriel Angelos and the Space Marines known as the Blood Ravens as they take on a campaign to rid the planet of Tartarus of the war-loving, barbaric Orks.  What first starts out as a quest of extermination becomes a more complex conflict as more hostile factions enter the fray and a threat that could endanger the whole galaxy is discovered.  I will refrain from revealing much more about the story, but the campaign ends on a cliffhanger, all the more reason to buy DLC.  While the campaign is only 11 missions long and feels paced a little faster than it probably should be, the game attempts to compensate with each level taking anywhere between 1-2.5 hours, which probably explains why the story may have been rushed.  If you're a veteran of the RTS Genre, you may find the core game's campaign to be easy and manage to clear every level without failure.  Overall it's a story that justifies your actions and explores a small fragment of what it's like to be part of the Imperium of Man if nothing else, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.    3.5/5-Graphics:  The game was made in 2004, as a result the graphics you're going to see are going to be a little dated in contrast to the more modern landscapes and character designs known today, even on the higher settings.  As a result, the textures are going to be rather bland and lacking in detail in some places.  Obvious geometry for the most part isn't too noticeable, however animations are rather rigid and limited and you will probably start seeing the same actions get repeated, especially during the Campaign cutscenes.  Even with all the advancements in graphics throughout the years, Dawn of War ages surprisingly well.  You'll be able to notice the bloodshed, corpses, bullet holes and explosion residue left in craters as the battles rage, even if there are a few limitations.  The buildings are animated, so you'll know if your stuff is damaged, being built or whether something's happening, which is always useful in a fast-paced skirmish where information is vital.  Every faction has their own distinct style that's present in their architecture and Game UI, preventing the player from confusing one side for another. Overall, the game's graphics aren't the best I've seen, but it's pretty remarkable considering what was available at the time.   4/5-Gameplay:  Dawn of War is one of the simpler RTS games in terms of complexity.  The map is already drawn with every key point identified, however fog of war still exists, ensuring that  reconnaissance is still important.  There are only two resources to collect:  Requisition and Power, with the former being automatically generated (but sped up as you explore the map and claim more points) and the latter requiring the player to construct generators to collect.  Because of how requisition works, one never has to worry about the map being depleted of resources and being unable to build things, although it becomes much more difficult to construct anything when you have less buildings and points to generate resources.  There are also few kinds of units, which allow for simpler yet fewer strategies.  You will only encounter infantry, land vehicles and builders.  Fortunately the game not only classifies infantry as groups that can be reinforced and improved with your resources wherever they're located, it also avoids adding defenseless builders when you attempt to select your army.  There are four factions by default with more added in DLC, each promoting different strategies and play styles, but you're most likely going to be acquainted with the Jack of All Stat Space Marines from the campaign and the tutorial levels.  Speaking of the tutorial, every key aspect playing the game is covered in an easy to understand way that will allow newcomers to at least figure out what they're supposed to be doing.  One thing I will complain about is how limited the camera zooming is, as I tend to be unable to select all of my units that start occupying the entire screen, and at times your units may have difficulty simply going where you request them to, but not very often.  Before I forget, there is one aspect that separates Dawn of War from other Real-Time Strategy games:  Morale.  Yes, the often mistakenly overlooked aspect of war that must be maintained within your ranks.  Morale determines the survival of your units, and once its depleted they will start missing more often than a stormtrooper at point-blank range.  Naturally there are commander units that exist to boost morale and/or break enemy spirit that can be bound to infantry squads and can prove to be dangerous units with enough research and training.  Because of how morale works, it's never a good idea to send in a strike team that's outnumbered.   To summarize everything that was just typed, Dawn of War is one of the less complex RTS games you'll find, but that doesn't make it necessarily easy or boring.  4/5-Sound:  Everything sounds like what you'd expect it to, weapons, vehicles and all.  Each faction has their own idiosyncratic set of sound cues you'll associate them with.   While it is a minor annoyance to hear your units make an announcement every single time something involving them changes, anything said will always be relevant to the given situation with examples such as “Squad broken!” and “Under fire!”.  Everything your units say is not only standard, but reveals more of the personalities behind the unit type and the faction they hail from.  The background music is usually faint compared to the action, which is a good thing in this case because it doesn't distract from the more important aspect of this game:  Warfare.  While the background music fits the scenario, there isn't much else to say about this limited track.  Aside from the necessary announcements and some extra filler to avoid having the game sound too quiet, sound wasn't much of a focus on this game.  3.5/5-Replayability:  As games grow older and remain active through time, their replay value gradually diminishes and Dawn of War is no exception.  While the campaign may keep one occupied anywhere between a few days to a week at most, there is no real incentive to play this game for very long.  Skirmish mode may be fun for a few rounds to experiment with other factions and strategies, but aside from that there isn't much to say.  While there might have been an active multiplayer for the core game in the past, hardly anyone tends to roam the lobbies anymore.  Unless you know of other people who own the core game, you may end up never setting foot in the multiplayer community.  Fortunately there are three DLC expansion packs that can add more vitality for the game, with the majority of them being well-received as they incorporate new factions, campaigns and possibly fixes to whatever bugs exist and updates for the graphics.  With what little exists in the core game, DLC is practically a necessity, although it's important to keep in mind that Dawn of War has a sequel where the majority of users have most likely migrated to.  A little distressing, but what do you expect from an old game?  It's a miracle it's still even active.  3.5/5Summary/TL;DR:Dawn of War may not be the most complex Real-Time Strategy game out there, but that doesn't make it any less fun.  Overall score:  18.5/25  or 74%**Note:  This score is for the core game itself.  The expansion packs have not been evaluated by this user and may change the score.			"

												A pretty cool different Starcraft. More based on combat strategy than building a base. And of course there's a great overly serious 40K story. Lots of fun.			"

												There are a lot of RTS games out there and Dawn of War is one of the best of the best. It actually does feel like you're playing the Warhammer 40K tabletop game, except without all of the hassle. While the graphics are lacking nowadays, the gameplay and fun factor are still top-notch. There is base building, but it doesn't require an insane amount of micro-managing like SC2 does, for example. What makes this game so enjoyable to me is that you spend the majority of your time managing your massive army and it's just straight up fun to do.The campaign is OK and worth a single playthrough. Just be prepared for drawn out conversations, overly wordy narration, and some incredibly terrible voice acting (though it does have a particular charm). The meat and potatoes is the multiplayer mode, which you can play against CPU bots or online. In this version of the game you can pick between four factions which include Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and Chaos.Highly recommended.			"

												ProsPretty easy to learn for an RTS. Low skillcap, only basic micro required.All four races play unique.Battles are huge and epic. Soundtrack is great, combat is fast, unit quotes never get tiring and are full of ham and cheeseGreat campaign. Awesome expansions add 3 more campaigns and 5 more races. By getting all expansions, you have access to every available Warhammer army that was during this time except Tyranids.Sindri Myr's voice is like auditorial chocolateConsUnit collision sucks ballsBalance could be better. No Tyranids. Play Dawn of War 2 for Tyranids. "

There are a few more races, but they are stupid and really OP, so guys, this is a 10/10 game for 2006, also as Dark Crusade and Winter Assault.

												Dawn of War is one of my favorite RTS games, even though I suck ♥♥♥ at them, Dawn of War is one I find myself picking up again and again to play. The game takes the setting in the Warhammer 40k universe and lets you control one of a few factions from the Warhammer lore to battle other players. The factions in this game are the Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, and Chaos Space Marines.The game, and the series, has many pros; the game has base building, units in squads, vehicles, and pretty decent destruction effects. The aingle player is decent I think and is a good few hours of gameplay and then the multiplayer is like a lot of RTS games however it has resource points you take and hold on the map to keep a steady flow of resources to your side to build buildings and troops. The game offers a variety of modes players can wage battle in such as take and hold (which is taking critical points and holding them to win), annihalation (which is just killing the other side), and capture the flag and so on. The only bad thing I think when it comes to this game is that it is an older game and a few computers have had issues running it but for the most part it seems to be able to run on the newer systems. If not then most fixes can be found online. In the end if you enjoy games like Company of Heroes, Starcraft, Warcraft, etc. then I would recommend this game. The gameplay is well done, pretty well balanced, and enjoyable to play with some friends or just to pass some times with. If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k lore and setting than this game is great.			"

This game has good graphics, runs smooth and has a lot of content. The storyline on hard for me took 10 hours and I enjoyed every second, beautiful mission designs and very good storyline. Lots of different troops and buildings. When I finished the game I said to myself “I have to buy dawn of war2""because of how much fun I had playing it and wanted to know what happens in the storyline.10/10 must buy on sale.			"

												I have no experience with the 40K universe, but this game is awesome. Unlike Starcraft, this game is actually tactical. It's not really about massing a few units. You have to actually use your brain. There are  different weapons you can equip your men with that all serve different purposes. Use the wrong weapon? Your units die. Also , there are more upgrades. It's really about customizing your army for different tactical purposes. And thankfully there isn't any of that B.S. cute micro stuff. There are also tactical points, relics, and slag deposits to worry about. Oh and there are diferent kidnds of cover, too. There are many gameplay elements, not just  rushing the enemy base. If you clickfast games then this isn't for you, stick to Starcraft. If you want a real tactical game, this is it. Plus the lore is better and there are many races, not just three like most RTS games.			"

												Dawn of Eldar, the best Eldar game ever made! If you are an orc lover like me, then this game teaches you the error of your ways and the ultimateness of the Eldar, as does every sequal & expansion there-after! I now know better. Eldar ♥♥♥♥ or GTFO!Seriously, get the firestorm over kronos/kuravana mod ASAP and this game becomes awesome. Without it, it was good for its time but it hasn't aged well.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												I have 30 minutes on the game at the moment I'm typing this up, 30 mins in and I have not even finished the tutorial. This game takes time and investment, if you put the work in the return is great. Very enjoyable if you are into RTS's and lore.			"

												Good game but rather short on content.I know this is one of the more venerated RTS franchioses and mind you I liked it. The interface borrows from the Blizzard school of RTS as opposed to the Westwood School. You are given a fair amnount of info for each unit, it;s damage, it's strengths it's weakness, etc.However, it's rather scarce on content compared to many of it's peers. Little hint,. If you're going to have multiple factions in an RTS, it behooves you to at least due a story campaign for each of them. Heck even the ancient Dune 2 had a campaign for each house.Why is this an issue you may wonder. Well, while the marine campaign is indeed nice, I would have loved to play an ork campaign or a chaos camapin... you get what I'm saying? They've created a lovely universe with nicely done inhabitants but yet they confine you to just one.. I hear the expansions add more campaigns but those are extra which makes me wonder. ... Why? I mean I know Other games did this as well but again they gave you a solid offering for all factions before tacking on the extras.So while I can recommend, this game is rather low on my 'must buy' list because of that.Graphically it's pretty nice for it's time, quite nice, gameplay and strategy has a tendency to be a little linear. The squad idea is a nice aesthetic but really doesn't amount to much, gameplay wise. . FOr what I played during the free weekend fun but ... meh... not teh sort of RTS I would genuinely come back to again. It's just too generic in story and too linear in gameplay.			"

												What can I say, accept that this game is awesome!  40k is best served as an RTS, even though I think they are heading towards a MOBA style after Dawn of War II gameplay style and Renicide.....at least as rumor has it :PJust going to jump right into it:PROSYou can make your owqn factionOk graphicsGreat MusicCan be used on lower-end computers (I have a higher end and a lower end)With friends to play with = Amazing! ...even vs AI compsPrice is great for all the fun possibleCONSCan't change Population max without a MODCommunity Online is quite dead (Also a few private with pass rq games)Units when under crtl+# do not act as intelligent as they could when staying together.MISCDoes not follow Warhammer Table-top 100% in damage distribution and armor, but close enoughAll-in-all a great all around game.  Even though it does not follow the rules of the real codex and mechanical understandings of weapons to armor, it does a great job all the same.  So if you love RTS this one is a bit different, but still an RTS to add to your collection.  If you love Warhammer Space Marine 40,000 then probably don't have to suggest this to you because you probably already own this... Basically a must buy to add to your Steam collection, even if just for solo skirmish mode.  You can also use this game to help you understand how the online 40k applies damage to certain armors and special abilities; which are somewhat different than table top, but seem to be reoccurring throughout 40k online games.Sirspoony's rating = 8.25/10    8.75 to 9/10 if community was not so dead			"

Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't.

Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations.

Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?			"

												Traditional RTS with a few unique differences that make it fun:* Squads of units are trained and controlled as one, rather than individual units.* Individual Hero units can be attached to squads.* Dead squad members can be replaced through reinforcement.* Squad weapons, armor, and abilities can be upgraded individually.* Cover system protects units when they are in ditches, craters, etc.* Point Control system forces players to fight for map control early on.

												This is one of my all time favorite games.  Having played the table top version for years, I was famliar with the world.  My hours of play are not accurate as I had previously bought the cd version of this and the follow up games.If you can, there are a ton of mod sites that allow you to paint your army or input other units.

												Significantly enjoyed this game; considering buying it after the free trial.Pros: - Logical, linear game flow; - Well-designed mission objectives (almost entirely bug-free); - Excellent graphics - really gives the feel of being a computerised tabletop;Cons: - Unit management is painful, although understandably so; - Sometimes, NPCs' actions lead one to wish to bang their thick skulls together.Overall, a nice, solid game. Would recommend.			"

												(Reviews of mine posted on the expansions are the exact same as this one)Enjoy playing a game that stands tall and proud even now. Enjoy playing a game that has virtually no balance problems. Enjoy playing a game with 9 different races that somehow all play the same, something that Starcraft 2 Heart of The Swarm currently is beginning to fail at.Enjoy playing a game where each race has a super weapon that is literally a giant unit from a giant tank, to a large, fat pyramid-ish cube with a giant laser beam, or even a big pig...thing with lasers on it's head, bigger than the swimming pool you went to last month.Trust me... these Super Weapons put Command and Conquer's Super Weapons at the kiddie table, they make them look like pea shooters almost. Oh... what's that? One is an energy field that makes all tanks and vehicles invulnerable for a short time? One of them is an ion blast fired from a sattelite in space or something? One of them is a nuke?Only the Nuke super weapon stands up to any of these.The game works off of unlimited resources known as Requisition and Power. Power, you make generators to make, and Requisition is gained from taking and holding points throughout a map. Both can be upgraded in a different way to produce more resources faster.Anyonewho is a fan of strategy games who has NOT played this one is just simply missing out.This game is the closest anyone will ever get to a seemingly perfect game in it's own rights, and to add to it, it's got wonderful voiceacting, awesome soundtracks and rather impressive visuals for it's time, all of which stands just aswell today.Hardcore RTS fans can agree that if you are a HUGE fan of the Real-Time Strategy Game, you owe it to yourself to try this.The game has 3 expansions, the first one adds The Imperial Gaurd, the second adds the Tau and Necrons, and the thirds adds the Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar.All 3 add onto the game and simply make it one of the best if not the best RTS in existence so far.Also only Soulstorm has much of an actual multiplayer, because people only play it, so if multiplayer is what you're looking for... well try out the skirmish mode, and if you like this, get the 3 expansions and join us in the crusade to kill eachother!This game is easily an 8/10, it's simply gaming bliss.

												A great introduction to the Warhammer 40k universe. If you're like me you stumbled upon this by friends that either played the tabletop game, were into the lore or played this. As an RTS it is quite an entertaining one to play as you have your campagin of course which is really good as you play as a Space Marine chapter known as the Blood Ravens. It's even got a decent story to go with it since it takes place on a slowly chaotic planet filled with Orks, Eldar and Chaos Space Marines. I sort of wished the campaign was a little more varied in how you only play as Space Marines but it's still a rather competent campaign at that.The game has lots of units to play as and often the game is territorial based meaning that you you have to keep moving and taking over relics and strategic points to get the resources you need to win the battle. It's a pretty good incentive instead of the usual building a huge army and steamrolling everything (not that steamrolling is fun but) it's refreshing to see a change in the RTS formula. When you're done with your campaign you have your skirmish modes where you play  against the AI with four factions to choose from (Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar and Orks) and online mode where you play with friends and randoms which is quite nice and fun to play. Lastly you have your army painter which let's you customize your faction's armor and logo colour. It's cool but a little limited though not a lot of RTS games lets you do that.Good campaign, fun skirmishes and online play makes Dawn of War a worthy RTS to have in your collection. It's over 10 years old and as a recent newbie to the series it is still rather fun to pick up and play. I give it an 8/10.			"

												This game asks an eternal question which all of us must ponder at some stage in our all too brief lives.

												The ""Action RTS"" genre got defined by THIS GAME. Hell you have so much fun just watching your units walking around, because they look badass. The gunfights are eyecandys and the graphics can easy face any 2013 RTS game. The campaign was a joy to play, finished it like 3 times in total now. Too bad the multiplayer is dead. Still I can recommend this to every Warhammer and to every RTS fan without any doubts. And for the current price its actually a steal anyway, especially when u grab it up in a sale.			"

I'm not shy about going on forums and searching for and implimenting fixes but the sound issues, like low-volume, static, or missing sounds pop up every other session. Gimme a break! Playing on an office commercial Dell with Win 7 but the box is over ten years younger than the game; one of the reasons i chose to install it here. It shouldn't be this much of a problem.			"

												I remember this to be great RTS that combines base building and capturing control points like the old classic Z. But neither this nor Winter Assault is recomended due to one fact - they both lack widescreen support, so one will be playing either streched or blackbarred version, or will be using some community workarounds, which have their own problems. Skip GOTY and Winter Assault and go for Soulstorm or Dark Crusade, both of which support widescreen natively.			"

												Love love love this series, better than DOW 2, didn'trealy like that they went in such a different direction. DOW 2 is ok, just not the ""real thang"". Can't wait to get ahold of Armageddon which seems to have went back to the true form of WHammer. But I dgress. Aside from them NOT having trading cards or achievements *which I still don't understand considering the game is still so popular and such a classic, every TBS or RTs fan should havei their library, all 4 of the DOW 1 games are great and brings back fond memories, not to mention allowing to to make some new ones!

												Couldn't get into it. Can't hold a candle to a RTS like Total annihilation.

												A good old-fashioned RTS set in the Warhammer 40k universe. Runs smoothly, easy to learn but hard to master, looks pretty good for an older game, engaging story mode and addicting co-op/ai mode. I wish more people were on the online multiplayer, but I'm happy popping on to play an hour-long game against a bunch of bots. My friend and I once had a 6-hour long game with us on a team against multiple teams of hard bots. Recommend for anybody who likes RTS games, but not for the whiney newer generation of gamers who think anything without triple-a cutting edge graphics is bad.			"

												At this point, I could honestly only suggest this game to hardcore RTS fans, specifically those who are into WarCraft 3 but could expand into some new lore and mechanics. It's just aged a great deal. It looks and feels bad. The soundtrack seems on par with the sequels though, and there seems to be plenty of story in the campaign, and a neat territorial conquest theme to the campaign that the DoW2 series did not have.Now, I'm typically not a fan of true RTS games, which might be why I feel like Dawn of War 2 was a vastly superior set of games in ALL ways, but I can understand that the first Dawn of War series of content here can hold some people's attention. They're definitely more focused on more multitasking and bigger squadrons. That kind of stuff honestly just hurts my brain. I much prefer DoW2's 4-Hero Unit campaign structure, and it's Last Stand mode (though now largely unplayed).As far as multiplayer goes, I cannot comment, as I know my role there. I am no use to any team. That's probably where this first series shines, from what I hear.			"

												You know how some RTS games age really well? Dune 2, all the Warcraft games, etc? Well, this is not one of them. The game models don't have a lot of polys, and textures don't have a lot of pixels in them, sure, but this is not the problem. They also don't have any style or imagination. Gameplay is straightforward and boring, too: the same as in any other right-clicking RTS game you played before. And the story... WH40k universe offers a lot of real, gritty gothic stories of unimaginable horrors and deep space nightmares. This is definetly not one of them though.If you think that this game has any value other than nostalgic, think again. And don't buy it.			"

												I LOVE THIS GAME. Just wanted to make that perfectly clear before carrying on. I would love to play it again... I sunk a ridiculous number of hours into this game when it first came out, which was back in the days that current resolutions were nothing more than theory. The game now is practically unplayable on high end machines simply because it hasn't been patched to do so. Which is a real shame... DoW2 works fine on modern kit, but it's not the same game, more a 'Here's some men, go kill ♥♥♥♥' and very little RTS. Until Relic put out a patch to fix it, I do not recommend it unless you're on a 10 year old machine.			"

												If there was a neutral vote id put thatbut it does tip towards the no. One reason being when i first saw this i was like HOLY ♥♥♥♥ ITS A WARHAMMER VID GAME OFC ITS GOIN TO BE GREAT!!!Then i started to play and dont get me wrong very nice for its time but it lacks the warhammer feel.... the feeling of controlling thousands of troops at once, the feeling of aww man 50 of my guys died but thats alright i got 500 more to throw into the fray that kinda feel if u ever look at the artwork for battles in the codexes and books it depicts humongous batttles where thousans (im sorry i ment MILLIONS) of troops are thrown at eachother while this when i was getting to the mid campaign where the orcs supposedly are infesting the cities flooding in in the thousands where as the actual level i only got to kill 100-150 orcs max eachtime this is a great game dont get me wrong but it lacks the mass troops and the base building is just horrible. no room to build no freedom as to where i want my barracks to be or my turret to be dead smack in the middle of me base incase of sky boyz and stuff I know warhammer battlemarch came out way WAY later then this but if they were goin to setup a campaign why not like that where you get 20 squads to work with in the beginning (maybe alittle more since ya kno BIG BATTLES NED MUST HAZ) then have a battle deployment i mean they couldve done so much more with this but they chose not to and went with base building i mean come on where in the history of the tabletop game did base building matter you simply had a equal force as your enemy and the roll of the dice along with your strategy to win you the day not resources or higher tech level it simply didnt matter so why should it have mattered now.And dawn of war 2 was a complete waste of the title its simply 4 squads every level where as they took out the need for a base (which was nice) but took away EVEN MORE troops so it felt so empty like there was this perfectly good battle field with no able bodies to fill it inch by inch.Now if your a warhammer fan and have played the tabletop games and other things warhammer i suggest this to you but if your the lore fan who thought of warhammer 40k as a age of mass DA MEN EVERYWHERE then dont get this its a waste they couldve done so much more but they chose to go down a route that wasnt ever their stle when deving thids game			"

												Wasted 30minutes of my life trying to pass main menu... first it doesn't support 1080p, you can only set a max res of 900p and not even that.. the game will CRASH! After I finally was able to set a stable res of 720p decided to boost the overall graphcis as everything was on low, I put all on high and right after that BAM CRASH! SHOCKER! After that was crash after crash couldn't even get into main menu.♥♥♥♥ing game won't work!!! if you ever get it in a bundle, you better off trading it for 1 card even... dawn of war 1 is broken, waste of my time and  money.

												It's very old, and it shows horribly in both graphics and gameplay.First annoyance: Whenever you boot it up it goes to the Steam overlay, prompting you to CREATE YOUR RELIC ACCOUNT. Yeah, nope, attrocious. Give it a rest already.While the campaign is entertaining in a B-movie way and the small animations of your Terminators crushing enemies are both brutal and fun to watch, your troops start messing up as soon as you have more than 10 of them; clustering together in tight spots, stopping on their way to attack-move somewhere so you need to issue another order to get them going, and having the map central on units immediately when selecting them forcing you to go back to where the action is/was to order them where to attack (as opposed to Star Craft gameplay where centralizing on units only occurs if you double click the shortcut for the unit).Case in point: Your troops captures a relic point. You then select a servant to build a listening post, however the camera goes to that unit instead of just selecting it while still being over the listening point area you just captured, making you have to click on the map where that point was and then clicking on the place you want to build again - every damn time you want to build something. It's really jarring and halts your progression and flow in a very tedious, frustrating manner.I'm sure this was decent for its time, but games have moved on since then and it's just too old and finicky to compete. Adding to that, it has no resolutions for 1920x1080 and the camera, even when zoomed all the way out, is way to close to your troops and ground to get what you'd consider a normal overview in RTS games.Only get it in a bundle as I did, or stay away, even on a sale.

												The game itself is a fun RTS, but the issues hold it back for me. I've tried it on multiple computers since I bought it a few years ago, and I can't get more than halfway through a mission without it crashing on me. A huge disappointment, since the little bit of time I've managed to play it was good. It doesn't have widescreen support built in (there's a fan-made patch to add it, but it's still not perfect), but I honestly enjoyed it enough (again, while it worked) not to mind black borders on the sides of my screen.Since so many other people have had it run fine for them, it's almost definitely something about the computers I've tried playing it on. Don't spend a cent on it unless you know for certain it works on your computer (try the demo first!).I only have half an hour listed because I only added it to Steam hoping they had fixed the issues in the newest patches. It's still crashing as often as it did when I installed it from my boxed copy.			"

												I know shouldn't let the Campaign overly influence my opinion on this game, but man I found this boring. It hasn't aged very well at all. I can forgive the poor draw distance, and the chunky graphics, as technology moves on long after games have been made.Yet... the story was pretty boring and by the book, which is a shame when you consider the huge amount of lore you can draw from the Warhammer Universe. Like other RTS before and after it, Dawn of War suffers from the ease in which you can build up a super army and just blitz your way through the map. There are some nice animations and kill sequences within the game, which is a nice little touch.I'll give this game another go somewhere down the line and play Skirmmish/Multiplayer against other people, which I think will be a fairer reflection on what it has to offer.I do like the idea of the Army Painter tool to create unique paint designs.

												While I did play this game from start to finish, I would not recrommend it when compared to much better games of the same genre. Had I bought this game when it first came out as opposed to a steam sale several years after it's release I would probably say this game is great. Starcraft is a much better game in comparison. I am mostly writing this review to say not to buy Warhammer 40,000 because it is like any other strategy game on the market. I think consumers would be happier buying Warhammer 40,000 (2) as the gameplay is less repetative and more exciting sicne your squad mates use cover and throw grenades to take over vital positions (kind of like Company of Heroes mixed with Starcraft). I would have been fine skipping on the first 3 Warhammer 40,000 games and just owning Retribution 2 with all of its expansions.  I own all the Warhammer 40,000 Franchise games and that is my honest opinion.			"

												Arnold Ray ""Bake"" McBride (born February 3, 1949 in Fulton, Missouri), also nicknamed ""Shake n' Bake"" and ""The Callaway Kid"", is a former Major League Baseball outfielder, known primarily as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies' teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Selected in the 37th round in 1970 as the 811th player,[1] he made his major league debut for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1974, finishing the season with 173 base hits, 30 stolen bases, and a .309 batting average, and was named the National League's Rookie of the Year, the first Cardinal to earn the award since Bill Virdon in 1955. On June 15, 1977, McBride was traded, with Steve Waterbury, by the St. Louis Cardinals to the Phillies for Tom Underwood, Dane Iorg, and Rick Bosetti.On February 16, 1982, McBride was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Sid Monge. On November 7, 1983, he was granted free agency, but chose to retire from baseball.			"

												Altough I do not play the table top game, but i find that this game is the best way of starting to get into the MASSIVE world of Warhammer, as it goes without saying that it is a considerable amount cheaper and more enclusive. A squad of Night Lord chaos Space Marines at full strenght and an Aspiring Champion cost about 565 points in game, which are free. The same squad would cost about £50 (I've looked at a start up pack which is around 15 figures) for much the same. That unit then takes hours to make and paint, and then will end up on a shelf until you buy about 3 more units, a Land Speeder and a Librarian, at which point you have to drive to the shop (Because those units wont fit on a bike) and play some annoying nerd who keeps telling you your doing it wrong, or that you don't know enough about Konrad Curze's former life in a hive city and his subsiquent fall to the forces of chaos to play as the Night Lords. On the other hand, in game you can play agaisnt a well balanced A.I of adiquate difficulty which CANT TALK, and along side countless other sqauds and even other leigons in 2v2v2v2 skirmish matches of annihaliton or economic based battles in a bid to control the battlefield. You do the math. £6.99 or £609.99. I've even bought the £99.99 expansion package. Still worth it.			"

Positives* It is a better than average game. Buy on sale, not at full price.* As an RTS fan I can say that this game has an interesting take on the subject and is fun; that being said I've never played multiplayer, so my review is based on single player only. * The single player campaign I felt was decent, not the best. I feel that the missions took too long in order to properly enjoy the story.Negatives* Single player campaign missions took too long in most cases, and made it difficult to become fully engaged into the story. Thus the story became not enjoyable.* The characters didn't grab my attention as much compared to the Dawn of War 2. The story was simple, with obvious twists; and didn't teach enough about the Warhammer Universe or history to really get me into that world. That being said I did enjoy Gabriel Angelos, but he wasn't in the expansions!* By comparison, I'd rather spend an hour listening to a documentary about the imperium of man, and the empire, than spending an hour on a single mission.* No steam achievements.ResultDoW 1 and DLC = 6/10.If you must play this game, buy it on sale and not at full price. I also highly recommend Dawn of War 2 instead; although base building is removed, I feel it is the superior game for its story.Additional NoteSeems people don't like my review, please inform me why in the comments, thank you.

												Campaign is too short. Not challenging enough until you do Insane mode. Same strategy applies across every mission: rush Infiltrator squads to SPs, build Listening Post + a hundred turrets around each LP. Spawn Land Raiders and end game quickly. Skirmish is awesome though, 8 player battles are epic. Winter Assault and Dark Crusade are excellent expansions. Soulstorm is passable. The best part is how the game managed to capture the lore and environment of the 40k universe.

												Yep. It's old, but it's one of the most defining RTS during its time.Quick recommendation: If you want the 100% Dawn of War 1 experience, get Dawn of War: Soulstorm + Ultimate Apocalypse mod, instead. But if you want to really introduce yourself slowly to the Warhammer 40000 universe without clotting your head with too many stuff at once, play this one first.I used to own all of the DoW games once, pirated. Being used to Warcraft and Starcraft as pioneer RTSes, I thought, ya why not. Another space-sci-fi RTS. Recently I bought all DoW titles on Steam, just to remind and appreciate how Dawn of War introduces me to an uber-awesome sci-fi universe which is WARHAMMER 40000.This game opened doors for me. It introduces me to the dark, grim and hopeless Warhammer 40000 franchise. From there I get to know that GW miniatures are a thing, and am hooked to collecting and painting the minis now. And Warcraft and Starcraft actually are inspired by the Warhammer and Warhammer 40000 franchises, respectively.Back to the game, this is one of those innovative RTSes where you can control an entire 'unit' (or squad) of up to 9-10 soldiers instead of training them one-by-one a la War/Starcraft. This allows bigger battles with more units on screen. Other innovative things are all units can engage in either ranged or melee combat. Why melee in a sci-fi universe, you ask? Well melee is a big feature in the Warhammer 40000 universe, where combats tend to get up close and personal.So within those melee combat, they will sometimes have 'sync kills' where some of your/enemy's troops will execute a brutal melee kill animation that's really fun to watch. Other innovative things in this RTS is certain bigger units like walkers and monsters will be able to mow down and toss smaller troops around, and this really brings the battlefield alive.Am really excited Dawn of War III, the third installment of this franchise that is coming soon. And if you really are interested in delving into the universe without purchasing the overpriced models, codexes and books, this game is a must play to get you the general feeling and atmosphere of the Warhammer 40000 universe/franchise. It is a very good entry point to the overly complex universe.			"

												This is the game that really got me back into RTS after years of docile activity. It has laughable graphics, but the story and characters just feel and look really cool. The building system is very much like Company of Heroes or Starcraft, but seem to be simplified in a way that players can pick it up easy and still feel like they're getting a challenge without the frustrating factor of ""how do i do ____."" In some ways, I view this game as superior to Dawn of War 2, but I'd still recommend buying both. Another important thing to note is that you don't have to know anything about the Warhammer series to enjoy this game. I came in knowing little more than it was about space marines or something. The story gives a good backstory and explanation for the universe, inviting players from all background rather than shunning those who do not follow the series. I don't really have a complaint except that maybe an updated HD version should be made (Though I don't really care much since, as old as it looked, I still liked how it did present itself).Gameplay: 10/10Story: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Characters: 9/10Replayability: 10/10			"

												This was the game that got me into the Warhammer 40k Universe. The gameplay is fantastic for an RTS, you have only two types of resources, requisition and power so you have to go out and capture requisition points and defend them to maintain a source of requisition, this keeps you in constant conflict with the other factions as they need it as much as you.This kind of ""Need for war"", makes the game so action packed for a strategy game. There are only 4 factions, and each of them with different units and abilities. The campaign was great, both in story and battles, but it's a shame that they only made a campaign for the Space Marines.Overall, this is a great example of a Real Time Strategy game, one with an extensive lore behind it and innovative gameplay.

												I'm not a huge RTS fan (that is to say, I like 'em, but I suck at 'em, :-), but I really liked some of the things they did in this game to enhance tactical gameplay (as opposed to just  the 'BUILD ALL THE THINGS, KILL ALL THE THINGS!' approach used in  AoEII and other games. Units come in squads, you can resupply squads in the field, units shoot without you having to tell them to shoot, capture points, attaching heroes and healers to squads, upgrading. This all made it feel different and exciting and also very much like a Warhammer 40k game (Not a big 40k fan, but WH Fantasy fan, definitely).The story is ♥♥♥♥, the voice acting atrocious, but the gameplay makes up for that. I do have to say I only played the singleplayer campaign (I'm not really into skirmishes and definitely no MP). I liked the inclusion of an Army Painter option in the menu.Will definitely play some expansions and looking forward to DoW2.			"

												I picked this up cuz I was too cheap to buy StarCraft 2 and I use to play the table top version a few years ago and boy am I glad I did. This game is great the way it fits in cover and rough terrain like the table top verson is fantastic. The game is well balanced and the units are fun to play with. The way the game fits in all the details and tech from the 40k world is awesome. Scouting an Ork encampment and then raining down 4 drop pods filled with space marines is a hell of ah good time.

												Dawn of War remains the best-made RTS in the genre. The pace of the game gives you time to react to situations even if you don't have professional APM counts, letting even average players create strategies and battlefield tactics (unlike StarCraft, often). But the pace is still fast enough to be exciting and non-stop (unlike Kohan 2, often). The units are distinct enough to offer real advantages, in a rock-paper-scissors style of interaction. And the single-player game offers some great writing and tons of content. Love the whole series, including this original offering.			"

Even for a game that's kicking down the door on a decade worth of age, it still looks decent enough, and plays very well.Outside of that, the single player campaign provides an interesting backstory, though I honestly don't know enough about 40k lore to be able to pick up on whether everyone is canon, or if there's some weirdness involved.

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is in my opinion the best RTS game of all time, and it is just fantastic.Story:- I don't know that much of the Warhammer lore, but as far as I know, it follows it really well. If it doesn't, it still delivers a good and satisfying story!Gameplay:- The gameplay is where this game shines, with different races to play as on over 30 maps, this game never gets old. All races have the same basics, but late game it changes. I won't spoil anything of it, because I think everyone who is a fan of the genre or a fan of the Warhammer universe should play this. There are, as said above, over 30 maps to play on, and all of them are different in some way. Every map is challenging to master, and it adds brilliantly to the replay value and enjoyment.Graphics:- Graphics don't add anything to the overall enjoyment of the game in my opinion, and it doesn't do that here either. The graphics were great for their time, and though the textures definitely look dated, they do hold up over 12 years after its official release.Verdict:Dawn of War is the definitive RTS experience, and it is definitely worth the money, though if you're after graphics, you should probably go for Sins Of The Solar Empire. The game gets a 8/10 from me.- Denolact			"

												The biggest difference between this and other RTS is the damage output of the base defenses.  It creates a much slower, more attrition based game that requires strategy more than speed.   It is a very different from the blizzard model in that sense, which is why it appealed to me.  I recommend this RTS model to anyone who is fans  of wargames or boardgames as the slower pace appeals to those genres.don't let my time spent fool you.  I just registered my retail copy of this game.  I've been playing this since it came out.  If you need to know if I am a fan, just look and my dow2 hours.			"

												Dawn of War and all its expansions (excluding Soulstorm) are fantastic RTS games that helped redefine the genre. Experimenting with strategic ""requisition points"", full building animations and unit sync kills. This game was well ahead of its time.THis, the original game provides you a story campaign as teh BLood Ravens, a chapter of humanities Elite space marines.It also allows you to play as Space Marines, the Eldar, Chaos and Orks in multiplayer.Campaign is good, music/ voice acting is good, gameplay is good. If you don't mind the dated graphics, this is a surefire RTS game for your library.			"

												An Age of War is usually a fitting adage for any Warhammer 40,000 game, although Ages of War might be slightly more appropriate.I remember playing Dawn of War when it initially released and someone had a copy at a lan. That Intro. We all saw it and we were sold right there and then. This awesome new strategy game where you could zoom right into the action and see swords clash, blood spill and units being torn limb from limb.Over a decade later the game has clearly aged a bit in terms of graphics but even still they hold up reasonably well.The gameplay is a unique take on resource control and one that could have been utilised in a professional competitive environment in my opinion.All in all it's a great game that has stood the test of time. Multiplayer still has its charm and the single player campaign ensures some game time. The customisability of your units in game as well as your whole army's paint system adds an extra element to a strategy game that should have seen more action for the game it brings.			"

												I've been playing DoW for the past few years and I keep going back to it time and again. It's probably not the best RTS but it works brilliantly within the context of the WH40K universe and it is one of the most consistently fun games I've ever played. Just hearing the Orc scream of 'WAAAAGH' and the pious words of the Emperor's faithful Space Marines are enough to make this game one of my favourite 40K experiences. It's very different from the tabletop vesion but it still has a great deal to offer players, in terms of different races and the iconography of the rich 40K universe, and deserves to be seen as a game which has stood the 'Test of Time'.

												Want to play warhammer 40k without spending a mint on their minifigures? Then this is easily the next best thing. If you can get past the graphics then you will surely enjoy the game. It offers an unmatched level of realism, such as cover mechanics as well as the ability to decide what weapons certain units hold. I enjoyed this game, however I do not like the Dawn of war II game play. It claims to be an RTS but it limits your army, which isn't in the spirit of the genre. This game  is much better by a wide margin. There is one very evident downside to this game that I can think of. It was the price of the games, when I bought the games the costed around 15 to 20 dollars each which is way too much for a game of its age. thanlfully the price for now has droped to 12 dollars for the base game and the others shouldnt be much more making now a prime opportunity. Buy it while its cheap.			"

												Well well well, what do we have here? Another Relic RTS in my reviews? Fear not, viewer, as this one will be mostly positive.Now then, let's start things off, shall we? As far as the story goes.. well, I could care less about it. Go here, talk a bit, fight guys. Go there, talk a bit, fight guys. Go to another place, talk a bit, surprising revelation and/or plot twist, fight guys, emerge victorious. 1: The game (Like a lot of WH40k titles.) fails to realize that Space Marines are not the good guys. Nobody is. Except maybe the Eldar. 2: The voice acting is incredible. The story does have cutscenes.. but they are god awful. Let's just say I'd rather watch PS1 FMV than these ""cutscenes."" I will cut this game some slack, as it came out in the early 2000s, but some things, such as these cutscenes, are inexcusably terrible.I will point out that this game actually nails strategy right on the head. Each race is well balanced and has their own special perks, strategies and weaknesses.. unless you're playing as Orks. Just.. just don't play as Orks. (Please note that this is the GoTY edition, and not any of the DLCs where balance gets thrown out the window.) While on the subject, I will point out that the different units in this game are very impressive, sporting many different infantry and vehicles from Warhammer 40,000 lore. Still on gameplay, you will notice there are two major types of units you can build: The more combat-oriented ranged units and the frontline first-to-die melee units. Ranged units are generally preferable over the latter, but melee units can also disrupt ranged infantry and force them into melee combat - not exactly a ranged unit's strong suit. Melee units are also typically more durable than their ranged counterparts, as the Space Marine Dreadnoughts have armor so thick it's like trying to punch a hole through a cereal box using nothing but packing peanuts. Some infantry and vehicles can be equipped with weaponry to make them more effective against certain targets. Take the Predator for example. It is a sturdy battle tank with side-mounted heavy bolters and a small main cannon effective against infantry. By default, it is an infantry annihilator, but it can be upgraded to rock lascannons on every firing port it has, transforming it into a vehicle obliterator. Take note that  most weapons effective against infantry will not do much against vehicles, and vice versa. Refer to my cereal box and packing peanuts metaphor.The graphics are dated, but still acceptable nonetheless. This game came out in '04, so this is fine by me. Everything looks like how it should.The soundtrack is pretty nice, having good battle themes and whatnot. But it's mainly the voice acting I would like to cover in this section. As I said before, the voice acting in this game is surprisingly well done. I cannot get Gabriel Angelos's voice out of my head. Every race has their own 'attitude' towards seeing you as their commander - Space Marines and Eldar have somewhat British accents (I say somewhat because a lot of Space Marine units like Dreadnoughts and Assault Marines have American accents, while Scout Marines have British ones.) and respect you and would die for you as their leader, Chaos worship you as their lord and speak in an angry and sometimes panicked tone 24/7, and Orks constantly question your leadership and will often insult you when you simply select a unit; also, the way they butcher the English language is just... beautiful to witness. Props to Relic on the voice acting front!This game does have a fair amount of DLC, but it is quite affordable. Buying this game plus all of it's DLCs doesn't put it above 60 U.S. dollars, so the price is pretty good even with like two of the DLCs. One more thing about the DLCs I will mention in this review is that all of this game's DLCs are playable as standalone games. Yes, you heard me right. Granted, you will only have one or two races depending on which DLC you bought, but it is a really cool feature in my book.Dawn of War runs pretty smoothly on my PC, but watch it with the multiplayer connection; it can get laggy at times.The battles Dawn of War offers are great to spark and even greater to see. They aren't massive scale like Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, but they aren't overly tactical like this game's sequel. The map sizes fit these battles appropriately, and everything seems like a legitimate battlefield, minus the running for cover part.TL;DR: Dawn of War has it's flaws, but in general it is a solid RTS with great potential. I think the RTS genre is where the Warhammer 40,000 franchise would fit perfectly, and Relic has proven this. If you love strategy games or WH40k, go ahead and give this a shot.			"

												Dawn of War is an RTS or real time strategy, where you can play the campaign as Gabriel Angelos leading the Blood Angels 3rd company of space marines or engage in multiplayer fight or skirmishes against computer controlled enemies. You can chose from a large number of different factions if you have all of the expansions (you would need to launch soulstorm to use all of the expansions content regarding factions in multiplayer).

												This is the one that started it all. Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, Soulstorm, it all started here. Even the original Company of Heroes, which was not just better than it's buggy, DLC-bait sequel, but a near-perfect example of an RTS game, was a direct evolution of Dawn of War.All 4 races are actually pretty well-balanced in multiplayer (better-balanced than the source material is nowdays!). The campaign story is great, and fits the Warhammer 40,000 lore perfectly, which makes it a good introduction, if a bit predictable for the already-initiated (if you went in knowing the lore, you knew X was manipulating Y against Z long before the main characters had a clue Z was involved).This came out right when I first started getting into the actual 40k tabletop game, and the original Rome: Total War followed soon after. My 10th-grade GPA could've been a full point higher, but on top of learning 40k and painting my first army, autumn of 2004 was an RTS golden age we will probably never see the like of again.Except here. Why are you still reading these? Go fight for the Emperor and learn to yell ""SINDRI!.""			"

												Fun RTS. The squad system with units is interesting how you can equip special weapons. The campaign was excellent with an interesting story and map design, music is fitting to the levels. Good tech tree progression.Didn't outstay its welcome, lasted a fine amount.One mission is bugged, I had the same issue with CD and DVD copies of the game, where you must use arty to kill a base to make your own base, you end up having to kill the base with some jetpack units which is kinda a hassle and you could screw up loosing then and have to restart the level, This is at the beginning of the level so it isn't a hassle if you restart but still.Difficulty wise, very easy. You set up defence in the campaign with 2 - 4 squads starting out then you slowly take over the points and then fortify the points then you steam roll enemy base.Overall, I will give it 7/10 an enjoyable RTS and worth your time. The W40k lore is interesting and kept me going playing the game, I wanted to learn what would happen next.More of a unit based RTS with basebuilding included but not the main point of the game.			"

												The quintessential 40k game. When I think of the will of the Emperor destroying Zenos filth, this is the game that comes to mind. Somehow, even how repetitive the game's campaign is, it is one nearly unlimited fun for any fan of the RTS genre, or 40k in general.There have been copies, and sequels, but nothing has captured the magic of the original.

												A decent tabletop to video game conversion. Age of Empires II attempted to use in-game dialogue to simulate real time discussions and events between people in RTS games, but Dawn of War manages to make it even more believeable with the closer camera and the more dynamic movements of the models. The story is riveting, suspensful and startling towards the end. Anyone who enjoys a futuristic crusade and a struggle between good and evil should certainly follow this chronicle. The add-on system of weapons, unit commanders and special attacks enhance the game play in a variety of ways. A menagerie of units is available to not only the Imperium, but the Orks and the Forces of Choas. The map design is very good and the structures are both impressive and fearsome sights. The voice over work is very theatrical and the cut scenes strongly resemble stage set pieces at times. The up close battles are especially well done. Swords, axes and electronic melee weapons all combine to spectacular effect. Dawn of War serves as proof that visualizing a table top game and taking time to develop solid game mechanics and credible army units can pay off.			"

												The Gold Edition of Dawn of War was one of the first M-rated games I bought as a teenager, and I always had fond memories of it because it catered to my personal favorite combat strategy: turtling. Nine years later, those feelings are still going strong.For the uninitiated, turtling is the notion of erecting a stiff defensive perimeter, absorbing enemy attacks while establishing one's own economy, then lashing out with the full fury of one's tech tree and crushing the enemy in a swift show of force. Dawn of War's most effective strategy is what I like to call ""Turbo Turtle"" because of its resource mechanics. Unlike most games which require players to harvest resources from the game world in something of a parallel operation to the military stuff, the two mix together in the form of requisition, gained automatically from capturing various points around the map. This system keeps the game moving because no resource infrastructure is required to build infantry units. Just take a squad or two, capture some points, and you're off and rolling. These points can even have fortifications built on them, keepinig enemies at bay long enough for a force away from the flashpoint to react and engage and allowing the player to hold large swathes of territory (and resources) without desperately trying to get every detail just so to prevent exploits in the defense. (The other resource, power, is produced entirely within the tech tree with bonus areas available on most maps, meaning any shortage is usually self-created.) This keeps the game moving at a reasonable pace and prevents players from turtling for 20-30 minutes while advancing to the next tech level like one might in other RTS titles. This simplified approach keeps the focus on combat and battle tactics rather than letting resource gathering linger in the back of the player's mind.The game also doesn't have players building infantry units piecemeal; instead, infantry come in squads which can be expanded and outfitted with heavy weaponry. The Space Marines - the sole faction the player uses in the campaign - have such powerful infantry that most early missions and even skirmish games can be won with 4-5 decked out squads of their mainline infantry, and the squad as the base unit can result in infantry combat on a massive scale at the climax of a battle. Five full squads of Space Marines puts 45 units under the player's control; mainline infantry for the other races churns out even more individuals, and it's all commanded at the squad level, so, again, no micromanagement.The visuals were quite good for the time, although they haven't held up very well in the nine years since the game's original release. The upside to this is a lack of lag or chug on most modern PCs, even when the battles reach their most frenzied. There are fewer positives to be found with the story (quite dull and rather predictable) and the sound design (the voice acting is downright painful at times), but playing an RTS for the story is like eating a cheeseburger for the pickles; it's nice to have the extra flavor, but it's not really why you bought the burger.Relic hit a home run with this game. Not only did they capture the essence of Warhammer 40,000 and its lore, they also made it something players new to 40k will be interested in and enjoy without getting bogged down in trying to bring 40k's rules to a video game, something other GW-inspired titles (read: Blood Bowl) could stand to learn from. Fun is the most important element of any game, and Dawn of War provides plenty of it. For the Emprah!			"

												I bought this game to unlock the 4 original races in the Dark Crusade Multiplayer because on the game's page it says that the games work together but no matter what I've tried the 4 DOW races are still locked. What's worse is that the playerbase is all on Dark Crusade so even though I have the ability to play SM/Chaos/Ork/Eldar on this game's multiplayer there is nobody to play against. I'd much rather find a fix but I've tried everything (some people let me know that it only should work after you've opened the game and played a skirmish match, and the ""race unlocker"" online requires 2 keys and Dark Crusade doesn't produce its key). If you think this game is worth it for the singleplayer alone go ahead and purchase it but I will be getting a refund.			"

												I have never really bothered to play a Warhammer game, or even the board game. But after playing Dawn of War I can safely say that Warhammer has been cemented in my memory as an excellent rts with excellent lore behind it.You begin as a commander of the forces of the Imperium of Man finds himself outnumbered by orks, a race of green humanoids hell-bent on conquering everything. The storyline, although short, is one of the most interesting I've seen in an RTS, and it is easy to follow, even if you know nothing about the Warhammer lore. It evolves into a decent ending, with elements for a sequel clearly present.This game, as an RTS, is brilliantly executed. Rather than buying a single unit, you buy a squad of units, each with its own health bar, which you can reinforce, upgrade weapons, and beef up to take on the challenges that lie ahead. This applies only to infantry, however, as vehicles are a single unit, with their own strengths and weaknesses. The variety of tools available to you ensures that no matter the task, You will have everything needed at your disposal. In addition, workers do not gather resources, rather capturing strategic points generates them, which takes an element of micomanagement away from the game, making it more acessible. Your squads tend to have good lasting power, and remain useful even very late into the game. Just as well, as they tend to be pretty expensive. Also, they have a morale system; when things are going good, morale stays high and your units fight normally. Face them against a flamethrower or other psycologically devastating weapon, and the squad will break, severely reducing its effectiveness. this is a great feature, and as far as I can tell one unique to the warhammer franchise.All in all, I strongly recommend this game. The campagn is rather short, however you'll find yourself having had too much fun to really care, and the multiplayer is an excellent addition. "

												Dawn of War is a mix of macro and micro management RTS. It follows the classic formula of tiered units and buildings.If you haven't played any of the Dawn of War 1 series, I recommend skipping to the end and playing 3rd expansion, Dawn of War Soulstorm.  They've added several more playable races, but has abandoned the long linear story campaign for a conquest map.While the conquest map does have a tiny bit of story as you capture major enemy faction cities or key military locations, it pales in story structure in comparison of the first two games, Dawn of War and Winter Assault.

												Ok guys this is going to be a long one. Bottom line if you've played warhammer 40k you already know this universe is insane. Secondly each dawn of wars campaigns don't shirk on difficulty to the point where from the word go you have to be moving. If you're wanting a game that will pamper you stop right now. This game is easy to learn and hard to master. There is an obvious lack of space combat but I can forgive that because of how massive the table top is.Pros:+ great openers+ Squad reinforcement options give a smaller force a much more intimidating presence.+ good balance appropriate for the races. Spacemarines are tough and versitile for instance.+ Army cusotmization for skirmish games really gives a nice feel+ focusing on whether to expand or turtle up gives a variety of options.+ Punishing gameplay when mistakes are made. I've gone from crushing a chaos army to losing a skirmish fight because I elected to rebuild my forces.+ Doesn't require a lot to work flawlessly on max settings.+ AI skirmishes feel challenging on higher difficulties, forcing you to get better as a player.+ Multiplayer versus AI or PVP can be fun and nothing is more satisfying than watching armies duke it out especially those opening shots.+ Artillery+ Resource management+ place turrets anywhereCons:This is the internet now I need to list the cons. Most are just adding to the fun of the game.Serious con:squad and vehicle cap are 20. That's 10 space marine squads (upwards of about 80-90 space marines) 2 tanks, an ultimate vehicle, an artillery piece and two light attack vehicles. Not a lot given some of the map sizes.-AI difficulty ramping is BS. Easy AI doesn't attack you enough and standard rushes you right off the bat and can base wipe you early. Standard can even snowball the entire game. Still need to work to hard ai.- Timed missions suck because they rush you and no one likes rushing. Besides ling rushes.- its easier to ask a river to change course than stop an Ork Waaaagh! You don't know what fear is until you have 120 orks on your doorstep screaming Waaaaagh!-Needing relics sucks as they're crucial to bringing out your ultimates.-holding critical locations and strategic points sucks because its harder to hold them than taking them.- pathing--Tank pathing. That moment where you accidently box in your land raider. ""Oops...""- nearly impossible to turtle up realistically due to turret ineffective without crossing fields of fire.- Stalemates Suck. Nothing is more nerve racking than not seeing your enemy for twenty minutes.- artilleryOverall My wallet may scream bloody murder at me but no regrets. Buy this game and burn the heretics and let the grenades fly.			"

												This is the one that started it all. Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, Soulstorm, it all started here. Even the original Company of Heroes, which was not just better than it's buggy, DLC-bait sequel, but a near-perfect example of an RTS game, was a direct evolution of Dawn of War.All 4 races are actually pretty well-balanced in multiplayer (better-balanced than the source material is nowdays!). The campaign story is great, and fits the Warhammer 40,000 lore perfectly, which makes it a good introduction, if a bit predictable for the already-initiated (if you went in knowing the lore, you knew X was manipulating Y against Z long before the main characters had a clue Z was involved).This came out right when I first started getting into the actual 40k tabletop game, and the original Rome: Total War followed soon after. My 10th-grade GPA could've been a full point higher, but on top of learning 40k and painting my first army, autumn of 2004 was an RTS golden age we will probably never see the like of again.Except here. Why are you still reading these? Go fight for the Emperor and learn to yell ""SINDRI!.""			"

												Fun RTS. The squad system with units is interesting how you can equip special weapons. The campaign was excellent with an interesting story and map design, music is fitting to the levels. Good tech tree progression.Didn't outstay its welcome, lasted a fine amount.One mission is bugged, I had the same issue with CD and DVD copies of the game, where you must use arty to kill a base to make your own base, you end up having to kill the base with some jetpack units which is kinda a hassle and you could screw up loosing then and have to restart the level, This is at the beginning of the level so it isn't a hassle if you restart but still.Difficulty wise, very easy. You set up defence in the campaign with 2 - 4 squads starting out then you slowly take over the points and then fortify the points then you steam roll enemy base.Overall, I will give it 7/10 an enjoyable RTS and worth your time. The W40k lore is interesting and kept me going playing the game, I wanted to learn what would happen next.More of a unit based RTS with basebuilding included but not the main point of the game.			"

												I bought this game on sale and started playing it for nostalgia sake and I am glad I did, I played it when it first came out and remembered really enjoying it.  Now that I played it again I have to say it still stands the test of time.  Definitely one of my favorite RTS games.Heavy in resource management and base building, something I think was sorely missing from the second one. The graphics are dated and you have to download a patch in order to play it widescreen.

												The beta period for Dawn of War was one of my favorite gaming experiences ever. Believe it or not, there was a pretty long period of time where the general tone of gamers online wasn't overtly negative and troll-ish, and the whole beta was filled with fantastic players who were down to play this new and exciting entry into the RTS lexicon.That being said, Dawn of War has certainly aged strangely. Since it has been out for nearly twelve years at this point, its kind of a funky game. Video games have grown up and changed a lot since this was new, but that doesn't really detract very much from the overall experience. Widescreen doesn't really work and isn't worth trying to get to work, as a sidenote.The core gameplay is based more around controlling squads of units than building a base. There are still resource nodes to grab on the map, and you still need to be mindful of the tech tree and working towards better units, but most of the game is army and unit based. Each of the races in the game sort of play similarly, with similar ideas, although some asymmetrical aspects are present. The core design is still fun years later, and games versus the AI can be hectic. If you have a buddy who is down to do some 2vAI games, and you don't mind clunky early 2000's interfaces, you'll get some good mileage out of this. The campaign is totally forgettable and only features one race, though. Online seemed to be a ghost town when I tried it out, but that also might be a side effect of the confusing naming of the first Dawn of War game + expansions.You see, the GOTY edition doesn't contain everything, strangely enough. You're still missing the expansions. If you want the complete experience, you'll have to look elsewhere and get the Platinum edition. I got this through a bundle, so I'm not too miffed, but the naming is confusing.Overall, this was a good bit of time for some nostalgia. I had a blast playing a couple of maps and doing most of the campaign, but there isn't much staying power here if you're not a returning player. You might find the design a bit flawed overall, and there are later Dawn of War games that improved on the formula this game established.			"

												I'm not a big fan of strategy games, but I was always curious about the Warhammer 40k lore and boy I got really suprised by this game! While this version is pretty much standard compared with the expansions, this game is a really great start to beginners to either the lore or the games. However, this game has also some problems that maybe were fixed in the later games. I loved playing as a Space Marine, Chaos Space Marine and Orks. What about the Eldar? I hate them.- Great animations for every character. EVERY. CHARACTER. Even the fights are fantastic.- Pretty nice story in the main campaign.- Interesting and nice camera angles during the game.- Just 3 main races makes the game a little bit short, knowing the full lore of the franchise.- Some bugs like for example: Soldiers not moving and getting stuck in places and after a while they move.- Some of the vehicles that can transport can only take one squad, which is not really helpful in my own opinion...And to finish this review: I really hate the eldar in this game.

												The Gold Edition of Dawn of War was one of the first M-rated games I bought as a teenager, and I always had fond memories of it because it catered to my personal favorite combat strategy: turtling. Nine years later, those feelings are still going strong.For the uninitiated, turtling is the notion of erecting a stiff defensive perimeter, absorbing enemy attacks while establishing one's own economy, then lashing out with the full fury of one's tech tree and crushing the enemy in a swift show of force. Dawn of War's most effective strategy is what I like to call ""Turbo Turtle"" because of its resource mechanics. Unlike most games which require players to harvest resources from the game world in something of a parallel operation to the military stuff, the two mix together in the form of requisition, gained automatically from capturing various points around the map. This system keeps the game moving because no resource infrastructure is required to build infantry units. Just take a squad or two, capture some points, and you're off and rolling. These points can even have fortifications built on them, keepinig enemies at bay long enough for a force away from the flashpoint to react and engage and allowing the player to hold large swathes of territory (and resources) without desperately trying to get every detail just so to prevent exploits in the defense. (The other resource, power, is produced entirely within the tech tree with bonus areas available on most maps, meaning any shortage is usually self-created.) This keeps the game moving at a reasonable pace and prevents players from turtling for 20-30 minutes while advancing to the next tech level like one might in other RTS titles. This simplified approach keeps the focus on combat and battle tactics rather than letting resource gathering linger in the back of the player's mind.The game also doesn't have players building infantry units piecemeal; instead, infantry come in squads which can be expanded and outfitted with heavy weaponry. The Space Marines - the sole faction the player uses in the campaign - have such powerful infantry that most early missions and even skirmish games can be won with 4-5 decked out squads of their mainline infantry, and the squad as the base unit can result in infantry combat on a massive scale at the climax of a battle. Five full squads of Space Marines puts 45 units under the player's control; mainline infantry for the other races churns out even more individuals, and it's all commanded at the squad level, so, again, no micromanagement.The visuals were quite good for the time, although they haven't held up very well in the nine years since the game's original release. The upside to this is a lack of lag or chug on most modern PCs, even when the battles reach their most frenzied. There are fewer positives to be found with the story (quite dull and rather predictable) and the sound design (the voice acting is downright painful at times), but playing an RTS for the story is like eating a cheeseburger for the pickles; it's nice to have the extra flavor, but it's not really why you bought the burger.Relic hit a home run with this game. Not only did they capture the essence of Warhammer 40,000 and its lore, they also made it something players new to 40k will be interested in and enjoy without getting bogged down in trying to bring 40k's rules to a video game, something other GW-inspired titles (read: Blood Bowl) could stand to learn from. Fun is the most important element of any game, and Dawn of War provides plenty of it. For the Emprah!			"

												After a couple of years I reinstalled the game via Steam. And still I find it very good even though the graphics cannot compete with todays standard. But the multiplayer is always good for intense battles. This game is not over complex it gives you easy access but at the same time it gets deep when it comes to upgrades and all the different units and peoples. Capture the flag to get resources makes the game dynamic. It definitely is a golden oldie and recommended for everyone who likes to play a strategic game. And the setting of the Warhammer universe is just great.			"

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ Bug-free+ Classic RTS Gameplay+ Clever use of flags+ This is our land now+ But do you have a flag?+ Great Multiplayer/matchmakingCons:- Game is a bit short; single-player campaign lasts roughly 20 hours- Only four playable races; later expansions add moreOverall: Warhammer 40k is a fantastic board game franchise, but it's very expensive.  This is a solid introduction to the world in a fun, entertaining package.  If you played this game in its heyday, you really don't need me to tell you it's great.  If you're new, then know that this game stands the test of time, and is still fun so many years later.  It nails the RTS genre, and still looks good.  It plays smoothly, and rewards clever gameplay and tactics.  The later expansions give more campaigns and more opportunities for multiplayer shenanigans, but this game started it all.Bottom Line: Worth playing and replaying, for old and new fans.  Familiarity with the Warhammer universe not required.			"

												10/10 would purge again. but this is a good game, campain was great, all 5 factions were involved, even if the imperial guard did not do much they put them in there and it did not feel forced at all. all factions progress different and i would not say any have a definent strength. for example all factions have good ranged,melee and vehicles even if some have more good ones in one category they are pretty much even.i think this is a good thing because you do not know what to expect, for example if one side had great melee infantary then you could use alot of anti-infantary stuff, so i think that that was great. i will not spoil the campaign but it was great my only complaint being i found a bug in the last mission where the boss was stuck on a squad dof tactical marines, it ment i had him in the same spot under my sight for most of the game until i got terminators and killed him.overall good game, army painter was fun and added some personality to the skirmish mode for me.

												Great, better than DOW 2 in my opinion; this has the classic base building and lore and was a masterpeice in its day. DOW2 is more a strategic RPG and lost a lot of the magic shown in its first installment. Still great even now; the character models still stand up well althought the terrain textures begin to look a little dated now.

												This game is a glorious beauty. When I first picked it up I had no idea what I was getting into, never having heard of WH40k outside of scant references in a few corners of the wider Geek/Nerd community. When I first picked it up and played the tutorial, I was a bit put off because I couldn't amass a large force of tanks (a la Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance). And why in the world was melee combat still a thing?? I ended up putting it down to play other games until, feeling bored and wanting to procrastinate on studying for finals, I decided to pick it up again, this time approaching the game with the understanding that it is largely infantry-based. I decided to embrace the melee combat as a unique element of the WH40k universe. I created my own army (which was surprisingly fun) and then went and did the campaign. As of writing this I have all but finished it, and I must say that this was surprisingly enjoyable. As someone who can intuitively predict the endings of most movies, I have to admit that during the first half or so of the game I was kept guessing about what would happen. Some of this is undoubtedly due to the fact that this is my first introduction to the WH40k universe (if you're familiar with the franchise you *might* guess what can/will happen next). It is probably one of the more enjoyable campaigns I've played now in awhile.As an infantry combat game, the infantry battles, upgrades, and mechanics are engrossing and satisfying. Base building does have restrictions (you can only build within a radius of the stronghold or strategic points) but it balances the game nicely and is enjoyable.Research is pretty interesting - you unlock new buildings and units by building new buildings and/or upgrading your stronghold/starter building. You can research upgrades for your units at specific buildings (eg, for the Space Marines at least, the armory will give you a research option which will increase the number of special weapons you can carry + gives you access to more weapons like rocket launchers). You can also upgrade you units in the field (eg, dreadnought can be upgraded with an assault cannon or twin laser cannon, predator can be upgraded with all manner of laser weapons, squads can be given a sergeant, etc.).Edit: There are a few bugs, mostly related to saving a game in the middle of playing a campaign mission, etc. These can be overlooked though, they are relatively minor (eg, missing voice queue/background music, etc.). The biggest bug that annoys me is that the game seems to forget to increase your infantry pop cap when you research the last upgrade. This can be worked with but it can be downright frustrating. Bug does not appear to affect the vehicle cap. This game is fun. Even if you're not into War Hammer 40,000, this game is still worth playing. Play it, lest you be accused of HERESY!!8/10 would procrastinate again.			"

												A solid RTS set in the grim world of Warhammer 40,000. Unit variety and constant revisions to one's strategy keep the game fresh, even for an older title. Its nice to still see stable multiplayer for this game, something which should now continue into the forseeable future. The story-driven campaign has excellent voice acting and intersting mission variety. Be wary that this game does have some trouble launching on some newer graphics cards, however this is easily fixable with some quick config file changes.

												This game is surely one of the best real-time strategies ever made. I never really been into WH40k, but this game made love this brutal, depressing universe.The campaign is really neat, as a leader of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter fighting through the planet of Tartarus which has quiet diverse maps, marshlands, cities, plains, mountains etc. The story is also enjoyable, it has some twists and good characters. The factions are really different, besides the Space Marines you get Orkz, Chaos Marines and the Eldar, but they're only available in multiplayer and skirmish.If you haven't tried DoW yet, now's the time, the gameplay is still fantastic and despite 11 years passed, the game still looks stunning.For the Emperor!

												Played this game as a teenager and this always struck me as the epitome of a rts (even more so than starcraft). Your armies are massive, all units feel strong and nothing is useless, and the story (being a 40k player for years) is exactly what i wanted. The only issue i had witg it personally are some of the races tech trees are really big. Love this game. Its for 40k and rts fans, do yourself a favor and pick this up. 8/10			"

 Overview  To me, Dawn of War is my favorite RTS games, ever. As much as I love this game, I still think it's a flawed masterpiece on its own. In this review, I'll be going over the story, gameplay, and my likes/dislikes with this game. This is a spoiler-free review, so nothing here will ruin your eperience with this AWESOME RTS! The Story, and Gameplay Dawn of War takes place in a war between the Space Marines, Orks, Imperial Guard, Eldar and Chaos Marines. The game plays pretty smooth, and is quite fun to learn each race and their abilities. I LOVE to play as the Imperial Guard, because they're quite fond to learn.  I dislike the Eldar, though, because over how overpowered they are. The next thing about gameplay, is that the Expansions add such great things in-game.  Likes/Dislikes  Likes:-Contrary to my opinion earlier, I enjoy the Eldar.-More Waagh Banners=More power!-This deserves all the awards it got, but my favorite RTS is still Empire at War.Dislikes:-Not able to play in modern resolution, must get a download with a patched version of the execuatble for modern resolution use.-The Orks vehicles are not very powerful-Space Marines can have quite the unit cap. Final rating  I rate this MARVELOUS RTS a 10/10, it deserved all the awards it got!			"

												Worth buying! Entertaining animations, territory control as an actual game mechanic as opposed to a general principle, the expansions add new content but are also stand alone and more or less games in their own right, after you have the expansions the original still seems complete and balanced compared to the sequel DOW II which seems more cash grabesque, quite understandable considering warhammers origins as a tabletop but still; easy to learn but hard to master in the same vein as chess but with more explosions and retreating. That is another thing! Retreating is actually a valid tactic! Make a fallback position to heavy cover when ♥♥♥♥ hits fan, beware though that if you turtle in that fantastic invincible making cover your enemy squads can and will spec there squads out with flame throwers and explosives, The wargear mechanic means that while some units are still better than others for specific tasks you can generalize or specialize THOSE units as well! Tanks are scary. Chaos marines flinch easy, Orks splatter, Space marines drown, and Eldar eww.			"

												Though my hours on Steam for this game may not be high. I have put hundreds if not a thousand offline hours into this game. LAN Parties and probably over a thousand skrimish games, it is a great RTS game. Relic crafted with Gameworkshop the best Warhammer 40,000 game for PC! Campaign in the game is fantastic!!!

												I rate Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War (this game still doesn't explain why this game is called 'Dawn of War') Game of The Year Edition 3/5. Ok.Well this game was probably pretty good (3.5/5) when it first came out but like movies, games can age and often not in a good way. By today's standards I'd have to say this game is fairly bland and, particularly during single player campaign, somewhat boring. This is partially due to the relatively drab graphics but is also partially due to the gameplay itself which is, sadly, a little too repetitious, Regardless of whether you play multiplayer, in the single-player skirmish mode or on the main campaign, the game's battles are primarily focused on the need to capture and control certain victory control points. Capturing and holding these control points primarily give you the ability to requisition more soldiers, equipment and vehicles or allow you call for more buildings with which to reinforce.Unfortunately, this kind of tactical battlefield gameplay gets old pretty fast as, regardless of which side you play (they are all pretty evenly balanced against each other), the underlying tactics one must employ change relatively little. Essentially you must build units, capture points and then build more units, reinforce and upgrade your current units and capture more points. The single player campaign attempts to spice things up a bit with story-oriented objectives which require you to do things like eliminate every enemy building or kill a particular enemy. The multiplayer and single player skirmish modes also includes settings which allow those matches to be won and lost if similar objectives are achieved. However, regardless of how victory is to be declared, control points must be captured to get more battlefield resources.Limiting the potentially creative tactical possibilities even further, the gameplay is heavily focused on the deployment of infantry. (Some sides use more light, faster-moving infantry and other sides use heavy, slower infantry but all sides mostly use infantry organized into individual squads which you can individually attempt to control). In the main campaign you can only play as the Blood Ravens Space Marines. There are no air units which you can control while there are a few tanks and other armored units you cannot assign a squad to specifically guard and accompany a particular tank (this has to be done in a more manual fashion), though the game mostly just treats different tanks as merely different types of artillery support for your infantry squads (for example, you cannot use tanks to run over infantry unfortunately).Different units have different roles and are absolutely prevented from working outside of those roles (unless their roles change due to being upgraded). Only infantry can capture control points. Oddly, tanks and armored walkers cannot. The gameplay often feels oddly inflexible as a result. You can assign Heroic units to certain squads but you cannot tell a squad to automatically guard another squad and so forth. I remember back when I played Homeworld I ways setup complex, interlinked guardian roles for all of the units I had so each unit was ultimately protecting (and would automatically reinforce) other units. As in most other tactical games, can't do anything approaching this level of complexity here. This game isn't very subtle. The gameplay is mostly about reinforcing units fast (by clicking on buttons on the lower menu as fast as you can) and selecting different buildings and ordering them to produce ever more units while telling your workers to construct more buildings while telling your infantry to take control points while telling your artillery direct their fire at certain high-importance enemies. Sometimes you get to do flanking maneuvers but sometimes not. There's not a lot of ways to think outside the box in this game. Mostly you just have to try to be fast.In terms of graphics, this game can seem a bit bland by today's standards. The complexity of the textures which this game uses have not aged well. However units have a fair number of animations but the stuff they automatically say when selecting them or giving orders becomes really repetitive really fast (I was happy the game has an option to turn off this particular part of the audio) This game depicts some brutal combat situations with bodies that sort of stack up on the ground (a nice graphical touch) but the characters themselves look, well...cute. They look really, really really CUTE. LIKE OH MY, THOSE SPACE MARINES LOOK SO LOVABLE with their big feet and big shoulders and relatively little heads! The Space Marine Dreadnoughts are even more cutesy and funny. They look like cute walking garbage dumpsters (and they have the deep metal garbage dumpster voices you'd imagine a walking, talking garbage dumpster to have). To be fair, the Chaos forces and the Eldar forces and the Orks generally look a quite a bit less cute though (and this game lets you zoom in to an amazing degree to see each individual close up if you want to though you won't possibly be able to be an effective commander if you try to play the game like from such a view as individuals run into and out of your zoomed-in field of vision). The cuteness might be intentional but Warhammer 40K characters BEING CUTE IS NOT TRUE TO THE WARHAMMER 40K UNIVERSE. Unfortunately because of the extreme cuteness ineptly combined with the seriousness of the dialogue and its suitably heavy-handed delivery, the main campaign's movie scenes are a laugh riot. It is commendable that the designers of this game tried to use the same graphics as the game itself to do most of the cutscenes to advance the plot, but when shown up-close the characters all run like marionette puppets (like in the movie Team America), don't move their lips remotely in sync to the dialogue and well,, LOOK ABSOLUTELY TOO CUTE TO BE BELIEVED!!! If you like inadvertent humor, look up the between-missions scenes. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?! After a while I started wondering if a Hello Kitty Space Marine was going to show up to perform exterminatus on the planet.The AI does more than adequate job, but then, given the terrible lack of potential tactical options which this game presents you, I'd expect nothing less. The sound is adequate. Although I liked 2 of the pieces of music used in this game the vast majority of it is boring. I got so bored with the music I played music from a media player on my computer while playing several of the larger battles. This game has very few outright bugs and no bugs which are game-breaking. The final boss is not overly difficult though the AI is far more aggressive in the skirmish mode than the main campaign. The main campaign effectively acts as a sort of long tutorial of sorts. The ending of the game is a disappointing cliff-hanger although I suppose I should expect that given the world of Warhammer 40k.Ultimately, given all this, do I recommend this game or not? I'm not sure. I think, in the light of newer games that have come out since which eclipse this one, I do not recommend this game. This isn't a bad game but it is beginning to age badly.			"

												Damn I love this game ! Having played the Warhammer FPS a few years ago I was attracted to this after playing another Relic game the Company of Heroes series. I've never played the Warhammer table top game but I've at least been in a Games Workshop shop and briefly toyed with board and dice role playing games many years ago. I would guess that some of the developers have played table top RPG's before as some of the kind of humour in that world comes across in this game. I would highly recommend this over Dawn of War 2 as the second game just does not have the same attention to detail, art and graphic design direction that this game has. But DAW2 is a very different game. Here we have Relics calssic attention to detail. The animations and voice acting are incredibly endearing just as we would see a few years later in the first Company of Heroes game. The map design is also solid and believable, where, again, in the second game map objects have been placed badly and you don't feel like your're in a real place.  The sound is also very good. I was listening to a tank firing and it sounded impressive with the shell whooshing off and then a huge explosion as it detonated echoeing off into the map. Sadly that is just not there in DAW 2 although Relic would go on to get it right again in COH2. So well recommended. An excellent diversion and just a very good game.			"
