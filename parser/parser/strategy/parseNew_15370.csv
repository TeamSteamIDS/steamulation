												8.5 / 10It is stand - alone expasion pack.Awesome music, good graphics , very addictive , fun turn based tatics game.These are things when in comes to HOMM. And HOMM5 is not different.But be careful. It will gonna make you pay a lot of time. I mean it.The one-time play can cost you about 1 and half hour and possbilly even more!The fact that luck plays major role in this game can kinda make you upset. (there's many radom stuff in this game)Note that there's mod that make you play other HOMM5 campaigns on this expasion pack.(orginal , HOF)			"

												Very fun game. The best in turn based strategy if you ask meBought heroes 6, was dissappointed and even more dissapointed when i couldnt even finish 1 mission because it stopped working. Remembered this game was good. And now that I play it, I realize it's very close to heroes 3 in mechanics(heroes 3 was a diablo 2 quality game imo). Get it. Such a good game. "

												If you have never played a Heroes of Might and Magic game, shame on you.  This series spans back to my early childhood.    The Heroes game I played the most  was WOG, a custom expansion for HoM&M3.  I loved this series and logged countless hours into these games.  They are indepth yet easy to pick up, hard most of the time unless you are a seasond vet.Build up your town.  Recruit Troops (this version allows upto 7th level units). Upgrade your buildings to get bounses, like resorces, spells, or your creature dwelling. In HoMM5 you can select from 2 differant upgrades for each creature type.  You have a army that is lead by your hero(s).  On the map you will be just one person, but if you attack a creature stack or another player the map closes in and you switch to battle.  This is simalar to RPGs where u wander around a map and you trigger combat then cut screen, there is your party ready to kick some butt.This game allows may differant types of combonations with town faction/hero selection/creature types/pre-gen maps/campain.New Features include the single player campain where you play as the orcs, and i think the 'caravans' are new to this expainsion.  Caravans can be selected where you hire creatures and there u selecet where you want your guys from and the caravans will farry you troops from creature dwellings or even other towns.I must also point out this game does have some flaws.  First I mention the AI, to be honest the AI in heroes games has never been the best and this game is no exception. Many people claim that the normal setting is ""Comp doesn't even try"" (Yes they will even not capture resorce nodes, and be crippled by larger maps).  Also people claim the hard setting is ""Comp Cheats way to much"". Don't be upset, they are fan made mods that tweeks the AI so its more cunning and less cheating.  The random map generator built into the game is poor compaired to previous games.  Lack of teams is the biggest issuse, for multi player games.  If your playing single player the random map gen is fine. NOTE: the time for the computer to move on random maps seems to take extreamly long time even with a 'newer' computer.  YET AGAIN, fans of the Heroes games shine through as I have found 2 other random map gens, I've only used one and it worked great, but the comp lag remaind.The best things I like about this game, caravans (YAY), the gfx (not the best but better then earlyer Heroes), the camera controals(feels natural, smooth when combined with arrow keys), balance (like most heroes games there is no horrid balance issuses), and the community (you will have to resort to the web for forums,)Heroes games have a place in my heart and this one is no exception.9/10			"

												This is one of the greatest games that I've ever played.  The campaign mode offers a rich story that follows on from previous HoMM titles and provides quite a challenge on heroic difficulty.  The multiplayer mode has incredible replayablity,  offering players a choice from a vast selection of heroes, each with various strengths and weaknesses. There's a good selection of maps to play, as well as a lot of user created maps to download.  This is certainly a game that's easy to learn but hard to master.  One of the best turn based strategy games out there. Highly recommend.			"

												In terms of length this expansion totally lives up to the main game of HOMM 5, which I remember playing for the better part of 2007. On the micro scale Tribes Of The East is as good as a Heroes 5 game can get with all the cool turn-based strategy and the different fractions and abilities. That's all good. Unfortunately what they've done is, that they've extended it way past it's capabilities. It doesn't have the steam to build a 100+ hour game yet that's exactly what you get. I still feel trauma whenever I think back on the size of those maps. I think it took me some 8-9 hours to complete the larger ones. By the time I had an army large enough to take on the particular map's final boss, I had long reached the max level available and the whole world had become this empty, trodden space with nothing left to explore. At times this came to be when I was still a good couple months behind from facing the final boss. In that sense the game's doing a very good job at wasting your time. Much too often it lost the momentum from where on it just became grinding to get the level done and much too often I found myself asking 'why am I doing this?'.BUT, to end with a lighter tone - on the micro level you've got a solid 'Heroes' game and maybe you have a hundred hours to waste, maybe you're in prison or something, then it will definitely help you pass those hours.

												Still today, the best of Heroes of Might & Magic games released by Ubisoft. Nival got the essence of Heroes of Might & Magic gameplay and transferred to a magnificent 3D world. ""Anime""-style art was highly discussed, but it was really not that much asian-like but overdone/caricaturized, matching the mood of series starting games Heroes 1 and Heroes 2. Innovations like breaking the strictly army-turn-based combat in initiative-based combat in which faster units get more moves, and a deep, distinctive skill system were refreshing and missed in next games. Tribes of the East, being the last expansion, refines the game experience and it is a recommended classic.			"

												I loved HOMM 3 as a kid, and liked also HOMM 5 as an adolescent. But now this:""Notice: The online multiplayer services for this title are shut down but single-player features will remain available. Any in-game News and player stats services will be shut down. For more info, check out the Ubisoft forums""We bought this game in order to be able to play MP with a friend a decent while ago. Thanks for retiring the multiplayer, Ubisoft being Ubisoft. And FYI I can't meddle with Hamachi because of my computer setup being in a private internal network.

												If you like turn based strategy games, get this game. The story is a continuation of the first one's (which was very good)  and the mechanics that run the game are well made. You can even play the game online either against other players or coop with your friends. It also has a built in mode online called Duel mode where you and your opponent each get a premade fully developed army and fight to the death with them. It is very quick and alot of fun to play as each of the heros are well balanced and have there own quirks in this mode. If you feel ambitious you can even make your own armies for duel mode and even custom campaigns and maps with the map editor. It is a very fun title and has given me hours of enjoyment. I highly recommend it. XD			"

Orcs are really nice to play (new fighting tactics with the rage of blood), are very beautiful. The three campaigns are very catchy, and it feels good to replay the necropolis and good old Zehir (always so charismatic ! ). The game is moreover a stand-alone allowing to discover the world of Heroes of Might & Magic V. Great achievement ! 16/20			"

												TL,DR: Treats Heroes 3 itch, but doesn't offer much new.Pros:- good 'ole Heroes 3 with expanded hero and creature skill system- a bit too cartoonish, but still very solid and stylish graphics and overall design- every faction is very different gameplay-wise due to new global racial ability systemCons:- too many crucial things are random-based, way too many for a TBS- low variety of interactive nodes on the map: either a guarded treasury, a permanent or temporary + to some stat or an outdoor variety of some sort of a town building. Some challenged nodes like ""+1 luck to all owner's heroes"" or an architect's hut that gives some discount on buildings in owner's towns or allows to build twice per day would be nice. Alas- Overabundance of creature abililies makes combat very varied, but you'll have no idea what many of those abilities actually do even when you use them, because their effects are not stated anywhere in the game. There is a fan-made manual for that though.- AI is not very I- Random map generator is still quite glitchyP.S. Too bad Heroes 6 went over the top and treated Heroes 5's two sore fingers by chopping the whole leg off.			"

												I own and have played all the Heroes of Might & Magic (HOMM) games from editions 1-6.  In my opinion, I will list them from favorite to least favorite:HOMM 5HOMM 4 ties with HOMM 3 (for different reasons)HOMM 2HOMM 1HOMM 6Since the beginning, the HOMM franchise was split into two genres: one was an action first-person type of game, and the other was the strategic turn-based game.  (Really.  You could buy two different games with the HOMM name on them.)  The action-based ones were hits, but not my style.  The turned-based ones always tickled my fancy, though the artwork was generally cheesy.  Starting with HOMM 5, the HOMM franchise moved to this French company called UbiSoft.  Things have been pretty lame since then, though HOMM 5 was a great introduction for them.  (Except for the hideous DRM that they implemented, which was beyond atrocious at the time, way back in 2006.  We were all mad at bad companies like EA (U.S.A.), UbiSoft (France), Paradox (Sweden), and the fly-by-night German and Russian companies that misled the gaming community with their cheapshots and hit-and-run tactics.)Anyway, HOMM 5 was sort of like what The Force Awakens is to the Star Wars franchise.  Basically, a new, huge company put a lot of resources into a classic franchise that they acquired; did well at first; and then gradually declined.  (Has that happened for the Star Wars franchise yet?  I don't think so, but time will tell.)  But yeah, HOMM 5 takes the favorite elements of HOMM 3 and HOMM 4 and puts them together in a truly 3-dimensional experience.  The way that the player can upgrade his characters is pretty darn cool; and the HOMM community really put out some great material for us players.  (Better than UbiSoft has, which is a money-grubbing you-know-what.)The good stuff about HOMM 5 are the graphics, sounds, and strategies.  The bad stuff are the French company that is out simply to milk you (essentially useless expansions), the extreme difficulty in modifying your game (unless you know how to write scripts in a programming language - yeah, that difficult), the lame DRM and game forums, and the atrocities that have followed since.Have you seen HOMM 6 or HOMM 7?  If you play them, they will make you hate the HOMM franchise.  What has been going on over there at UbiSoft?My advice is that you just play and modify HOMM 4 to your little heart's content, if you can find that game anywhere.  If you play HOMM 5, you won't be disappointed.  The HOMM 3 remake available on Steam really is not worth your time or any money, as you cannot get the wonderful expansion pack for it anymore.  HOMM 1 & 2 are easily forgotten hits, unless you can remember seeing or playing them back in the 90s like I still can.  Avoid HOMM 6 & 7 like the plague.  Avoid any other games from UbiSoft like two plagues - wait for them to fail and have their titles sold to better developers.If you have the patience, then good things will happen.  Believe it.  The HOMM franchise is in the wrong hands right now.  Boycott these thieves until they go away.  Then get HOMM ten years from now when it is good again.Oh, and I should mention that HOMM 5: Tribes of the East gives you everything you need to play a complete version of HOMM 5.  You do not need the base game or the dwarves expansion pack.  All of that is available in Tribes of the East, a stand-alone product.  (Yeah, UbiSoft are crooks like that.)			"

I don't agree with any of the comments that claim that only this or that Heroes game is good. They are all good.If you want to play Heroes 5, then Tribes of the East is the game to buy because it has the final engine and gameplay improvements and you can use a mod (heroes 5.5) to play all the campaigns and maps from the other two Heroes 5 games. Heroes 5.5 also improves gameplay and the random map generator.At the price of €10 this game is fantastic value.Highly recommended.			"

												I have played the originial Heroes of Might and Magic, Heroes of Might & Magic 3: The Shadow of Death, and even a bit of the newer Heroes of Might and Magic VI, and I have to say this is by far my favorite one so far.  Heroes of Might and Magic V was a great game, and this only adds on to it in many ways.  Some of the major additions is the two types of each tier of soldiers that you can recruit, and of course adding an additional faction, the Orcs, while not losing many of the great features in Heroes V that were lost in the Hammers of Fate Expansion.  Still a very challenging game overall, but well done.  Definitely recomend it, especially if you liked the original Heroes V.			"

												HOMM 5 is a very special case in the book of 'How-To-Age-Quicker', where it consumes more time then you thought it did. The only game before it (for me) was HOMM 3, And no, not the peice of s**t HD remake, but the original, CD PORT.HOMM on its own was a really shallow lot of cool but also very bland gameplay, enjoyable but not mindblowing amazement, however, this expansion to the HOMM 5 library makes every nerve in my body tingle. Not only do we have stronghold which is now probably the most amazing race to play, but overall,  has a fun mechanic which rewards you for being aggressive as all hell.In short, it's a must buy for anyone who has any patience and love strategic games, I believe anyone can get into this game in particular. HOMM 3 can't do that to people, that takes nerves and a lot of spare time. Crack this one open when you are bored, you learn the mechanics in literal seconds, and you're good to go.GR8 game m8 8/10			"

												Don't think of this as DLC, it's essentially a whole new game. The campaign is just as long as the main game. This is the more difficult of the 2 expansions, so either buckle up for a challenge, or expect to crank it down to easy on a few of the missions. I very much recommend this whole series to anyone who enjoys fantasy/strategy/rpg.			"

												In something under 90 hrs, I have my campaign finished on hard difficulty...The game is OK, although i think the computer ""turn thinking"" could be faster (hardware doesn't matter really)Sounds make me tired fast so i turned it off. Music was turned off even earlier.Also, I set speed to maximum because it gets reaally boring to watch all these animations and stuff.But all in all the Tribes standalone Heroes V game is a fine sequel to the glorious Heroes 3.Also, some tips for campaign: When leveling heroes, go to internet and see the ""skill wheel"" so you could reset skills to the most useful combos (usually the skill in the center of the skillwheel is the coolest combo) because SOME OF MAIN HEROES FROM EARLIER MISSIONS ARE GONNA BE TRANSPORTED INTO THE FINAL MISSION AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THEM IN IT but redo the campaign!!!The 1st campaign is easy, no tips.The 2nd campaign is harder, mission when Ornella starts as a necromancer -  don't rush the 2nd city near witch's hut, it's hard to get and is not so neccessary to complete the mission in my opinion.In the last mission, before the 4 spot ritual, make sure to gather all troops and artifacts from other heroes to Arantir , because they're gonna die.The 3rd campaign with orcs requires you to get good skills and gear for both Gotai and Kujin. Also, Kujin will come to the final mission (and you cannot change her in it)The hardest mission is the one with Kujin, But here i'd even recommend it on Normal rather than hard because it's kinda impossible if you don't get lucky with skills and are no strategy genius overall ( for example, put 7 units of a tanky kind each in quantity of ""1"" and let the ballista kill annoying one-target mages, that requires ballista skills )The 4th campaign is multiple fractioned, here you need to level and gear up Zahir (mage), Wulfenstein (dwarf) and Frida (knight) because ALL three + Kujin the shaman come to fight in the final mission.The first encounter with Zahir mission, as soon as u take the 1st dark elves city, they will come from the portal right near it and attack u with a reasonable army. Make sure you have some Rakshasas and mages in nice numbers to stand them.Zahir with the main combo spell would be easy to easy as soon as you get it ( he then casts every kind of magic without even learning them ) (also, the ""mentor"" ability of Zahir helps get any new hero a huge lvl boost)			"

												How many more have to kill in order to save the world. What an irony ... Well, things just got simple. And a lot more complicated.@ Agrael (Raelag)			"

												A nice calming and well developed story of Ghandi traveling through the mists of Narnia to go to his seance meeting with Stalin, Jack Frost and a necrophiliac with the fedora as they develop a scheme to find the 7 purity rings of Tom Hanks. This game is the epitome of the human comprehension as it relies on just going ape♥♥♥♥♥♥in battles instead of strategy (I tried on Hard mode and i assure you it works).			"

												Kareem Rating 8.5/10 - A great buy for the meticulous strategist. Heroes V offers elements of RPG style gameplay, along with an in-depth turn-based world and combat system. Heroes! A great game where you can sit down with a few buddies and take turns playing hot potato on the hot seat. Build your empire, expand your domain, and crush your enemies… Engage them as the undead, with the raise dead ability you just keep on hammering your foes, Or! Play as the dungeon, masters of destruction magic, harbor of dragons! With 6 different factions, there’s something for just about any type of strategist. I’ve been playing this series of games since I was about 9, and they just keep getting better.			"
