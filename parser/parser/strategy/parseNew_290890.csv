												A definite improvement over the simple concept 10000000 gave us. Rather than set a goal over the whole experience, the game makes it a bit more about the journey.Pros:+ Shows some real evolution of the original concept with more tiles and new special attacks+ New zones keep the enviornment interesting and the journey long+ Heavy upgrade to the presentation of the game as everything feels nicer to execute+ Better soundtrack than 10000000, even if it also gets a little repetitive. Has much more fitting music for the art style.+ Earning your keep very much pushed in this game as you must do well to progress and unlock new crew members+ Keeps an adventure feel to it rather than dangling a goal over you like in 10000000+ Only tweaking the formula to avoid any unneccessary confusion, adding more, but not too much, for veterans.+ Much more varied color pallet.+ Enemies now have weaknesses and immunities.Cons:- Some goals still seem arbitrary.- While nice, the new library for looking at item effects, enemy types, and weaknesses is, in the end, pointless considering you're at the mercy of the tiles.- Still a bit more luck based than skill based.- Not too much has changed visually.- The way upgrading is handled stinks of a game that had microtransactions but were seemingly removed for the Steam version.- Upgrading still feels way too slow considering the cost, now adding a minigame as if still meant for a touch device.7/10.

												My experience:- Over 6,5h- 33k tiles smashed- Finished the gameWould I recommend it? Yes.Will I play it again? No.This is simple game, but the gameplay provides fun and has this 'one more run' syndrome (it is addictive).While it is not a complex game, it gets the job done - for relatively small price ( kinda equivalent of a beer ) you get 6 hours of enjoyment.33k tiles dudes. Over 33k tiles. That counts for something :)			"

												You Must Build A Boat is a mobile styled match-3 game.  That's it, if that's exactly what you want then read no further - this is the game for you.Onto the review proper.  I have never played 10000000, I do no know what type of game it is and maybe I should have done more research because the description 'About This Game' was not what I was lead to expect at all when I bought You Must Build A Boat.YOU DO NOT BUILD A BOAT.  For every stage you pass your boat gets bigger and more furnished.  You have no input in how this happens.You do not actively gather a crew or capture monsters.  These events happen as you match tiles but, again, you have no strategic or tactical input.  There is no skill involved.You can upgrade your weapon, cast magic and upgrade your board.  But ultimately there is little choice in how you do any of these things.  The game boils down to: buy the cheapest upgrade so that you can eke out a little more time in the next match 3 game and then buy the next cheapest upgrade.The match 3 game which is the core and only gameplay of You Must Build A Boat (as there is no boat building or monster wrangling) is frustrating rather than fun.Certain enemies are weak to certain tile combinations - swords for an enemy weak against physical for example.  But the very tight timelimits left me frantically mathching anything I could in the hope that any damaging tiles - regardless of appropriateness - would fall onto the board.  There is no time to build combinations effectively and no guarantee you'll be given magic or ability tiles when needed.This is not a thoughtful puzzle game.  The timelimits are too tight and the board too random.  If you're waiting in a station or a queue at a shop this would be a good time waster but on a PC where I am choosing to spend my time on entertainment for enjoyment; it's just frustratingly flat.

												I will admit, I am not a huge fan of match 3 games, Endless runners can be fun but even they begin to get a little annoying after awhile. So as you can imagine, I was very surprised when I played YMBAB and had a friggin blast, hours flew by and I didn't want to stop playing. The game takes all of its genres and mixes them perfectly. Mixing not only match 3 but also light RPG elements. What drives you to continue playing is the games constant reward system. You are rewarded with new crew members, gold, or expansions to your vessel. No run feels pointless, you always feel like you are accomplishing something. On top of all that you have access to a vast array of abilities to improve. This feature allows you to create a strategy and play style that is unique to each player and something you wouldn't expect in a match 3 style game. Of course the only problem I could find with YMBAB is that sometimes your attention needs to be divided with what's going on up top and continue matching. This isn't always easy and can be a little frustrating, however this is far from any kind of real problem. YMBAB is made extremely well and bug free. The pixel graphics are adorable and the music matches suit. There really isn't any reason to not check out YMBAB at a great low price of $4.99. So excuse me while I play over and over again and expand my vessel!I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Yes!! I've been waiting for this title for quite a while so I am tickled pink that it is finally in the store! This little 55mb gem is brought to you by the creator of '10000000' for an affordable $3(currently on sale). The object of the game is simple: You must build a boat.Much like it's predecessor, you journey though a side scrolling dungeon completing tasks and sliding matching tiles for bonuses/items etc. Excellent time waster if you're looking for something to sort of casually play without putting a lot of thought into overly complicated mechanics. There's my short and sweet review!FIN			"

												If you enjoyed 10000000, you will enjoy You Must Build a Boat. It is essentially more of the same, with some additional layers of complexity which help the experience feel more rounded. You will probably not be surprised that your primary goal is to build a boat. You do this mostly by clearing dungeons, which is generally accomplished by executing a variety of match-3's in an experience that mirrors an endless runner. You'll have a variety of ways to attack your enemies, you'll gather loot, and you'll use that loot to upgrade your ship. The dungeon goals feel a little tougher this time around. While this adds a welcome level of complexity (and hoarding spells to hurl at fireball at a frozen enemy does feel mighty fine), these more complicated goals can sometimes stall your experience. There was one dungeon objective which was so poorly explained that I was stuck for at least an hour before I finally Googled to find out what I was supposed to be doing. When a similarly difficult objective came again a little later, I didn't waste as much time before looking up the answer. Still, plenty of run goals are accomplished simply by entering the dungeon and matching away. As you upgrade your weapons, spells, and shield, you'll find allies to aid your journey and your runs will become longer as you master the matching mechanics.You Must Build a Boat suffers from being extremely repetitive. You are going to be doing the same matches again and again. You will go through dungeons that all look fairly similar and face lots of similar enemies that want to kill you. It is a grind, and while it is well-executed, you will probably not be able to play the game in one sitting. My mouse hand grew numb during more than one play session, and the visual strain of staring at the screen to discern matches can be tiring. Still, I absolutely recommend the experience for its high level of creativity and clever execution. I have always enjoyed endless runners, and this is among the best of them.			"

												It lasts about six hours, it's very repetitive and relies on luck more than it should. But it's also stupidly cheap and insanely satisfying when you combine the great chiptune soundtrack, with the massive combos you can get and a clear sense of progression. While it does still feel like something more welcome on mobiles than on PC, it's still a fun game that costs less than lunch and isn't as lazy a port as some other mobile games on Steam.			"

You Must Build A Boat is a match-three puzzle game with it’s own unique RPG elements where you must build...a….boat.Please note this review is mostly for people who have played 10,000,000 as there are a lot of comparisons.General GameplayI was a huge fan of 10,000,000 and I was excited to try You Must Build A Boat and i’m glad I wasn't disappointed. It stays true to the original whilst adding new gameplay mechanics and extra replayability to make for a refreshing play. This time around you’ll find yourself starting out on a small boat which you’ll need to slowly upgrade and add crew members so you can reach your goal. The main gameplay is pretty much the same as 10,000,000; you must match three or more identical tiles by dragging a row on your board. Different tile matches will have different effects from damaging opponents to opening chests or collecting resources. Most of the tiles are the same in YMBAB however you will find new tiles to match in this game two of which are Thought and Power. Much like wood and stone were in 10,000,000, you collect these and can spend them after the run. Though they seem a little useless at first they are both actually very useful as you play on. Power and Thought are used for adding crew members which will give you permanent passives during your run eg +10% spell power or +6% staff damage. They are also used for upgrading other things such as your spells.Quests range from matching tiles to using spells in a certain way or killing certain enemies. Once all ‘quests’ are completed you’ll be able to progress to the next area where you’ll find a different range of monsters as well as new quests and a new ship unlock at the end. The ship unlocks consist of new people for your ship that’ll upgrade your things like your staff, sword and shield and other some vendors too.Monsters you encounter differ in the different zones you are in and each are either melee or ranged. They all have their own immunities, perks and weaknesses making them all different from one another in some form. All monsters can be ‘collected’ and added permanently to your crew by completing their specific quests (which you can’t miss) or finding the secret collects which can be found by doing certain tasks or actions which are...secret.Pros--- New randomized dungeon effects add a lot more replayability.--- New upgrades, rooms and NPCs.--- Relaxing yet challenging at the same time.--- Ridiculously addictive gameplay. --- Fair range of enemies with their own immunities, perks and weaknesses.Cons--- Lack of explanation on certain things e.g Secret Crew members perks, no in-depth tutorials because things are unlocked progressively.--- Not a fantastic port. Too much clicking and unneeded swiping when it comes to opening boxes or levelling up.--- Unnecessary changes from the first game e.g items are now stored on the board and not in your bag.--- If you’re going for 100% achievements, by your third run things can feel REALLY grindy.SummaryAlthough not as good as 10,000,000 in my eyes YMBAB is still a fantastic play and worth picking up if you are a fan of it’s predecessor. There is plenty of enjoyment to be had despite its few flaws and really is a must try for any fans of the previous game or any casual gamers in general. Well worth the $5 I spent on it even if I would have prefered to play it on my phone in hindsight.			"

tl;dr - Kept matching tiles for hours and hours, anytime I might have forgotten the point of the game, the transition screen will remind you in massive letters - ""YOU. MUST. BUILD. A. BOAT."" 11/10 transformed my dingy into a massive pirate ship pimp-my-ride style. I received this game as my second review copy (wohoo!) and was very excited to try it because I love match games – in particular, Puzzle Quest. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience.If you like match games, RPG-lite elements, grinding, and retro pixel-style graphics, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are simple and nice – the variation in monster/character sprites is decent and the amount of detail in the game is good. As you progress through the game, you will encounter new crewmembers, resulting in new rooms being added to your ship (increasing its size). Eventually, you will transform your tiny dingy into an awesome pirate ship. Whenever you complete an area, you will travel to a new one, complete with different backgrounds and “water.” The music and sounds are decent and remniscent of the old-school retro games era, however, I muted it after an hour of playing in favor of my own.Controls are entirely mouse-based and very easy to learn. There is a mobile version of this game, and you will quickly notice how the game is meant to be played with a touch interface. That being said, the PC version is still very playable and fun. There is a helpful tutorial, however, I noticed that it does not seem to be skip-able – which can be a bit annoying when you start a new game again and have to go through the text dialogue multiple times. The learning curve is mostly minimal, however, will have to do a fair bit of grinding in order to progress (even if you happen to be the best match gamer in the world). Enemies become stronger as you progress, and the game continues until you are knocked off the screen – which is hastened whenever you are attacked or take time to open chests. I like this system because it is indicative of your remaining health – so at max health, you will be running at the very right end of the screen.Gameplay consists of you matching various tiles (minimum of 3) while your character runs through a dungeon. Different tiles execute actions like attack (magic or physical), open locks, and shield (prevents damage and refills health – allowing your character to run further to the right). There are also brain and muscle icons, which act as a form of currency to purchase things like attack/spell upgrades and hire crewmembers. Crate tiles take up space, however, destroying them will sometimes yield useful items or spells (ex: a fireball spell that pierces all visible enemies). You get bonuses for matching more than 3 tiles, matching different tile types simultaneously, and chaining matches. Grinding plays a critical role in this game because enemies will start to do massive damage to you if you are not upgrading things like your defence (health) and attack.Whenever you start a dungeon run, you can add missions (a maximum of 3 once you invest in the ability) – each one adding to the dungeon difficulty and loot chance. Completing missions will give you resources, as well as things like new crewmembers (monsters) to recruit. Recruiting monsters will provide you with a particular bonus (ex: increased critical attack chance), and recruiting all monsters in a “set” will give you an extra bonus. Monsters that have been recruited will appear on your ship, roaming around and looking ferocious. Once you have run a specific distance, the difficulty of the dungeon will increase and you will enter the next level of the dungeon area. Completing all levels of the dungeon will allow you to progress to the next area. It is always advised to progress as soon as you can because loot rate/rarity (and monster difficulty) will increase significantly, allowing for more efficient grinding.Eventually, you will encounter “traps,” which must be disarmed by matching the appropriate tile. If you fail to do this within a small window, you will activate the trap – the worse one being a freeze trap that renders all of your actions invalid until you thaw out (very easy to lose if this happens to you at later stages). Sometimes, you will find food in your play area – clicking it will refill your health substantially. Treasure chests will also increase in difficulty (requiring you to match key tiles 3 or more times), however, you can offset this by matching 4 or 5 tiles instead of the minimum 3. A nice thing about the game is how it says: You Win! whenever you get knocked off the screen. The tutorial even explains that you cannot truly “lose” the game.Once you complete the game, you can restart in a new game+; I tried this for a short while until moving on to other things.Overall, the game plays very well, and can be extremely enjoyable if you are a fan of the match-3 genre. I got ~7 hours out of this game, and have played it into the wee hours of the morning just because I wanted to finish a stupid mission.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												Nice fast-paced match-3 game, if you have played 10.000.000, you already know.It's addictive as RPGs can be, having in common with them stats and unlockable upgrades.What's new in this game?In this game you can move tiles while other ones that you have already matched are still breaking, that is YMBAB is even more fast-paced than his predecessor; however the game is easier, since you have many little tasks, never as difficult as reaching 10.000.000 points.In the case you are up for more challenge, after beating the game you can start over with the game being harder, but be wary: this is not a new game+, you lose everything!There is also a little gift midrun if you choose to restart... and there are other secrets in the game...(litterally called secrets by it)There are many little differences that sum up to became an entirely new game (I don't want to spoil everything), so it's reccomended to people that played the first game too.The only thing I don't like is the start... why am I on a boat and still I have to build a boat?Why are there monsters with me on it and why are they helping me?Well, we will never know... but this doesn't matter, because the YMBAB is fun.; )P.S. How could I have forgotten the music?!The music in this game is great!I'll probably keep playing to hear that.			"

												It does not disappoint.  If you played 10,000,000 and liked it, then you MUST get this game and you MUST BUILD A BOAT!!!New features I've seen so far (I haven't completed the game yet):New Tiles: Thought Power and Muscles - accumulate them to recruit monsters to fight for you and give you bonuses!Random Dungeon Types:  Some have harder enemies, some have more loot, some have fog on the bottom of the screen so it's hard to see.Instead of building rooms and upgrading them like in 10,000,000, in this game you gain friends along your journey who will upgrade your weapons and armor.  Your boat gets bigger and bigger as you gain more NPCs.You get random loot and can sell it for money.Graphics are upgraded but still pixel-based.  Just not as harsh pixely as in the last game.  Music is nice.  I think.  I'm so busy trying to make matches fast that I don't pay much attention to the music!Price is cheap!  I would pay more for this game, it's that good.  In fact, owners of 10,000,000 were promised a free key but I didn't even bother emailing the developer, I just bought it instantly as soon as it came out.			"

												Best 2.50 I've spent.  I was looking for an ""RPG Match 3"" type game.  You Must Build a Boat boasted building a boat bigger and better.  What I didn't know is that I could spend my gold to upgrade my tiles, damage, defense, spells. I could sell to an orb. I could recruit monsters. Yes yes it says all of these things right there in the description, I just didn't expect to love it so much.  Graphics are low quality, but you can tell what everything does by sight and the ""tutorial"" helps you without being too intrusive.  Love it.			"

												A very simple puzzle game with a nice little dungeon running twist.  If you played the previous game in the series you are not getting much more really.  While the feature of building a boat is new, it actually doesn't add anything to the actual gameplay.  You still move your little dungeon runner to the right while matching tiles to either deal damage, or collect items.This is fun however, don't get me wrong.  It's well worth the purchase for some simple old school puzzle action.  7/10 for just being a fun game, no bells, no whistles just an enjoyable gaming experience.			"

Graphics and sounds are on the minimalistic side (I turned off the music after roughly 30 minutes of playing) but gameplay is solid and engaging enough. You'll constantly be learning new abilities and new enemies and traps will always get in the way, requiring you to constantly elevate your matching abilities and being fast.If you enjoy fast-paced Match-3 puzzle games, or if you enjoyed 10,000,000, this is a worthy sequel and game.

												You Must Build A Boat (YMBAB) is a fast paced tile-based puzzle game. It wants to have the feel of an older game, as one can tell by the minimalist pixel art style and the 8-bit music. Your objective: run through a temple, gather treasure while fighting monsters, and use your gold to progress upriver by... building a boat. Who knew...To it's credit, YMBAB works well with its chosen style. Old games are, on the whole, more challenging than most new releases. And you will find that YMBAB is challenging... it will take awhile to master.As you continue you gain crew members who make you stronger and give you a place to spend gold... you even collect monsters to help you.However, many players may be turned off after about an hour or two of gameplay due to repetition. Runs are essentially identical, different places are really just palette swaps, and too many times you will try to complete a quest only to just not be given the proper tiles. That's my major gripe with this game. How random things are, often times preventing you from advancing to the next area simply because the tiles won't line up right. I'm sorry, but I can't predict if a cascade will get me my mandatory 4th triple match of the run before I get pushed off screen to start over. Also, I've noticed only two music tracks in the game: one for your boat, one for going on a run. I'm not against 8-bit music, but only two tracks is aggrevating.I have yet to reach the end of this game, and maybe I never will. Perhaps all that's there is a ""GOOD JORB BUDDY"" sign and a button to start again. I don't recommend YMBAB, but go ahead and play it if you want... just be aware of the grind you are about to suffer through.			"

												Dear god, what a disappointment this was.  I enjoyed 1000000, but this game is like someone decided to draw it out as long as possible while removing half the things that made the original tolerable.  Oh right and when I beat the last quest the game softlocked.  GOOD JOB.The drink system is absolute rubbish now, with mostly-useless effects and less flexibility- drinks last a set number of runs so once you drink one you're stuck with it for that amount of time.Monsters have a large variety of effects, which means for the most part there's no strategy for taking them out.  You just have to match attack tiles in general.Upgrades are now basically worthless for the gold they cost, and you have almost no gold income aside from quest rewards until the very end of the game!  This means you can't grind until then, and when you DO get there, you HAVE TO grind, because the last quest is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.Oh right, quests.  Instead of collecting resources to unlock upgrade types, you have to do quests, which usually involve satisfying some unique action during a dungeon run.  That's generally fine, though some rely on blind luck.  However, their main purpose seems to be roadblocking upgrades.  After a certain point, the equipment upgrades all require ""silver"" which only drops from quest rewards until you get an upgrade near the end of the game that lets you get it from matching crate tiles.  Thus, silver restricts what upgrades you can get, which makes grinding mostly useless.  Furthermore, base stat upgrades are hard-locked to completing ""monster capture"" quests, so you can't grind for them at all.Take the combination of the following factors:1) Traps are so punishing you have to have a variety of tiles ready to match at all times, which requires luck.2) The RNG is streaky which means you get a lot of garbage or a lot of accidental match chains, which can either roadblock you or make progress smooth.3) Quest items are looted from boxes which require a lot of matches of specific tiles.4) The last quest item is put so deep in the dungeon you have like 10 seconds to match the required tiles.  The dungeon is pushing you back just that fast.5) Dungeon effects are randomly generated, but they stay the same until you complete a quest.6) Monsters near the end of the game take like 5 or 6 attacks to kill and have no weaknesses for the most part.7) Items can be stockpiled for emergencies between runs once you get the upgrade that allows it, but all items STAY IN THE GRID, GETTING IN THE WAY.All these factors combined means that if you get a bad roll for your last set of dungeon effects, the final quest becomes PURE LUCK.

												Even though it keeps the core gameplay intact, You Must Build a Boat feels more dynamic than 10,000,000 thanks to some fun animations and effects and a soundtrack that sounds like it was lifted right from an unreleased Castlevania game. If you enjoy matching three (or upwards of five, even) things, this is a great alternative to your various Bejeweleds and clones thereof.			"

												You Must Build a Boat is a mixture of Endless Runner and Match-3 with Rogue-lite elements. Sounds strange, but works pretty well.Your character runs through a dungeon, fights monsters, opens chest and overcomes other obstacles while you match the corresponding tiles. In each run you are given a set of up to three missions to fulfil which grant special features to a run and affects the difficulty - the more you try at once, the harder it gets. But you also get more out of a run. Upon completion of all missions for a certain stage, you process through the next of ten settings. Missions also grant you new recruits or resources which you can invest into enhancing your character (which boils down to doing more damage on a match) to ease your next run.Sadly that's it about the game. You keep running the dungeons, trying to complete the increasingly luck-depended missions. The increasing difficulty is offset by the better stats and bonuses and thus a run in the first dungeon feels not much different from on in the last. Once you complete the game, you unlock the daily run challenges and can start a new ""prestige"" game with slightly increased difficulty. Talking about repetitive gameplay.The progression is strictly linear and you have to complete the missions in a particular order. You have to do a mission no matter what and you move on to the next stage no matter what, once the current one is completed. A simple farm run to get some upgrades is out of the question, which leads to some hopeless runs later down the line.There are sadly some issues with the game which can infuriate you. Like not being able to pass an obstacle because you simply don't have the tiles for it or just not seeing any matches, while you are doomed to watch the time ticking away. I've also encountered some small bugs which lead to the game hanging, but they could all be fixed with a simple restart.It's not a bad game at all, and good to waste some time on. But I feel it's a step back from its predecessor 10,000,000 and there are better Match-3 games out there.			"

												I couldn't decide what to play (too many games, first world problem extraordinaire) so I scrolled down to the final item in my steam library - You Must Build a Boat. I actually obtained 100% achievements on 10,000,000 so I don't know why this game was sitting in my library unplayed - but 18 hours later, I'm happy to give it a reasonable thumbs up.An upgraded 10,000,000?This is a Match 3 / RPG combo in a very similar style to 10mil. In fact the actual game board is near identical - but the upgrades and premise are a little different. This one has more collectibles, more upgradeables and in my opinion, is harder - especially if you're aiming to 100% the achievements. However, at it's core, they are extremely similar games.FlawsIt's very RNG and this makes it a grind, especially towards the final few achievements. In trying to add depth to the previous game, there are some extras like traps, monster vulnerabilities, quests and so on - but by adding so many different things sometimes it's simply not possible to complete a level or a quest without just spamming it over and over and hoping for the right combo. This ends up with you having a ton of resources you can't even use by the end - but still not getting the things you need to progress. There's a fine line between adding depth/strategy and simply padding the game out to give it the illusion of more, and I think this fell a little into the padding category.Many of the cut scenes / actions for upgrades also seemed unskippable, and they were pretty boring to sit through. This is not the sort of game I play for story.Worth it?I must have picked it up in a bundle as I have no recollection of purchasing it - but for those who enjoy the match 3 concept and aren't bothered by a bit of RNG/grind then this is a very fun game. If you're easily frustrated, the simpler concept of 10mil may be more suitable. I wouldn't pay full price for it even though it's only £3.99, but I'd definitely give it a playthrough if you pick it up in a bundle or on sale. I enjoyed it, despite the flaws and I built a pretty awesome boat!			"

												If 10,000,000 isn't enough, you get ""You Must Build A Boat"".Just like it previous game, ""You Must Build A Boat"" is a match-3 puzzle game with an addition mix of RPG elements.  You goal is simple, you fight in the dungeon using match-3 to gain golds and materials, then use them to improve yourself and your boat, once you done with one area you onto the next, until you ungrade everything.EightyEightGames did a really great job on improving the mechanic of this game.  Unlike the first game, the items you can use in this game is actually useful for many situations.  Also special magic tiles is now available to give you more choice on how to fight the monster.The improvement come a little downside for me.  I feel the game became is a little too fast pace, most of the time, I end up trying to match whatever possible without looking the current objective.  It work most of the time but it take the fun away when it turn into just another match-3 puzzle.If you do have a choice between this and the phone version, I would say get the phone one.  The game probably work better on a smaller screen.  Either way, for the listing price, I would definitely recommend this game to any causal player, phone or PC.			"

												I'm not sure I can reccomend this game, its nearly identical to 10,000,000... except this one removes the score requirements and your rank advancement is entirely based on finishing all the quests on a tier. Then the end game seems to be an unaided quest through 500 meters? 500 units? 500 steps? 500 SOMETHINGS to finish the one feature of this boat building simulator that you'd find in evoland... I'd spoil it, but its already spoiled...Also this game lies, you don't build a boat. Last I checked it takes wood, and stone... things you got in 10,000,000 to build a boat... in this game you don't get any wood, or any stone... so how the hell do you build a boat? SERIOUSLYI'm still trying to figure out how you go from a canoe to a boat... YOU GET NO MATERIALS TO UPGRADE IT... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHThis game should be You Must Watch Others Build a Boat, then put some cutscenes in... otherwise no way I'd recommend this failure of a boat building simulator.			"

												What a bargain.  You Must Build A Boat gets a wholehearted recommendation from me.  Gameplay is terrific.  Timed match-3 is fast paced and rewards you even when you don't succeed with your run-goals.  Actually, they say you won each run, even if you failed your objectives, because you still collect treasure, gold, etc. that comes back to your boat where different vendors you've picked up along your travels will sell you upgrades to melee & magic weapons, spells, shield and more.  The chip tune music is catchy (I could listen to it for hours-long game stints without tiring of it) and matches the game perfectly.  This game mixes luck (random tiles) with skill (your timing, choice of attack, strategy against different foes, etc) which is nice because it doesn't get boring.  The RPG elements of upgrading your equipment and run bonuses are great.  The one-step-at-a-time introduction to new gameplay mechanics, plus the simplicity makes this game easy to get into - while the ""one more run!"" addictive gameplay and charming music keep you playing once you start.  Lastly, I like that it's ""different"".  Your ship's crew looks to be made up of monsters.  You're not really told what the story is, and I think as I finish the game it will be revealed - and I'm looking forward to learning what I'm sailing towards and why I've built the boat.  I'm surprised the regular price is only $4.99.  I think they could have asked for twice this and had very few with buyer's remorse.  I snatched it up during the Thanksgiving sale of 2015 for $2.49, but it's a great little game and already a bargain at full price.			"

Everything about both of the games is fanatsic.10mil is about escaping the prison while YMBAB is about nailing up a giant river... sorta like the nile river.If you have not played any of these two games you are TRULY WASTING YOU LIFE. PLAY THIS IT'S GOOD and you don't even need a gaming pc. you con probberly play this on a pc with windows 98.Only one problem with this game, you can't stand on one spot to grind money, you always have to move forward since you do the quests all the time which makes it harder and harder...

												Short review: Fun game. You can compare it to 10,000,000 but it added some new mechanics that my draw in new players. Long review:NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS (for as much as this game has any)Let me go a bit more indepth now. On the surface the gameplay between both games is exactly the same, you go in a dungeon with Explorer and do the puzzle shoving and solving with the 'match-three'-game. Meanwhile you will beat enemies, get gold and other goodies. Gold is basically used for the same thing as in the previous game, you buy upgrades with it. One thing changed in that perspective. If you played 10,000,000 you know you collected wood and stone to upgrade your shops and things like that. However in this game, you will unlock your shops through getting certain achievements in the dungeon. And you have way more shops then in the first game, also you will catch some loot like random rings and stuff. Eventually you will unlock someone you can sell that stuff to for gold.So with the wood and stone collection gone, you have three new tiles. You have a 'Meat', 'Power' & 'Crate'-tile added to the mix of your normal staff, sword, key and shield. 'Meat' & 'Power' are basically for the best new addition to the game, namely the monster buddies. Completing objectives and achievements will unlock certain monsters, which you can eventually purchase. These monsters are basically your upgrades for certain things. Like +10 Staff Power or +10 Trap Time and stuff like that. These become very useful eventually also in later dungeons. What remains are the 'Crate'-tiles. These basically replace the item-slots you got when opening chests in the first game. Nothing special, only thing is they take up a place on your board. This can be a bit annoying when shoving around but it will help you immensly.How about the gameplay then? Like I said it didn't chance much, they added some tweaks and turns. But on the surface it's exactly the same as 10,000,000. Only thing I like better in this game then the previous one is the fact that you have more then one dungeon. You basically travel with your boat (starting of as a simple rowing boat) down the stream and go plunder the dungeons along the way. Completed all the objectives in one dungeon, you travel on. For me personally I like this better. In 10,000,000 I usually had no problem beating the first level of the dungeon, but came across trouble beating the next levels, which essential made me put down the game. Here you can just go and keep on doing the same dungeon over and over. Ofcourse eventually you will run into higher speed and difficult enemies. But it won't block you, cause you will start on Lvl 1 of every dungeon and you will not travel futher and get more challenging objectives before you beaten the dungeon, basically serving as a watchman for your difficulty. Only downside I see to this is, that if you eventually encounter a dungeon that's to hard for you, you can't go back to the previous. I would love to have seen this to be added, but I can see why they didn't.Overall a very positive vibe from this game. It's much like 10,000,000 and if you liked that one, you more then likely are gonna like this one. If you didn't like the first one, you can always give it a shot. Because the game added enough new content to try and be an 'upgrade' from the first one.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: You Must Build A Boat. I Must Be Crazy For Liking It.Genre: Combination of RPG, Rogue-lite and Match-Three Elements.Developed & Published by: EightyEight GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Business Model: Single Purchase. Copy Purchased by Myself, Playtime Was Mostly On Android PreambleI used to like mobile-centric games, back in 2013. It was a new frontier of gaming and a lot of new ideas were being used to figure out what could be done. However, I eventually became fatigued of the current running trend which is freemium everything. Freemium mechanics and business model, an extremely toxic and unenjoyable combination of ideas. It completely turned me off from trying new games for a while. It didn’t help that I felt like there weren’t any games being made for a core gamer such as myself. Games where I can sit down for more than five minutes and actually get a deeper, more challenging experience as I went along. Most of the time, the game shows its hand and I’ll get bored of it pretty quickly. A friend eventually cajoled me out of my negative attitude towards it and sharing a bunch he recommended. So, I decided to give Android another go, to look in the inner depths of the platform and find games that PC-centric gamers like myself might find interesting. It's true that You Must Build A Boat isn’t exactly a hidden gem. However, I think it’s a good starting point for me to start from. Let’s talk about building boats and killing monsters. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsYou Must Build A Boat is a combination of RPG, rogue-lite and match three mechanics. The player starts on a boat and is tasked with, well, building a much bigger boat. To accomplish this, he must run an endless procedurally generated dungeons, defeat monsters and acquire loot. Incrementally and eventually growing strong enough through capturing monsters, recruiting crewmates, finding relics and upgrading your capabilities to take on the challenges ahead. There are two phases to this game, running the dungeons and buying upgrades with the recently acquired loot. As this is a rogue-lite, the objective isn’t to “win” the dungeon, but get as far as you can and acquire as much material as possible. The RPG mechanics are in how you can upgrade your weapons, defense and spells that you can use in the dungeon. There’s a good tutorial that runs you through the various mechanics and currencies in the game. The main portion of the game that the player will be playing in is the dungeon running. This side-scrolling endless dungeon has the player running to the right as long as they can. As soon as they get pushed off to the left, their run is done and they can either retry or return to the boat to acquire upgrades. This is the player’s health bar essentially. Each run will have an objective(s) that the player must strive to achieve. These objectives can unlock new shops on the ship, gold or power depending.  As you progress through the dungeon, there are procedurally generated enemies, chests and traps that will try to hinder your movement. You must match the appropriate tiles in order to defeat these obstacles. For enemies, this is usually matching sword or magic staff tiles to do damage. For chests, it’s key tiles. Traps and certain chests will have an icon associated to them telling the player what they must match to defeat them. Enemies won’t simply stand around and let you kill them, they’ll throw their own attacks that will knock the player farther to the left. You can match shield tiles to prevent “damage” but these must be refreshed pretty often to keep the shield up. There are three other tile sets as well: knowledge, strength and crates. Matching knowledge and strength tiles give you a currency for upgrades or recruiting “found” monsters which grant bonuses. Matching crates gives the player a chance to find items to sell or spells that can be used in the dungeon run at the player’s discretion. These spells vary from freezing spells to fireballs. While the player is running, they are constantly charging a horn spell that, when the horn is charged and the player is in danger, will clear the immediate screen of enemies. This can sometimes be a clutch play or completely wasted on a single enemy. It depends. The general idea when you’re playing the match-three section is to have as many sword/staff/key matches available to deal with whatever obstacle you’ll run into. While the guy is running between obstacles, the player should clear the board of crate, strength and knowledge tiles as much as possible for their benefits and so they can have access to the sword/staff/key tiles. Matching four or five tiles in a row increases the potency of these tiles as well as tile multipliers that are unlocked later in the game. All the while, the player is up against a constantly changing timer due to the aforementioned “health” bar. Upgrades can be purchased to improve the player’s sword, shield, staff, spells and even dungeon runs in general. There’s a choice of three different upgrades for most of these items but generally they are all stat upgrades with some having certain effects. All upgrades are worth getting, it’s just a matter of whether you can afford them. Game ThoughtsYou know, I rather enjoyed YMBAB. As far as mobile games go, it pushes the player to keep getting better at match-three. Since you’re up against a health bar timer where faster and better matches are constantly encouraged, it makes the player improve along with the character you’re playing as. Sometimes, runs can just be bad because you won’t get the natural matchups you need but more often than not, you can make it work. It’s about making the best of a difficult dungeon. Once I finished the campaign, I felt I had gotten enough of the experience but boy, it was a pretty darn good experience. While the upgrade/RPG mechanics aren’t exactly that deep, it at least gives you something else to think about and strive for in each run so that each subsequent run is that much better. It’s still a pretty simple experience when you get right down to it, but it’s got the right combination of mechanics, skill ceiling and ideas so that even someone like myself can enjoy it. PC Settings and Audio/VideoGame Options:What the User Can Configure:Resolution Options: Reasonable selection.A list of resolutions limited to your max resolutionScreen Mode: Windowed/Fullscreen ModeBorderless Windowed is part of windowed mode.V-Sync, Shader Effects IncludedOn/Off ToggleParticle Count.User selected for low/med/high.Audio Options. Music & SoundAdjustable sliders.Final ThoughtsHonestly, I think You Must Build a Boat is a better experience on mobile devices. That’s not to say that the PC port is bad (it’s not). However, the mouse feels like a poor substitute for the touch-driven design. You could still play it with a mouse, but I think you’ll enjoy it more on your phone/tablet than on a PC. Still, this combination of fast-paced match-three mechanics and rogue-lite mechanics make for a fun time. And You Must Build A Boat is one that a decent amount of hidden depth for a mobile game. It keeps me interested despite its simplicity through its push to the player to keep getting better and faster at matching tiles together. So, give You Must Build A Boat a look.

Even knowing that, I still play it to each map actively rather than spam.  And even when I spam, it's still fun to see how far you can get and how many resources you can build up to expand your crew or upgrade your weapon/magic when you get back to the boat.			"

												A lot of the game is making matches on a very short timer hoping that you randomly achieve objectives so that the system updates your boat and adds crew.When you finely finish the game asks you to do the exact same thing again on a harder difficulty.You do gain resources that you can use to upgrade your character's attributes but the decisions don't feel like there's a ton of flexibility and the increase in costs basically means that it makes sense to upgrade everything so  you can get enough resources to upgrade everything again.  There isn't really any specialization.			"

I'm not a veteran of the match 3 genre, in fact I generally am pretty bad at it and get frustrated pretty easily.But You Must Build A Boat manages to give you a smooth enough progression and-eventually-enough control on how hard you want your run to be that I found myself enjoying it immensely.Even when I got stuck it wasn't for long since a lucky streak or my upgrades eventually carried me over to the next quest: the pervasive sense of humour also helps to lighten the mood (e.g. why am I looting weird things from chests? why is the ship propelled by jumping up and down?).Overall the game offers a fun experience and really gives a  ""just one more run"" feeling: last but not least you can expect a good 10ish hours of gameplay at a very low price.

												EightyEightGames is quickly becoming one of my favorite developers. 10,000,000 was an excellent fresh idea on some old concepts in a nice fun package. You must build a boat is a sequel of sorts to 10,000,000 with the same dungeon crawling, connect x number puzzle game with very bright and addictive game play plus so very much more without spending an extra dime for it. The panick as you can't find a match while trying to defeat the next enemy so you can get that next upgrade or get to that next level of the dungeon is rewarding and tense. It feels Fun. In a day of♥♥♥♥♥hair waving graphics and novel sized story telling, Fun is a commodity as rare as gold and this game...is Fun. I want to play one more round. I want to get that next upgrade.

												You Must Build A Boat is one of those addicting games you just have to finish, even if you're not really enjoying it anymore. It's even more luck-based than its predecessor, and this time the name of the game is grinding. At first YMBAB felt better than 10,000,000, and while there are some improvements, some of the new mechanics (like traps and overall randomness) were there to just test my ability to avoid throwing my mouse at the wall.Still, I do recommend this, as there's some real enjoyment involved when you've finally finished the last quest and uninstalled the game.

												As many others have said, this game is far to random to be truly fun. Though the ideas behind it - monsters that are vulnerable to certain attacks, chests to unlock, traps to dismantle etc. - are entertaining enough, the time limits and pure randomness of tile drops will often lead to a frantic effort to match anything in the vain hope you'll get what you need on the next drop. This can lead to some 'quests' being completed easily on the first try, whilst others must be attempted tens of times until the tiles fall exactly as needed. This robs the game of much of its fun and what remains is a vexxing exercise in frustration.			"

												This is a great example of why a story should not be forced into a game that does not need a story. 10,000,000 was great without needing a story shoe-horned into it. I only played this for a few minutes, but I already got sick of the constant cutscenes. I've gone back to playing 10,000,000, so my recommendation is to buy 10,000,000 instead.			"

												Match 3 game you can't lose. I am a little torn about liking this game or not as I was trying to match 3 with some care and I didn't do all that well. When I stopped trying to match things and dragged and clicked randomly I improved dramatically.Not that I don't like being rewarded for doing nothing, but I don't know that I will be playing more... except to complete it.So I guess I don't hate it.Love match 3s with really ""retro"" (bad) grahics? Buy this on sale.			"

												10,000,000 was an massively addicting experience and YMBAB is no exception. Although nearly identical in gameplay some additions I liked were the monster crew collecting, dungeon varieties, and overall graphical upgrades. However, some aspects like the dungeon modifiers and special conditions are hardly noticable, the traps are super annoying and the upgrading systems are all seem more random. I'm stuck running a dungeon over and over to grind so I can have a weapon deal over 188 damage in a single attack (that or get an insanely lucky 6-in-a-row or something) In that way, the progression has many more road-blocks and doesn't seem as fun to speed-run. Absolutely grab the original game if you haven't already, and if you're dying for more this game delivers!			"

												Great game from the maker of 10000000. You don't play this game for the graphical fidelity, but it's a simple, very approachable puzzler that is very hard to put down. This game is made to be beaten and made to make you feel good, so pick it up and enjoy it! It's hard not to if you like puzzle games at all.Last thing I'd say is there isn't a ton of strategy apart from getting all of the things the game vendors sell and using it to get to the end. I'm still playing through it and I think I'm about 80% done.			"

It seems like bad design that this can happen. I'm not even saying it has a decent success rate; I'm saying it has a NEARLY FLAWLESS success rate. This game is easier to play with your eyes closed, like bad fighting games where button-mashing is the best strategy. Once I realized this, it became impossible to play the game normally.			"

												You Must Build a Boat (YMBB) is a game of matching 3 tiles in a row, combined with unlockable powers and collection elements to keep you playing.Premise of the game is simple - you have a boat, and your quest is to row it upstream. At each stage, the flow gets stronger and you can only continue by adding more crew to your boat. The crew can be recruited with resources you find in dungeon runs that come in a form of a match-3 game. Run the dungeon often enough and you unlock enough resources to move on to the next stage.It's deceptively simple and addictive. The music helps too.Pros:+ Addictive gameplay+ Easy to learn+ Low costCons:- 8-bit graphics isn't for everyone- Lack of variation in the gameplay			"

The only downside I found to this game is the music, I loved it but over longer sessions I found myself muting it and playing my own, still the gameplay is solid, the new features don't feel forced in and the numerous graphical improvments mixed with the style of the first work perfectly together.

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!I just have time right now to get a quick ""review"" up for people thinking about buying this, especially during the summer sale. I don't think I even have to tell fans of 10000000 but if you liked that game, you will really adore You Must Build A Boat.More story, brighter colors, better sound effects, new power ups, new puzzle elements, and more interesting enemies that you can capture and use to increase your stats. Unlike the drab homebase in 10000000, the boat in this game is more interesting. And fun. Completing the dungeon quests adds things to your boat, like a crew and creatures, more types of vendors,  and more. No longer is our brave heo limited to a life of lonliness. He even dances in his free timeI thought the original 1000000 looked ok in the steam store, but I took a long (too long) time to give it a try. It is a good game. But You Must Build A Boat is more of a party. For those that don't know, this may  look like a ""regular"" match three game, but you can complete matches by sliding columns and rows which adds more strategy to the match three gameplay. Also, the player progress through dungeons by making matches to affect the sidescrolling adventure at the top of the gamescreen and gaining materials and gold and leveling up RPG-ish elements.  And I find it much more fun than Bejeweled. It's not as in depth as Puzzle Quest 2, but again, I had more genuine fun with You Must Build A Boat.All the extra bells and whistles in YMBAB are charming and the music is happy. I'm not afraid to admit that I find myself smiling when I play this game. You MUST Build A Boat!			"

												Very great and simple game for the price. If you like hard games then this is definitely for you. This game is far harder than any other match 3+ type. There is no difficulty controls, only an option to do more than 1 mission at a time which makes it more or less difficult. Even if you do just 1 mission it can still be very hard. It does require some luck to get past. There are areas where you will suddenly need to get 3 in a row of a key and they give you about 2-3 seconds to see it and find it before you get dropped with a trap that will freeze you forcing a restart of the level.The game does an ok job of not making it so frustrating when you fail. If you fail a level you can instantly start it over w/o waiting for any type of loading. You also will gain gold constantly during each fail. If you fail and restart right away you will notice your gold constantly builds up so you can go get stronger to help make it easier. My only real negative is that the first several levels are very very easy and then all of a sudden after you have moved your ship about 2 times it suddenly gets about 10x more difficult. I have been stuck on this one level for a while where I keep dying within 60 seconds and feel like I am making no progress.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun challenging games. It can be very frustrating too or maybe it's just me. I am really good at these type of games, but this one leaves me feeling really stupid at times.			"

												Inspired by TotalBiscuit quick look into the game, I decided to buy it from Steam summer sale 2015. I am a fan of connect-three games and this looked fairly interesting take on the genre so took a stab at it. However, despite the fairly fun looking exterior of the game, you quickly see how bare-bones the actual game mechanics are. Game is so heavily based on luck and after a while it is much better to spam lanes to (hope for) connections. I really dont recommend the game.			"

												YMBAB is a match-three puzzle game which is pimped by elements of rpg. It`s fun for a while but gets monotonous after a while. If there wasn`t this feeling that every choice is interchangeable it would be more fun (buying monsters or upgrades, the items,...). Don´t want to recommend, maybe for fans of match-three games, players of other genres should watch some videos.--------------------------------------------------------YMBAB ist ein klassisches Puzzle-Videospiel im Sinne von ""Candy Crush"" und wie sie alle heißen, also 3 oder mehr Symbole kombinieren. Es wird mit der Zeit aber monoton, weil die Entscheidungen, die man treffen kann, gefühlt nicht wirklich Einfluss auf das Spiel haben. RPG-Elemente wie Schwertaufrüstung, Zauberstabausrüstung,usw. sind nett, aber es bleibt beim bereits beschriebenen Problem. Ich empfehle es den Fans von Puzzle-Videospielen, alle anderen sollten sich erstmal Videos angucken.			"

												took me about 6 hours to finish the game so the ratio with it on sale is roughly 2 hours / 1$ spent. which is good. It was a fun addicting game with near exact gameplay as their previouse title. Pros-on sale value is good, but still decent value if not on sale.-addicting, fast, simple gameplay.-Progression is contant and feels rewarding-reset system upon completeing the game so that you can play through again on a higher difficulty which adds value.Cons-Post reset nothing is changed other than difficulty, would be nice if something changed.-Store page says steam achivements but as of this review nothing is in yet.-Basic gameplay concepts don't change. it's the same throughout leaving something to be desired.-Can be frustrating at times due to RNG. this game is 100% rng and skill is not really invovled as you can't plan ahead for anything. the most strategy invovled is making the decision on weather or not to save or use an item.

 If You Like Match-3 Games... Then buy this game. If you don't, then more than likely, you won't enjoy this game. To me, its fun in short bursts. It is possible to get caught in the ""what comes next"" cycle, and the rpg-lite elements are an added bonus. Basically, its a better version of ""10000000"", which is good, seeing as this is the sequel.Those expecting the ability to customize the boat, to select the occupants, or catch monsters pokémon style...don't. As stated, the main point of the game is to match 3 tiles in a row. Most of the mechanics around that focal point happen passively, or with very little input.I like this game.

												Addictive, and I do not regret my purchase. I bought this after watching TB's video on the game and I really did like it.  Because his video started well into the game, I decided to do a 20 minute gameplay impressions vid to see how I liked it. Short answer: I liked it!Here is my video if your interested:

			You Must Build a Boat is another game from Eighty Eight Games (creators of the popular match 3 RPG 10,000,000). It is a match 3 game with RPG elements.		

I'll update my review once I get more time with the game, but so far so good!			"

												FIrst of all I think it's worth mentioning that I have NOT played 10 million. This game was also the first game that I played with the core gameplay being match 3. If you haven't played 10 million but you want try this one out, don't worry, that will work very well. You Must Build A Boat is a very easy game to get into even if you have never played match 3 games before. The gameplay is very repetitive, so if you don't want to be doing the same thing for around 8 hours (this is how long it took for me to beat the game) then you should look elsewehere. But if that isn't a problem then please try this game out. It's cheap, I very much like the art style and the music is fantastic. Gameplay works very smoothly and when you hit those massive combos accidentaly it truly is the most satisfying thing in the world. Really my only problem with the game is the fact that it's very VERY addictive and also when you start the game again you can't skip the tutorial. So all in all this game is absolutely brilliant for what it is and with the price tag it has you can't go wrong.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a puzzle game.(If you have played 10m (10,000,000) then you do know what to expect from this game.)Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some different resolution sizes available.You can play fullscreen or windowed mode.There are some different languages available.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.About the game.The puzzle concept is still the same as the last one. You will have to make a row of 3 or higher to activate them. Sword and wands blocks are needed to kill enemies. Key blocks are required to open chests and doors. Shield blocks will prevent you from pushing back. Taking an X ammount of damage will break the shield and if you have been pushed all the way to the left side, your run will end. The further you are able to go in a run the more points you will receive. But the run will be alot harder too as you will eventually face against stronger enemies.There are daily challenges.New block which is destroying every crate on the screen.Crew members are able to make your run stronger as they have stats.Alot of fun and it has new effects and items.Has guide and tips about items and monsters.The game has different music compared to the first one. (first one was better).Random difficulty effect after a certain run point.Alot of upgrades available.Less grindy.Other things.There is no No number shield level/Durability vision/indicator (You will only see a small shield infront of the person)-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												Hey guys! Let me just say that YMBAB is an amazing sequel to 10000000! Its the same fun fast-paced tile-matching for survival gameplay with a slick new approach that got me hooked all over again....and yes, the game just gets better from there.Pros:-You get to build a big♥♥♥♥♥boat-Puzzle tile-matching feels even more fast pased than the original-New tiles (Crates!) open attack tiles to help get through mobs faster-More engaging mob activity on the action pane making you have to pay attention to both-You MUST build a boat, you guys-Everything that happens feels awesome-Sound effects are killer and exciting-Small things happen that are interactive that could have been automatic; this makes it more engaging-Tutorial is seamless and actually helpful-Feels good meeting the in-game objectives and unlocking cool stuff-Progression through the map helps break up anything tedious about tile-matching games-Boats are built, and sailed inCons:-Tutorial would be nice to be able to turn off for second playthrough-Doesn't have multiple save option-I want to talk to all the characters on my boat when I unlock them or have them say funny stuff when I walk by randomly-If you are looking for a boat building sim you'll probably not be happyYeah, this game is rockin'. If you have ever enjoyed a tile matching game ever you owe it to yourself to play YMBAB. :DDisclaimer: I was provided a complimentary copy of this game for review purposes however I was not paid for my opinions they are my own.

												Numerous minor issues prevent me from recommending this title.The upgrade vendors for sword/staff/shield show what the upgrade will do... sorta.  Current stats are not displayed prior to committing to an upgrade purchase, and then only briefly.Forcing me to click numerous times to ""get"" the upgrade I just purchased, or to break my loot out of a crate, is mindless busy work, and the exact opposite of fun.  (the swipe right to open a reward chest is... tolerable)The screen shake when selling loot is unnecessary and awful.The artifact that makes matches possible at the start of a run feels like a punishment, not a benefit.  More often than not, it leaves the board thin of matches.  On a related note, the Matterhorn activation is incredibly jarring; the damage hose is nice, I guess, but it disrupts whatever I was trying to do on the grid.Being a tenth of a second off on your timing invalidates whether a match is applied.  The monsters don't have to approach formally and present a Document of Formal Request to Fisticuffs, they just start swinging... why do I?The RNG _does_ feel super capricious.  Just beat a monster, and can see a chest behind him?  LOL, we're gonna throw keys in the right spots to wreck all your easy matches!!!  Hope you weren't planning on gaining ground anytime soon!!!  LOLOLOLOL  Two monsters in a row?  Nah, we're all out of swords and staffs... try back next week.The area progression curve is a right angle.  In spite of all the issues above, I made steady progress until Pagoda... then I slammed into a brick wall titled ""grind for upgrades, nub.""This took three years?  Really?			"

My sole complaint so far is that the crate tiles just don't register to me as valid matches (probably because their design is different), so I waste way too much time staring blankly at a screen completely forgetting that they can be matched with each other.

												I recommend this game if you like a fast-paced straight forward match-three kind of game. Keep in mind though that you won't be matching symbols one by one, but rather matching columns and row. Eventually it still is the same principle.It's well made, with some RPG elements, where you can decide what sort matches will have a stronger impact. The emphasis of the game is about getting stronger, investsing in certain abilities, so you can get farther and face stronger enemies. It's not a relaxing game, as you have to be quick, but once you get a hang of it, it feels good and non-stressing. There is a story, but it is practically non-existent. It's just for the setting's sake. This game is all about the match-3 kind of puzzle. Once you finish it, you can play it on two more harder difficulties, which is nice.			"

You Must Build a Boat really expands on the unique style that 10000000 pioneered in breathing some new life into the genre. With the base-building mechanics and fun gameplay YMBAB has, there is a sense of reward for each frantic round of play that makes this title one of the best puzzle games in years			"

												After putting fifteen hours into the game, and just having beaten it, I can definately recommend ""You Must Build A Boat"" to absolutely everyone.YMBAB is a sequel to the game ""10,000,000"" and plays almost identical to it, in that the game is a combination endless runner/match three puzzle game with light RPG elements. After escaping the castle/dungeon/whatever in the original game, the protagonist now finds himself alone with two monsters on a small rowboat. The idea of the game is to enter a dungeon, complete various tasks and eventually you unlock various merchants, and capture monsters. As you acquire more merchants, your boat magically is expanded to accomodate them, thus the whole time you are building your boat. When you enter a dungeon, your character progresses along the top of the screen, and as he runs into monsters, and chests, and various traps, you match tiles to allow him to progress. It sounds simple, but is quite addicting, especially when you see ""You Win!"" every time you finish, even if you didn't complete your actual objective. That's because each time you get gold and other resources to spend to allow you to get stronger. As for how much you get out of the game, it can come down to a matter of skill. What took me fifteen hours to do may take you less time. But for those of you die hard enough to tackle it, there's a hidden achievement you can only get by beating the game twice, and then going almost to the end a third time to acquire a hidden item. No new game plus here though, as you start over again fresh with the danger and difficulty of the dungeons raised. So yeah, even at full cost you will get your money's worth here. So, what are you waiting for? Get building! "

												TL;DR: YMBAB is a fun game, and is an almost exact remake in many ways of its predicessor, 10,000,000. If you like match 3's generally, you will probably like this.The sequel to 10,000,000, YMBAB Is a fantastic match game/RPG that keeps you on the edge of your seat as go from calmly matching for the best combonations, to a frantic matching anything as you curse the luck you abundantly had 2 games ago when it wasn't needed. An added bonus is the sound track that has that NES ""you are on the last level"" feel... that this is the final run you will have before quitting in victory, or more likely defeat (because who leaves the slots when you are on a streak?) I keep going back, and getting a wonderful ammount of mixed emotions (between hatred and anger), but none towards what I consider a fantastic sequel to a fantastic game. Its just fun.Pro's:Fun, fast paced, you always feel like its a boss fightIt doesn't stray too far from 10,000,000, so if you liked that you will probably like thisGood musicNew Game nightmare modeOverall a fun casual gameplay type that you can play a few matches of, and be done with it.Con's:Will become a grind at points in the gameChallenges become frustrating games of chance, and you can't proceed without completing them (no matter how well you do)The game really hates telling you how strong your bonus stats are, like it said it was giving you an enemy slow ability, and then just lied about it...New game nightmare modeOverall I loved it, beat it, and will probably do that again.

												YOU MUST BUILD A BOAT!Where to start?Matching icons with wrap-around. The pressure is on and before I know it I've been killed by yet another living white dragon. Exactly like ""10,000,000"". Except this time, instead of trying to escape one scene, you've sailing your boat up a long river into multiple scenes.I don't like the upgrade system in this one as much as 10,000,000, but overall I like this game slightly better. You also cannot go back to an easier scene/area in this one as you could in the other.Convinced my girlfriend to play this one with me. At the end of every area the words ""You Must Build A Boat!"" appear huge over the screen. Now it's an inside joke between us.Very fun, quick to learn yet impossible to master. Takes a while, and you'll just be grinding for a while in each area until you earn enough resources/gold to unlock and upgrade your way to the end. But don't grind too hard because if you complete the final mission you'll move on to a harder scene and you could screw yourself over.If you want a fun puzzle game, dungeon crawler-esque, with terribly-awesome 8-bit-esque graphics, look no further. I got both this and ""10,000,000"" in a Humble Bundle, but I would not recommend buying both. One or the other is good.7/10 Would play to the end, but not much replay value.			"

												Great game.  More or less its a Match 3 game with rpg/rogue like elements thats on meth.  Goal is to build a boat, you do this by grinding dungeons in which you run across mobs and you can match physical attacks ""swords"" or magical attacks ""staffs"".  Different mobs have different weaknesses and the game makes it pertty easy to find out what they are via a guy on your boat. you ""win/lose"" when you get knocked off the lefthand side of the screen or when the screen catches up to you. Gota make the matches fast and have the board set up to deal with that ever comes at you next.You also have to deal with different traps which can be disarmed by matching the tiles that are being carried by the trap.The game also has a pokemon style monster collection system in which unlocking/buy of monsters gives you power ups.Music is great, upbeat old school midi feel thats very catchy.Graphics are great, If you enjoy pixel art.If you enjoyed 10000000 then you will enjoy this. More of the game but better in everyway that I can think of.			"

												Great game. I had a lot of fun and played through multiple times. By the end, I felt connected with all the members of the ship. It's a match-3 game that rewards speed over combos. So if you're slow, you may feel frustrated in the late game. My advice to you is get it for Android. I find it easier with swipe gestures. Mouse feels like a handicap in comparison.			"

												Surprisingly fun. I hate candy crush type match games, but this added enough elements to make it interesting to me. Combat, building yourself up, this feels like a variant of an RPG. It needs a stats screen so you can see all the things you've levelled up, spells, weapons etc...I haven't played 10,000,000 but I would after having played this. I think there will be a successor to this, and I'm intrigued to see how the game develops. It could yet become a deeper and more complex game.			"

												This game is very boring and frustrating. It's a match-3 but hardly gives you the tiles you want to match to progress. I can't count the times I sat on a board matching arms and brains and keys, hoping one of either of the attack tiles showed up. Three runs in a row I couldn't get past the first enemy because my damn board was full of keys! Also, a nitpicky point, but why put ""YOU MUST BUILD A BOAT"" in shaking letters if you aren't going to put any sound to it? This happens every time you add a crew member and it is jarring to lose all sound. Weird design choice.I cannot recommend this game. Save your money for a better match-3, Ironcast being a better alternative.			"

												Disclaimer: I was given early access to help test the game on Steam & Android.  It's also available on iOS. If you haven't played 10 000 000 you should go play that first, it's awesome (  ).  This game continues where 10M left off - You Must Build A Boat!  A Match 3 game AND a sort of dungeon crawler.  You slide the tiles instead of swapping them. Every match you complete gives you something. Possibilities are:Sword attacksStaff (magic) attacksShieldsKeys to open treasure chestsStrength & Knowledge for yourself (they are a currency)Crates that might contain consumable items, and the items themselves remain on the playing field!Progress by completing the wide variety of quests (kind of feels like achievements) during runs, and upgrading all your stuff in between runs with Gold, Strength, Dust, and Knowledge.  Tons of fun, at least 4/5.			"

												This is a strange, unique puzzle RPG that is as thrilling as it is frustrating. At times I think the game is broken because you won't get any blocks that you can use so you're just stuck starting that section over. It's painful when you see the block you need but the run ends just as you are moving it. The final area is particularly maddening. Regardless, it's worth playing.			"

It's fun, but feels far too luck based just to make progression, and it can feel extremely grindy at times. You can feel yourself gradually improve, but it's not nearly as addicting as Bejewelled or another match-three, and at least those games don't have the facade of depth.			"

												This game is a sequel of sorts to 10million, but it is worse, not better.  The eponymous boat is full of pixels.  They are hard to keep straight and discern where to go to upgrade equipment, and most of them are monsters that just clutter up the space.  It all doesn't fit on the screen, making it a pain to go on another run, having to click somewhere to move the screen in order to be able to click where you want.  The music is really annoying.  Success has more to do with luck than skill since many times there are traps that have to be defeated with matching items that are not on the screen.  I bought both YMBAB and 10M for about seven bucks, so it's not a tragedy, but I recommend buying one or the other, certainly not both.			"

Or in some other words, this game is an example using artifical-difficulty to increase the playtime( I.E. it's by design it takes far too much time to even hope progressing in this game, not due the lack of player-abilities).------You can find some more details in the full-article here:https://docs.google.com/document/d/18TF-_7UjmVCNGFC91W5ESyouM5jLWxaoedY0iCGF5mE/---------			"

												A step backward from its predecessor '10000000', this game should have been called 9999999.This game feels less like you are building a boat, and more like you are sawing trees to gather endless logs for a boat (that you never get to build - because endless logs). At first the seeming storyline or theme of building the boat seemed promising, but the lackluster and grinding gameplay, gimmicky UI, and absence of any connection of theme to the objectives and progression, makes for the perfect storm and capsized the game to unsalvageable depths. This is one Steam key that I will be tossing into Davey Jones' locker.			"

But you're basically just sorting like tiles.  If you want to sort tiles, this game will deliver with more tile sorting than your body has room for.  If you're looking for something other than bejeweled,  you will be disappointed.  I was not looking to sort tiles, so I will count myself as disappointed.Also it has nothing to do with building a boat.			"

												Disclaimer: one of two review copies recieved from the developer. The other was an iOS code, which has been played longer than this one.It's everything 10000000 was, but better. The biggest and bestest difference is that you can keep making matches while new tiles are dropping, which is perfect for such a fast-paced game (and it is very fast-paced). If you're unfamiliar with the previous game, it's a dungeon runner/match-3 hybrid, one of the best match-3/other hybrids I've played. I would recommend You Must Build A Boat over 10000000 if you haven't played either yet.Read my full review on  IndieGames.com. [indiegames.com] "

So I'll just put down the thoughts that I feel are most relevant to my gaming experience:Fast Pros:- Good ""party"" atmosphere- Great scene transitions- Fun interactions like sliding open chests and breaking boxes- More atmospheric/graphical/musical variety- Vastly improved ""assist"" functionality when sliding/matching tilesFast Cons:- Compartmentalized into 30-90 second play sessions (grr....)- So fast and aggressive it borders on panicky- Music too urgent and stressful- Too much clutter and visual BS on boat screen- Needless complexity in non-gameplay areasBottom line: Way more arcade-y than it's predecessor.  I don't feel good when I play this game, I feel really stressed.  There is no time for strategy because it is pedal-to-the-metal or you stand no chance of beating the level objectives.			"

												I'm sorry, but the ""puzzle"" aspect is a little ridiculous... When the game is as fast paced as it is, the puzzle that allows you to actually do stuff during a un also needs to be able to let you get the right stuff at the right time, as quickly as possible. I've barely played the game and I can garuntee you that the current puzzle system does not function to what it needs to be. You will CONSTANTLY find yourself trying to use the right thing, but because of how the ""board"" is generated and how it works, you'll have to match up something completely useless in hopes of getting something you need.Basically: Puzzle doesn't work, infuriating design.

												First of all, I genuinely think this game has potential and is creative. A friend of mine gave it to me as a gift knowing I was a fan of puzzle quest and I dove right in. What I discovered was a lesson in frustration that quickly devolved into the firm opinion I wasn't having any fun. The RPG aspects, great. The music is phenominal. The gameplay itself is garbage sadly. 50% of my matches I quit and restart because RNG gave me such poor drops there's literally nothing to do but break useless objects with the hope something I need will come up, which usually doesn't. Upgrades have little impact unless I want to just grind and grind, which might be ok if I could formulate a strategey or patterns but that ugly RNG rears its head again, screwing the player over at every opportunity. Like it or not, the game replaces difficulty and tact with a classic ""cheapness"" factor I thought we all left alone in the dark ages of the 8 bit era and I won't be recommending this to my friends.

It's certainly the more easily accessible one of the two.			"

												Worse gamplay, better overall. They removed the item system which i really enjoyed from the originial. Being able to hoard and safed gaurd certain items for when the puzzle becomes stagnant was a major plus for me and is sadley missing from this version. The chest tile is no longer there either so no matching chests in the hope of getting an item that you need. Both have been replaced with tiles on sreen that can be clicked that do something such as food, shoot a fireball etc. Upgrade system and overall aesthetic is better and the variety of monsters and their strengths and weaknesses has been improved, aswell as an improvement to the upgrade system. I hate the trap mechanic. Hate. It is such a devastating negative effect for something which has very little to do with player skill. Either i have the 3 tiles on board which it wants or i get punished. I can try and clear other tiles in hopes it turns up but  either way im still being punished for the randomness of the board. If it had a number of tiles needed to be cleared that would be better. Overall it felt like more of a grind, I was more dependant on the boards layout and was constantly getting stuck with no way of clearing up the board or worse getting frozen from traps making it just frustrating for me. 7/10, original was 8.

												Initially I didn't like this game.  Every time I got a bit better at matching the tiles, I went to a new, more difficult area so I had no real feeling of getting better.However, I ended up liking this game for relaxing when I got home from work and couldn't decide immediately what I wanted to do.  The snapping noises of matching the tiles and the popping of boxes is actually one of my favorite parts.Being able to play this for just 5 minutes at a time is something that really made me like this game and I would recommend it for its affordable price.I definitely got more than $5 of entertainment out of it.

												A worthy follow-up to 10000000.  One of the few games where I made sure to 100% the achievements.  Going through the story mode will take ~7.5 hours, and around ~25 hours to get all the achievements.Pros:- Lots more to do.- Building the boat is a more obvious form of player advancement than the counter in 10000000.- Plenty of hidden extras all over the place.  (Black dragon in the art gallery, for example)- You can always make a match, so failure is (almost) always your fault.Cons:- Sometimes when you find a crate, you'll have none of the tiles you need on board, so you'll be frantically matching while you slide off into oblivion.  Can get frustrating at higher levels.- Can get frustrating when random level modifiers boost enemies in unfair ways.- The UX is a bit of a step back in some ways.  The game seems to have been designed for touch, and you'll often do something and be left with an item on screen with no clue that you're supposed to just click the living crap out of it.  The busywork clicking is annoying and out-of-place with the rest of the game.- When you restart at a higher difficulty, you have to redo the tutorial.  The developer said on Twitter that fixing this is on his TODO list.			"

												Well now.For those who enjoy highly casual gaming of the likes of Bejewelled or Candy Crush - this one you'll enjoy.And Those that have played 10 000 000 and liked it, will definitely enjoy this sequel as well. If it seems like more of the same, you are right, but there have been made some changes to the successful formula to keep you interested.Quirky and simple and enjoyable although it has some rough spots where the whole thing becomes a very 'grinding' experience until you can reach the next level.Nevertheless there is enough to do, collect, discover, for this to make it a pleasant gaming experience.

												If you're familiar with or have played and enjoyed 10,000... you'll also like this game. Same match three concept.You Must Build A Boat has more ""overworld"" to manage - with multiple upgrades, shops, the addition of a monster recruitement system, junk collector and rare artifact merchant. As you progress, you build your tiny dinghy into a shipworthy vessel. It feels more rewarding to progress in YMBAB because of how you can physically see your ship becoming bigger, but I do prefer the simplistic play style of 10,000. It might also be my imagination, but this game poses a bit more of a challenge than 10,000 did. So far, I've also put more game time into it and the game seems much longer. Very difficult to screw up a game as simple as this - I can't think of a single reason not to play this game. A great way to pass the time, highly addictive, very easy.. but surprisingly satisfying.			"

												I love this game. I had not played 10.000.000 so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But what a game! Its short, only like 6 hours of gameplay with some replayability if you are the kind of person who wants to keep running over and over, harder and harder... But that does not really matter, I loved the characters, loved the concept and the idea of matching three in a row to get your hero through the various locations that the game has to offer, and I loved to see the boat getting bigger and bigger.I found it to be a very well balanced game, where the quests and the runs you have to do to complete the quests scale nicely with your ability to see the combinations on the board. I enjoyed every minute of the 6 hours I played this, even though I got stuck at some points. The random factors that occur when you replay a level keep it interesting and challenging.For me, this is the best game I have played all year (so far..) and that for only 3€! I would have happily paid 10€ for this, it is that good.The music is amazing but limited to two songs and I garantee you they will get stuck in your head and you will find yourself humming the tune in the supermarket when trying to race old ladies to the line at the cash register...I made a short video about the start of this game here, if you are interested:

												This is the kind of game I like to call a ""bored game"". Play this if you're bored. Technically all match-3 games fall into this category for me, unless they have some intricate plot. This game is especially good at pulling you out of boredom, since apart from the match-3 board it also has this sidescrolling segment that you have to pay attention to. I don't usually even have to look at Bejeweled anymore and I still win, but this game wants me to pay attention. That's good, I like that a lot. What I don't like is the somewhat ridiculous difficulty at some points, though I guess it's okay if you have infinite continues... I wouldn't recommend this game to people who are looking for a challenge, but I do recommend it to those who need a new ""bored game"" in their library.			"

												I didn't play it's predecessor, but heard a lot of good about it. After seeing the review on Rock Paper Shotgun, I grabbed it pretty quickly.Combines match 3 and continuous runner type games, while adding another layer of progress tracking on top with improving the boat.Very addictive, ""just one more run"" quality. The environments, monsters, and secrets were all enjoyable.Pretty light fare, not very deep game. Definitely requires attention and speed during the runs, but it's not something that occupied my mind (strategizing, I should have done that differently) while I wasn't playing it.			"

												A tile sliding 3-match puzzle game with RPG elements, and is a direct sequel to 10,000,000.The base mechanics are similar but there are changes to the tiles and how weapons and items work. Instead of repairing a dungeon you are building a boat that will carry you and your monster buddies to freedom.While still in a retro 8-bit style, it feels like the graphics are a little crisper and the movement of the tiles is a little less wonky than the original. So improvements there.Overall if you enjoyed 10,000,000 or if you're a fan of match-3 games in general, you will enjoy this.			"

Now you got multiple locations to run, more upgrades, crew and monsters to collect etc.At core your character runs through a dungeon and you must match three tiles of either keys, swords, wands, shields etc. in the lower area to progress. If you’re pushed out of the screen by losing time or getting hit you have to restart the dungeon but keep the collected materials, rewards, items etc.Extremely addicting gameplay, playable for five minutes at a time and low priced.Recommended for fans of the first game, match-3 and RPG fans.

												It's considerably satisfying, to be honest.It may not look like much, lasts about 6 hours but you can surely have a blast for 1 run.

You have to complete a certain challange in order to unlock the monster you are about to pay for to get into your crew and then go to the ""trainer"" dude/chick and buy it.It has its moments. You got this ""HammerHorn"" which fills up every time you take damage and when it reaches its peak it summons to battle all of the crew you have gathered so far and it leaves a really satisfying feel after you saw your comrades mow down 3 Boss enemies in 3 seconds.Bought it for 3 euros, played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it till the end.

												Very enjoyable at its price point, it's a great successor to 1,000,000. The gameplay is a simple match-3 with an RPG twist. The game gimmick is that instead of exchanging the place of two tiles, you slide entire rows to create matches.The 8bit tune is very catchy and the writing (well, that little that is there) is pretty funny. At the end of the day, for what it costs, it's an excellent past time!			"

												This is a pretty good matching game! Instead of matching tiles, you must match tiles within rows or columns. While that's going on, you have an adventurer delving into a dungeon, which demands specific matches at times, so this makes for a frantic game sometimes!It's one fault is that it's clearly made for a tablet, so there are times outside of the match game where you're meant to click repeatedly on a crate or slide something across the screen. The fault is that it's not indicated anywheres that you have to hammer down on the icon. Other than that, it's pretty simple and well done.			"

Overall it felt like more of a grind, I was more dependant on the boards layout and was constantly getting stuck with no way of clearing up the board or worse getting frozen from traps making it just frustrating for me. 7/10, original was 8.

												Initially I didn't like this game.  Every time I got a bit better at matching the tiles, I went to a new, more difficult area so I had no real feeling of getting better.However, I ended up liking this game for relaxing when I got home from work and couldn't decide immediately what I wanted to do.  The snapping noises of matching the tiles and the popping of boxes is actually one of my favorite parts.Being able to play this for just 5 minutes at a time is something that really made me like this game and I would recommend it for its affordable price.I definitely got more than $5 of entertainment out of it.

												Tile-matching, base building game. It's a very bare bones oldschoool arcade-y type of thing. You must build a boat by recruiting dudes from dungeons that you must go through via tile matching, that gets progressively harder. the difficulty curve is quite high between 1 and 2 choosable quests that give rewards and simultaneously make the level harder. th eproblems I had were with the aforementioned difficulty system involving quests, and the fact that the tiles aren't very vividly coloured, so the obvious connections don't really stand out amidst the dark tunnels of the dungeons you spelunk through.tl;dr: good, arcade-y tilematcher, a bit hard and tile colours dull.

												I love this game. It's cute and silly and extremely addictive. The difficulty ramps up smoothly, in a way that's always challenging but doesn't make me want to throw things. The characters and commentary are fun. It's not a fancy game but It has really charmed me and I've played through 3 times already despite not planning on playing past the first go-round.

												I've been playing videogames since 1982 and I must say I'm very very much impressed. This game has everything, kickass soundtrack (never boring), fun sounds, great sprites and characters, and an extremely simple concept very well executed. It has humor, excitement, items, gold, sacrifices to please the gods to put the odds in your favor, you name it, it's in there. If you really like games, you owe it to yourself to play this. Doesn't matter what kind of genre you prefer, if you are a gamer in the true sense of the word (not someone who jacks off on frame rates and such) you'll love this game.			"

												You Must Build a Boat, or YMBAB, has a very similar concept and gameplay to the first game 10,000,000. In YMBAB, you have to link 3 of a kind in at grid box, by movint either a column or row, by clicking and moving the row or column. There are different kinds of blocks, namely: swords, staffs, shields, keys, crates, strong arms, and brains. You can also get items that drop and can be used along the way as well. The more in a row you link, the better the result. Using these blocks you have kill creatures and open chest to proceed through the 'dungeon'. At you home base/boat, you are able to upgrade these blocks or tiles, to enhance them, as well as being able to buy monsters to help you along the way. The main difference from the first game is the monsters, as well as the horn that allows the monsters to help you in the dungeon,  by stampeeding anything in their way. The horn is not triggered by the player, but rather has a bar that builds up until it is used. I have had lots of fun playing both this one and the first game, and it is a nice game to just enjoy as you kill everything in your path. "

												There are good and bad parts of this game.  The overall, however, is mostly good.Pros:-Retains the more complex match-three style of its predecessor, while adding new things such as traps, and new items to use while running the dungeon.-Has a monetary system, which allows for more choices in how you customize your run.-Actually has a tutorial run which explains what things are, and how to go about using them, without being too annoying about it.Cons:-Once you've beaten the game, and begin the hard mode, you must go through the tutorial once again.  It's not as helpful the second time.-The ship is huge, and the vendors move around each time you upgrade.  Finding them can be a little annoying sometimes, especially with a million monster crew members in the way.Overall, worth the buy if you enjoyed 10,000,000.			"

												This is the kind of game I like to call a ""bored game"". Play this if you're bored. Technically all match-3 games fall into this category for me, unless they have some intricate plot. This game is especially good at pulling you out of boredom, since apart from the match-3 board it also has this sidescrolling segment that you have to pay attention to. I don't usually even have to look at Bejeweled anymore and I still win, but this game wants me to pay attention. That's good, I like that a lot. What I don't like is the somewhat ridiculous difficulty at some points, though I guess it's okay if you have infinite continues... I wouldn't recommend this game to people who are looking for a challenge, but I do recommend it to those who need a new ""bored game"" in their library.			"

												This game, despite its odd name, is a sequel to 10,000,000, which came out a couple years ago on Mobile and PC. On a micro level, it's pretty much exactly the same game with as few minor changes. The first is that some of the match-3 icons have changed. Staves, Swords, Keys and shields remain, and do the same things as before. Crates have changed in that they now drop items on the board (rather into discrete item slots off to the side), while Stone and Gold have changed to Power and Mind icons. You will now gain gold from opening treasure chests in your runs, and selling loot afterwards.The other change in the game is the end goal. In 10,000,000, you are presented with a simple goal - score 10,000,000 points in a single run. In You Must Build a Boat, your objective is to finish every quest in the game. You will go from location to location, moving to the next after you complete every quest in a location. Quests are similar to those in 10,000,000 - kill X enemy before he hits you, open 5 chests in a run, etc. These differences are largely trivial, however, as the game plays out pretty much exactly the same in the end. The final quest requires you to go on a solid long run with a powered-up character, more or less in line with the point goal in the last game.The presentation is a little nicer, but the view gets very cluttered as you increase the size of your boat and add NPCs to it. The other main negative I'd point out is that some of the art on the tiles looks pretty bad, and the crates take a long time to get used to seeing on the board and matching. Other than that it's a solid game and a worthy follow-up to the excellent 10,000,000. "

												#YMBAB is the sort of game that catches you by surprise. I bought this on sale for two or three dollars expecting something I would play for five minutes and then never touch again, but I found myself coming back to it constantly until I had beaten the game. I enjoyed it so much that I even bought it for Android so I could play it on the go. Not much replayability though, because it's tedious and rather boring to have to redo challenging quests. However, on your first playthrough, all the quests seem very challenging, but as your skill increases and you buy upgrades, they'll feel like a breeze. The soundtrack is amazing, memorable, and very catchy, but outrageously repetitive.  Would have liked new music for each area. Overall, good for 8 hours of fun. 7.5/10 big macs			"

Now you got multiple locations to run, more upgrades, crew and monsters to collect etc.At core your character runs through a dungeon and you must match three tiles of either keys, swords, wands, shields etc. in the lower area to progress. If you’re pushed out of the screen by losing time or getting hit you have to restart the dungeon but keep the collected materials, rewards, items etc.Extremely addicting gameplay, playable for five minutes at a time and low priced.Recommended for fans of the first game, match-3 and RPG fans.

												Very enjoyable at its price point, it's a great successor to 1,000,000. The gameplay is a simple match-3 with an RPG twist. The game gimmick is that instead of exchanging the place of two tiles, you slide entire rows to create matches.The 8bit tune is very catchy and the writing (well, that little that is there) is pretty funny. At the end of the day, for what it costs, it's an excellent past time!			"

												This is a pretty good matching game! Instead of matching tiles, you must match tiles within rows or columns. While that's going on, you have an adventurer delving into a dungeon, which demands specific matches at times, so this makes for a frantic game sometimes!It's one fault is that it's clearly made for a tablet, so there are times outside of the match game where you're meant to click repeatedly on a crate or slide something across the screen. The fault is that it's not indicated anywheres that you have to hammer down on the icon. Other than that, it's pretty simple and well done.			"

												A great Match-3 Puzzle RPG. Your character will constantly be running right(east) on top of the screen. You match swords and staffs to damage enemies, match keys to unlock chests and get gold, match brains/muscles for intellect/power(used later), and shields for armor. When you get pushed off screen, which is done by taking to long between actions and/or being hit by enemies, your run end. You get sent back to the Hub Screen, which is a ship that gets bigger as you progress.If you've played 10,000,000, then much of whats offered in You Must Build a Boat is the same, but greatly improved upon and there's still plenty of new stuff. If you enjoyed 10,000,000 and/or Puzzle/RPG's, then You Must Build a Boat is a must have.			"

												I expected more out of this sequel to 10,000,000... I expected to be able to move from place to place by my own design. I thought I would be building something. But those are just mandatory, irreversible and un-customizable badges of level progression.This game is a graphical upgrade. It does have more content. It does run smoother. But I found the insincere ""You Win!"" after every run, the stretched, unskippable mini-cutscenes, the insipid tutorial, the shallowness of play, too distracting to notice the things it made better... Until I went back to the original and found I really couldn't enjoy that anymore either.I had hoped it would be so much more. It could have been so much more, if it was presented differently. Perhaps if it took some of the moments it spent intrducing pixel paper people with shallow and meaningless one-liners and used it instead to contextualize our search for the legendary artifacts that can allow us to build, not just a boat, but a FLYING SHIP.In my heart of hearts, I am disappointed.

With every reward (which is practially every run) comes an exploding box, clickable crate or draggable key to unlock with, which feels extremely rewarding.Far more structured than the last game with a lot more flavour and interactivity, so far there have been no negative points to mention over its predecessor.

												This game is so much fun. I play it pretty much every day.it's a basic match 3 game with extras. You move down a hallway and run into monsters and chests. As you get hit you are pushed back, and as time passes you move back. You match weapons and keys to continue. You can also match brains and muscles to gain points to unlock other things. You have to complete quests like ""kill an orc"" or ""hit an enemy for 80 or more damage"" or ""gain 30 thought in one run"". You can match crates to have spells and items appear, like food which lets you move forward in the hallway or spells which have different effects like freezing or damage.   There are some hidden monsters to unlock, and once you finish the game you can restart at a higher difficulty. I play on my iPad and have gotten to level 12 difficulty. It's a great time waster, and I can't wait for the developers next release. Also, see their previous game ""10,000,000"" which is very similar to this one.			"

												tough, but im going to have to say no to a recommendation.- inconsistant difficulty, mainly due to random nature.- not all concepts translate well to non-touch screens.- music is too damn catchy!- have stopped having fun, but want to press forward just to finish it.Lots of box types, vast majority are useless when facing an obstacle. So many boxes are broken and wasted in between obstacles. Some sections took me 15mins to clear, others took me over 2 hours of gameplay because of the difficulty and slim chances of the planets aligning to make the objective possible to complete.			"

												This is a sequel to 1,000,000, building out on the leveling and RPG aspects while keeping the gameplay the same.  Which means you will continue to face frantic strategic match-three gameplay, as you try to make useful matches when encountering obstacles to be enemies and open chests. It's amazing how well the concept works; it really does feel like an action game more than a puzzle game, though it serves both purposes. It's not easy,  but the expanded options and purchases do give you a better shot, it seems. I was stuck on the last section for at least an hour (just not quite fast enough), and there's lots more replayability (you collect monsters, and several take special situations to get - I missed at least a half dozen in my playthrough). It's a weird mix of game styles, but it's very good at what it does.			"

												It's an interesting, yet satisfying, twist on the old-school tile matching games. As you go on adventures and complete quests, you will find ship crew, monsters to hire, and gold bonuses for upgrade. You use the gold and sometime silver to upgrade your staff, sword, and shield. Some monsters are resistant to certain things and some monsters are vulnerable to them. It has some smooth 8-bit graphics with some music that doesn't overpower the visuals. A nice little game for only $4.99. It only lasts a few hours at most, but it is an enjoyable few hours, I'll give it that.			"

												This is the kind of game I like to call a ""bored game"". Play this if you're bored. Technically all match-3 games fall into this category for me, unless they have some intricate plot. This game is especially good at pulling you out of boredom, since apart from the match-3 board it also has this sidescrolling segment that you have to pay attention to. I don't usually even have to look at Bejeweled anymore and I still win, but this game wants me to pay attention. That's good, I like that a lot. What I don't like is the somewhat ridiculous difficulty at some points, though I guess it's okay if you have infinite continues... I wouldn't recommend this game to people who are looking for a challenge, but I do recommend it to those who need a new ""bored game"" in their library.			"

												This builds on the 10,000,000 game with new resources, better game play, more level types and new monsters.  The biggest improvement on 10 million is probably the ability to make matches even whilst the tiles are still falling into place.  This means the painful days of waiting for the tiles to finish moving are over!Similar to 10m, there isn't much storyline but there are plenty of secrets to discover!As you progress up the river, your boat will get bigger, you'll collect more monsters, upgrade your weapons, discover more shop keepers etc etc  There are items you can pick up on the board with various different effects, some are weapons, some destroy loads of tiles on the board, some give you a little more time).  There are lots of different levels with different designs and monsters and there are also traps which you have to avoid by matching the right tiles.If you liked 10m, you'll like this game.  It's a faster paced version of 10m with a lot more content.Also, if you haven't played 10m, you don't have to in order to play this game, so don't worry about that			"

												An interesting twist on the Match 3 gameplay style, with an addictive just-one-more-run feel to it plus RPG-lite progression.  I think his previous game, 10000000, may be a little stronger, but this is still a fun, addictive game.			"
