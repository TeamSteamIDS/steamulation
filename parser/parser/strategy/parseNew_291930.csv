												Updated.The good: You can manage a business with multiple industries, reasonably quick to learn, achievements give skill points that can be used for upgrades, average.The bad: Glosses over a lot of detail (micromanagement), extremely repetitive, minimal sense of accomplishment or reward, automation is sub par, game feels cheap.This game could have been a lot more.  Sadly it's a lackluster title that will merely wet your appetite for an industry simulator that we've all been craving.  It's worth closer to $10-15.  Would recommend Cities in Motion 2 or Euro Truck Simulator 2 for a better executed experience.			"

												Hours Played Disclaimer: I accidentally left the game idle overnight during the tutorial, so the hours played is inaccurate.I am writing this, and I am still very early game in freeplay mode. Keep in mind I have played city and business sims before. IE offers an extensive tutorial that will introduce you to its mechanics. This game seems to be very detailed and nuanced in terms of its gameplay mechanics. You not only make larger choices about where to place buildings, but you hand-pick the number and type of trucks needed to deliver your goods; different trucks transport different goods. You will also need to maintain your vehicles as time goes on. Also, you can actually determine the shape of the land you purchase for development, as well as the location of buildings within a given plot. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are serviceable and get the job done. So far, I haven't run into any bugs or problems of note. I'll update this impression once I get more gametime under my belt.Update: The various information panels available are acutually useful and helpful. As vets of the genre know, this is not always the case with this kind of game.Your primary source of income will be from fulfilling orders for various products. You will need to deliver the products on time in order to avoid a penalty for late delivery. The game ends if you run out of money. However, you can get a limited number of loans (six, I think) from the bank. It looks like the game has two gameplay modes: freeplay and scenarios. At launch, there are six different scenarios for you to choose from, which place in charge of varying industries at different stages of development. While the scenarios seem somehwhat interesting, I think most gamers will want to go for freeplay option.  Overall, I recommend this game. I know there are concerns about the the developer's past releases, but I decided to take the plunge, and I am enjoying myself so far.Update 7/31:  Still enjoying the game overall. Pick-up and delivery of goods are made instantly once a truck arrives at a given destination. It looks like the early game is limited to farming, and you will gain access to diffirent techonologies and industries as the game progresses. The game can drag a bit at regular speed when waiting for production of various goods to hit a desired level, but you can speed-up time to compensate. One minor issue I have run into is the awkwardness of knowing how big the next plot you're going to buy needs to be in order to accomodate a given building. Right now, you have to go into the Buildings menu select the building and look at it's footprint; then you have click on the Land menu and draw out the plot based on your memory of said footprint. This isn't so bad when you're placing one or two buildings, but it can become a bit of a challenge when you're doing more. It's not a dealbreaker, but it is annoying. If you want to mine, you can order a geological survery that will tell you the size of given deposits in an area, and I wish there were something similar available for setting up water plants. There doesn't appear to to be a water table that tells you what areas of the map have more water than others, and this is a feature I really liked in the latest SimCity. Currently, it seems like you can just plop a water plant anywhere, and it will produce the same amount of water. Workers become available instantly when you build residences and request a given number, so there's no gradual build-up of the population like in other games. This may not be realistic, but it does allow you get facilities up and running sooner since you don't have to wait for workers to become available once requested. Their travel to and from work is not simulated either.  I still haven't encountered any major bugs or crashes. I'll update these impressions again soon.Update 7/31 #2: Okay, after playing the game for a while on Freeplay, I would still recommend this title for fans of the genre. If you are trying to choose between IE and the latest Sim City, however, I would go for Sim City, as it's prettier and, perhaps, more streamlined and refined in some of its gameplay elements. Some folks have been reporting lag spikes and sluggish gameplay.  I really haven't had any problems in those regards. All of the game features I have tried have worked as one would expect. The bottom line IMHO is that this is a competent entry into the city building genre, but it could use a facelift and some subtle improvements  to make  it even better. Perhaps the price tag should be a bit lower given these issues, but this is a generally robust simulation that seems to offer a solid foundation for some good fun. If you're on the fence, wait and see if and how the devs respond  to suggetions and complaints.			"

												I bought this game very early on and have been patiently waiting for the developers to patch it up to an enjoyable level ever since. And all of this time, I've been nothing but supportive and hopeful, waiting for this to occur. But now, I've finally thrown in the towel and decided it's time to call this donkey for what it is.All you really have to do is go to the forums and you'll quickly see other peoples' reasons for dissatisfaction with this game. But speaking for myself, the worst aspect of the game is that has an economic model that creates orders/demand for you to start a business, then dries up those orders to ZERO unless you open other businesses (with different products) to develop the surrounding towns to create more demand for your original product. Sound ridiculous? It is. For example, you go from building a successful egg producing business to suddenly, zero demand (due to no one in the world eating eggs anymore because their town is too small, apparently). It takes all of the positive, enjoyable parts of the game, wads it up, lights it on fire, and throws it out the window. Have you ever heard of a business game ""on rails""?I don't know if I've ever even written a negative review on Steam. But, my level of frustration and disappointment in this game has led me for this to be my first. Is this the worst game ever made? No, but it completely misses the mark of creating an enjoyable progression of building your business to be what you want it to be (which to me, is the point of game like this, Railroad Tycoon, etc...). This game is SUCH a missed opportunity and the developers seem to be oblivious and completely disengaged. Not a good way to run your uh...  business. So, save yourself the frustration and do not buy this game.			"

												When negative reviews outnumber positive ones, I avoid the game like it was spoiled fruit. This time I went against the majority and bought the game. They have listed so much wrong I thought can't be true.  I should have taken the $30 and bought a hammer to hit myself in the head with.  Frustrating, mega-micromanagement,  and no hope for fixes to the basic mechanics of the game,  Next time I buy the hammer,  You should spend your money elsewhere			"

												BROKEN as can be!  Does not install properly, requiring you to find and install a specific version of DirectX and PhysX, must be run as administrator (also during install), must change GFX card config to abnormal settings (which will break other games if not changed back first), must run at low-quality audio on your soundcard, cannot use anything above 16-bit 44.1kHz (CD-Quality), which is shamefully poor with today's common 24-bit or at least 16-bit 192kHz, and i've literally never seen a game that can't downsample-  it requires you to nerf and reconfigure your whole system just to run it.  Then, once you've done ALL THAT, you will STILL find that it crashes to desktop constantly.  In-game features such as auto-scheduling product deliveries are broken (they ONLY work if ALL the goods are available at the very moment of the order, at ONE location, AND can fit on ONE truck... which will never happen.)To top it all off, their support seems to think all these problem are 'okay' and 'normal' for games 'these days'.  They're deluded and insane.This could have been a nice game, but the incredibly poor compatability with standard computers, lack of configureability, ineffective patches, haphazard coding, poor performance, and dismissive support attitude are all enough to make this a truly awful, painful experience that is more frustrating than it's worth for a medeocre and seemingly unfinished game with few original elements to a genre with only a half dozen entries!  Really, they couldn't do ANYTHING new?  The strange lack of development in many areas (such as the fact the only source of power in this world is, apparently, solar?) and clunky interface (you can't 'back out' of some 'draw' menus and must switch menus to get back to normal click-to-interact modes) just... ugh.Consider this game a painful basket of lessons being learned by an indie developer.  Hopefully they can add some real content, fix the interface, and for the love of GOD get it working within some modicum of basic computer gaming standards... then, maybe they'd have a good little game.  But as it stands?2.5 out of 10.  Go play Capitalism 2 instead.Also, just a note.  It has crashed to desktop 19 times in the 90 minutes i've been 'playing' it.  Oh, but I can run Minecraft for 8 hours without one crash?They just didn't even try to make this thing stable.IF you really need help or are unlucky enough to have bought it, and are one of the people (see:  most) who can't even get it to run, please feel free to send me a message on Steam and i'll try to walk you through all the many steps to make your computer compatible.  But.. it's not really worth it, and you have to undo it to get most /other/ games to work.			"

												This game plays like the heart and soul of Industry Giant 2 and Transport Tycoon. You build industry around a map after buying land and produce in a 'unit per hour' style to then sell to cities which, depending on population, have needs. You build truck hubs to send out trucks to pick up goods and deliver all over the map. Even if you've found this style of gameplay fun, there are some significant drawbacks to this particular title.The actual method of getting goods to market is not the smoothest method either. You'll find yourself doing extremely mundane tasks with a lot of clicking - and there is no simple 'deliver per month' that would make bringing things to market more automated and streamlined. This is only set up between your own factories.The actual manner in which your vehicles take things to their orders is unsatisfying. Undetailed vehicles, no sense of loading and unsatisfying sound effects mean that the thing you'll do over and over seems to reap little reward. There's no ching or money or roar of engine, no sense of big loads or interesting vehicles. In this regard, it falls short of previous, older, non-3d titles.The method of land purchase, itself, is a little obnoxious. If there were tools to help you fill in gaps or 'snap to road' and 'snap to non buyable land' options, it would be a little less so - but with large footprints, winding Freight Tycoon style roads and rigidly blocky buildings, you'll find yourself with an ugly landscape rather quickly. You point and click to form a shape. If you've ever played Cities XXL and built a farm - the manner is identical, but for the ability to snap to lines and fill in spaces. This, agan, is sorely missed, costs time and leaves gaps.Furthermore, there is little sense of border in some buildings. To make roads between them, you'll often be clicking on invisible (Indeed, also 3d) footprints as you select and build roads to create alleys and access roads. To progress through the game you start with a few buildings, earn money and level up. This releases more buildings and products - that cities, too, will begin to pick up as they grow. To make a city grow you have to supply it with as much as you can. This means you'll be taking large numbers of orders. The different menus you have to go through to send a truck, the inability to rename vehicles or places to create senses of locales or purposes (Especially helpful as your plants specialize in products), you'll come to know them as 32, 44, 1 and 3. Not only unpersonal, but it continues to take away from an immersion of the game. A simple option to rename would have helped. You wont see the load capacities of trucks when you send them out - you have to actually select the logistics depot, go to purchase a new vehicle and determine it from there. A truck will then leave, 'touch' its source destination to instantaneously load, get stuck behind a vehicle going slowly (ala Freight Tycoon without the passing or upgrading of roads), and then 'touch' its destination to deliver it. The sound effects are ala Windows 95 System Sounds than an actual game, and the little details that make the sight and sounds of these games, the sense of a day to day operation, seem lost. I've tried playing this quite a bit, and it still suffers from a crash to desktop every couple of hours. More importantly, the more I play this, the more I not want to play this. I want to go back to other titles to get a sense of satisfaction that they, as a game, give. Though newer and in 3d, this game is both expensive and lacks a sense of basic heart, soul and effort that others have tried to give. I don't recommend it.As a sidenote, the graphics are clean enough when zoomed in - but this is a view you will be rarely using. Zooming out, they very quickly become pixelated and seem rough.			"

												I absolutely love games this like even when most do not.  Sadly, this is one of the worst simulation games I have played espeically for the price.  The game is clunky and hard to build.  Selling items isn't automatic and just becomes annoying after awhile.  I tried the campain which was lacking any substance and didn't give me the desire to contiue to play.  Simply put, I'm horrified that I spent money on this game and beg steam to give a refund.			"

												Well... Well... I was waiting for a game like this!And I'm Surprised. This game is good... Really Good!Let's have a deeper look on it:Pro's:1. If you like micromanagement games, like I do, you will enjoy this game, becouse it can guarantee you at least 100 hours of gameplay.2. The Game is BEAUTIFUL! The design is what it should be!3. The Gameplay is the best of it's genre. You can Hire workers, buy lands, research new upgrades for your factories, buy trucks, buy your OWN House!!! And it's still not over: You have an achievement section and the Trade Cards too. But this is not the biggest thing in the game.4. Skill Tree: Yep! Halleluia! Finaly somebody, who told: 'Let's Put Skill Trees in this game!' They ARE helpful, and can give you a boost in-game.5. Price system is really accurately done. The prices are never too high or too low... they may seem to be, but none of them are. They are perfectly equilibrated with the game.6. Autosave Feature: The game at least not punish you to restart everything from the beggining. Every 3 monthses (please correct me if I'm wrong) your game is automatically saved, so if the game crashes, you are saved. Cons:1. Still Buggy: There are still some bugs in-game, like what happened to me today: The acchievement system broke down, and now I can't use my skill points. Sad story, hopefully it will be patched in the v1.02.2. Engine Crashes: Sometimes (especially if you play more than 4-5 hours), the game just shuts down by it's own, loosing all your progress from the last Autosave... Sad, sad, sad. Not talking about the engine what needs 2.4GHz Dual Core Processor. It can be a nightmare for some players to play with it for the lags. :(3. The Mechanics: This tipe of game is not for everybody! If you want to get to the top quickly, this game is not for you! Be patient, and you will have your Gold Medal! :D4. Graphics Settings: As Soon as you enter to the map, you will see the blured trees, and say: 'OMG Why?'. Just turn off the Blur mode, and the game will be Fine! :)5. PC Requirements: They are TOO high for this tipe of game. I know that the INSOMNIA engine is powerfull enough, but why did it have to be so outrageously demanding? (Not my teritory, just saying) Sometimes less is more! 6. The Price: Just one question: WHY??? I bought this game in the GameStop for 15€... Half price like here. And what is different? I don't think so, there is any difference. My opinion about this game? Well, if you are a HARDCORE gamer, who likes this genre (micromanagement), than you will be fine with this game. :)For others: If you would like to try this game, buy it at the GameStop or wait until the price will drop down! You should probably give it a try!Overall Rating: 8/10 (will be updated after the release of the new patch!)Cheers!			"

												Unfortunately I can't recommend this game. Nice ideea and could be a nice. But it has so many problems that will keep you from enjoying the game (a patch could solve some of them but... well nobody cares):- there are anoying bugs (tells me the building isn't conected to the road network but it is). - the selling process if very very bad. esentially you select what item you want to sell and for what price. the sell will be automatically IF you have available vehicles. If you don't you have to manually select thev ehicle (when it's available). It's not a problem at first, but when you advance into the game it will become a problem and it will keep you from enjoying the game.- you can;t buy materials so you only can produce them and transport them from one building to another . This will have to be done by a truck that is assigned only for that task or manually. And again, after some time in the game this management becomes hard.If some of this issues will be addressed i am pretty sure that it will be a pretty nice game. But so far the game resumes to: build, wait, sell, build, wait, sell... "

												This is primarily a first impression review, but is unlikely to be updated.First off, the game runs slowly on my rig. I don’t have a powerful graphics card, but the screens lead me to believe I’d be ok (I can run many more visually appealing games on mid-low settings, like Anno 2070 and Sleeping Dogs). On the lowest settings the game still runs kinda low and the software cursor is often choppy.I did encounter a bug in the tutorial where one of the dialogues that didn’t have any apparent requirements (no click here, etc) did not advance. I was able to skip it and complete the tutorial.The game itself presents to be a  more complex SimCity (not that always online crap, I'll never play it so I can't compare), it looks very indepth and in many ways looks like it's trying to deliver exactly what I want.The game requires lots of micromanagement, which isn’t on its own a bad thing. I prefer games that give me lots of control over what needs to be done. There is a strange lack of automation however. For example, when I built a chicken coop, even after I assign workers to it, I have instruct it to start producing chickens, which is its only function. Transporting goods between buildings and to contracts is similar. This makes more sense and does allow you to program the route so it repeats. However, I was unable to find a way to queue tasks. I had one farm truck and contracts to two different cities. The game did not allow me to start both tasks as I had only one truck. Preferably, it would set the tasks in a queue and available, unassigned trucks would go.I entered Freeplay and balked at first at the lack of freedom (no industry buildings, no research options) until I learned that you level up through completing orders and your level is saved to your profile (so future freeplay games will start at a higher level). I played for a bit but became bored at how slow the progress was. I ended my play session when I realized one order that I had set up game days ago was never delivered. Nor were the other two contracts I had just set up for delivery. Supposedly there is a way to track a trucks motion, but when I was looking for it, the game began to run very slowly and I had reached my limit.PROs*Very complex looking game*Has a leveling system where your actions make your more efficientCONS*Poor graphical engine (this may be unique to people on lower powered systems)*Buggy and/or sometimes unintuitive*Lack of effective automationFinal thoughts: I guess it is less of a simulation game and more of a literal sandbox, meaning you are a kid in an actual sandbox playing with your Tonka truck, You have to find the sand, dig the sand, and put the sand in the truck, and push it in the direction you want it to go. This is fine with one truck, but with 10?			"

												This game is great as long as you (1) do the tutorial and (2) enjoy the tycoon/economy simulator genre. This game is a refreshing new take on a tired old genre that hasn't had much in the past few years. It's great at scratching the same itch as the Railroad Tycoon series or OpenTTD while adding new game play elements.I've only played for one evening and can see that it might have limited re-playability value - the progression seems fairly linear and it might not be exciting the 3rd or 4th time through. It's a long progression though, so to me, the $25 price is a good value for a single play-through. Other people might disagree, but I expect a solid 20-40 hours of fun.If you do not enjoy tycoon games you will hate this game. If you loved Roller Coaster Tycoon you still might not like this game. But if you liked Freight Tycoon, you will love this game.			"

												I like the concept of a business simulator.  When I was younger, I played a game called Capitalism and Capitalism II.  Both games taught me the basic concepts of busines, supply and demand, logistics and the importants of training/research.  In that game, one had to use your mind to come up with some strategies.  However, Industry Empire lacks in several of those areas.  Dislikes:The game does not seem like a game, rather than a grind.  The concepts are easy to master.  In order to level, one simply has to play long enough and sell enough ""goods"" to an infinite market.Once you get enough $, you can buy more land to build another building to shorten the time to the next sell.The game has a severe lack of features.  For instance, you can change the speed of the simulation, which is good considering time is the biggest adversary.  Unfortunately, the game notifies you when one of your storage buildings is full.  Which is good, except it puts the game back down to a crawl.  There is no option to disable the mandatory slow down of the time.  Bottom line:  The concept is good.  Perhaps a younger player can get some value out of it.  If you are looking for a shallow business sim/korean grind feast, look no further!If you want somethign deeper/more complex, please let me know when you find one. :)			"

												I cannot judge the actual quality of the economical simulation, if you don't mind the game slapping you accross the face, you may proceed and play it. The problem is that Industry Empire isn't fun to use/play. I admit I didn't go as far as actually finish the whole tutorial (played half an hour), big flaws emerged far before it ended.Claiming a land requires drawing a free polygon within which you can construct only rectangular based buildings. This system implies messy placement, clumsy space optimisation, lack of ""snap into place"" that'd have actually helped the player play the game (maybe the devs thought using square/hexagonals cells was so 90s... I dunno). Drawing the roads is a nightmare, without any clear indication whether they effectively connect or not with the building. Again, free placement, no hint, no idea what you're doing right or wrong.The GUI doesn't completely work either. I suspect some bugs, but it also doesn't work on from the ergonomy standpoint. What's the use of both a Reset button and a Cancel button where the Reset button actually Cancels everything you just did? And do we really need scrollbars on which you cannot click to page up/page down?During placement, say during road placement, you can select buildings on which you missclick without even leaving the placement tool. Now what?The game looks and feels like a pain to play. I would recommend playing Banished again. Good UI, solid, fun to play. It might not be as rich as this one but it works just fine.I can't just have a clear opinion on the price tag, but it feels like 30€ is a bit too much for what we end up with.			"

												This game has been greatly improved with the latest patch so you can mostly ignore the bad comments about buying land and the markets crashing in terms of selling your goods, though you still have to watch out not to flood the market but then i think thats a good thing as its more realistic.At the end of the day its probably not as good as other strategy management games like Tropico etc, but its not bad either. i think what it mainly lacks is a proper campaign. there are a few scenorios etc but really it could do with a bit more structure in terms of achieving targets, though tech research and skills perks are a nice touch.Overall though if its on sale and you're a sucker for these types of games give it a whirl, there are worst things to play.

												Had potential but....Sometimes the only way to get ahead seems to be collecting the treasure boxes or whatever they are, however to get them requires endless scrolling around the map. Along with the endless clicking and cycling through your farms/mines etc. to build but your stock numbers it get rather tiresome.  Automating does help to a degree.			"

YouTube™ Video: Should You Buy Industry Empire? A 3 Minute Industry Empire Review 

			Views: 2,429		

			Industry Empire is set to be the ultimate simulator. While some games have 5-8 production chains this one has over 100 end products to sell to consumers.		

Industry Empire is another attempt at entering a very niche market.  Economy simulators are not for everyone.  In fact, very few people will be able to dig their claws into them.When you go to the grocery store do you look at all of the products in front of you and immediately calculate in your head which is the best per gram/oz?  If not, you probably don't have the kind of mind made for these games.  Economy simulators are designed around people who can curb every nickle and every dime to maximize profits.  They make spreadsheets in their head and can figure out the exact figure of every single profit margin.Industry Empire is an attempt to try and soften the genre for less hardcores by making things more manual and thus less complicated.In a general economy simulator the purpose of creating product is for the use of the population.  They demand TVs and you get them TVs.  In this game there is no local demand, it is entirely export basis... kind of like Tropico.The game tries to get a little deeper than Tropico by making this all manual.So let's say you have begun producing Eggs.  You need to sell those eggs.  You go to an order sheet and pick which offers you'd like to accept.You fulfill those orders by shipping product on trucks.  Trucks come in different types that have limitations on what kind of product they can ship and how much they can ship.  Min/maxing means only having as many trucks as you need to fulfill orders for each kind of product while having large enough trucks to fulfill the sizes of orders you need to fulfill.As you continue to do business you level up and gain access to new products you can make.The key to these kinds of games is the production chain.  So you start off with basic resources but as you level up you can make more complicated resources.  You might start off with cows.  Then you get a butcher to cut them into beef.  Then you might get a sausage factory to make beef hotdogs.  After this maybe you'll get a hotdog factory to make microwavable hotdogs.  Each step in production increases your costs but also increases your profitability.To further promote selling more products the game limits you on how many orders you can fulfill.To further incentive you to sell different products they also have achievements which will give you bonus points when leveling up.A secondary feature of leveling up is the Leveling Tree.  You will gain certain static points modifiers that will make life easier.  Your level stays for every single play so the game actually gets progressively easier as you continue to play it. It means good players will spend less time at the game, whereas bad players will spend more.What the game lacks is a lot of character to get you into the game. With Tropico, Anno, and SimCity you are given missions and goals that will continuously pop up throughout a game.  This game has nothing like this.  You are left to your own means with no real direction on what to do.Another major weakness to the game is the lack of automation.  You can schedule deliveries to your own facilities to keep your own production going.  But there is no way to automatically sell product to the various towns.  You have to fulfill the orders which takes endless hours and may be just too tedious for the average player to stomach.On top of that the game has some minor issues with crashing.  This would all be fine if you were getting a phenomenal game... but you're not.Overall the game lacks a lot of design that you would find in similar games.  Unfortunately there are just far better simulators out there that are older.  Anno 2070 which was released in 2011 is a far superior game to Industry Empire which was released in 2014.  The catch is that Anno is the exact same price (including all DLC). Stick with Anno... unless you've already played Anno to death and want to try something different... then pick up this game at a Steam sale.			"

But i have to add the game is NOT that horrible as you may think on the basis of reviews.So if you are a fan of a genre and like steam achievements then wait for a discount and buy.If you like such games and don't care about steam achievements and do not oppose piracy then torrent itIf you are not a fan and just looking for some game to play then look somewhere else.Still i think this game is worth a try but i vote for not recommended since it still  has many drawbacks			"

												I am a very big fan of tycoon game, I think I had my hands on nearly all of the major games in this genre, Transport Tycoon Trans openttd simtowertownantcity2345 RT2 RT3 TM industry giant transport Giant Gold CapitalismII RTC ANNO1404 Simutrans CS locomotion Patrician Tropico A-Train CitiesXL CitiesSkyline, and this game really has a lot of potential.Pros:1. A Really Really Really rich set of goods to process and sell 160 goods, beating a lot of games by light years, only came close by Capitalism, but has a lot more dynamics2. Decent production chain It becomes as complex as, if not more than TrainMaster3. Very well balanced you cannot sell one type of good forever, it will crash the market, you have to feed the cities the 160 goods in varity to let it grow and consume all you productions to make profitAll in all, a very different taste of flavour from many other business tycoon games, very rich economic simulation, with tiny bit of transportation simulation. This is a nearly unbeatable game logic.Cons:All that was of merit in the game logic, is comprimised by execution.1. Known Game crash at launch issue, with scarce information. saw a lot of forum post complaining about crash at launch, I had to reinstall a few times, then completely restart steam to get into game, definitely has to do with graphics, I got a prompt for some kind of factory graphic reset before first successful launch.2. Random crash in game, with scarce information. Game sometime just crashes for no apparent reason, when you are about 1 hour / 1year game time into the game. reload will sometime crash at same point, doing something different avoids the crash.3. too few maps From what I see, only 6 scenario and 3 maps (could be only 6 maps may be they reuse the map? Idk I am not interested in scenario I simulate, I only enjoy simulate)4. tedious micromanagement This is to many people a con, not that I frustrate a lot about, after all I see the reason behind it to be forcing player to pay attention to individual buildings. I think it is unfair to actually say the micromanagement is tedious, the production phase actually allows you to automate(with configurable time + volume option, never seen in other games), at the sacrifice of holding up one of your vehicle per operation; but the selling to market phase, there is no automation. Come on, after all sales is the most important part of Business! If all things can truely be automated, it will add a lot of satisfaction to the ""hands off"" experience, though might bring away some joy of micromanagement, you know we are all lazy.Bought at steam sale, about 7USD, thats a deal.Know what you are buying, you only enjoy this game if you are patient, and like to see things running, and love business simuation.

												This is a good cross between the traditional tycoon/industry type games and the more recent facebook leveling/reach target type games. The order system was a little frustrating until you realise that you can just produce every item as at some point there will be a massive order that will use up all your stock. the road system is annoying, one tip is to build them first in the middle then build the buildings and connect it all up.As the game progresses it crashes very often so be sure to save, it is a little too much now and it definately needs a patch.Otherwise its a good little economic sim, altho too much micro in my opinion with minimal automation possible and thus can be quite tedious, but still good fun given the little choice in the game catogory.overall id say a 7/10 at the halfway point (levelwise) if the crashing continues and get worse then that will definately be a dealbreaker....will update late on if that is the case			"

												This is a decent game to fall asleep to.  Just plop some buildings down after the irritating manual selection of land you need to buy, buy some vehicles, make sure you have electricity and water (and the manually selected land to put them on).  Hit fast forward til you have enough stuff to sell.  Wash, rinse, repeat and level up.   That's it.  That's the game.  Very little challenge and you'll spend 90% of your game play staring at the commodity prices looking for the best deals.  No animations and no flexiblity with scheduling your trucks beyond one truck for one commodity for one location.  Was not worth the $30 I paid.   Nowhere near the standard that Transport Tycoon set.			"

												Broken and tedious with a clunky interface.Among the bugs I've encountered so far: Tutorial won't advance, Can't get milk resource (thus disallowing everything you can make from milk) and a random clash bug. Since I've played for 6 hours, that's 1 bug every two hours.The graphics are the latest 2004 has to offer (minor complaint)The interface is reptition and click heavy. You'll find yourself doing the same tasks over and over requiring far too many clicks to do the simple things (like sending a truck on a delivery)The sandbox mode, ""Freeplay,"" allows for just 3 different maps. But I suppose that since there isn't much to this game anyway, that's more than enough.Anyway, as far as game play goes, you build your buildings, connect them with a road building tool that takes a lot of getting used to, make sure the buildings have enough workers, power and water... then flip through the market looking for good prices that you have enough resources to fulfill... And that's about it.			"

												I've been playing the game for a while and it's ok.These kind of games you either like or not and I do.It is not cheap but you put some improvements into it could be grat.Since Actalogic made it farming could have been done more realistic like farming giant.what do animals eat,manure should not be a an option it should as it is normal life.Get rid of thse yellow prizes on the map they are pointless. I have no clue how the cities grow,it is to random I understand industry devirsty to make it more interesting but it can be very painfull when you decide to build one thing and you cannot sell it for while.Thee a lot of farming products even products in the game in general which I like very much.Industry is very thorough and I like it. I would recommend pharmaceutical products as product editon.I do not undestand the fuel consumtion and trucj maintenance.You have a ship-freighter on the cover but not in the game,you should have it like in industry giant 2(air plane and trains also if possible) and some kind of distribution centers  or stores to store and sell products in the cities.I have to go back to city growth make the level neccessity in cities use rcession,stagnation,normal and boom in cities, if possible add marketing and apartment and commercial real state dependent on the city size.How about some competition? Do this you will have a great game which every player who likes economic games will love.Do this and the game will survive on the market otherwhise the game will go into history very fast which would be  shame.

												DO NOT BUY!This atrocity of a game is the WORST "" industry type game"" EVER.Yes it sounds harsh but I just LOVE LOVE LOVE Industry Giant 2 so I was realy hoping this could quench my thirst for some industrial action...WRONGIt is painful to play, painful to look at and the worst part is that the developer actually seemed to have invested some time and work into this... if I was the producer of this game I would IMMEDIATELY FIRE the Game Designer and never allow him to work on anything again because given the opportunity here to make a realy good game he has failed 100%.The whole system of sending trucks, selling the cargo, getting anything done basically is a MICROMANAGEMENT HELL!I have never seen such a bad game desing... it´s like the CEO of the company who has a degree in economics and never played a Business Simulation genre game before decided: ""Oh, what the hell... how hard can it be to design gameplay"" VERY F*CKING HARD IT SEEMS because if I wanted to pay for working I WOULD AT LEAST WORK IN A URANIUM MINE SO MY SUFFERING WOULD END SOONER. This is work you pay for and death will not come soon enough to safe you from it.Edit: There has been a update to the game wich is pretty much as useless as the basic game was because it will allow you to let the system make transport orders for you but only if all conditions for said order are met in advance... so its still a lot of guessing, comparing and estimating and pretty much doesnt work. I did actually try to take all the offers aviable on the market and set everything to ""auto"" and yet still i did not see a single truck go anywhere. I hope the next update will allow for the ""vehicle task"" to be created even without having the needed ammount of resources on hand before... then it MIGHT become a game instead of just a boring job...

												The game itself is a very good idea and should really inspire more simulation game. At first, it made me think of the old capitalism game. The graphics are OK (it's a sim game afterall) but there is one major feature that gets the game almost unplayable. To make money, you have to select orders you want to fulfill then send a car to deliver it. The problem? it takes a few operations to get that done and you'll spend most of your play time doing that. Most orders are small, not repeatable and there is no may to automate it (it would be easy to simply click on a ressource with: ""deliver to order when ready"").In fact, you won't spend much time building your industry empire. You will be rage clicking the orders to make a few coins and that will take all the space. If there was a a patch released to automate it with bigger orders, i would rewrite this review. But for now, i can't recommend it.			"

												Trash Game, Just a new mod for the their old game Farming Giant. Keeps Crashing constantly, sluggish performance. zero automation. the tools to buy land are horrible (selection tools). the interface is from a game of 1995. its more like a $5 game u play years after for nostalgia. DO NOT BUY not worth $30.			"

												Does not work on Parallel Desktops (Virtual Machine settings: Windows8/4GB Ram/1GB Video) on Mac (MBP 15"" Retina mid '12). It starts, shows Rondomedia logo,and goes away. Money wasted.Another stupidity is you need to run it on Steam at least 5 minutes to post a review. If it does not work how can you run it 5 minutes. I watched the Rondomedia logo several times to count seconds upto 5 minutes to write this.			"

												This game crashed on me when I clicked an icon. Selecting land to buy is cumbersome. The road tool is pretty rough. This game is quite unpolished although it has promise. I would wait until December before buying to see if they tighten things up.			"

												Sadly they got some good features, but graphic is mediocre, it becomes totally boring within beyond 1 hour. Ganeplay is ok, but the graphic is dragging the game down. Sadly wont recommend to anyone.			"

												Industry Empire is city building/tycoon simulation game. Seems quick complex game to play, if you don't play tutorial first, but interesting. I'd recommend this game to thoise who like city tycoon or any other simulation somewhat that kind.			"

												RATE 5/10 - Too Pricey, should be 10$, interface and windows is a bit clumsy and take up too much space, a general storage depot would be great so you don't have to micromanage every single chicken farm, grain farms etc. Road building works well but i often ends up having problems figuring out where im allowed to place roads and it snapd too quick to buildings, ending of the game is kind of odd, when you go into minus the game just ended without any warning...generally Industry empire is nice enough game and the contract system is a great concept when the 'automation' works, which is sadly not that often, trade routes would be a great idea or at least the option to automatically sell to the nearest city, for this game to be great, in my opinion it need the transport schemes found in games like Railroad tycoon and TTD, you quickly find it impossible manage your buildings and progress at the same time, it just makes it unenjoyable to play.at first i ""Thumbed up"" the game, but since then no changes have been made by the developers despite alot of criticisme, lately i've experienced a lot of frame drops, we are talking 16 fps, even though im running a 980 ti, the game is absolutely unplayable.i really hope the developers would fix these things and rethink the trading system, i mean just implement a RRT like system to towns and voila, it's sad because the game really is fun to play, is so enjoyable to find resources, build mines and steelmills etc. and see you little empire grow etc. etc.but sadly in this state im not playing it again, but DAMN i want to....

												I bought this game because I love industry/production games. There's nothing better than starting from nothing, building up you business and see the profits roll in. This game allows you to do just that. It's fairly similar to Farming Giant but FG is better if you don't include the constant crashes.  Why is FG better? Because you don't have to click 100 times just to sell your products. There you can sell directly to the city and you can automate that process the same way as you can automate the supply of your factories in Industry Empire.This game is good but it would really need automated selling to make it great. Because now, you can't focus on expanding because you constantly have to accept and fulfill orders. If the orders get bigger later in the game, maybe it gets easier. But fulfilling 20 unit orders  to make 200 bucks gets boring real quick. I would really suggest that they add a more automated selling process with the first update! It's an urgent update!EDIT:So the update came with automated selling process. Yaaaay you might think. But hold it right there cause it ain't what you think it is. You still have to click about 5 times to earn 300 units of money. You have to search for a task, see if you have enough resources, accept it (it get's auto completed if you have enough trucks/workers). Maybe I'm doing the game injustice here because I have only played 8 hours but it was painful 8 hours to be honest. You start with 2 mil, have to spend it all to start leveling the city but then the city decides to change the resources needed and you have to sell everything for half the price that you bought it but only made 10k in 6 months with it. (You can start selling to another city but then this city starts shrinking and your work is wasted)I'm amazed how some people managed to level the cities to 60k+ population without losing their minds. I thought this would be more like Farmig Giant which was GREAT! (minus the crashes and money disappearing). I will give it a few more hours but I don't recommend it anymore.			"
