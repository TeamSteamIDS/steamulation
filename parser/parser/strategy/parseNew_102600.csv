												This is a game about killing orcs. The concept is simple enough, but the execution is high quality. The game is basically a 3rd person shooter in which you have to defend a magical rift in a castle from a horde of orcs and other monsters that are trying to get through it. If too many monsters make it to the rift you lose. One man against a relentless horde of monsters may not seem fair, but you have a lot of advantages. In addition to your trusty crossbow, you'll have a large arsenal of spells, traps, and guardians to help out. Furthermore you earn skulls for completing levels, and you can then spend these skulls on further upgrading your arsenal.At the start of each level you'll have time to plan and set up your defenses and get a feel for the layout of the area. You'll be told where the orcs are coming from, what route they are likely to take, how many waves there are, and even what monsters you can expect to come knocking down your door.This is important because, despite the simple premise of ""orcs must die,"" this is really a tactician's game. The first few levels you may be able to survive using just your crossbow, but as the difficulty level increases you will have to diversify your tactics or perish. You'll start facing more orcs, tougher monsters, monsters that come from multiple entrances, and even multiple rifts that must be defended simultaneously. I will give one bit of warning that is not mentioned in the game-- if you intend to play on the default (war mage) difficulty level as I did, in order to earn the maximum of 5 skulls per level you not only need to prevent any orcs from reaching the rift, you've also got to do it within the par time. Once you start the initial wave the timer starts, and it doesn't stop even during the ""break"" periods you sometimes get between waves.The game is single player only. The graphics and music are adequate, but not AAA quality (this is an indie game, after all, and I don't expect AAA quality here).There is a storyline which is short, simple, and entertaining. Borderlands fans will recognize the voice of Axton the Commando as the War Mage.If you like third person shooters or defense-centered gameplay you'll like Orcs Must Die!			"

 Simple, Fun, AddictiveThis game is very simple, defend your crystal from orcs! I know that sounds pretty booring but trust me, this one is good.First of I wanna talk about the gameplay. The gameplay is actually really addictive and fun, its not hard to understand. First the gameplay seems really simple but after some time it gets harder.The graphics are nice and cartoony, something that I really like! and the controls are nice and tight.Is this game worth the full price? Freaking yes! its a total hidden gem!Will this game run on a older PC? yes it will and good too!1-10? I give it a 8 out of 10.All in all its a great indie game with alot of fun hours ahead for you! I totally recommend it. "

												Here we have a very fun game, but it can get you very angry when you try to complete it perfectly. I completed with multiple rage quits.The proposal is simple, tower defense, prevent the orcs from reaching the portal, there are different types of enemies with different behaviors. The fun is to develop a strategy with the available traps, exploring the scenario in order to exterminate all. The vision in the third person possibility you to actively participate in the struggle, something different in these types of games.With a fun and intuitive gameplay, the graphics also pleases with his cartoonish appearance, the sound of stacks of orcs being crushed and torn is comforting. The plot is simple, just an excuse to kill orcs in many ways.7.5/10			"

												Excellent tower defense-ish game!  It's smooth, colorful, bloody, violent and pretty damn difficult at times.  It's a lot like a single player Dungeon Defenders.  Removing the multiplayer makes it easier to see whats going on, and allows for more creative thinking.  Each new level, trap and ability you unlock will leave you thirsty for more and more Orc blood!The traps are extremely divers and fun to experiment with.  Some combos work better than others, and some strategies are easier for different people.The pace of the game will keep you on your toes, and the learning curve is well balanced.  With the constant addition of new enemies and new traps, your tactic will have to change throughout the game.Its a good length for the content as well.  If it was longer, it would feel drawn out or not leave enough room for omd2.Over all, this game is a lot of fun and worth buying – on sale!  I only stress that this is bought on sale because you can play all of the omd maps on omd2 – with or without a friend.

												Single-player tower defense thing where you seek to commit massacre against poor huggly green people who just want to leave their crappy homelands for a better place. If you do play this game, do so with the knowledge that you are a terrible person who willingly makes enemies walk into spike-traps, get grinded up into goo, and catapulted into lava pits.Enjoy the murder! :P			"

												Fun game which offers a fresh take on the tower-defense genre. By putting you in the middle of the fray there is never a dull moment. The monsters are fun, the traps are fun, the character is fun and the gameplay is challenging and (wait for it) fun. What more could you expect? If you catch this game during a steam-sale you should definately give it a try.			"

												Orc Must Die is typically one of those indie games that must be in the library of those gamers who a) like the RPG genre b) are fond of indie games. This game is not just an RPG but also a strategy one.It is a tower defense game, basically, but as opposed to the usual top-down approach this game uses a third person perspective. It is an interesting choice but certainly makes the game convenient to play. The rest is the usual stuff: the orc waves are getting more and more difficult and the player unlocks more types of traps. Oh, and of course, on later levels we have to look out for more areas as the enemies can approach our base from several directions.If you are bothered by the fact that one single orc reached your base and because of that you lost a couple of points you are free to replay all previous levels for better results. This replayability and the dozens of available levels make sure OMD is a long-lasting experience. At the time of writing this review the game has a 75% discount and its GOTY edition certainly is a catch for just 2 euros.			"

												Amazing game, totally love it <3.It has everything to spend a great evening:+Cartoonish but high-quality graphics - Great animations of everything - traps, spells, orcs deaths. Lovely.+Variety of enemies (and even allies) - different enemies, different approaches.+Gameplay: provides awesome replayability which is just great for a single player game - this is a tower defence game AND you are playing as a hero that places those towers, so you can play with more offensive traps so they do everything for you, you can put more effort into leveling your character and kill all the orcs manually, or you can buy some troops and make more defensive traps to block the enemies. Great game. Good level design and nice story.+If you lucky enough - you can catch this game for 90% on sale - instabuy (don't forget the dlcs they are very useful)+3 difficulties+Nice OSTOverall, I loved everything about this game. Very well done.			"

This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! then skip to Results and read from there.Robot Entertainment mixes elements of different game types to conjure up a brilliant rendition of the tower defense genre. Taking action packed battles and mixing them with strategy you get a game that pushes both hack ‘n slash as well as base management. Story:The order has fallen, the last War Mage is dead, and protecting the realm is now left up to you his apprentice. You must fight your way through the unlimited hordes of orcs as you defend the rifts from falling into the wrong hands. As you press through your adventure you come to learn the evil forces are being led by a corrupted War Mage who plans to destroy humanity. Will you be able to save the world from falling into darkness? Campaign:The campaign is broken down into three acts. The first act has ten levels, the second act has 8, and the third act has 6. Despite each act having fewer levels than the last they are all about the same length as the number of waves increases throughout the campaign. Each level unlocks a new element to the game and once you’ve completed the level you gain the new item for any preceding or future level. Each time you beat a level you get a rating of one to five skulls, unlike most games these skulls actually are given to you as a currency which you can use to upgrade items. You can only get five skulls per level, meaning you cannot beat a level scoring five skulls then play it again to get another five skulls. Each level you can choose from a mastery tree that allows you to kit yourself out for that level, based on your strategies this can vary greatly throughout the campaign. You will progressively unlock more tower/item slots, which start as you only being able to equip three towers/items but later on you’ll find yourself with 10+ slots. You play the entire game in third person, and similar to other games of the genre you are able to join in the battle and help your towers out. This means you are not just sitting there waiting between waves, but rather taking an active part into the gameplay. Some levels you may find yourself not needing to join in, while others you will be right in the fray. Gameplay:Each level allows you to equip an inventory which allows you to choose from a combination of spells, weapons, and towers. There are two weapons (crossbow and bladestaff), four spells (flame bracers, ice amulet, lightning ring, and wind belt), two guardians (paladins and archers), and 17 towers. I found myself typically sticking to the same set throughout the entire campaign, but there are many different strategies you can go for. By placing player activated traps you can take a large part of the game, you can sit back and use guardians to do most of the work, or even mix and match. The gameplay is fast paced and really pulls you into the mix by getting you to experience new elements each level. Artifacts of Power DLC:Artifacts of Power is a DLC that includes new items and towers. The DLC includes two traps (Shock Zapper and Floor Scorcher) and two spells (Vampiric Gauntlets and Alchemist Satchel). I used the Floor Scorcher and Vampiric Gauntlets a few times, found the Shock Zapper completely useless (as you need a roof for it to function), and used the Alchemist Satchel to get a +50 kill streak for the achievement. All and all this DLC isn’t exactly necessary, but if you can get it on sale and included in the pack it’s worth grabbing. Lost Adventures DLC:Lost Adventures is a DLC that includes new level, enemies, and even a new tower. There are five new levels, which offer more skulls allowing for even more upgrades. There are two new enemies the Frost Bat, and Cyclops Mage. It also includes one new trap the mana well which allows you to refill your mana gauge. This DLC is completely worth it as it adds additional content, new enemies, towers, and refined leaderboards. If you can get this on sale or in the bundle you will not regret it. Results:Orcs Must Die is an epic tower defense hack ‘n slash game that keeps you pressed and wanting more. With rating systems that actually give you rewards, fun and interesting enemies, a long and arduous campaign, and an amusing little story Orcs Must Die is a Must Buy (too easy). If you are looking for something similar to Sang-Froid or Sanctum this is pretty much in that line. Once you beat Orcs Must Die you’ll feel like you need to buy the second one as it makes you just want to play more. Pros:+Leaderboard system that allows you to rank yourself amongst friends.+Level rating out of five skulls which can then be used to buy upgrades.+Loads of spells, weapons, and towers to choose from.+Skill trees which can be customized each level to allow you to change how you play (more player intensive, tower support, or mixture of both).+Smooth graphics which look good and don’t push it too far.+Funny and amusing dialogue which gives you a laugh without being offensive.+Intense amount of action, keeps you pressed and fighting between each wave.+Built in level traps (such as rolling locks, acid pots, lava pots, and ballista).Cons:-I had a few levels glitch where an enemy wouldn’t leave the spawn point and thus I couldn’t kill it requiring me to restart (this was annoying if it was at the end of the level).-If Gnoll Hunters fall into acid pits they do not die (as I learned when I set up a level that used nearby acid pits to kill enemies). -One of the DLC levels (Reverse Tower) is just The Tower in Reverse. I know this is obvious from the title, but if you purchase the DLC before playing the game its disappointing to find out one of the levels is the same thing just backwards.			"

												This is a really great and fun tower defense game mixed with real-time action game... once you get the hang of it. Not to imply that it isn't fun right out of the gate, but it doesn't take very long for you to sort of realize that the game wants to be played in a very particular way, and if you aren't picking up the game's hints, it can get frustrating. There are frankly a lot of things about this game that are VERY USEFUL INFORMATION that it doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining to you. Here are just a few examples of things that are confusing and will drive players to consult ye olde Google:1. How in the hell does the skull system work...???2. I'm kicking a** and no orcs are getting into the rift, but I keep getting low scores...???3. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this steam trap...???Here are the short versions to those answers:1. For 5 skulls, beat the level, get lots of combos, don't lose any rift points, and beat the mysterious ""target time"" that you have no idea exists or what the specific target time is unless you finish the level and select ""statistics"" from the end-of-level options then look for the fine print.2. Combos. It's not enough to just kill all the orcs and keep them away from the rift. You have to kill lots of orcs simultaneously, really fast, as much as possible.3. The steam trap is a worthless piece of crap that does nothing useful (and it's not the only one). Just ignore it.If you want to head down the path of victory instead of the path of what-the-hell-is-going-on, then here is where you should start:1. Wind Bracers2. Archers3. Tar pits4. Barricades6. Ice amulet7. Steel Weaver -> Death AugmenterYou'll unlock these as you progress, but those are probably the most useful traps in the game. Orcs plodding slowly through a snaking trail of tar while 15 archers fire flaming arrows at them simultaneously? While you simultaneously use the bracers to blow huge crowds of them into a lava/acid pit? Victory.You'll pick up more tricks and variations as you go. Swinging mace trap + tar pits = virtually unstoppable. Expensive, but heavenly.Are fliers a problem? Or maybe ogres? Or maybe hunters? ICE AMULET THOSE A-HOLES.It's really fun once you get the feel for it and find the optimal strategies, but aspects of the game can definitely feel mysterious and frustrating at first.I'm just three levels away from 5-skulling the entire game. It's been a good time.			"

Originally posted by The TL,DR Genie:I installed Orcs Must Die! and played through the first two difficulties with a constant smile on my face, pretty much bewitched by the fun combination of traps and spells I could use during each mission. I refused to let it go until I beat it on the hardest difficulty and got all the achievements. I give this game five skulls (and a horned helmet to boot)!A fun, addictive, and enjoyable experience that keeps on giving.Orcs Must Die! is not the type to focus on its lore or story more than it's necessary. There's a legion of baddies out there and it's up to you and your ridiculously generous array of traps, weapons and spells to stop them. The simple and funny cinematics and voice acting cover the rest. The protagonist is witty, easy-going, wise-cracking, and arrogant to the point of annoyance. And as such, I lovingly refer to him as Bruce Campbell.The HUD and menus are minimalistic and have been built for easy and simple navigation with a gamepad. Even so, using a keyboard is in no way inconvenient especially when considering that all of the action is paused while looking through the menus.The graphics are in no way elaborate or any form of high definition but they are far from being poor or shoddy. Considering the high level of action and running around required, they are quite appropriate as nobody wants to have to restart a mission because they got overrun by orcs while looking at the pretty walls. The sound effects fit with the visual style amazingly well, the music is very fun and needs a lot of time for the repetitiveness to become annoying, which sadly cannot be said by the quippy voice acting which does get old pretty fast.The controls rarely feel awkward and only become a problem for perfectionists (such as myself) who wish to align all their traps perfectly. The heat of battle on higher difficulties makes for split-second perfect placement which when failed might require users to restart the mission. The Options menu is quite modest but fitting to the purpose of Orcs Must Die!. The Achievements don't ask too much from the user and completionists will get almost all of them by the end. In regards to the Leaderboards, some of the higher scoring users got there with cheats that allowed absurd numbers but ranking among friends works just fine and in real time.I installed Orcs Must Die! and played through the first two difficulties with a constant smile on my face, pretty much bewitched by the fun combination of traps and spells I could use during each mission. I refused to let it go until I beat it on the hardest difficulty and got all the achievements. I give this game five skulls (and a horned helmet to boot)!			"

												Orcs Must Die! is a dynamic combination of arcade game and tower defense. The action takes place in a fantasy land where the biggest threat to humanity are hordes of orcs. We, as an unlucky mage, must keep order in the whole castle. Simple, isnt it? Graphics looks more than good. Whole, maintained in a characteristic, slightly cartoon style is conceptually shapely, ingenious and simply pretty, works flawlessly.

												For those who don't know, it's a third-person tower defense set in a fantasy world. You're a war mage and your job is to defend the human world from the invading orcs. That's the synopsis in a nut shell without giving too much away, the rest is orc slaying fun history.There's a variety of useful items including but not limited to 2 main weapons, 4 spells, 10 ground traps, 4 wall traps, 3 ceiling traps, 2 minions, and 3 ""Weavers."" All of those have various uses and abilities and it's all up to you as to how to best deploy them against the enemy. That's not even including the DLC. Weavers are simply menus with available upgrades you can purchase with cash earned from waves. You get a limit of which items you can use per mission, the max being 9 available slots. You are also able to upgrade traps when the time comes with ""skulls"" earned after each victory. So it's somewhat tactical, you need to strategise your approach when starting a new map. It gives you a moment of grace to choose which traps to use and to scout the map.The music is upbeat and catchy, it compliments the protagonists witty commentary and the bloody orc slaying perfectly. I haven't encountered anything negative to say about it.The sounds effects are crisp and simple, nothing special of note here. The one sound that got on my nerves was the Autoballista firing sound, it's a loud WHOOOOSH and drives me nuts when I have a lot of them. Other than that, I don't mind the rest, it's very atmospheric. The sound that sent chills down my spine was the sound a flock of Fire Babies makes, it's very ominous.There's no endless mode, if you want an endless mode then get the second game. However, you can create a mod of the existing levels and add or modify waves. It's hands-on and takes patience and some planning on your part to do this, it's not an in-game feature.Pros:Great graphicsGreat atmosphere and special effectsInnovative abilities and trapsResponsive controlsController support (tested with XBox 360 layout)24 non-linear maps, each with their own challengeExcellent voice actingNot too over the top humorBeautiful art and great music3 difficulty levels (Apprentice, War Mage, Nightmare)Can fight 10,000 orcs with modded wavesCons:Autoballista fire soundSingleplayer onlyNo endless mode or any other mode besides the main levels (excluding DLC which adds more content)Can't invite Weavers into the battle (this disappointed me </3)No key remapping for left handed peopleNeutral:Orc Archers are stronger than Orc Warriors which makes sense but still seems backwards to meModding waves will disable leaderboard progress and for good reason but your kill counter is unaffectedUpgrading can be initially tricky, I recommend saving your skulls until you have at least most traps unlockedActive leaderboard that shows yours and your friend's scores and shows where you are placed globallySkull farming can be tedious, getting a perfect victory has strict requirements but it's worth itIt's a smashing success, ingenious concept and will offer you potentially hundreds of hours of tactical fun.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Orcs Must Die! Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Tower Defense; Action; Strategy; RPG; Casual   My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers REVIEWOrcs Must Die! is an amazing take on a tower defense/3rd-person action combo.  Attributes of both genres are blended together perfectly to form an addictive and entertaining little game. This is a game that is very easy to enjoy.Orcs Must Die!  does a great job taking 3rd-person action elements and blending them with some tower defense to establish a good basis. Then they sprinkle in the lighthearted atmosphere and charming characters with the simplistic-yet-captivating mechanics of the game… and it shapes up to be a really fun, delightful experience. It’s definitely the kind of game you can dive right into and get hooked for hours. There is a relatively large amount of different towers and abilities in the game when compared to many other games in the tower defense genre. You have plenty of options and can have fun experimenting with different strategies. The level designs also vary enough that they call for different approaches to beat them, so you will have to try out different tactics in order to succeed. And there is a fair amount of different enemies which keeps things fresh as you progress through the game.There is also a scoring system and leaderboards to add replay value.This game is just downright fun.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												This game actually turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Stragtigically placing all the wonderfully wicked traps to kill as many Orcs as possible before they get to the point where you have to fend them off is a great challange. Picking your traps is fun considering there are many to choose from. traps are also upgradable which is definatley a nice touch.  Would I recommend this game, yes to anyone. So why not go on over and get your copy now and while you are there grab Orcs must die 2 and the DLC....I did!			"

Orcs must die belongs to a genre that is obviously meant to be have repetitiveness, but in a good way so no reason to explain that . You have to stop horde of ogres from getting into some kind of orb that powers you and the valley. Use traps, weapons, guardians and powers to stop the horde. It may sound boring but trust me you'll love it. It has a bit of story that continues on OMD 2! so it is recommended to buy both on bundle.+ Play as you wish. First 2 levels are meant to teach you but after that kill them however you want.+ Plenty of creative environment kills available+ Increasing difficulty doesn't mean the health bar will just increase. Instead, a lot of varied types of ogres come that requires good knowledge of weapons that you'll pick before starting the stage+ Creative weapons+ Funny+ Really cheap on sale-Just when you think you have the grip, the game ends-No boss ending, kill the last horde and the game will just end after a cutscene~Stages are not sorted according to difficulty well. There are difficult levels and some dead easy levels right after that. But maybe thats how they want it to be.Overall I give this game 7/10 Nick Cage and a big heeeeehaw!  "

1-sentence review :Perfect mix between a 3rd Person Shooter and a Tower Defense Game !Pros :- Challenging without being too difficult- A bunch of really different ""towers""- A ton of enemies- Varied & interesting Levels- Funny main characterCons :- Lacks a little bit of polishing on user-friendliness- Orcs Must Die 2 is better (It's not a con for me, but it's the reason some idiots don't recommend this game :) )			"

												Robot Entertainment have produced a slick action game here based around the popular tower defence genre. This game follows the traditional tower defence script of building traps to stop a constant stream of enemy foe but introduces player spells and weapons to assist.Far from becoming confused the game merges the 2 styles effortlessly, there are occasions when building an intricate series of diversions and traps is the order of the day and other times when equipping your poking stick and some fire gauntlets is required to smite the raging hordes.The game follows a steady learning curve, those new to tower defense games will be handheld throughout the first stages and with the game introducing new skills and abilities as you go along you will never feel overwhelmed at the pace.The games real charm rests in the war mage himself, the character story is developed via cut scenes between levels, he's equipped with a few witty one liners that he will dole out at various times and you cant help but like the guy!The graphics are good, the music is solid and atmospheric . Some people will play through it once but with the introduction of the ""skull ranking"" system many will replay the levels in order to 5 skull them. In this game skulls mean upgrades and upgrades means more dead orcs! ... This game takes its place as one of the best tower defence games available today. With the announcement of a sequel on the way things are looking good for Robot Entertainment.			"

												HANDS DOWN - The Best Purchase Of The YearThere simply aren't a lot of games these days that really bring to the table what Orcs Must Die does. The concept is simple, easy to learn, harder to master. Very addictive and very satisfying to play. Not sure yet? Looking for a description of the game? Basically it's an indie 3rd POV Tower Defense, with Warcraft look & feel and the action of Team Fortress 2.If your looking for a reason not to purchase, I really can't give you any and that's been while since I've had that with any game!

												I'm not a huge fan of Tower Defense games in general, but Orcs Must Die managed to catch my attention some years back and I'm glad it did.The game functions like a combination of Tower Defense and Third Person shooter, much like a certain dungeon defending other game that is absolute garbage and will not be discussed in this review. As you make your way through levels, by accomplishing various feats you gain Skulls that you can use to unlock and upgrade traps and guardians you can place in the levels, as well as unlock and upgrade gear for the Warmage Maximillian, who you run around fighting with while your maze does its work.Every level serves up its own array of challenges but for the most part there's a solid strategy to be found in the basic sort of ""put up barricades so there's only one bottleneck, then shove them through as many traps as possible."" On Nightmare mode that attitude changes entirely, but for the game's normal mode, that basic strategy will get you through pretty much the entir game with only a few rough spots.Enemies run the rnage from a bunch of orc types, who just blindly run at the Rift, to kobolds, who ignore everything and just attack the rift, to gnolls, who tend to ignore everything else and just come to kill you. There's also Giants, Trolls,and Ogres who are massive lumbering foes who are barely stopped by any traps and require immediate attention or prolonged trap work to kill. Frantically rebuilding your mazes while hacking and blasting away at orcs is a lot of fun no matter how you slice it.The game's not overly replayable, IMO, unless you're going to max out five skulls on every single level on both difficulties, but if you do want to do that, there's plenty of playtime ahead of you. If you're interested in score and leaderboards, the game also does have that, but I wasn't personally interested in it. Some of the levels are very challenging though, especially in Nightmare, and unless you suss out the level's specific trick, especially on Nightmare, getting 5 skulls can seem like an impossible task. At this point the game becomes as much a puzzle as it does a Tower Defense hack and slash game. You can also go back to older levels with the new unlocked trap gear and marvel at how your upgraded traps smash through orcs like so many dominos while the Warmage gets to watch.There's a reason this first game spawned a sequel, a F2P MMo, and even a boardgame: It's because the game is a whole lot of fun. The story isn't anything amazing, and mostly serves as a backdrop for why there's orcs everywhere (You're the guardian of a Rift in a massive castle, and you're shutting them all to stop the Sorceress from sending armies through.), but that's fine. The only real downside to the game is that there's no multiplayer.... but hey, the sequel has multiplayer! So play this one to get the background and get your feet wet, then jump in with some friends into Orcs Must Die 2: Bigger and Better-er. Absolutely recommended.			"

												I absolutely love this game. Great tower defense game. It has a great and memorable soundtrack.I would get tracks stuck in my head that would compel me to play more Orcs Must Die. The orcs are funny, the graphics are smooth and visually appealing, and a game that has enough challenge without taking away the most important part; the fun. There are few games that after I have completed that would whisper in my ear ""dun-dun-dundundun now that you've finished Nightmare difficulty you gotta go back and get 5/5 skulls on each map"" Which I did, and loved every second.You won't regret buying this game. Do it, for the orcs.			"

												Orcs Must Die! is an outstanding, well done Indie game with excellent, quick and ongoing support in the Steam forums by Robot Entertainment. This game can be played several different ways, so there is great replayability. Examples: 1) you can play just to complete the 24 War Mage mode levels followed by the 24 Nightmare mode levels, followed by 5 levels more for each if you own the DLC, 2) you can playthrough to ""5 skull"" all the levels, and 3) you can playthrough trying to achieve higher or top scores by using different combinations of traps. You MUST, however, make sure you have at least a dual core processor as this game heavily uses the second core for its animations. I highly recommend this game!			"

												The gameplay is gritty, easy to learn, and difficult to master.  The game is quirky, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is easy to pick up, but hard to put back down.  It has a few shortcomings (no CoOp), and Nightmare isn't quite as difficult in this original as it was in the sequel, but the gameplay is still going to challenge players of every skill level.For those of us who love Tower Defense/FPS hybrids, this game is a solid purchase at anything under $10, and a steal when it dips below $5.  If you play through the achievements (all of which are reasonable), you can expect about 15 hours of very enjoyable gameplay.			"

												A third person tower defense game based around traps and killing orcs. Addictive and very fun gameplay. Has a large variety of levels offering many fun challenges. Nightmare mode offers a little more of a challenge as you need to know exactly how you want to set up your traps and make sure you don't do any misplacements. I was really addicted to this game when it first came out, and bought Orcs Must Die 2 to play with my brother. Pros:+ A large selection of fun traps you can use to maximise killing efficiency+ A good selection of levels to play + Addictive, fast-paced gameplay where you have to use your hero to his maximum potential alongside the traps.Cons:- I tend not to like it when games offer dlc for extra cash, however the game of year edition is quite cheap when on sale, do it doesn't matter quite so much anymore.My Score: 9/10			"

												I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre.Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game.Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders.Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.

												Orcs Must Die! Is a first-person tower defence game developed and published by Robot Entertainment. It was released in October 2011. You play as a War Mage that defends his rift, or base, against the enemy orcs and fellow allies. In the first-person aspect, your War Mage has weapons that you use against the enemy and you construct defences to defend your Rift. This game is purely single-player. This review will cover the overall concept in regards to story and downloadable content, gameplay, and to a smaller extent, performance.Orcs Must Die features a simple concept with an easy learning curve. The simple concept is tower defence and there is no tutorial because you place units to defend and should not require assistance. This game features 25 base game missions with 5 separate missions through the Lost Adventures DLC and there is a small story attached to the base game missions. The DLC contained new units and new levels, so while there is a passable amount of content, for $2.99 it does no harm. There is three difficulties so this game has enough replayability for 25 hours. Regarding the story, I did not overly understand the actual story at hand because it was not emphasised. The start of each level had the War Mage advancing the unclear story such as him being alone in the mages and having to defend against the enemy. There were around three cut scenes in the entire base game missions that succulently revealed the story but without those, the attached story was unclear and an afterthought. If the story was emphasised more through cut scenes this game would have been better. Moving on, each level is different and vary in difficulty, providing a new experience with most of the levels. For instance, as one level progressed it increased in difficulty. As the missions progressed, it became harder in difficulty. Therefore, I praise the level designs that are neat and add diversity and fun towards the game. As for enjoyment, I enjoyed the missions and the overall concept and style for the most part, but levels started to become stale and therefore, were becoming boring but luckily I finished all missions on easy difficulty without being burnt out.The gameplay is basic and has a large amount of variety. The gameplay aspect is a wave begins and your units and your player beat the enemy, gaining income to spend on other units or upgrades. There is a very nice variety of units because there is a total of 30 units and weapons, and while I used the same eight for each mission there were other options at least. One feature is the upgrade tree, which is three different trees with different abilities and the player chooses one per level. You spend your currency you gain from killing enemies on unlocking abilities in the tree through a vertical skillset approach, which is you unlock skill one, then you can unlock skill 2 and so forth. For instance, one skill may be reducing the reload times for timed units. I like this but I believe its unbalanced because for 29 missions I used only one tree and the other mission I used another one, as that particular tree I mainly used drastically improved the powers of my units. Another system is the upgrading of abilities and/or reducing the cost of your units after the levels by using skulls. For instance, upgrading archer guardians would reduce the price from 600 coins to 500 coins. This proves incredibly useful because of the course of the level, as things get harder, you need stronger units. The game makes the little things count, such as witty comments from your War Mage to the sweet killing animations, providing a light-hearted atmosphere. Furthermore, the artwork is very nice with its cartoon approach that freshens the games apperance. The one main issue I had with the gameplay was the generic movements by the AI and their lack of animation in attacking and rushing. For instance, I felt that each unit lacked diversity in movement and animation because the ogres have different clothing and names but all have the same animations and movements. This is the same with the orcs and the flying units. It gets repetitive as well because you get the feeling its like 'oh, the ogre is charging at me again'. The other small issue was the pathfinding bugs with enemies, but not a major issue.The performance was consistent and is optimised. I could play on max settings at 60+ FPS. This is not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.Orcs Must Die is a solid game. It benefits from the simplicity and diversity of the game in enemy characters, units and the basic nature of defending against multiple waves of enemies. It suffers from the lack of animation and movement in enemy, that makes the game repetitive and towards staleness. The story is very disappointing as it is an afterthought, though it has its small moments. The artwork and gameplay is neat and light-hearted and the overall atmosphere of the game matches this description. I completed the game in eight hours and this was an appropriate length because I was close to being bored. But, I enjoyed it for the most part because of the simplicity. Furthermore,  has its pros and cons and is a solid game, however, it does not stretch into being a good game. At $12.99 for the game of the year edition, I recommend it on sale. It’s a fun game that is casual and easy to play but there is not enough fresh content to play this for twenty hours.Ratings system:For this particular game, I will rate the concept and gameplay judging from what I wrote and average those scores. I will then range the score to what I felt it should be given.Concept: 6.5/10Gameplay: 5.5/10Overall: 5.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

												Orcs Must Die is the classic tower defense game with the added twist your character being controlled in the first person perspective and equipped to help out when those wall mounted axes isn't quite getting the job done. First person tower defense is nothing new but it is how solid and streamlined Orcs Must Die feels that makes it stand apart from it's competitors.You are the last of the War Mages, not the brightest, not the strongest, just the last one. And you are all that stands between the peasants of the land living in an idyllic medieval utopia and being introduced to the business end of a rusty axe. To stem the tide of orcs pouring in through magical portals you must progress to a succession of levels killing increasingly larger and more diverse waves of enemies. To help you on this task you have your trusty crossbow and variety of traps and magic.You start each level by choosing which traps and weapons you want to use, completing missions unlocks more and completing them well allows you to upgrade them. As you slay orcs you earn gold which can then be used to place more traps or to gain various in-mission upgrades. As the levels progress you are introduced to all the classic tower defense enemies, the fast runners, the big slow damage sponges, the attackers that run straight for you, the suicide bombers that can kill your barricades, the fliers that follow completely separate paths from their ground dwelling kin and every other enemy that has been in every other tower defense game to date.Graphically the games goes for a sort of cartoonish look that works fairly well most of the time and the music does the job equally adequate. The various juvenile one liners being spouted by your character grows tiresome rather quickly however.There really isn't much to set Orcs Must Die apart from any of the other tower defense games out there, it does everything they do and never strays too far from the path of tried and true. What makes it shine however, is how extremely solid it all is. No action is wasted and every item in the game feels like it serves a purpose. The gameplay is tight and satisfying and although the nature of the genre makes it repeat itself quite a lot as you reach the higher difficulties it manages to maintain a longer lifespan than most tower defense games.All in all Orcs Must Die is your standard first person tower defense game, extremely well made and a must have for any fans of the genre but not a game that will attract any newcomers or a game that brings anything new to the genre. A tried and true fomular, executed solidly.			"

												I have very fond memories of this funny and polished third-person tower defense game. Slaughtering orcs, trolls, goblins, and other mobs is hugely satisfying, especially when racking up combos and abusing skill trees and environmental traps.The game's only flaw is that the hardest difficulty, Nightmare mode, is a bit on the unfun side, as it immediately starts all attack waves automatically, removing the element of careful planning. If you're a completionist aiming to 5-star every level, be prepared for the tedium of restarting every single level dozens and dozens of times from scratch until that one magical run where nothing goes wrong.Aside from that, highly recommended game. If you've never played Orcs Must Die 2, get this one on sale and play it first, and see if you get as hooked as I did.			"

												Pros+Good variety of traps, weapons, and spells that allow for different playstyles. Want to go heavy on traps? How about heavy on spells and weapons? Or a nice mixture of both? Finding the perfect combination for what works for you can feely very rewarding and fun.+Good map variance. Maps can force you to switch your build so there's rarely a comfort setup that works for everything. +Good music that very rarely grows tiresome or reptitive.+Graphics are good and still hold up even several years later. Gives off a cartoony vibe, which I enjoyed.+Good variety of enemies that require different combinations to kill effectively.+A good amount of challenge from the Nightmare level maps that might require multiple set ups or attempts to figure out the perfect combination.Cons-Some of the voice lines that trigger when you set up traps can grow tiresome and reptitive really quickly.-I suffered some audio issues where a voice line would either stutter halfway through (but the gameplay would be fine) and some waves on some maps just not playing music.-The story is nearly non existant, but who plays a tower defense game for the story?-No Co-Op or online play.Overall Orcs Must Die! is a very fun rewarding Tower Defense / Third Person Shooter hybrid that I highly recommend to fans of those genres.

												We always think about killing games to include either people or zombies, I never think about orcs. But after playing this killing orcs, ogres and trolls seems to be as easy as threshing a colbalt into a grinder.The game is a tower defense, with it's main focus being on the traps you setup along the orcs path and not so much your weapons. It allows you to strategize and be creative, in a way I think it helps you intellectually by seeing things in different perspectives as to how you'll set up your traps. By the end of your first level, you'll be dancing to the victory song while screaming, ""ORCS MUST DIE!""			"

												Orcs must die is a tower defence game, without towers.  You place traps in expansive hallways and court yard like areas to defend rifts from a massive amount of Orcs.  Hundreds on screen at once running toward your rift.  You have traps, spells and weapons to fight them back and away from the rift and you are going to need every little bit of help you can get to work the field.  So prepare properly and get ready to hold down the fort.  Go buy this game!			"

												Orcs Must Die is just an amazing game, you'll have a smile on my face every moment you're in game. The title pretty much explains the basics of the game, but without mentioning the best part, the traps!The game is a tower defence/Third person shooter in which you must defend the rift in each castle. The rift is basically a portal from the orcs world to the human world, if too many orcs make it through the portal, the game is lost.You start off with a few simple traps, a sword, and the always equipped crossbow. But as you get further into the game you will unlock new traps and eventually upgrade your traps with skulls, which are unlocked depending on how well you do in a level. As you progress through the game you will unlock more slots to equip different traps, these are kept if you go back to a previous level, which you might not have done so well on (or maybe you did really well and are replaying it because it's so much fun). At the beginning of each level the game tells you where the orcs will come from, the route they will take and the types of enemies you will encounter during that level. The levels are divided into waves, the gap between waves is really a quick break in which you have time to place some traps with the money you have collected protecting that rift. Levels are only short which makes it a great game to fill in time whilst having fun. The art style is also great and fits perfectly with the gameplay, and some of the cheeky comments the War Mage makes. The soundtrack is really upbeat and part of what makes you so happy playing this game.The only downside to this game is that, unlike its sequel, it is only single player.But overall Orc Must Die is a great game for any casual gamer, especially those that are fans of both the action and strategy genres.

												I got this game for .99 cents when it was on sale, I thought it wouldn\'t be much fun but the opposite is true. This game is a surprising rendition of a classic TD but has a very unique element to it, You are the Character setting traps and slaying orcs with a crossbow. This game with all its unique trap combos, my favorite the Floor Burner with a spring trap to make them endlessly run through it again and again, makes the gameplay enjoyable, there are a few annoying maps but all in all a great game Lets take a minute to go through the pros and consPros- The game is surprisingly addictive slaughtering orcs over and over with a trap combo          The game has unique traps and different map levels each time so you don\'t get used to the same strategy          The headshot feature is my personal favorite            Archers on a bridge are OP          The Graphics are suprisingly great Cons- The music for the orcs is a bit redundant but fun           I wish OGRES weren\'t so OP as well as the Fliers if you get caught offguard Overview- I would recommend this game for someone who likes TD\'s and Strategy PS. Or slaughtering orcs :D			"

												I love the game for it's humor. Your alter ego is a dork and his victory dance over defeated enemies hilarious. When I saw it first time I almost died laughting.The game itself is a tower defense variation in 3D where towers are replaced with traps. You will find malicous pleasure in seeing endless hordes of souless orcs being impaled, burned, squadshed, shattered, flipped, electrocuted, dissected and pummled to death. Thanks to the game comic style it's not graphic but hilariously funny.			"

												WTF is it?   -   Orcs Must Die! is a third-person trap laying orc slaying monster delaying tower defense game. It is the second game made by Robot Entertainment whose studio is made up of people from the now defunct Ensemble Studios. Why is that significant? Well at one point in my life I was a console gamer, I won't go into specifics because those were dark times filled with low framerates, but I digress. The game that I played the most on xbox was Halo Wars which was developed by Ensemble. Being the amazing devs they are, they have yet again impressed me with Orcs Must Die! The objective of the game is to stop orcs from reaching the rift(s) on each level by placing traps and using weapons. Each level has multiple waves of orcs that increase in difficulty over the rounds and if enough orcs enter the rift(s) the rift score drops to zero and you lose. The plot of the game is surprisingly interesting aswell since you play as a War Mage who is the last member of an order dedicated to defending the rifts which are sources of magic for the two worlds. I think they could have gone more in depth with the story even though this is a somewhat silly game.Verdict   -   Well worth the time and money.BTW   -   This is better than that Rift mmo.			"

												I'm enjoying this game a lot at the moment and it reminds me a lot of Dungeon Defenders. I purchased this and Orcs Must Die 2 in a Steam sale around a year ago I think and i definitely see myself replaying the game on Nightmare difficulty.Your character is a funny war mage tasked with defending the various dungeons and bastions from an onslaught of ogres, kobolds and orcs. You get to control the war mage in third person as well as actively managing your traps.Unlike some games you have to wait for a break or stoppage in waves to replace or build traps. In this game you can sell, and lay traps whilst the waves are happening (as long as you or an enemy aren't in the place you want to place your trap).I felt like they could of expanded the story each level to give a sense of immersion, but the gameplay makes up for this flaw.If you love tower defense games but want an alternative to your standard one then give this a try.Pros:- Fun Gameplay- Nice Assortment of Enemies- Quirky Main Protagonist- Plethora of Traps- Dynamic Trap Management- Cool Looking Artwork/GraphicsCons:- Not a very in-depth Storyline- Short Campaign- Graphics May not Appeal To Some- No Coop or Multiplayer Aspect.

WIth the talent-like choices you can personalise how you wanna play each level, going trap heavy, combat heavy or a mix.The story is not bad but is not the strong point. The funny coments you character makes sometimes are quite cool tho. Pros:- Kill orcs (need say more?)- Several diferent levels with diferent kinds of enemies- Choose how you wanna play (TD heavy or slash/shoot heavy)- Smart♥♥♥♥♥coments that can actualy make you giggle (maybe...)Cons:- Not story rich- Could get repetitive (but really, killing orcs gets boring for you guys??)

												Overall a good game for slaughtering Orcs. Being a fan of the Orc race myself in video games, it was enjoyable to slaughter thousands of goofy Orcs as they rushed towards you in the many different levels this game's storyline had. Many different games these days have vast differences in graphical designs, yet this game struck a good balance between keeping it simple and looking good at the same time. The same goes for the different skins and models available throughout the game.The cutscenes explaining the storyline are a bit short, and lacking information at times, but the idea of this game is pretty straightforward; you kill Orcs. Lots and lots of Orcs. You've got many different ways to do it, all ending up in the brutal slaughter of Orcs. There are many different contrapments and weapons to help you along the way. Considering the purpose of this game, I would say this is one of the best Indie games I've played in a while and I look forward to playing Orcs Must Die! 2 as well.			"

												Orcs Must Die! is yet another take on the now ubiquitous action-tower defense genre. In many ways, it's similar to Dungeon Defenders (see previous review), but you play as only one character and there is no customization, other than what traps you decide to use on each level. That doesn't make it bad, however. In fact, it's a real plus in the game's favor... as the main character is, well, quite a character! I guarantee his goofy lines will bring a smile to your face. Gameplay is standard fare for the genre - progress through a series of levels in which you must set up traps and defend your magic rift from hordes of orcs. Every new level completed adds a new trap or ally to your arsenal, making for a smooth progression (though nothing is ever really a cakewalk). You will be challenged, for sure... especially on later levels. If you're looking for a new tower defense game (or maybe looking to try one for the first time), Orcs Must Die is about as solid as they come. Give it a look!			"

												Most Tower Defense games are a fairly hands-off genre; you build towers and they do their thing, with your involvement being where to put them and when to upgrade. But lately there have been some that let the player get into the action more personally, and Orcs Must Die is a great example of that. Compared to the nameless protagonists of the last two games, OMD puts you in the shoes of the Apprentice, one of many War Mages tasked with defending rifts to the human world from bands of invading orcs. His tutelage has come to an end though, thanks to his master taking a fatal tumble, forcing him into the role completely. As the Apprentice is a combination of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast and Groose from Skyward Sword, this isn't necessarily a good thing, especially not when the orcs seem to be getting more organized suddenly.Instead of defending whole territories like other games, each level in Orcs Must Die takes place in a different fort, with a rift on one end and the orcs (as well as other enemies) charging in through the other. So rather than towers, you'll be placing down booby traps instead: spike traps on the floor, walls that shoot out arrows, even swinging maces you can put on low ceilings. It's not too hard to create a total death course enemies will futilely try to wade through. The game's combo system, the ragdoll physics, and the orcs' voice clips as they're being pulverized all help encourage this very well. The Apprentice also has some weapons of his own for crowd control, or the odd enemy that manages to get through your traps.Each level offers up to five skulls, four for not taking any damage and one for speed, which you can use to upgrade your traps permanently. These range from extra damage on some, to slowing enemies, to dramatically increasing speed. It can make many traps much more useful, although what you spend can't be refunded. The game has 24 levels, which I beat in about ten hours. That unlocks the Nightmare difficulty, which offers tougher enemy placement and much less time to prepare between waves. I didn't find the base game that difficult, so it's a nice option if you want it. There's also some cheap DLC, which offers a few extra tools and some new levels; nothing necessary, but good if you want to get a bit more out of the game. And with one this well-made, there's not much reason you wouldn't.			"

												Orcs Must Die is a third person, action, tower defense game.  You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways.  In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them.  This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side.  After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn.  These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians. After many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME.  I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions).  Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay!  There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost.  It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.  However, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs.  Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat.  If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube.  And if you like what you see, buy it.  Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.  TLDR: 10/10  Disclaimer: No Orcs were harmed in the writing of this review.  Harmed before, oh hell yes!			"

												At first glance Orcs Must Die! looks like a Tower Defense game. In reality if you rely solely on towers to kill enemies you will lose very quickly. It's more of a hybrid Over-the-shoulder 3rd person action and Tower Defense game. Yes, increasingly difficult mobs lumber brainlessly toward an exit, but they may also try to kill you directly. Around half of your kills will come your main character using his trusty crossbow and spells than by the towers themselves.This is generally a good thing but if you're looking for a pure Tower Defense game this isn't it. It does however keep the action fast as you sprint around each level where you need to help bolster defenses on various ends of the map. You can't just ""set it and forget it"" for most levels.While the different traps are fun, they generally come in 3 flavors: Single use (the worst, dead after one trigger), episodic worse (deals damage and then cools down), and constant (best, constant damage to all enemies that traverse it). As later levels and difficulties feature tougher and more numerous monsters, you will have no choice but to use traps that deal constant damage, of which there are a limited amount. This makes many of the more entertaining and flavorful traps pushed to way side. There are at least 3 traps I never used.Regardless the game is still fun. Planning how to handle each wave and setting up a circuitous kill zone is extremely satisfying. The whimsical art style and humorous protagonist also helps things immensely. There's tons of replayability with multiple levels, 3 difficulty settings, and a decent expanion pack to boot. Well worth the sale price.			"

												Orcs must die? Definitely! Ever play Dungeon Defenders? Well, if you have, imagine this is the one where you play alone (a bloody pity) and you do not have to level up or get god-like weapons/pets. You do however, get a bookload of traps and handful of spells to massacre the orcs/ogres/gnolls/batties etc. In most circumstances, I actually had so much more fun with this than Dungeon Defenders (I mainly blame my overpowered Steam friends for it though).If you never played Dungeon Defenders, well, imagine this as another tower defence game but you get to jump in and massacre the orcs yourself. Spells/traps/archers, plenty of ways to do it =DNote though, it is a rather short/limited game and it is single player but the joy of seeing that your wonderfully laid traps have worked perfectly - always a fantastico moment! One indie game that totally deserves your attention!			"

You set traps and kill things (sometimes even without the traps). There are lots of traps and lots of ways to play. This game uses a fairly simple scoring mechanism of kill steaks and combos (#of things hitting something as it dies) that is easy to understand, but tough to master so topping the leaderboards is quite the trick.The price is affordable, the game has 24 levels that can be played on any of the 3 (only the last 2 matter) difficulty settings + a few more levels in the Lost Adventures DLC and I find it to be worth every penny.

'Orcs Must Die!' is a well designed indie game to play a fast round without thinking of playing 'CS: GO' instead.Desc:You have a portal with (dependent on difficulty level) 20 lifes, each orc getting into it decreases the life. You goal is to place traps/units and use magic to kill all the orcs without losing any life. At the end you gain skulls for each completed level to upgrade your traps/units. Easy as that.Pros:+ 'Pointless' killing orcs+ Humorously dialogs/story+ Awesome level design (no level is the same and each level has its own gimmicks)+ Active melee and ranged fight (sword / crossbow)+ Terrific trap and unit design (no pointless traps/units)+ 3 magical sections+ 3 levels of difficulty+ No Bugs/Glitches+ Downloadable Demo(+ Achievements [some are hard to get])(+ DLCs)Cons:- no Multiplayer (there was a lot of potential to have a MP implemented)- I would write more cons, if I would find some ^^Recommended, but only if it's on sale, because there is still the sequel 'Orcs Must Die 2!'.9/10 "

												An excellent Tower Defense, in Orc Must Die our goal is to kill orcs. The concept is simple, but the execution was ver good. This is basically a Third Peron shotter mixed with Tower Defense, and our goal is to defend our portal that is inside a castle. Orc Must Die has 24 levels, and everyone level has a different approach, in each level you will fight hundreds orcs. Now you must be thinking that you are alone on this fight, well no, you will have many traps and magic powers to help you on this journey. On the beginning of each wave you have unlimited time to prepare your set up. Since is the first wave you won't have too many coins but don't worry because on the firsts wave, archers and barrels are the perfect combo. Graphically speaking this game goes for a sort of cartoonish look that fits fairly well, also the OST does the job equally.If Orc Must Die has COOP - OMD2 has COOP - would be a much better experience. After i decreased my backlog a bit i sure want to re-play this game again! Recommend! ~ 7/10			"

												Orcs Must Die! is a nice twist on the traditional tower defence genre. Instead of building towers to defeat creeps (orcs), you set traps along their path. The game is played in third person view, so you can also kill orcs with your own spells and weapons too (similarly to Sanctum). OMD is exactly what it says on the box. You kill orcs in hundreds of different ways as they make their way to the end of the level. The premise is simple and it's fun to work out various strategies to kill orcs. Items, weapons, spells and weavers (special abilities) can all be used. Some levels are frustrating, though a bit of logical thinking goes a long way. The visuals are very smooth and fit into the laid back, humourous style of the game. The storyline and voice acting are a bit cheesy, but OMD doesn't take itself too seriously, which adds to the charm. Great game to play casually.			"

												Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself! Very child friendly but also mature and challenging enough for older audiences without seeming unfair.4/5One of the best tower defense games I've had the chance to play!			"

'Orcs Must Die!' is a well designed indie game to play a fast round without thinking of playing 'CS: GO' instead.Desc:You have a portal with (dependent on difficulty level) 20 lifes, each orc getting into it decreases the life. You goal is to place traps/units and use magic to kill all the orcs without losing any life. At the end you gain skulls for each completed level to upgrade your traps/units. Easy as that.Pros:+ 'Pointless' killing orcs+ Humorously dialogs/story+ Awesome level design (no level is the same and each level has its own gimmicks)+ Active melee and ranged fight (sword / crossbow)+ Terrific trap and unit design (no pointless traps/units)+ 3 magical sections+ 3 levels of difficulty+ No Bugs/Glitches+ Downloadable Demo(+ Achievements [some are hard to get])(+ DLCs)Cons:- no Multiplayer (there was a lot of potential to have a MP implemented)- I would write more cons, if I would find some ^^Recommended, but only if it's on sale, because there is still the sequel 'Orcs Must Die 2!'.9/10 "

												It's a trap! Well, quite a few of them actually. And you can upgrade them. Orcs Must Die! puts a proactive spin on the tower defense genre. Different enemy types require tactical thinking and you'll find yourself going back to older levels to try new stregies. Fun!			"

												A very fun defense romp. It feels a little more ""puzzley"" than Sanctum or Dungeon defenders, as opposed to hectic and shootery. Very well-crafted, and quite funny to boot. It's very hard to pull off an arrogant, irreverent, wise-cracking protagonist who doesn't just come across as obnoxious; but in this case, I think they did a great job.UPDATE: I found this game much more fun than the sequel, and if you're only going to play one of them, I recommend this one.

												Orcs must die? Definitely! Ever play Dungeon Defenders? Well, if you have, imagine this is the one where you play alone (a bloody pity) and you do not have to level up or get god-like weapons/pets. You do however, get a bookload of traps and handful of spells to massacre the orcs/ogres/gnolls/batties etc. In most circumstances, I actually had so much more fun with this than Dungeon Defenders (I mainly blame my overpowered Steam friends for it though).If you never played Dungeon Defenders, well, imagine this as another tower defence game but you get to jump in and massacre the orcs yourself. Spells/traps/archers, plenty of ways to do it =DNote though, it is a rather short/limited game and it is single player but the joy of seeing that your wonderfully laid traps have worked perfectly - always a fantastico moment! One indie game that totally deserves your attention!			"

												Trap defense game that pits you against hordes of orcs with each their unique abilities. At your disposal you have a number of traps and spells to keep them at bay. One of the best things I liked about this game is that on other tower defense games when that one straggler makes it past your defenses you have to just sit and watch as it wakes right into your nexus. On OMD you have the option to run over there and kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself! Very child friendly but also mature and challenging enough for older audiences without seeming unfair.4/5One of the best tower defense games I've had the chance to play!			"

												At first glance Orcs Must Die! looks like a Tower Defense game. In reality if you rely solely on towers to kill enemies you will lose very quickly. It's more of a hybrid Over-the-shoulder 3rd person action and Tower Defense game. Yes, increasingly difficult mobs lumber brainlessly toward an exit, but they may also try to kill you directly. Around half of your kills will come your main character using his trusty crossbow and spells than by the towers themselves.This is generally a good thing but if you're looking for a pure Tower Defense game this isn't it. It does however keep the action fast as you sprint around each level where you need to help bolster defenses on various ends of the map. You can't just ""set it and forget it"" for most levels.While the different traps are fun, they generally come in 3 flavors: Single use (the worst, dead after one trigger), episodic worse (deals damage and then cools down), and constant (best, constant damage to all enemies that traverse it). As later levels and difficulties feature tougher and more numerous monsters, you will have no choice but to use traps that deal constant damage, of which there are a limited amount. This makes many of the more entertaining and flavorful traps pushed to way side. There are at least 3 traps I never used.Regardless the game is still fun. Planning how to handle each wave and setting up a circuitous kill zone is extremely satisfying. The whimsical art style and humorous protagonist also helps things immensely. There's tons of replayability with multiple levels, 3 difficulty settings, and a decent expanion pack to boot. Well worth the sale price.			"

												Some games you can tell are going to be good from the first 10 minutes of playing them. Orcs Must Die is one of those games. From the moment you start playing, its slick presentation becomes very apparent, ranging from a charming artstyle, to nice fast-paced music, and a comedic tone. But presentation is not the only thing where the game shines. As a tower defence game it has some pretty ingenious trap ideas, such as trapdoors that release scorching flames, spring pads that launch orcs into the air, as well as acid bombs and even knights and archers. The level designs are also very well made, at times providing very obvious spots for where traps are ideal. And in addition to traps, you also unlock weavers, which are sorceresses that provide you with passive skills for the duration of the level. Upgrading these skills makes either your abilities or your traps/guardians more effective at what they do.At the end of each level, you get a score (which is shown against scores of people on your friends list) and a rating out of 5 skulls. You can then use the skulls to upgrade some of your traps.Overall the game was loads of fun. I've had a blast. Perhaps the only minor criticism I have is that when starting a new level that has more than 1 enemy entrances, it's often impossible to tell where the enemy is going to come through first. But it's a very small nitpick. The game is fun. If you like tower defence genre, get it now.			"

												Horrendously good fun. My main grievance is that the Warmage (the protagonist) is a complete idiot and the game takes every opportunity to beat you over the head with that fact. Fortunately you can mute the game so you don't have to listen to him. Another small issue I had was that there are occasionally little nuggets of exposition during the game, but you can barely hear them over the sound of orc giblets spraying across the level.Putting those issues aside the game rewards you with an army of orcs and associates to slaughter your way through with a variety of pokey, burny, zappy and crushy things. The score system gives you an incentive to go back to earlier levels with your new toys and make orcs die in new and interesting ways. You can approach each level in a variety of ways, so if you prefer setting up a death alley and watching the carnage from afar you can do so. But if you prefer getting up close and personal with a blade whilst a tar pit slows your enemies down, that's a valid option. Later in the game you unlock 'Weavers', giving you mid-game temporary upgrades for your traps and skills which add to the number of strategies you can use.I didn't have any technical issues with the game although on an older machine the game did slow down a little when a lot of enemies were around, but otherwise it runs well.Overall I'd recommend it to tower defense fanatics as well as action or strategy game fans.

Instead you run around like crazy, setting out traps for the bad Orcs and Ogres that burst out of the doors to save the world as a non-talented wizard apprentice. IMHO it's better than the second part as it's really pure and straight fun.			"

												Orcs Must Die! is a tower defense game where you are in control of the hero who will be fighting off Orcs and planting traps. The game plays like a 3rd person action game mixed in with the traditional tower defense formula. The player plays an extremely active role and your crossbow will be needed just as much as wall arrow traps. There are numerous traps at your disposal and you unlock more as you go along. By the end of my play through I ended up using just about every single trap. They are all designed very well and most of them work well with each other to produce great kill boxes.The game features three difficulties but you'll want to start on War Mage as you don't gain many skulls (the currency used to upgrade traps) on Apprentice (the easiest). At the end of each map you are awarded between 1 and 5 skulls based on your performance. Getting 5 skulls will require a significant amount of strategy (especially on Nightmare, although there's no achievement for getting all 5 skulls on all stages on Nightmare, just War Mage). You'll need to pretty much know what is going to come out and during what wave so that you can prepare adequately. YouTube is an excellent reference if you're having trouble and is great for learning new strategies that you may not have figured out on your own.There's not much more to the game outside of the general story mode but getting all 5 skulls on War Mage and Nightmare will take a while, making the game a great value considering it's already quite cheap. The game features leader boards so you can always go back one you've fully upgraded your traps and go for a better score on the global rankings or among your friends. Overall this is a great tower defense game that is well worth your time if you have any love for the genre. 8/10			"

The game is a lot of fun, but unlike the sequel, there’s no co-op gameplay :(You take on the role of a cocky student war mage trying to hold back the onslaught of orcs coming through into our world. The hero is pretty dumb, but fortunately the orcs are even dumber and their paths through each level are almost completely predictable. With your magic traps and artifacts (for casting spells) you need to make sure as few orcs as possible get to the end of the level and enter the rift (sometimes there’s more than one rift to defend). The game is broken up into individual levels, each with a different map, and on each map can be multiple orc entrances and exit rifts. At the start of each level you are given unlimited time to run around and see the layout, as well as set up your loadout (which traps or spells you can use during the level). Once you’ve started the game you cannot change your loadout, you’d have to restart the whole level. You have a ton of traps to choose from, although a few of them aren’t much use and you’ll likely be sticking with the basics like wall arrows, tar pits, and barricades for most of the game. You’ll be facing only a few different kinds of orcs (fast runners, arrow shooters, ogres), but they’ll be coming in large numbers so the key to beating each level is channeling the orcs into choke points where you can use fewer numbers of traps. The traps cost money so you can’t just fill the map with them (and unlike many other tower defense games, you cannot upgrade the traps during the levels). The biggest difference though between Orcs Must Die and traditional tower defense is the fact that you the hero are on site blasting enemies alongside your traps. You’re armed with a reasonably powerful rapid fire crossbow that’s able to kill small numbers of the slow moving orcs, or the really fast runners that die in one shot. Your traps usually have cooldown times so you cannot rely on them to catch every orc. For example, a spike trap might only trigger every 5 seconds, and during those 5 seconds, more orcs might run over it. It’s up to you and your trusty crossbow to fill them with arrows while waiting for your traps to be ready again. Every level you beat unlocks a different trap type or spell (like fireball or lightning) so by the end of the campaign you’ll have a massive arsenal to choose from. Pros:+The difficulty ramps up slowly and gives you a chance to learn various strategies for tackling levels. In the meantime, enjoy the humor. “Oh no he di’nt” – Orc, as he’s knocked into lava+You can go back and replay levels with your newly unlocked traps and spells. The game tells you the top scores for each level that your Steam friends achieved. I’m not that competitive though, I just wanted to finish each level and see the story.Cons:-I mentioned the difficulty ramps up, and by the end some of the levels seem practically impossible to get max score if you’re trying the Nightmare difficulty.Overall, Orcs Must Die is a little known gem. The metacritic score is high, but nobody really talks about it. Some of the Steam achievements require mass grinding though, which is a little annoying. 9/10 "

												I was a staunch hater of the Tower Defense genre at the time of launch for this game. They were everywhere, everyone played it and I found them insanely pointless. Back then they were limited to simple wave-defending, waiting for inevitable death.After trying the demo, I bought the game immediately. Orcs Must Die! was (and still is, in my opinion) the high point of the Tower Defense genre.With amazing art, ingenious level design, creative traps and a hilarious main character whose idiotic banter can lighten even the darkest days, this game stands out among its many peers.

												Think Dungeon Defenders, but Single Player only, and more chaotic. Basically, you're this warmage guy that needs to defend these portals called Rifts, and you need to defend it from the orcs and other enemies that try to go through it.You can lay traps, place guardians, use a bow or sword, or even use magic such as fire, ice, lightning, or even wind to defeat the orcs.A pretty fun title overall, it has a good amount of replay value.

												Orcs Must Die! is third person a hilarious sit-game-com settled in fantasy medieval theme.Technically: the game is a fantasy / medievial ""tower"" defence + third person ""shoot everything that survived trap lines"", 30 traps, spells and weapons (total), mostly upgradable 20 (24?) levels to beat + a few in DLC, approx 10h of gameplay, nightmare difficulty, another 10h of gameplay, challanges - max score per level - 5-10h,Gameplay notes: The difficulty per wave grows with number and setup of enemies, and shrinking space for traps,  The enemies do not seem to have increased HP per wave, Most of levels are balanced so that the Mage needs both traps, spells and wepons to hold the line, Weapons require item slot, there are two in the game: sniping crossbow and melee blade staff, Spells require equipment slots and to use in the mission and mana to cast, Defender minions require item slot, and gold to place them, During a level the Mage can buy upgrade from one of three 'weavers': generic trap upgrade, spell upgrade, mixed upgrade. Traps cannot be directly upgraded during the level. They can be upgraded during the story. Some levels have two or more distanced attack paths, of which at least one must be fully secured with traps, No endless mode (can be found in OMD!2), It is possible to replay old levels with improved trap set for better score.All of the characters are stereotypic to the point of lunacy. The main hero, 'The Warmage' is a young, dumb lad.  Blindly convinced of his own awesomeness. He needs to prevent orcs from enering portals to our world (at which he is good)... and to figure out (at which he is terribly bad) a more permament solution.  His (former) Master shows up in the story by his memories. He was the last (failed) hope for the world, spare his student, but the only thing greater then his apprentice's ignorance, is his stupidity. The Sorceress (the prime enemy in the game), does not show up directly, but magically takes quarrels with the Warmage. Most of her arguments are attempts to insult the Warmage so that he can't figure that out (which is not that hard afterall).  Most of Warmage's speech are (futile) attempts flirt up the Sorceress, and show that he is the most handsome and awesome man in the area (which if of course true, as he is the only one). The orcs are main competitors for the price for The Best Cannon Fodder in video games: dumb, ugly, run and die in hundreds, have hilarious (though still dumb) speach lines, can be headshot-ed.General info OMD is settled in medieval-themed bastions / castle /  dungeons. There is only one level theme. Forget about cinematics. The storyline is presended via semi-animated drawings. This is a great idea and fits great into the game. The orcs, the Warmage and the traps have a bit grotesque, comic design. Again, this suits the overall game mood, and slows down graphics 'aging'. Amazing music. If you run into game OST, do buy it. I managed to get one from Humble Bundle.Any problems? Trap balance - some traps are simply better, some are just useless (Hint: use traps with large AOE and fast or no reload), Since trap upgrades are permament, The Warmage usually sticks with favourite set with little room for experiment. No co-op game (solved in OMD2) The super-arogant hero can be hard to get used to. The humor can be sometimes percieved as primitive. High emphasise placed on combat, it is not possible / extremly difficult to play only with the economy. First two levels in nightmate are... too nightmareish, the difficulty seems to be easier further. there are two levels in the game (including final), which must be simply learnt and played by hearth. In each wave the Mage must build traps in particular area, buy a proper upgrade and solo secure another corridor. Mispacing traps will leave the attacked corridor unsecured.Strong sides humor, nice character design, good overall ballance in map design, good balance of strategic / economic components in gameplay (unless you don't like action in tower defences), interesting maps, high 'replayablity', level score to be maxed.You should avoid the game, if you: dislike action in tower defence and prefer them to be purely economic, dislike arrogant and dumb protagonistsDo play if: don't mind thinking / action hybrid, look for a lot of fun, tend to max each level "

I got this one sale for something insanely cheap, and kept in in my library for a long time before I even got to play it. I'm sad I didn't boot it up until now. The game is a mix between a third person shooter (although there is a melee weapon) and some tower defense/strategy elements. As you successfully defend each level, you'll be able to unlock new magic/defenses/units/passive buffs and it is all really rewarding in the end. I would love it if this game was multiplayer, but even still in its current form, it is a blast to play around with.			"

												I wanted to give this game a legitimate chance before I wrote my review. I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.Play it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed)Avoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense 9/10 in my bookThe only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue			"

												Veridict: 9.0The protagonist will make you laugh your *ss off, while the tower defense style of this game will turn you into a fan of the genre. And if you are already a ""tower defense guy"", then this title is a must have.Despite it tower defense style, you can defeat most of the levels using only spells and weapons like a fire crossbow, a magic sword, bottles of acid and many other apparatus, just like a FPS/action game. Or even better, why not both? After you spread your vicious traps throughout the fortress' hallways you can equip one of your weapons of choice and slay any orc that pass through your killing machines.Orcs Must Die! have a wide variety of traps, weapons and spells that you can use to stop the hordes of orcs from entering the rifts, you'll play it on the role of the last (and funnier/dumber) War Mage alive, and your duty is to defend the order and protect the land of man from being invaded through the rifts.Fun is the only word capable of defining this game. And if you ended it and liked it, don't get emotional.. there's a sequel for this: Orcs Must Die! 2, so you can keep playing and slaying more and more orcs.			"

												How I got this game? It was on sale and I am sucker for sales. But still it is my personal best buy. Fun, addictive, constantly returning for more. Playing levels over, and over for one more skull, for using new traps on old levels, for finding more ways of stomping squishi `umans. I mean, ergh, stupid orcs. The best thing is you can play it for 15 minutes or for hours at the time depending of your own time scedule. THIS IS the great stres relase game. The commentaries of your character are always funny, and give him personality. which brakes the usual stereotypes in games, which is refreshing. GREAT FUN, WHAT SHOULD YOU ASK MORE FROM GAME? nothing, THATS RIGHT. You squishi ` umies...			"

												Orcs Must Die! (OMD!) is an absolutely fantastic addition from the indie developer, Robot Entertainment. It's a game that blends third-person action with tower-defense strategy. Casual and hardcore players alike should be drawn to OMD! given its uniqueness, exciting gameplay and its corky sense of humor.			"

												This hate-speech-disguised-as-tower-defense is just another example of anti-orc racism to add to the ever-growing pile. The orcs as portrayed in-game are dull and dimwitted creatures who walk straight into spike pits right after seeing their fellows impaled before their very eyes, a disgustingly prejudiced parody of these noble souls. Additionally, you play a single human against waves of orcs, a design decision that encourages speciesist imperialism in a decidedly unsubtle way.But I'm sure you'll agree the gameplay's a lot of fun, right Adolf?

												Good game, it's not the best of balanced TD game out there, as some traps are OP as hell (Swinging Mace) compared to others that are just pathetic (Steam Trap), but balance is good enough that it will let you beat stages in many different creative ways so not everything has to be so cookie cutter and boring.Now for some advice time for the new players who for some reason is reading this crap on my profile... any-who, your upgrade priorities should be Tar Trap, Barricade, Swinging Mace, and Archer Guardians, those are the GOD level tier of traps and bread and butter to everything.Other notable traps are your Brimstone, Floor Scorcher, Spike Trap, Spring Trap, Arrow Wall, and Grinder, these here are your second level of tier stuff so start upgrading them when you can.The rest of your traps can go suck it because they do in fact all suck. Also never ever ever leave home without your Lightning Ring and just stick with the Steel Weaver exclusively, because you ain't no♥♥♥♥♥♥Congrats you're a Pro now.Lastly... Good luck on beating some of my high scores :P			"

												Orcs Must Die is a drama of apocalyptic dimensions. You’ll run around killing them with a mixture of clever traps and third person shooting but this tower defense game is really the story of the poor Orcs that you decimate. Every Orc’s story is told with a hallucinatory intensity, whether they were tossed off a cliff by a spring, slowed by tar before being perforated by poison arrows, burned to a crisp by ground based fire traps, or stabbed to death by the merciless protagonist. Orcs may not be real, but their trials and tribulations have taught me more about the fragility and splendor that we call life.I can’t express how transformative this masterpiece is. Let’s be clear, it’s not just a masterpiece of the tower defense genre, but of humanity itself.  Orcs must die has turned me into a better person. As a result of this game I’ve decided to clean up my act. I will no longer leave spike traps on the floor lest my future offspring trigger them. Also, I will try being friendly with strangers rather than freezing and shattering them.   "

												Wow this game is addicting! Part shooter, part tower defense, this game is AMAZING! Not to mention hilarious! The point of the game is to defend Rifts, and to do this you must place traps on the floors, use magic, and your trusty crossbow. But the funny part comes with the way you can defeat the opposing Orcs. One way is to place Spring Boards on the floor that launch the orcs whereever you aim the board. This can result in humorous and deadly outcomes. Another example is the dialogue, just plain goofy! Plus....drum roll please....ACHIEVEMENTS!!! Yup another game with achievements to keep the gamer coming back for more slightly-stoopid bragging rights! Pick this game up! Its unique, funny, fun, and OMG FUN!!!			"

												I liked Dungeon Defenders a lot, but Orcs Must Die is even better. There is just something so incredibly satisfying to watch hordes of Orcs get blended in a maze of traps. From spikes on the ground or the walls, massive popup furnaces that churn walls of fire, milling barrels, rotating axes and the most epic weapon of them all in my opinion, the swinging mace. Or if you want to have some fun, the spring trap that makes them go airborn. You can either make them fly over the halls from one side to another using spring traps that face each other (it's just funny to do that :D ) or you simply throw them in lava or acid. Don't feel like blending the orcs? No problem, you can shoot them yourself with crossbow or use various other powers on them as well as place archers and knights that will fight for you. And when you think you exploited all the options, there are also powerup cards that give you special abilities like stronger player characteristics, stronger and faster traps or more powerful weapons. You invest some of the funds you have to buy traps into them and make yourself or the traps more efficient. Just awesome blend of FPS, lite RPG and tower defense. It's brilliant and i can't wait to play Orcs Must Die 2. Just have 3 more missions in the first game, but so far i'm totally in love with this game. Oh and unlike in the Dungeon Defenders, you can re-route their paths with barriers, so you can funnel them through one hallway to make your defending job easier, create a choking point where they all clutter together. It gives the game a proper tower defense feel and a lot more options to exploit on for maximum Orc blending power!The game engine is also fantastic. From what i can tell they are using their own engine, but it's super fast, looks really good and has really nice character physics (really love the way how player's dress is affected by the movement) as well as physics that affect the orcs. And they achieved all this without the stupid PhysX. Thumbs up for that! And all this packed with quite well placed humor and player character making fun of himself and the orcs. And the way how developers presented the main character as the most stupid person in the world. It's just really funny game as a whole and love it for that.And since there are so many different options to play through the maps with various approaches to horde control you can have countless hours of fun with the game. Highly recommended as i guarantee you countless hours of insane fun!			"

(you get alot of 1 liners while playing the game) and the game have an insane amout of replayability, especially if you are the kind of person that loves to complete a map ""perfectly"" like me (a perfectionist) at that point the game becomes more of a puzzle game when you try and figure out how you can kill all the enemies in the most cost efficient way possible and even if you aren't a perfectionist the game is still well worth its price if you ask me.I highly recommend this game :)			"

Game offers variety of traps to serve one's ""style"" - are you a direct damage dealer, tricky tactician, do you like traps to do all the work or do you like being engaged in a fight? These and many more options are offered. The variety of monsters, their stregnth, number in comparison with your abilities, traps and magic is well balanced. There are points in game where player must be very flexible. When you finish game, you can start with all upgrades and traps unlocked from previous run and do campaign from scratch. There are tougher monsters coming in already at start. This is sad, because I would welcome ability to play new game already on highest. I am not going to play again. Not because I wouldnt enjoy it, but because I have no time and want to finish other games, too. In short - great chillout game.			"

												Orcs Must Die! Is one of my favorite games to be honest! This game is filled with humor and has a really nice gameplay. The only drawback is that it's a pure solo game. Something which it's sequel Orcs Must Die! 2 remedies! you take the role of a warmage, protecting the world from invading hordes of Orcs, Gnolls, Ogres and other creatures wishing to enter our world through magical rifts. The story-line is actually quite nice. If you enjoy tower defense games then chances are good that you'll enjoy this game as well!			"

												It's tough to talk about this after having played 2, but here goes.I enjoyed this game enough when I first played it.  Some of the later levels get tough, and there are really only a few viable traps/weapon combos, but it works out.  There isn't a lot that I would say is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which is more than I can say for 2, but there also isn't much challenge, either.  Nightmare mode isn't necessarily hard, it just removes the strategy part of the game.  You're not given time to think/analyze/change placements, really.  I mean, yeah, that's hard, but it's also not really upping the difficulty in anyway.  Of course, maybe that's the best way to increase difficulty in a strategy game: removing much chance to strategize.There is, believe it or not, a story to this game.  I wasn't really aware of it for a while, but it's totally there and you might miss it if you're not paying attention.One quip I have is that things get redundant quickly, but whatcha gon' do.It's an alright game, good even, if a little stale/boring/dry at times.  Like I've indicated elsewhere, though, Two is an improvement in every way, from the interface to map design.  The addition of co-op was a much needed boost to OMD as well.If you skip this one you're not necessarily missing much.  A lot of the traps/dialogue/maps are carried over into two.  Still, this was an alright game.			"

												What you need to know about this game:It's a mix between third Person Shooter and Tower Defence game, where you are up agains a army waves apon waves of orcs and other creatures...The music is really good the grafics are cartoonie but well done, and the humor of the game is simply brilliant! (you get alot of 1 liners while playing the game) and the game have an insane amout of replayability, especially if you are the kind of person that loves to complete a map ""perfectly"" like me (a perfectionist) at that point the game becomes more of a puzzle game when you try and figure out how you can kill all the enemies in the most cost efficient way possible and even if you aren't a perfectionist the game is still well worth its price if you ask me.I highly recommend this game :)			"

												Orcs Must Die! is a mix of tower defense and a third person ""shooter"".Singleplayer onlyGraphics:     5/10The textures are quite simple. I know the game was intended to look like a cartoon, but if the developers added a few more details and colors, the game would look much better. Visually I like most of the enemies, but some of them have a truly awful design. For example: The animations of the dragon-like, winged ""things"" (enemies) fluttering in the air are far too static and the textures are not more than mediocre. The particle effects are very fitting for the game. The traps are well made, but in my opinion the look of the ""Shock Zapper"" trap doesn't fit its function. I suppose that's a matter of taste though. The details of the map are quite low, but this provides a certain overview that the game needs in order to keep the building site highly visible. I rate the graphics of the game as moderate.Sounds:     8/10They really did a good job here. The background music fits perfectly and enhances the game's quality a lot. The trap sounds are amusing and adequate. The only thing I really miss are enemy sounds. Yes, there are enemy sounds, but you will hear them quite rarely. With the orcs being silent you can't really tell when they appear behind you. It may not be that important because the developers added a minimap, but that's a missed opportunity to make the game a little bit better.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     9/10Both killing orcs with your weapon and with the traps is a lot of fun. The developers offer you a nice arsenal to protect the magical rifts. Spike traps, shocker, mushrooms, floor scorchers, archers and much more will help you slaying the orcs. The only thing what I really miss are really interesting weapons besides the crossbow and the alchemist bombs. The controls are easy to handle and building traps is no trouble at all.Level design:     5/10On the one hand the developers built some well structured tower defense maps (which isn't that hard I guess), on the other hand they really missed to add more details. You have the same wall and floor colors in almost every level. I would say you could rebuild those levels in minecraft with a good texture pack and it would look almost the same.Enemies/AI:     4/10The AI is - what a surprise - really poor. But I honestly didn't expect a complex AI from a tower defense game. So I will skip the rating for the AI and take a closer look at the enemy diversity. Besides the normal orcs there are big tough ogres, fast little kobolds, fast gnolls and flying creatures. The game doesn't actually need more enemies, but why did they just recycle the enemies and put a ""frost-"" ""fire-"" and ""armored-"" prefix to avoid designing more creatures?This kind of recycling is not necessary. 4/10.Story:     3/10Yes, it actually has a story. I was surprised. The hero is a sorcerer's apprentice who is now in charge of protecting the magic rifts (teleporters to the world) from the orcs because his master is dead who protected the magic rifts before. It's not quite a story, but a reason to fight against the orcs. I think I will give 3 points for the good attempt and the humor.Critic summary:     5.5/10Personal fun rating:     7/10     [good game]Well. It's a funny little game. No big title, but worth 5 bucks.I finished the game and I don't regret it.If you like tower defense games this might be an option.			"

												When I was young, I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre.Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game.Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders.Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.

												A variation of tower defense where you have to place traps to defend cores from invading monsters. While there's lots of toys (with new ones being thrown at you every level), some get left in the dust/unused (boom barrel, steam trap), while others get progressively more broken as the game goes on (archers, paladins, decoys). My biggest complaint is it's missing the stat tracking most tower defenses have to help you maximize your gold usage,  leaving you to guesswork if your traps are laid out properly. The maps are uniquely constructed, often requiring specific tactics to clear effectively, making each map tense and engaging. About a third of your arsenal are weapons for your character which keeps you in the action most of the time, unlike most games in this genre.With 24 maps you're looking at a sizable tower defense game with plenty of crossbow-twitching, fireball-slinging, ice-shattering orc carnage.

												Must orcs die!? And why is the death of ogres and gnolls a foregone conclusion of this? The title's inherent racism is not really questioned at any point. The only option towards a peaceful resolution is to buy drugs that become available late in the game and which you can never afford enough of to avoid bloodshed anyway. The player character is a smug, chauvinistic jock who relishes in the slaugher of people of different skin tones. Utterly disgusting.Servicable gameplay though if you can look past the developer's obviously politically inspired agenda behind this game.			"

												This review was written after I beat the game.Fun and reasonably challenging. The dialogue, voice acting, and story, though sparse, are pretty funny, too. Each level is really a puzzle to be solved - there's not necesarilly a ""correct"" solution for how to place your traps, but there's ""aha"" moments when you discover a feature of the level that makes a certain setup very effective. The fact that you get to control a hero makes the gameplay much more fun - you can have a big impact on the enemy waves with skilled shooting and use of the various magic spells.There's plenty of replayability in competing on the leaderboards or among your friends for a high score.My one major complaint is that several of the levels have a split design where you can't force all of the enemies through one choke point, so you have to split up your attention between them or set up lots of traps and hope they're working well enough. It's kind of annoying to mentally deal with this and spend time running back and forth. I understand the point of the game is to be mentally challenging, but this task is more mentally exhausting than it is fun.I also don't like that you aren't told in advance exactly what enemies will be coming through which doors before each round. If you want to go for really good scores, it's just an unnecesarry and un-fun memorization tax upon you to remember each wave.			"

												A variation of tower defense where you have to place traps to defend cores from invading monsters. While there's lots of toys (with new ones being thrown at you every level), some get left in the dust/unused (boom barrel, steam trap), while others get progressively more broken as the game goes on (archers, paladins, decoys). My biggest complaint is it's missing the stat tracking most tower defenses have to help you maximize your gold usage,  leaving you to guesswork if your traps are laid out properly. The maps are uniquely constructed, often requiring specific tactics to clear effectively, making each map tense and engaging. About a third of your arsenal are weapons for your character which keeps you in the action most of the time, unlike most games in this genre.With 24 maps you're looking at a sizable tower defense game with plenty of crossbow-twitching, fireball-slinging, ice-shattering orc carnage.

												Orcs Must Die! is a mix of tower defense and a third person ""shooter"".Singleplayer onlyGraphics:     5/10The textures are quite simple. I know the game was intended to look like a cartoon, but if the developers added a few more details and colors, the game would look much better. Visually I like most of the enemies, but some of them have a truly awful design. For example: The animations of the dragon-like, winged ""things"" (enemies) fluttering in the air are far too static and the textures are not more than mediocre. The particle effects are very fitting for the game. The traps are well made, but in my opinion the look of the ""Shock Zapper"" trap doesn't fit its function. I suppose that's a matter of taste though. The details of the map are quite low, but this provides a certain overview that the game needs in order to keep the building site highly visible. I rate the graphics of the game as moderate.Sounds:     8/10They really did a good job here. The background music fits perfectly and enhances the game's quality a lot. The trap sounds are amusing and adequate. The only thing I really miss are enemy sounds. Yes, there are enemy sounds, but you will hear them quite rarely. With the orcs being silent you can't really tell when they appear behind you. It may not be that important because the developers added a minimap, but that's a missed opportunity to make the game a little bit better.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     9/10Both killing orcs with your weapon and with the traps is a lot of fun. The developers offer you a nice arsenal to protect the magical rifts. Spike traps, shocker, mushrooms, floor scorchers, archers and much more will help you slaying the orcs. The only thing what I really miss are really interesting weapons besides the crossbow and the alchemist bombs. The controls are easy to handle and building traps is no trouble at all.Level design:     5/10On the one hand the developers built some well structured tower defense maps (which isn't that hard I guess), on the other hand they really missed to add more details. You have the same wall and floor colors in almost every level. I would say you could rebuild those levels in minecraft with a good texture pack and it would look almost the same.Enemies/AI:     4/10The AI is - what a surprise - really poor. But I honestly didn't expect a complex AI from a tower defense game. So I will skip the rating for the AI and take a closer look at the enemy diversity. Besides the normal orcs there are big tough ogres, fast little kobolds, fast gnolls and flying creatures. The game doesn't actually need more enemies, but why did they just recycle the enemies and put a ""frost-"" ""fire-"" and ""armored-"" prefix to avoid designing more creatures?This kind of recycling is not necessary. 4/10.Story:     3/10Yes, it actually has a story. I was surprised. The hero is a sorcerer's apprentice who is now in charge of protecting the magic rifts (teleporters to the world) from the orcs because his master is dead who protected the magic rifts before. It's not quite a story, but a reason to fight against the orcs. I think I will give 3 points for the good attempt and the humor.Critic summary:     5.5/10Personal fun rating:     7/10     [good game]Well. It's a funny little game. No big title, but worth 5 bucks.I finished the game and I don't regret it.If you like tower defense games this might be an option.			"

												When I was young, I played a lot of tower defence games in Warcraft 3. But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre.Combining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game.Set in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.For that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders.Every level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.Using the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.Having a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).It isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.

												Fun fact: I dislike Tower Defense games for being boring, repetitive and unpersonal. Oh, and boring, just to mention it again.Another fun fact: Orcs Must Die is NOT a tower defense game, even though it could easily be mistaken for one. But I would rather consider it a 'Tactical Defense TPS'. You're not a commander building towers, you're a guy building traps which are meant to aid you in wrecking Orcs. Lots of them. And boy, it's fun.Let's begin with the art style and sound. Both are fluent, coherent and quite fine. I won't say superb, because the game obviously is neither an AAA title nor top-actual, but it's well above what would be necessary as a minimum.A big point of the game is it's humor, that clearly hit my favour. Whether it's Orc's philosophing and quoting famous memes, or the utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-charming protagonist, or his even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologues, the game makes you chuckle. Whilst orc's get gibbed left and right.Which is literally all this game is about: Killing orcs in the most fashionable/efficient/hilarious way possible. You got a wide array of different traps, weapons and champions at your disposal, and often the level'S themselves have special environmental hazards, high bridges ideal to kick orcs off from, lava pits...Even as an enemy of TDGs, the game was great to play.Which leads us to it'S only downside: 'was'. The game is terribly short. I've beaten the entire campaign + bonus missions at this point, with a perfect completion on about 75% of all levels (many of those on first try). Yes, there is a 'Nightmare' difficulty, but I'm not sure whether I will go for that or rather switch to the sequel ofthis game instead.But hey, it's a budget game,so we can't exspect 40h playtime, can we?Result: 8/10 Solid and extremely satisfying way to waste time. ^^			"

												Wow, the tower defense titles these days actually improve on what is already a fun game genre. In Orcs Must Die you control a warmage, in third person view. So instead of building traps in an isometric sort of  view, you now run around setting up traps and actively killing enemies with your character. There's never a dull moment and the fact that you gain new traps after finishing a level gives incentive to keep playing. You'll want to come back for more, it's THAT fun.Other than that, the game mechanics are pretty much the same as any other tower defense game; you kill enemies, earn cash, upgrade traps, and try to prevent enemies from taking over your rifts.Only downside, in my opinion, is that it's a single-player affair. I'm sure it would've been more fun when played in co-op mode but maybe that's something for the sequel.Don't let that stop you from buying it though ![Rating: 87/100]			"

												Orcs Must Die is easily my favorite downloadable title for 2011. Why? Because it takes classic tower defense and makes something new, innovative, and fun out of it. The game blends third person action with tower defense strategy creating a very unique experience. The game is very well designed on that regard, meaning that it is impossible to beat a level using only traps or only spells (you must use both). You play as a War Mage able to use spells and weapons to stop the Orcs from entering the Rift. You also have the ability to lay traps throughout the environment. Each trap is uniquely designed and offers different gameplay elements. Some examples of traps are tar traps to slow enemies, swinging maces, spike traps, arrow wall traps, etc. You play a good amount of levels progressing through a very simple but entertaining storyline. Overall, Orcs Must Die offers a very new and unique experience for Tower Defense fans. To put it simply, if you like tower defense, GET THIS GAME!			"

												Orcs Must Die! is an orc racism simulation. You play as a white guy, the apprentice of another white guy, and spend literally the entire game killing orcs. That's super racist! I mean, it's not like it's sort of racist or anything like that. The name of the game is ""Orcs Must Die!"" It's not ""Orcs Must Die if Convicted of a Capital Crime"" or ""Orcs Must Die if it is Necessary to Employ Lethal Force in the Course of Self Defense"" or ""Orcs Must Die if they are Soldiers in a Justly Fought War"" or anything like that. Replace ""Orcs"" with any other race in the title and you'd have a lawsuit on your hands! The only reason this game isn't banned in Germany is because nobody cares about orcs. I give this game 13 out of 16 race riots.			"

Do you like any combination of the the above 3 questions?5. Do you like shooting orcs in the face?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then get Orcs Must Die!, and trust me you'll have a blast. It's challenging, fun and the dialouge is funny. Worth it all the way.			"

												I am not a fan of tower defense games, but this game (and it's sequel) give a refreshing spin on the genre. It combines 3rd person shooter with tower defense. This allows you to actively participate in the defense. You'll be shooting down enemies while managing your defenses.The level design gives you enough choice to try out different tactics. Sometimes there is one obvious tactic. Other times you have to try out different combos. Even though not all traps are as powerful/balanced, you can't always use the same traps. This gives enough variation through out the game.Orcs Must Die 2 adds a few new features:+ Co-op+ Endless Mode+ New playable class (mage)+ More customization			"

												A unique twist of the Tower Defense genre of games using traps instead of towers and 3rd person action. You are encouraged to use a crazy mix of traps and spells to rack up ridiculous combos and kill streaks. With 24 Levels, plenty of trap, weapon and spells, 3 upgrade trees and a lot of orcs and other nasties to slay, for $14.99 you cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.			"

												It might be easy to dismiss OMD! as a FPS/tower defence variant reliant on its tongue-in-cheek humour and simple gameplay to appeal. While these are two of its key strengths, there is far more to OMD! however; it has very well designed levels, plenty of weapon choices and types of enamy, as well as many different potential styles of play. Nightmare difficulty (available after the campaign has been completed) requires particular dexterity and speed of thought and adds further longevity to the mix. All that said, the real reason this game is recommended by so many people is that killing the titular orcs is immensely good fun. Eviscerating an orc wondering whether its parking has been validated as its friend explodes a day before it is due for retirement (the back stories courtesy of the grumbles the orcs utter as they amble towards you) frankly never gets old. Having just completed Nightmare with over thirty thousand kills to my name, I can safely say I would happily sign up to melt, crush, shoot, detonate, squash, burn and generally mangle the little gits all over again. Given this was released in 2011 it comes on sale quite often and is definitely worth a go.			"

												Game with the best tutorial in history!  ""Hm... How does this trap work?"" No problem at all! Before you start  phase you get to see exactly how the trap works:  1) trap  2) orc 3) trap + orc= burned/slashed/thrown in air  The only bad thing for me is that the orcs just mindlesly run around following same patern.

												A unique twist of the Tower Defense genre of games using traps instead of towers and 3rd person action. You are encouraged to use a crazy mix of traps and spells to rack up ridiculous combos and kill streaks. With 24 Levels, plenty of trap, weapon and spells, 3 upgrade trees and a lot of orcs and other nasties to slay, for $14.99 you cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.			"

												With a title like that how is one supposed to refuse?  Ok it's actually rather fun.  For the seasoned tower defense expert it's a rather fun 3D variation.  Tower Defense for the uninitiated is at it's best a grid based puzzler.  Choose how and where to defend utilising resources you earn.  The more experianced you become, the more traps and defenses you can place.  It's biggest failing is that there is no autofire.  Constantly having to slam the mouse button to fire an arrow or whack a sword becomes a little tiring.  Would I reccommend it?  Yes I would on a steam sale, simply for the fun sounds and indie humour, dotted around endearing orcy goodness.  A quick level now and again, is what makes a solid indie hit.  Without the ""just one more go"" deliciousnous of games like this, we'd forget the simple pleasure of gaming.			"

												One of the most addictive and energetic games I have played lately is Orcs Must Die. At first I was somewhat alarmed by the fact of non-stop killing with the help of various mechanisms, but when I started to play it I was totally absorbed in the process. It can be classified as Tower Defense game, but among other rivals in this type of computer games it is IMHO one of the best.  The aim of Orcs Must Die is very simple – not to let hordes of orcs, trolls and the like into our world. You are given a tower with one or several portals to be defended from numerous waves of monsters. Upgrading from level to level you are also provided with new different devices, skills, mechanisms, as well as earning money to money to buy ambushes and modernize them. The two most brilliant features of the game are in my opinion the highest level of action tension (what I feared most while playing is that somebody of my household would call me for something) and the elements of tactics and strategy.read more http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/orcs-must-die-2767/ "

												I don't understand all the fuzz about this game. Bought it in a promotion with all DLCs for like 5bucks but even so it is not worth it. I had fun the first few levels but it got old very quickly. I finished all maps (including DLC) in nightmare+5skulls and the only feeling I have is that I wasted 30hours of my life. Most of the levels, namely on nightmare, are more a game of ""find-out-the-only-strategy-and-loadout-that-works-in-this-map-lol-screw-fun"" than a real game. In a lot of maps there is only a winning strategy - not a balanced game for different types of playrs/loadouts.If you want a tower defense / shooter hybrid get SANCTUM, not this pile of crap.			"

			You can get the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/102600 A non-biased quick look @ 'Orcs Must Die' - A superb 'Tower Defense' game that will have you coming back for more.		

Slice them, burn them, skewer them, and launch them - no matter how you get it done, orcs must die in this fantasy action-strategy game from Robot Entertainment. As a powerful War Mage with dozens of deadly weapons, spells, and traps at your fingertips, defend twenty-four fortresses from a rampaging mob of beastly enemies, including ogres, hellbats, and of course, a whole bunch of ugly orcs. Battle your enemies through a story-based campaign across multiple difficulty levels, including brutal Nightmare mode! Will you roast orcs in pits of lava, pound them flat with a ceiling trap, or freeze and shatter them with a slash? No matter the weapons and traps you choose, you’re sure to have an orc-killing blast!  - Highly Recommended! "

												I think this game is a sin... yes a straight up  biblical sin; it's  far too fun to be anything but sinful, wrong or cancer causing. I'm serious. There is nothing I can find to dislike about this game. The graphics are crisp. even in the pitch melee you can always pick out high priority targets, the music is very nice for the background and the sounds ... on the slicing of metal and the funny wails of agony never sounded so good.It is also frustratingly difficult at times, don't be fooled by the early missions, it starts ramping up fast but it's a good challenge, the sort that has you reformulating your strategy when you lose and dancing when you win.There's also the humor... it is actually funny to listen to the voice overs at time, it sounds like something Blizzard would have done about 8 years back.. around the time of Warcraft 2/3...you know.. before they stopped making games and started designing payment portals..Give it a try, you won't regret it.  Defense with a twist. Now if you'll excuse me... I have a bridge to mine with catapult traps.			"

												Tower defence at its finest, intuitive gameplay and a lot of replay value. The only reason this is getting a negative review is because at this point you're better off buying the sequel OMD2. It has everything this game has and more.			"

												No built in key bindings. Big convoluted mess to try to get the game working with your own key bindings. On top of that, you can't even have a controller or something your PC THINKS is a controller plugged in to make it work correctly. Not worth the time and effort when there's a ton of other games out there to play. If I hadn't gotten this in a bundle (not to mention hadn't spent over 2 hours of game time trying to get it to WORK), I'd refund the heck out of it. This should not be acceptable. I can't believe how many positive reviews this has. It boggles the mind.			"

												I had difficulty getting into this, especially after having playing Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with a friend.  Many of the levels, it seems, require you to run back and forth between two different entrances.  In co-op this works marvelously (10 of the original maps can be played in the second title in the series), as each player can hold an entrance, calling the other when things get hairy.  The number of weapons and traps is also less than the second game.  Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, but at the very least, perhaps this review will be helpful to others who are tempted to visit the first game after trying the sequel.			"

												It's an action Tower Defense game. You place traps then you help shooting monsters down before they reach the goal.Buy the second one. Skip this one. The second even has most maps from this game, and has co-op which is missing here. Feels more like an incomplete and simple game.			"

												OMD is an entertaining, furiously addictive mixture of 3rd person shooter and tower defense, with a splendid soundtrack that perfectly compliments the frantic action.   You play as the rather dense but ♥♥♥♥♥ure Warmage, who must defend the magical Rifts from untold numbers of marauding orcs, using an array of traps, guardians, spells and weapons.   The main game of achieving a 5-skull rating (no orcs escaping, within a par-time) on all maps is a good challenge - which further fuels your abilities at large-scale orc maiming, as skulls can then be spent to upgrade your equipment.   Slaying the hordes is plenty fun enough, however therein also lies a complex combo-system adding much further depth of play, where the more traps and their afflictions hit an orc, the higher the combo-points, thus making every map replayable to experiment and chase that higher score.   Crisp graphics, great voicing, music, humour and still packed with pure, fun gameplay that's as good on a pad as with a mouse.   Quality arcade action that's only surpassed by it's more content heavy sequel, yet still worth playing first.			"

												Orcs Must Die is at its core a tower defense game, but in 3D, with a below average FPS element. If you are a fan of tower defense games, I'm sure you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of the game, since there is a lot of content.If you are a FPS gamer however, you'll probably get bored very quickly, as I did. Orcs Must Die was probably never intended to compare to ""real"" FPS games, and as such, the combat, difficulty, and enemy diversity and adaptation is lacking when you compare it.It's really annoying that you can only recommend a game, or not. If you are tower defense player, Orcs Must Die is amazing value. If you are an FPS gamer, Orcs Must Die is disappointing.			"

												An escalating dungeon defense game. Fun at first, but like virtually ALL defense games, the enemies strength grows faster than your capacity to defend and eventually you'll lose because of bad math and no other reason. If you're looking at this and really into the idea though, I highly recommend you check out Dungeon Defenders 2 instead, it's multiplayer and very very well balanced.			"

												Gib is short for giblets(pronounced jib or jiblets), yet this game chooses to pronounce giblets as if it were trying to say Gibbon. By forcing people to purchase the first game to get the complete ""complete"" orcs must die 2 and displaying how green they are with ordinary gamespeak, thumbs down, just play their grindy F2P game that they cut PVP out of because it was too fun and hard to balance so they said lets focus on PVE because we suck. But really this is probably the best one, physics are full storm and aren't nerfed like in 2 but you can't get the complete OMD2 unless you buy this game as well, so that isn't even a complete version of the game even though they're selling it as such.

												An okay tower defense game. Gets boring very quickly, but to be honest I really dislike the genre, hence why I might be prejudiced. If you like tower defenses, ignore my review, otherwise I recommend to pass on this one. It's just building traps and watching enemies walk into them and die. Sure, the game provides some challenge, but the gameplay itself is just setting up traps as quickly as possible and shooting some enemies from time to time.			"

And while this is not appearant at first.

												It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it. The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2			"

												Orcs Must Die is one of my least favorite games. I think this would be a great game if it was sort of  like Torchlight II.  You really need a pet or an ally to help you.  This game reminds me of an old game called Lemmings.  It was impossible for me to prevent the Orcs from destroying everything.  I never could master the gameplay.  The demo was fun to play.  The rest of the game was a nightmare.			"

												While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws.  Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two.  Pick one, devs.  Difficulty or ease.As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables.In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly.  So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!?  Why can't we simply rely on weapons?  Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other.  You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps.Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.			"

There are ~25 traps, spells and weapons at your disposal to take out the Orcs any way you can. The most fun part is mixing and matching between the different combinations of traps, spells, weapons and skill trees to find the best way to tackle each map. Highly recommended!			"

												The game can easily be summed up by its title. Orcs Must Die is about making a large amount of orcs into a large amount of dead orcs (and orc pieces). Of course, there's more to it than simply ""Use crossbow on orc"" as there are a number of fiendish traps, magic, and AI guardians that you can employ, making it something akin to a tower-defence game. There's more focus on action, though, as you're encouraged to jump in and do your part in causing a bit of death and dismemberment of your own. On top of it all is a somewhat basic story, though there is so much character and humor packed in that it still seems fresh and entertaining. To call the game ""mindless fun"" would be a little misleading as there is some strategy involved in trap placement and personal upgrades, but the real fun lies in watching a group of clueless orcs wandering towards a corridor full of all manner of blades and spikes and being reduced to ""orc salsa"" while you giggle softly to yourself.

												There aree dirty dirty orcs coming into your castle. Take a spin on tower defense by defending your tower with a custom job of sikes, traps, and magical weapons. Pretty much to the point with what it offers. Simple functions for a game that's more of a pallet clenser from larger games, or if you just want to blow some time with a casual game.Get it if your a fan of tower defense.			"

												There's so many positive things I can say about Orcs Must Die. It's a game which won't disappoint even the most hard to please gamer, as It's packed with so much fun, humour, and thought.Orcs Must Die is more or less the same as Plants vs Zombies. It's a game where you must place traps in order to stop the horde of enemies from reaching their goal, and every new level brings a new trap. With every new trap of course brings a new enemy, so be prepared for this when organising your traps.Aswell as traps you can also use magic, and choose upgrades through-out the various levels through a card system.Being as this is the first game from Robot Entertainment, I give this game a big 10/10. There isn't many people who won't enjoy this game. It's pretty hard to find weak points. There's few bugs, has good graphics, and overall perfect gameplay.Pick this awesome game up at any opportunity. You won't regret it.			"

												Orcs Must Die is a third person tower defence game. You play as the magicians apprentice and you must stop the Orcs from reaching the Rift, which is a portal to your universe.Each level the Orcs break through the doors (or fly through holes in the ceiling) and make their way to the Rift coming in waves. You lay traps in their path, from spiked floors to swinging blades the Orcs blunder through your traps becoming so much meat and with each death you get more money to place more traps. Of course should you get bored of watching them die you can enter the fray yourself firing either a rapid fire crossbow or engaging in melee. Once you complete the level you get skulls based on how well you did which you use to purchase and upgrade traps.This game is pretty good, if a little repetitive and the difficulty really ramps up in the later levels, especially if you haven't got the right traps or upgraded them enough. It's very satisfying to see a horde of Orcs be decimated as they wander through your traps, all the while never firing a single shot yourself.For £6.99 it's a great game, well worth the price. "

												Gameplay is similar to tower defense games, but instead of towers, you defend rifts. You prevent orcs from crossing the rifts by setting up traps AND fighting them using your crossbow/blade/spells (3rd Person). You can also customize your warmage (minor spoiler) by using the weavers, which give specific boosts whether you prefer casting spells or being crafty with traps.Highly recommended for the casual gamer, it's easy to pick up and go. Maps typically has 15 rounds which take no more than 3-5 minutes each (much faster if you are good)			"

The controls are solid and traversal of levels is easy.Graphics: Good, runs on most anything.Aesthetic: Interesting, lends itself to the game's unique humor.Music/Sound: The music isn't the greatest, and the Archer and Paladin lines get EXTREMELY irritating.

												Quite fun game, but rather short. Beat the Normal difficult within 10 hours or so. Even then, the hardest difficulty proves very challenging and I can see beating it taking a lot longer. I'd give it a 85/100 or so, but if it's on sale, grab it for sure.			"

												Another excellent tower defense-shooter hybrid game. Unlike Sanctum, though, this is third-person and emphasizes the action portion. Instead of spending time building mazes and giving your towers assistance, you will be doing most of the killing in this game, assisted by your traps. Highly recommended.			"

												It's Lord of the Rings meets Sanctum in this brilliant action/tower defense game. From the moment you lay your first trap you will be drawn in by the distinctive characters. As the title implies there is only one objective, you must kill every last orc that charges into your keep. The myriad of traps at your disposal, as well as your keen sword and spells, get this task done with prejudice. It's wickedly entertaing and slightly demented watching the orcs hurl themselves into spinning blades and explosive barrels, all the while taunting you and laughing about their impending victory. I had childish glee when the hero started trash talking back. For a game with only one hero and a handful of enemy types it is dripping with charm and style. However it is not without minor issues. The animations could use a little more work and the single minded gameplay won't last forever, but these are barely worth mentioning. The dark sense of humor and the variety of death mark this as a must play8/10			"

												Tower defense with strategy. Rather, it's strategy using tower defense. The ""towers"" aren't so much towers as they are traps. Oil traps, impaling traps, arrow traps, launcher traps, and so on. Set them up at the right spots, and watch the orcs go flying back the way they came, or dying on the spot.Oh, and don't forget to listen to what they say while you're killing them, or what your character says while he's killing them. That's always amusing.			"

The dialogue is surprisingly funny and adds a bit of zest to the already-fun task of creating the world's least orc-friendly castle hallways.Tip: Use a row of wall blades and tar pits (with some barricades, if necessary) to create a single-file orc slaugherhouse. It's as much fun to build as it is to watch in action.			"

												With Orcs Must Die!, the game starts off slow and seems to get quicker and more faster paced as you gain experience and get access to more abilities.  Graphics are nice in this game as well.  It Does seem to get a bit tedious after a long while and the pace at which the orcs spawn and rush in increases. If you do not have a lot of time to be able to play because of work, schooling or family schedules but would like to spend 15 min, 30 min or an hour just relaxing, I would recommend this game.   So overall this game is enjoyable, especially if you dont always have tons of time on your hands.			"

												This game is AWESOME. Extremely well-polished singleplayer experience full of humor and fun.The art, the audio, the gameplay, it's all quite solid and well-executed. The maps are significantly varied in layout (though not so much in art style) and all leave room for different strategies and play styles. The game really starts to open up as you unlock more abilities as you progress through the campaign.I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy singleplayer, action games, and/or tower defense games. There are some pretty crazy sales for it, but honestly I would still feel like I've gotten my money's worth at full price.The DLC is definitely worth buying if it's on sale, but maybe hold off if it's full price and you haven't fallen in love with the game yet.

Recommended 5/5!Orcs Must Die! is a really well made and optimised game. The graphics are adorable yet not too cartoony. The animations of the enemy and the main character are funny. Music and sounds fit perfectly into the game but after some battle, the same battle music might get boring. Even a ""low-end"" PC can play it well. The game mechanics are well engineered. You are controlling an apprentice Warmage. On every map, the enemy attacks in waves and you have to use Traps and spells to stop them. Don't judge in advance, its not a simply Tower Defense game. It is kinda complicated because you have some kind of a talent trees. 3 of them. This way, you can costumize your gameplay so its not the same every time (You can focus on traps, guardians or spells). There are 25 levels and 3 game difficulty. The Nightmare mode is really challenging and you will enjoy completing the game in Nightmare. Some achievements are hard to achieve but definitely doable. You have to finish the game in Nightmare mode. It took me 20 hours to get every achievement.Spoiler:There is a background story but nothing fancy. You are an apprentice Warmage as I said before. Your master died and every other Warmage is being killed by a mysterious enemy which will be revealed. Of course you save every castle and close every rift. You save the world but without the rifts, there are no magic left. "

												Highly recommended! If you enjoy tower defense or are a fan of Dungeon Defenders, this humorous game cranks up the difficulty accordingly as you go along and offers an abundance of towers and weapons to use. While the DLC is debatable (you definitely want the map pack, though), the grenade-like acid weapon in the weapons pack makes things a little easier and gives you a reason to use your mana. So, pick this up while it's still cheap!			"

												Orcs Must Die gets a place right there next to my beloved Defense Grid and Sanctum! This isn't marketed as a Tower Defense game, but any fans of the genre will love this professionally developed defense game. This game evenly balances the importance of you being in the fray, and being thoughtful about your traps. You choose (and upgrade) your loadout before going into battle, and the options are so well varied that you can approach things with a variety of different options. The overall ""feel"" of the game from combat mechanics to funny storyline are all exceptionally fun. Plus, like the great aforementioned games, this game leave plenty for you to improve upon and goals to pursue. Oh, and the difficulty curve is a great match to my tastes which is rare (gets genuinely difficult).			"

												Variety is what keeps this third-person tower defense game going. With the myriad scenarios and cartoonishly gruesome methods of dispatching orcs at your fingertips, it's hard to put down. My only gripe with Orcs Must Die! is that there doesn't appear to be any sort of multiplayer mode or level editor, things that would vastly increase the game's replayability. However, despite being a single player game it's very entertaining. Even after you beat it the surprisingly deep combo/scoring system will keep you coming back for more as you try to inch your way up the leaderboards.			"

												It's fun, but personally I prefer Sanctum.In orcs must die, there's no coop, which I find really saddening. The paths are also pretty much set, and my hand's going to die from carpal tunnel from the amount of clicking I have to do with my crossbow at times D: (no hold LMB to fire; you have to repeatedly click, and your crossbow fires like a submachine gun).It's difficult at times, but overall I sort of dislike the lack of path freedom. Sure you can build barricades, but those don't hold up to well. In sanctum, you can actually build the path that the enemies are going to take.However, it has alright graphics, and seems like it will have an adequate campaign length; I haven't finished yet.			"

												I simply have to share a quick review/opinion on this game stating that despite its rather silly visage and initial portrayal, it is really one of the most fun-packed and relatively easy to pick up games that I've played in a while. A perfect game to fire up on an off-hour to let off some steam murdering pesky orcs in every single way you could ever imagine. It delivered everything it promised and more, with the possibility for what seems like some rather deep strategy and cooperative gameplay later in the game aswell. I still have to play more to form myself a perfect opinion on the game, but still felt that I had to give my highest regards to the creators of this games already, and to highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a bit of a fun fast-paced thought-requiring time sink.

												It is an intensly fun game to play, with great humor, and strategy to boot. I like graphics and the mechanics of the game, as it drives the focus on simply killing orcs, yet you must build the skills required to set the appropriate traps on a given map; failure to do so means your DEFEAT, to only have to try it again.  I give the game a 9.9 out of 10: I never thought I would have this much fun with a game such as this.			"

The controls are solid and traversal of levels is easy.Graphics: Good, runs on most anything.Aesthetic: Interesting, lends itself to the game's unique humor.Music/Sound: The music isn't the greatest, and the Archer and Paladin lines get EXTREMELY irritating. Also, if you happen to minimize the game, it will loop the current sound playing.			"

This game gives me all that, and more, more as in comedy, badassery, archery, when in doubt use fire.

												Orcs Must Die! is an extremely fun Tower Defense game, with a very nice mix of tower (trap) defense and third person action game.While there are clearly some traps which are much more useful than others and you will tend to gravitate towards them, there is still a large amount to choose from, so you can easily set up some deadly combinations to defeat the invading orcs.The gameplay is where the game really shines, while the level design is so-so, the sheer amount of variety in the game compensates for that.The only major fault of the game is that it appears personal abilities are very strong and can overshadow the traps themselves, so if you are strategy minded you might be disappointed since, especially in the early waves, you will have to rely heavily on your character to do most of the work.Great game let down by balance issues and level design.8 / 10			"

												Ever played Trapt (PS2, 2005/6)? It's kinda like that except without as much charm, difficulty, atmosphere, synergy or interesting narrative.This game is another one of those innovative third-person shooter meets tower defence games that definitely have not been cropping up by the dozen lately, but don't let that out of the box thinking put you off of this title. As harsh as my opening line might have been, this isn't really a bad game. (Certain) Traps are interesting, the tone of the game is quite tongue-in-cheek and it's very easy to lose a lot of time while playing.Strangely this game puts more emphasis on the actual fighting yourself rather than tower defence mechanisms. Traps are expensive and nearly always fire off too early, catching only the first thing in range and letting the horde behind which through.Still, a fun little arcade title. Worth it in a sale.			"

												An alternative perspective on the Tower Defense genre. The objective is to prevent several waves of Orc's and other creatures from reaching your portal. You have an array of Traps you can deploy to help slow & kill the approaching enemies. Any that slip through can be taken out with your choice of Hand held Weapon or Spell. It's so much fun, once I started playing this I couldn't put it down till I completed it.			"

												An interesting 3rd person Tower Defense, likeable if you enjoy frat humour and an inconsistent difficulty curve. In its defense your towers seem formidable and there are a few interesting twists. Not a top pick but enjoyable for thoose who like the genre.			"

												A tower defence game that's all kinds of entertaining, engaging, and challenging. And while it has all of the usual trappings of a tower defence game, it also functions as a third-person shoter, allowing you to get in on the carnage. Use your traps and spells/weapons to liquify, crush, scorch, grind, and perforate thousands of orcs as they try vainly to infiltrate your castle. If watching orcs be electrocuted and set on fire while being sucked into a meat grinder is your thing, then this might just be the game for you!			"

												Its been years since ive played a game as entertaining as this!! the large amount of traps(allowing many combinations) and the large variation of fortresses(where in each you can find a certain advantage) allows one to play them over and over,another bonus is that every trap you unlock and every upgrade you buy is persistant so you can go to an earlier level to experiment with the new traps. the ""Nightmare"" difficulty also picks up nicely where the war-mage dificulty ends. this game is all about making facing hordes of orcs fun and they have done a excellent job with that!!the Quotes that the orcs spill are also funny.the Normal difficultty campaign took me about 8 hours to complete.

												I simply have to share a quick review/opinion on this game stating that despite its rather silly visage and initial portrayal, it is really one of the most fun-packed and relatively easy to pick up games that I've played in a while. A perfect game to fire up on an off-hour to let off some steam murdering pesky orcs in every single way you could ever imagine. It delivered everything it promised and more, with the possibility for what seems like some rather deep strategy and cooperative gameplay later in the game aswell. I still have to play more to form myself a perfect opinion on the game, but still felt that I had to give my highest regards to the creators of this games already, and to highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a bit of a fun fast-paced thought-requiring time sink.

												It is an intensly fun game to play, with great humor, and strategy to boot. I like graphics and the mechanics of the game, as it drives the focus on simply killing orcs, yet you must build the skills required to set the appropriate traps on a given map; failure to do so means your DEFEAT, to only have to try it again.  I give the game a 9.9 out of 10: I never thought I would have this much fun with a game such as this.			"

												Highly recommended! If you enjoy tower defense or are a fan of Dungeon Defenders, this humorous game cranks up the difficulty accordingly as you go along and offers an abundance of towers and weapons to use. While the DLC is debatable (you definitely want the map pack, though), the grenade-like acid weapon in the weapons pack makes things a little easier and gives you a reason to use your mana. So, pick this up while it's still cheap!			"

Pros:+ Casual Instant-Action Fun+ Lovely design of environment and player- and npc models+ Great narrator+ Orcsorcsorcsorcs+ Good plurality of weapons/trapsContra:- You get new weapons/traps to the beginning of the next level, this is good, but in this level most of the new weapons/traps are useless- ... which is also for the whole game. There a few items you absolutely not need.- For Core-Gaming, this game can get really boring. The level-design seems repititive after a long session.			"

												Orcs Must Die! is a strategy - trap - killing orcs - thingy-majiggy type of game. It's kind of hard to explain. But you start off with a few traps, and you must defend the ""Rift"" by killing orcs.If orcs start passing through the Rift, a ""Rift Point"" is taken off. You're weapons at the start of the game are the Crossbow and Sword. As you progress through the game, you unlock a series of traps and weapons to enhance your ability to kill orcs. And there will be more enemies. And harder enemies. So basically, in a way, you're never ""stronger"" than the orcs. It is a pretty hard game if you try to get the perfect score, so I recommend not aiming for the prefect score just yet. But killing orcs has never been so fun! So the final score is: 9/10 stars. Fun fact: If you have played Borderlands 2, he kinda sounds like Axton.			"

												Variety is what keeps this third-person tower defense game going. With the myriad scenarios and cartoonishly gruesome methods of dispatching orcs at your fingertips, it's hard to put down. My only gripe with Orcs Must Die! is that there doesn't appear to be any sort of multiplayer mode or level editor, things that would vastly increase the game's replayability. However, despite being a single player game it's very entertaining. Even after you beat it the surprisingly deep combo/scoring system will keep you coming back for more as you try to inch your way up the leaderboards.			"

The key to success in the game is choosing the right traps in the level as well as placing them strategically.  "

												Ostensibly a Tower Defense game, Orcs Must Die is a downright fantastic take on the genre.  With an art style reminiscent of Torchlight and a light-hearted sense of humour revolving around all the myriad ways to kill Orcs, OMD is as fun to watch and listen to as it is to play. The game offers a lot of options, and it does a good job of making them all viable.  You can be just as effective using traps to decimate Orcs as you can be wading in with Crossbow and Bladestaff.  You can use traps to deal direct damage, or take advantage of physics and fling the Orcs around like ragdolls.  You can also opt to be a weapon-wielder, lopping heads and shooting faces, or you can load up with spells and lay all kinds of elemental smackdown.  Or any combination of the above.  Orcs Must Die is an aesthetically pleasing game that transcends its origins and does not disappoint in living up to its namesake.  This game is excellent.			"

												Orcs Must Die! That's a pretty dumb name. Although I ended spending way too much time on this silly little game. Orcs Must Die would fall in the ""Tower Defense"" Genre but it has so many different twists. Firstly being, there's a pretty funny story and hilarious characters. You not only make traps, you also run around with a sword or gun or frost magic and fight as well. It's entirely possible to win the game without a single trap.  It's also entirely possible to win without a single sword swing but both would be incredible difficult. I loved wasting time on this game.			"

The gameplay is fun and innovative (you get a feeling of reward for creating complex traps and you really develop your own playstyle as you go), and the characters (that is, yourself, the mage, the enemy leader and the orcs) are easily likeable.I recommend it to anyone who's ever liked a tower defense game.

												Gameplay is similar to tower defense games, but instead of towers, you defend rifts. You prevent orcs from crossing the rifts by setting up traps AND fighting them using your crossbow/blade/spells (3rd Person). You can also customize your warmage (minor spoiler) by using the weavers, which give specific boosts whether you prefer casting spells or being crafty with traps.Highly recommended for the casual gamer, it's easy to pick up and go. Maps typically has 15 rounds which take no more than 3-5 minutes each (much faster if you are good)			"

												Tower Defense done right. Well is it really tower defense? It's a yes and no. Towers in this case are traps and you can place them during waves as well if you have money. However you yourself can also defend (much like Sanctum, in fact these two are simliar in more ways then one). Some of the early levels you can beat without usinga  single trap but later you'd have a very hard if not impossible time (in my opinion) to beat the levels without using traps. Traps vary from simple floor spikes and wall arrows to flame spitting floor traps and tar pits. It's not your traditional tower defense but it fits enough for me to put it in this genre. Upgrades to the traps comes outside of the levels and are permanent. No need to worry about which one to upgrade, you do it once and it's for good. There are a lot of traps and weapons in this game, a great variety for many different strategys and plenty of replay value.			"

												Its been years since ive played a game as entertaining as this!! the large amount of traps(allowing many combinations) and the large variation of fortresses(where in each you can find a certain advantage) allows one to play them over and over,another bonus is that every trap you unlock and every upgrade you buy is persistant so you can go to an earlier level to experiment with the new traps. the ""Nightmare"" difficulty also picks up nicely where the war-mage dificulty ends. this game is all about making facing hordes of orcs fun and they have done a excellent job with that!!the Quotes that the orcs spill are also funny.the Normal difficultty campaign took me about 8 hours to complete.

												A single player tower defense action game. As the name suggest your character must defend a room from an onslaught of orcs. The orcs will come through a door as their starting point. Each will proceed to the end goal at the opposite end (usually) of the room. You will run around setting up traps of all kind. Along floors, walls, and ceilings. Traps consist of lava, tar, spikes, and so on. Unlike alot of other defense games this game has more interaction. During and in between rounds you can purchase and lay your traps through out. However, you can also attack the oncoming orcs with one of two weapons. A melle and range weapon set this game apart. Being able to actively attack enemies makes this that much more fun. No need to feel as just a spectator to the game. Most enemies wont attack you as they are driven to their goal. However, as the levels proceed difficulty increases. With newer enemies comes new threats, and new threats begat new traps to counter. If strategy and defense is your cup of tea. I highly recommend this title as the ability to attack will bring something new that you will enjoy. However, if it is not your cup of tea. I still recommend it for the very same reason.			"

												I get why the Orcs need to die, I really do. But do they HAVE to die?The game never explains why they have to die, or why the wan't to capture the time portal's so badly. Surely their primitive hierarchy of wants and needs can be satisfied with the help of some magic. We don't even know the full story, maybe the portals are Samuri-Jack style way to the past before evil mages took over the orcis agricultural utopia that once existed before hand. We just cant know for certain and for that reason I am a consiencous objector to killing orcs as a TF2 inspired scout-mage until the developers explain why the orcs absolutely 100% MUST die.			"

												A good combination of first person shooter and tower defense game with some low brow sarcastic humor.Pros:+ It is not an easy game on the higher difficulty levels and in later stages of the game.  You will have to know your traps, choose your traps wisely, and get good at quickly placing them.  Be prepared to lose often and a whole lot on the Nightmare difficulty.  However, I do feel like I earned the win after I have been getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me on levels that I have had trouble with.+ Sound effects, music, and the voice overs from the orcs are cute though a bit repetitive.  + Graphics and level design are nice to look at.  + While a single set of traps can get you through many levels, some levels have a design that occassionally forces you to rethink whatever strategy you have settled into.Cons:- When using the crossbow while the monsters are at point blank range, I often shoot through a monster.  Not sure if this is a bug or a feature to force you to use the melee weapon.- While there are a variety of trap types that are unlocked as you progress they seem to fall into categories of use that make them seem like ""upgrades"" of older traps instead of a new unique trap.  For example I found that I pretty muched replaced the Spike Trap with the Tar Trap and the Wall Grinder replaced the other wall traps when making my trap selections.- The Gnoll Hunter moves through barricades without breaking them first.  This might be a legit ability of that monster but with their speed and ability to poison it feels like this is less ""increasing the difficulty"" and more ""cheating.""- Some issues with the camera that I mostly notice when backing up against a wall that has a small alcove and when standing under the Swing Mace Trap.- Some of the spash screens that pop up while loading do have some scantily clad characters that could cause some awkwardness.

Comical dialogue and interesting backstory supplement the excellent gameplay. If you like Tower Defense, Hack-n-Slash, or just a generally interesting and funny game, grab this immediately!PS: This game has NOTHING to do with Lord of the Rings whatsoever. "

												You take place of a special wizard dude who dies, and you have to defend certain areas of a castle from enemys, mostly being orcs. You gain multiple spells, traps you can place, and you also have a set of spells. You gain money from killing these enemys, allowing you to strategicly place even more traps. As you advance through stages, you gain more ways of defending your castle. you can also have a few allies that help you along the way. To be honest my little siblings play this game more than me. Not really my style.6.2/10			"

												Quite possibly the most underrated game of the year, this gem is filled with fine-tuned and ""always fun"" values that I never see anymore. It combines the best elements of effecient defense strategies with TPS/beat-em-up gameplay. The variety in different ways you can play each level gives it immense replay value. Only downside is that the first playthrough might be a bit easy for experienced players of either genre. Fortunately, there's a Hard Mode included that can appeal to you.Ever played tower defense games, and wished you were on the field to make up for the terrible micro happening before your eyes? This can put your abilities to the test if you use tactics that empower your own character instead of countless traps and guardians.There's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ demo, see the glory or yourself.			"

												Orcs Must Die! is a real gem of an indie game. It offers a creative take on the tower defense genre with plenty of options to approach each challenge. The mixture of strategy and action game elements coupled with tight controls flow together very well, leaving you with one very satisfying experience. The game also has a good sense of dark humor that, while it may get repetitive at some points, has yet to come across as annoying.All in all, I highly recommend this game. If you love the tower defense genre you shouldn't think twice about getting it. The game offers a great experience that is well worth the price and is still fun to play again and again.			"

												I'm a little surprised about liking this game. Usually I'm not big on action type games, but I found myself enjoying the mix of action and strategy. Placing the traps correctly is a major part of the game, but wading into a bunch of orcs breaking thru your defenses is the icing on the cake.I'm not far into the game yet and have found the dificulty to be hit or misss on the levels. Some seem really hard, but the next level is very easy. I can see myself finishing the game as long as the last few levels don't go over the top in difficulty.Overall a game worth playing, especially if you catch it on sale.			"

YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!i have over 1000+ games that i own and play...not to mention games ive owned in the past on consoles. this is by far in my top 3 favorites, maybe even number 1.so even if you are like me, and hate tower defence games, give this a try.

												I have played relatively few Tower Defense games, it being a genre that does not generally appeal to me. Orcs Must Die essentially said to me, ""Okay, so you don't like sitting around watching towers kill things. How about if YOU get to kill things too?"" And I was like ""Okay OMD, I'm listening."" And what fun I had. Orcs Must Die strikes an amazing blend of frantic third-person combat with the strategy of Tower Defense, creating a game that forces you to think and react with equal speed. It is challenging, occasionally frustrating but ultimately very rewarding, not every game leaves me feeling so satisfied when the credits finally roll. It's damn funny too, with its idiotic but endearingly determined protagonist and an Ork horde that's quite disenchanted with the whole marauding business and would rather not die horrible deaths in the service of their whiny sorceress.

												Great gameplay.  The upgrade system is different for a tower defense game (you buy one upgrade for a tower, such as more damage or making it cheaper to use in-game, and it then persists for the rest of your campaign, rather than upgrading each tower individually in combat), but it works pretty well all the same.Some of the protagonist's ejaculations get quite annoying, as they're pretty limited in variety, and often don't make sense.  For example, when laying a simple barrier tower, he'll shout, ""That'll hurt!"".Overall, the game is great.  I played the entire thing in one sitting. :P			"

Slice em, dice em, burn, em, freeze em, and a whole lot more with your varied arsenal of traps and spells.Some of the earlier levels might be a tad boring, however as you progress you unlock more toys to decimate your foes with, and you can go back to older stages with all your unlocks.

												Simply put, this game is huge amount of fun. It's an excellent blend of tower defense and action, with an almost comedic atmosphere. If you like hack & slash and/or tower defense, I highly recommend you take a look at this game. Actually, I recommend picking up the franchise pack since both the first and second games are a blast to play.Comparing this game with its sequel, I liked the levels better in general in this first game, but the second just has a lot more stuff including a second playable character with different traps and abilities, more monster types, and best of all, coop. So do yourself a favor and just get the franchise pack.			"

												I've only played this game for a few hours but so far it has been a very fun experience. The early levels are fairly easy but it gets trickier and more strategic as the number of possible enemy paths increases. The cartoon graphics are an acquired taste but bring an appreciable casual twist. A good aray of weapons eventhough the crossbow is completely OP!I do regret the fact that there is no other game mode available different from 'Campaign', keeping in mind each level warrants a second or third playthrough due to the ability to utilize newly acquired upgrades in played levels to increase score. THIS IS A SCORING GAME. If that is not your thing, you might be dissa.pointed by a too short game. However, if you find it a under 5$ (Holiday sales yay!). It's totally worth it.			"

												I have to say that when i first heard of this title i thought it didnt sound much fun. but i have to say there is a great deal of joy when you just basically curbstomp some orcs with magic. its VERY polished and pleasing to look at. the sound effects and music are as if midevil musicians decided to play some form of hiphop. its definitly a game that is hard to put down. basically it just feels rewarding and the things you use to kill them vary widely, and they all have a nice look to them that fits well in its suroundings. though i am cheap i say wait for a sale. but if you really REALLY like tower defense games and a bit more polished version and a little bit more thrilling version of dungeon defenders, this is a title for you. as much as i would like there to be a multiplayer, it shows that they spent their time focusing on the game in place of a split focus of how to make multiplayer work and how to make the game look nice and better yet FEEL nice. it just has a great feel!

												I have never been the biggest fan of Tower Defense games. But after playing a good 7 hours of Orcs Must Die over the last 2 days, I can honestly say that this title gets a spot on my favorites list. Robot Entertainment has produced  a challengeing, trhrilling, laugh out loud chaotic little gem. Nothing quite equals the satisfying feeling of frantically rushing around, strategically lining the corridors of a fortress with implements of death, and then watching your assailants fall in droves under hails of arrows, floor spikes, wall blades, and brimstone tiles. The 3rd person over the shoulder camera puts you smack in the middle of the chaos, immediatley lending the game a sense of urgency you don't feel in other TDG's simply because your character's life is in peril because your character is THERE. Humor, depth, and white knuckled pacing set the tone for a well made, fun game that is worth picking up. (Especially at such a low price.)			"

												I absolutely love this game!It clearly did not have a huge budget. There are no super expensive intros and the graphics are rather simple (but effective and not bad in any way).But it is the concept that is so much fun. Building traps for the Orcs to run into and get killed in the most hillarious of ways is incredibly satisfying. The dialogue and voice acting are well done. The music fits the theme (but is a bit repetitive). The animation is great. The story is funny. The hero is likeable.My only critique would be that it is a bit short if you paid the full price. It feels like the game only just started when it is already over. You really want to make use of the last few types of traps more often before the game ends. And I never really got to ues the Weavers that much either (there never really is that much money). I wished there had been more levels to explore this upgrade mechanic and the last few traps a bit more. Because of its shortness, best wait until it is on sale. 8 out of 10			"

												The idea is that you kill orcs. How you do that is up to you, and therein is where the fun in this game is found. It has both shooter aspects (you move around shooting a crossbow and possibly other weapons) and Tower Defense elements (you need to design good trap combos to win). Simple enough, but well executed, high quality, and fairly fun.The only shortcoming is that on some levels there is only one 'correct' build to easily win, and finding that can be a pain sometimes. And, unlike it's successor it does not have Co-Op.			"

												9 out of 10.It took me about 12 hours to get through the 18 map campaign, and I've spent at least another 12 going back and replaying the levels to try to get more achievements and better level scores.  Each map probalby takes 10 minutes to play.  You run around setting up traps (kind of tower defense-like) to kill the orcs, kobolds and ogres as they try to make their way through the map from the gate to your rift.  You have weapons as spells for direct combat.  It's fun to see if you can build the best configuration of traps to stop all the monsters.  Single player only.  Very stable, I only noticed one very minor bug with a monster getting stuck in lava and not dieing, but I was able to work around it.  The character you play is very humorous in the things he says and does, as are the orcs.			"

												While steam says i currently have 0.2 hours recorded playing this, I own it on xbox 360 as well and Ive completed the game. Honestly this is one of my fav games of all time. Absolutely love it so I dedcided to be the first to share my thoughs and opinions. Now on to the review :) Its a hybrid third person action game with tower defense. this means all your descisions and actions play out all in real time so when your defending against those nasty orcs, timing and well thought out traps are crucial. Yor goal is to keep the orcs from reaching a certain point on the map called, the Rift.The Rift was built in a forsakened fortress to keep everyone safe but now the orcs want to get to it and destroy you if you get in their way. Your teacher fell in battle so now it's up to you, The apprentice to defend the rift! The story is not really what this game is about but you are greeted whith the occasional cut scene. The game starts off with only a few waves and the basic set of orcs which are fairly easy to kill, as long as you don't sit there and let them attack you....but who would do that right? Each level in the game has a set number waves, each increasingly more difficult. The good thing is you always know what you're up against and just how many Orcs your going to slaughter in that particular level. The Orcs also range from ground units to archers to flyers and big tanks that take alot of damage. Also, each orc has a weakness so exploiting it in your traps and strategy will help alot. While the onslaught of orcs never stops, you have plenty of weapons and traps at your disposal, which brings me to my next topic, The traps! Each trap has a set fuction and there are a number of them which can only be placed on walls, floors, ceilings etc. They range from your simple barricades to huge swinging ceiling axes, to decoys and meat grinders, to archers and guardians. You also have weapons to choose from to kill the orcs yourself, thats what i love about the game. Youre not just looking down and watching the fight, youre in it. So it is up to you to work with your traps and stop the orcs from reaching the Rift. Although, in later levels you must defend more than one rift at a time which means the game can get pretty tough.  The rift will heal you when your close enough so if your ever in a pinch, you can go back and refill your hp which is nice. The game also scores you on your accuracy and headshots and the amount of kills in a row. Depending on how well you do, your awarded with up to 5 skulls, these are your currency. However, you cannot move on to the next level(s) unless you have earned enough skulls in previuous levels. So doing well, is essential. Yes the game can get challenging fast and you can lower the dificulty, but that reduces the amout of skulls to be earned, so its sort of a trade off. With the skulls you can purchase new upgrades and traps as well as bonuses that effect you and your traps, later on in the game. Now again i will say have not played this on pc yet but on xbox, there were no problems as far as framrate and lag. So I would check the system specs before you go ahead and make the purchase, as with all games. The visuals are quite nice and really stand out compared to most other tower defenses. The art style is a little silly and cartoony but dont let that fool you. When your killing orcs or watching your traps bruttally tear them apart..the gore and sense of pain does make the game feel less childish. Controls felt great on my xbox game pad although I would imagine mouse and keyboard is slightly better, accuracy and speed do play a big role here. Now i will say the game may have some flaws but I personally think Its close to perfect. And Im sure OMD2 fixes any issues this one may have. Theres more to the game than I've mentioned but I wont spoil it all. Lets just say if you like tower defense games and third person shooters/action, you should deffinitely give this a go. Robot Entertainment's Orcs Must Die! gets a 5 out 5 edit: I mainly bought this to replay levels in OMD2, and yes i will be reviewing the sequal when I finish it!			"

												A fantastic, if not unorthodox version of the tower defense genre. Now you get to defend from the inside! As the War Mage, you defend the rift between worlds from orcs trying to get into our world.How do you do that? Why, by using traps, spells, and weapons, of course! Brutalize orcs with spikes, arrows, acid, and more!See more in my short video that asks the simple question: Why didn't I play this game earlier?!

												Very surprising game! Orcs Myst Die! is a very good example of the mix between tower defence and action games. It's a solo only game but if you get into the first couple of levels you get hooked by the variety of the maps and the sheer number of traps you can set to stop the orcs from reaching your base. I would also recommend the sequel, which has a coop mode and alot more content.			"

												The nearly simultaneous release of this game and Dungeon Defenders has led to inevitable comparisons between the two games, and rightly so. Both games are Tower Defense games played on a personal level rather than a top down perspective. Both have the player control a character that can run the course of maps, place a number of defenses and traps, use different abilities and go toe to toe with the advancing mobs with melee and ranged weapons. The difference comes in the approach. Dungeon Defenders distributes the different abilities among different classes making the game virtually unplayable in single player especially if you’re playing a support class. Orcs Must Die has no multiplayer but gives all the abilities to one character with new abilities with each successful mission. Orcs Must Die also feels much more action oriented. If you’re looking for a good tower defense game that you can play by yourself, look no further than this game!			"

												Get it.  Seriously.  Although I like tower defense, I was on the fence about games that put you at the front of the action.  This one does more than convince me of this take on the genre - it keeps me coming back for more, time and again.  It's a simple game on the surface, offering an incredible amount of depth and replayability.  The story, though rather stark, is carried by a hilarious, well-acted lead (think a somewhat less intelligent Ash meets a less annoying and offensive Duke) and I genuinely wanted to know more about the world.  This is certainly a franchise I hope Robot Entertainment expands on in the future.  Go get it now and duke it out with me on the leaderboards!			"

Same time I may want something simple..but not low production indie crap(not saying all indie is crap). THIS game totally suprsed me..concept is simple..production values are very high and it is one of those games you play, you enjoy and you think it will soon pass....a few hours later there you still are. One of the best games i have played in a long time. It has the simplity of the 80's but it has some cool tricks up it's sleeve and is the perfect mix....♥♥♥♥ civ 5 lol get this and actually smile about your purchase!			"

												This game is pure fun. It strikes a tough balance between having traps that are underpowered making the player do all the work, and the traps being overpowered leaving the player with nothing to do but sit back and dodge the bloodsplats. It's always a frantic rush around the level picking off the few stragglers and strategically thinning the ranks with a crossbow or magic spell.			"

												I was genuinely surprised by this game.  I like killing Orcs, (thank you Warhammer: Space Marine) so I decided to pick this up.  It is simply a great game. The dialogue knows its place, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely solid.   A great balance between combat and defensive strategy.  The maps ramp in difficulty quite nicely, and the creators were smart to add enemies that will mess with tactics that worked a few maps ago.  Forcing the player to really think about each map is something that shows good game design and I really admire it.  If you like tower defense games and are looking for something a bit different, definitely check this out.			"

												Until LvL 18 this game is quite ok. Then the difficulty level starts to rise without any sign or reason. A level that you cannot beat without looking into a guide on youtube or s.th. like that. Bad gameplay-design sucks. Game deinstalled. Not to recommend!			"

												Bought in the steam sale, but oh my goodness...it's been a while since I literally started playing a game and could not stop, but killing orcs was so much fun! The story is just enough to push the story forward. The interface is simple and functional, though don't expect to be able to place traps in the middle of first person orc killing. Graphics seemingly inspired by Blizzard and WOW (not a bad thing).Overall it was worth the original £11.99...but it feels like a steal from the steam sale!			"

												Nice, mindless fun. In the game you play as a war mage that kills orcs. You get cool traps and a few weapons. It's quite satisfying to play too. Only downside is lack of multiplayer, which is present in the second installment - Orcs Must Die! 2. If this game is on sale, I reccoment getting it. Also, getting this game will grant you 10 extra co-op levels in OMD2, however you have to note that both players need this game for them to be playable in the co-op mode.			"

												Rating: 4/5     ""A very fun twist to tower defense.""Orcs Must Die is a comical game, and a unique hybrid of Tower Defense and Platform.  You play as a Sorcerer's Apprentice, who inherits his Master's mission after his most unfortunate (and oddly hilarious) death.  At your disposal is your late Master's spellbook, which provides you with the means to summon traps, guardians, and magical weapons which can all be used to single-handedly combat an army of Orcs...and luckily so, because that's exactly what your mission entails! Orcs Must Die features a simple control system, engaging gameplay, an overconfident, narcissistic main character, and orcs...lots and lots of orcs! An overall great game for almost anyone's video game repertoire!			"

Its art-style seemed too whimsically Warcrafty for me, and the recently saturated tower-defense genre generally holds little of my interest. Orcs Must Die, though, is an excellent surprise. Sweet visuals, a balanced challenge-level, tight gameplay, and very good voice-acting and writing elevate this game to the point of can't-put-it-away-'til-I-beat-it (a rare thing for my very real attention deficit issues to lean to). A small price during those wonderful Steam sale holidays, restrained and worthy DLC releases, and a sequel coming out with co-op? Yes. Yes I will.			"

												This is the funnest game I've played in a long time. It's all about killing orcs in various ways of course. The fun though is creating an ingenious way to kill said orcs. The game offers you a large variety of traps and such to kill 'em off, plus it offers some 1st person shooter style mechanics where you can kill 'em with your crossbow, your sword and your magic gizmos. The only drawback is the guy you play. He tries to be funny but the jokes just fall flat. Despite that though, I love this game. Very polished, fun and worth the money.			"

												One of the most helarious tower defence games I’ve played. I do very much enjoy this genre and orcs must die does shine as one of the best. Even though the gore and the graphics design is ""cartoony""; mowing down the hord with well placed traps or jumping into the frey with a meele weapon is still extremely satisfying. The humor is well done but taylored for younger players with reasonably subtle hints to more adult subjects. The plot is simple but entertaining non the less. The maps can be quite fendish but once you work out the best arrangement it all falls into place and you can work on that high score.			"

												Orcs Must Die is a very fun game - it focuses on one core concept (killing orcs) and sets everything up around that. A mixture of Tower Defence and 3rd person action, you lay traps to slow down, maim, and kill orcs to prevent them from getting to your base. You have to get your hands dirty, though, as you won't be able to kill everything in the early waves with traps alone.I haven't had so much fun with a game in a long time!			"

												A good combination of first person shooter and tower defense game with some low brow sarcastic humor.Pros:+ It is not an easy game on the higher difficulty levels and in later stages of the game.  You will have to know your traps, choose your traps wisely, and get good at quickly placing them.  Be prepared to lose often and a whole lot on the Nightmare difficulty.  However, I do feel like I earned the win after I have been getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me on levels that I have had trouble with.+ Sound effects, music, and the voice overs from the orcs are cute though a bit repetitive.  + Graphics and level design are nice to look at.  + While a single set of traps can get you through many levels, some levels have a design that occassionally forces you to rethink whatever strategy you have settled into.Cons:- When using the crossbow while the monsters are at point blank range, I often shoot through a monster.  Not sure if this is a bug or a feature to force you to use the melee weapon.- While there are a variety of trap types that are unlocked as you progress they seem to fall into categories of use that make them seem like ""upgrades"" of older traps instead of a new unique trap.  For example I found that I pretty muched replaced the Spike Trap with the Tar Trap and the Wall Grinder replaced the other wall traps when making my trap selections.- The Gnoll Hunter moves through barricades without breaking them first.  This might be a legit ability of that monster but with their speed and ability to poison it feels like this is less ""increasing the difficulty"" and more ""cheating.""- Some issues with the camera that I mostly notice when backing up against a wall that has a small alcove and when standing under the Swing Mace Trap.- Some of the spash screens that pop up while loading do have some scantily clad characters that could cause some awkwardness.

												Orcs Must Die is a dating simulator based on actual events, about a guy who lives in a castle and joins a shady online dating service. He then spends the rest of his life attempting to interview these would-be green suitors to find the love of his life. Sadly, his dates often rush the gates and fall victim to the castle's insanely jealous defense system. It's up to our fair prince to use his trusty Crossbow of Love and his Sword of Choosing to place that special touch on the suitors that meet his fancy, and who aren't grieviously injured by the castle.All in all, I found this to be a very tragic tale, as well as a cautious reminder of the horrors of online dating. It's also a really great game, even if you don't usually happen to like historical-based dating simulators.			"

												An entertaining and comedy-oriented trap dungeon defense game.It took me a bit to get used to the trap difference vs the usual tower defense games I play - but it pans out well in a very entertaining, challenging and rewarding way. The traps set up have a limited area of effect and react on a reset timer for most of them, so its a mixture of combinations of traps and your own wits with weapons and the enviroment to pull it off well.It proves to be a good game that is well worth its value.

												I wasn't interested in this game when I first saw it. Its art-style seemed too whimsically Warcrafty for me, and the recently saturated tower-defense genre generally holds little of my interest. Orcs Must Die, though, is an excellent surprise. Sweet visuals, a balanced challenge-level, tight gameplay, and very good voice-acting and writing elevate this game to the point of can't-put-it-away-'til-I-beat-it (a rare thing for my very real attention deficit issues to lean to). A small price during those wonderful Steam sale holidays, restrained and worthy DLC releases, and a sequel coming out with co-op? Yes. Yes I will.			"

I'd have to say this crap is wack, and the second game might have improved to a better standard. the intro video got one good laugh and that  I will never forget, but I have moved on from this heaping pile of dog fecal.. to better things. 1/10			"

												Orcs Must Die is a third person tower defence game. You play as the magicians apprentice and you must stop the Orcs from reaching the Rift, which is a portal to your universe.Each level the Orcs break through the doors (or fly through holes in the ceiling) and make their way to the Rift coming in waves. You lay traps in their path, from spiked floors to swinging blades the Orcs blunder through your traps becoming so much meat and with each death you get more money to place more traps. Of course should you get bored of watching them die you can enter the fray yourself firing either a rapid fire crossbow or engaging in melee. Once you complete the level you get skulls based on how well you did which you use to purchase and upgrade traps.This game is pretty good, if a little repetitive and the difficulty really ramps up in the later levels, especially if you haven't got the right traps or upgraded them enough. It's very satisfying to see a horde of Orcs be decimated as they wander through your traps, all the while never firing a single shot yourself.For £6.99 it's a great game, well worth the price. "

												If you've played Dungeon Defenders, a single player DD is the perfect description for this game.  It is a tower defense and 3rd person shooter.  The down side(s)? (besides it being only 1 player) You can upgrade your traps and weapons... once each, they are unforgiving with the penalties when units get through, and death animations where you arent sure when the enemy dies, not to mention some traps knock down and enemies get back up a few seconds later. It is quite fun.  This game is well worth 5 bucks. For me, its not long enough to justify more than that.			"

												Loads of Orcs, Traps, and Maps make for a great ""Tower Defense"" style game.The game doesn't take itself seriously at all which makes it even more fun & the cartoon-ish Art Style gives the added benefit of some pretty awsome Death Faces on the Orcs!Go for it, especially on Sale!			"

												This game has soul. A 3rd person shooter/tower defense mix, the traps are neat, the levels are fun, and the dialogue is frikkin hilarious. It has a moderate learning curve, so dont expect to get perfect scores on your first play through, but it grows on you. A high level of polish, great sounds, animations, and design make this a great game worth the price. 9/10			"

												The main character in this game always has witty remarks and reminds a little of Charlie Sheen. Music is very catchy and appropriate for a game about killing Orcs - organ music meets electric guitars. It can offer a couple of days of fun, but unfortunately doesn't have much replay value.			"

												An action oriented tower defence game, where you are right in the midst of the battle, tossing down traps, casting fireballs and building crazy trap combos. Good mechanics, cheerful aesthetics, funny lines...The comboing mechanic is cool, but a bit under used. Especially if you don't care about getting the high score and would rather concentrate on getting a perfect run.			"

												This game is pure fun. It strikes a tough balance between having traps that are underpowered making the player do all the work, and the traps being overpowered leaving the player with nothing to do but sit back and dodge the bloodsplats. It's always a frantic rush around the level picking off the few stragglers and strategically thinning the ranks with a crossbow or magic spell.			"

												While steam says i currently have 0.2 hours recorded playing this, I own it on xbox 360 as well and Ive completed the game. Honestly this is one of my fav games of all time. Absolutely love it so I dedcided to be the first to share my thoughs and opinions. Now on to the review :) Its a hybrid third person action game with tower defense. this means all your descisions and actions play out all in real time so when your defending against those nasty orcs, timing and well thought out traps are crucial. Yor goal is to keep the orcs from reaching a certain point on the map called, the Rift.The Rift was built in a forsakened fortress to keep everyone safe but now the orcs want to get to it and destroy you if you get in their way. Your teacher fell in battle so now it's up to you, The apprentice to defend the rift! The story is not really what this game is about but you are greeted whith the occasional cut scene. The game starts off with only a few waves and the basic set of orcs which are fairly easy to kill, as long as you don't sit there and let them attack you....but who would do that right? Each level in the game has a set number waves, each increasingly more difficult. The good thing is you always know what you're up against and just how many Orcs your going to slaughter in that particular level. The Orcs also range from ground units to archers to flyers and big tanks that take alot of damage. Also, each orc has a weakness so exploiting it in your traps and strategy will help alot. While the onslaught of orcs never stops, you have plenty of weapons and traps at your disposal, which brings me to my next topic, The traps! Each trap has a set fuction and there are a number of them which can only be placed on walls, floors, ceilings etc. They range from your simple barricades to huge swinging ceiling axes, to decoys and meat grinders, to archers and guardians. You also have weapons to choose from to kill the orcs yourself, thats what i love about the game. Youre not just looking down and watching the fight, youre in it. So it is up to you to work with your traps and stop the orcs from reaching the Rift. Although, in later levels you must defend more than one rift at a time which means the game can get pretty tough.  The rift will heal you when your close enough so if your ever in a pinch, you can go back and refill your hp which is nice. The game also scores you on your accuracy and headshots and the amount of kills in a row. Depending on how well you do, your awarded with up to 5 skulls, these are your currency. However, you cannot move on to the next level(s) unless you have earned enough skulls in previuous levels. So doing well, is essential. Yes the game can get challenging fast and you can lower the dificulty, but that reduces the amout of skulls to be earned, so its sort of a trade off. With the skulls you can purchase new upgrades and traps as well as bonuses that effect you and your traps, later on in the game. Now again i will say have not played this on pc yet but on xbox, there were no problems as far as framrate and lag. So I would check the system specs before you go ahead and make the purchase, as with all games. The visuals are quite nice and really stand out compared to most other tower defenses. The art style is a little silly and cartoony but dont let that fool you. When your killing orcs or watching your traps bruttally tear them apart..the gore and sense of pain does make the game feel less childish. Controls felt great on my xbox game pad although I would imagine mouse and keyboard is slightly better, accuracy and speed do play a big role here. Now i will say the game may have some flaws but I personally think Its close to perfect. And Im sure OMD2 fixes any issues this one may have. Theres more to the game than I've mentioned but I wont spoil it all. Lets just say if you like tower defense games and third person shooters/action, you should deffinitely give this a go. Robot Entertainment's Orcs Must Die! gets a 5 out 5 edit: I mainly bought this to replay levels in OMD2, and yes i will be reviewing the sequal when I finish it!			"

												This game is very, very entertaining, the objective of the game is to kill orcs, gnolls, kobolds and ogres before they reach the end of the level. We could say this is a light game as is easy to win, however, for getting the perfect mark is another history. Is a strategy game as you can choose which traps, spells and special guardians to use for each level and you can upgrade them as you got better marks in each level. However, if you play in the nightmare mode, the strategy gives places to your skills as everything will change and will be very challenging to finish the game, and worse if you try to get a perfect mark in each level. More is not enough to say, the game is very addictive, sarcastic history, and probably will be enjoyed by everyone. Thought is a good idea to get all the DLC in one single bundle as will help you. "

Same time I may want something simple..but not low production indie crap(not saying all indie is crap). THIS game totally suprsed me..concept is simple..production values are very high and it is one of those games you play, you enjoy and you think it will soon pass....a few hours later there you still are. One of the best games i have played in a long time. It has the simplity of the 80's but it has some cool tricks up it's sleeve and is the perfect mix....♥♥♥♥ civ 5 lol get this and actually smile about your purchase!			"

												There's so many positive things I can say about Orcs Must Die. It's a game which won't disappoint even the most hard to please gamer, as It's packed with so much fun, humour, and thought.Orcs Must Die is more or less the same as Plants vs Zombies. It's a game where you must place traps in order to stop the horde of enemies from reaching their goal, and every new level brings a new trap. With every new trap of course brings a new enemy, so be prepared for this when organising your traps.Aswell as traps you can also use magic, and choose upgrades through-out the various levels through a card system.Being as this is the first game from Robot Entertainment, I give this game a big 10/10. There isn't many people who won't enjoy this game. It's pretty hard to find weak points. There's few bugs, has good graphics, and overall perfect gameplay.Pick this awesome game up at any opportunity. You won't regret it.			"

												Orcs Must Die is a decent 3rd person perspective tower defence game. You try and stop the attacking Orcs from reaching the portal, you have assorted weapons and traps at your disposal and new ones unlock as you progress through the levels. I enjoyed it for the short time i've played it, but apart from the new perspective on Tower Defence games, it offers nothing ground-breaking in terms of gameplay. A neat idea that for some unfathomable reason doesn't translate as well as it should, still worth a try though.			"

												This will be the first half of our review for the Orcs Must Die! series. This is the review for the first game, the overall score of which will be averaged with the overall score of Orcs Must Die! 2 to give us our final score for the series as a whole. So far, it’s prospects of a solid score are looking fantastic. Let us begin.I – Story [7/10]Orcs Must Die! is a third-person tower defense game from Robot Entertainment, in which, the player assumes the role of the Hero; an otherwise unnamed character and the last living member of the Order. The Order is an ancient and powerful guild of War Mages who have taken it upon themselves to guard Rifts (magical portals that connect the human world and the “Dead World” which also provide a source of magic throughout both worlds.)The Dead World is home to a faction known as “The Mob” and is comprised of various creatures such as gnolls, ogres, and (of course) orcs. The Mob is lead by a former student of the Order known as the Sorceress. During the course of the game, the Hero is fighting to keep the Mob at bay despite their every increasing aggression and frequency of attacks.Spoiler Alert: In the end, the Hero steps through a Rift and closes it forever by means of a spell. Although he saves the human world from destruction at the hands of the Sorceress and her limitless legions, he also destroys the source of magic for both worlds. The human world, now dependent upon magic, begins to steadily deteriorate. The Sorceress, stripped of her powers, is trapped in the Dead World with a gratuitous amount of angry monsters.The of OMD! should be thematically familiar to the vast majority of gamers, moviegoers, and readers alike. It is tried and true and it worked wonderfully for the game. That being said, it has still be done before.II – UI [9/10]The user interface was great. It was simple, the minimap worked like a charm, and I kept pressing the “ready” button long before I was actually ready. (Please note that that was not the game’s fault, it was all mine. It felt necessary to talk about it though.) In-game HUD was very user friendly and all of my stats/currently equipped traps (towers) and equipment were easy to refer to. However, the menus seemed to feel a bit clunky. Maybe it was just me, but I felt that they could have used a little tweaking.III – Gameplay [10/10]As I mentioned in a previous article, I wasn’t always a fan of tower defense games. In most cases, I’m still not crazy about them. But, every now and then, one comes along that attaches itself to my heart like a parasite and sticks with me for the long haul. Orcs Must Die! is one of those special little parasites.The vast majority of the maps are incredible free form as far as defensive strategies go. The game starts you off with fairly easy maps and they continually increase in complexity as you hack and slash your way through the campaign. As someone who is (in general) not very good with strategy, I weirdly loved this. It gave me a good chance to brush up on my defense skills and figure out what needs to be where so I’m not eyeball deep in orcs in a few minutes. Should I build outward or inward? Do I need to worry about aerial a-holes or not? Loved it.As far as using your character in combat, the third-person perspective was implemented expertly. A reticle is clearly displayed (and not easily lost) so that I can wade straight into the action if need be or snipe fools out from afar. Primary and secondary weapon functions are easily used and easily mastered. Movement is very fluid and the character’s sprint speed is comfortable fast.IV – Content [10/10]Orcs Must Die! has a lot of content, especially for a tower defense game. The core game has 24 maps, 6 weapons, 19 traps and minions (in total), and 11 different enemy types. Not only this, but any upgrades you purchase for weapons, traps, etc. are permanent and stay with you throughout the entire game. This is fantastic, in case you were wondering.There are two different DLCs for OMD! (Artifacts of Power and Lost Adventures) and both add their fair share of extra content as well. Really though, if you end up purchasing this game, you’ll probably end up picking up the DLC at some pint as well because you’re going to want more.V – Visual [10/10]Every last graphical detail of Orcs Must Die! is enchanting. Character and enemy models are very well done and have a charming, cartoon-esque quality to them. The environments are wonderful and every map has something new for you to ogle in your downtime. When you’re not setting traps or slaying orcs, it’s really worth it to take a few minutes to just explore your surroundings.VI – Audio [10/10]Seldom has a game had a more fitting soundtrack than Orcs Must Die! does. Seriously though, just phenomenal. You can annihilate thousands and tens of thousands to this epic score and never grow tired of it. That goes for the annihilation too. It has a very metal feel to it on the whole and I’m sure that War Mages the world over could happily crush skulls to it all day long.On top of the score, the voice acting is absolutely superb. The Hero is hilarious and you’ll find yourself laughing at his one-liners and his celebratory dance moves map after map.VII – Overall [9.3/10]Overall, Orcs Must Die! is a great game and a true testament of what a tower defense game should be, in my opinion.

												This game is very, very entertaining, the objective of the game is to kill orcs, gnolls, kobolds and ogres before they reach the end of the level. We could say this is a light game as is easy to win, however, for getting the perfect mark is another history. Is a strategy game as you can choose which traps, spells and special guardians to use for each level and you can upgrade them as you got better marks in each level. However, if you play in the nightmare mode, the strategy gives places to your skills as everything will change and will be very challenging to finish the game, and worse if you try to get a perfect mark in each level. More is not enough to say, the game is very addictive, sarcastic history, and probably will be enjoyed by everyone. Thought is a good idea to get all the DLC in one single bundle as will help you. "

												Of all the recent first-person tower defenses to come out recently, OMD wins on variety and comic relief. A bit annoying you can't take your upgrade points back, though.One note: Get the Artifact DLC. The poison satchel has saved my butt several times, and it alone is worth the price of the pack... well, the sale price anyways.			"

Only one minor permanent upgrade per tower type while skills are put up through one of three skill trees which reset every level so you can play around with builds to avoid repetitiveness. The cheesy humour and over the top characters fit the game well.			"

												I have to say that when i first heard of this title i thought it didnt sound much fun. but i have to say there is a great deal of joy when you just basically curbstomp some orcs with magic. its VERY polished and pleasing to look at. the sound effects and music are as if midevil musicians decided to play some form of hiphop. its definitly a game that is hard to put down. basically it just feels rewarding and the things you use to kill them vary widely, and they all have a nice look to them that fits well in its suroundings. though i am cheap i say wait for a sale. but if you really REALLY like tower defense games and a bit more polished version and a little bit more thrilling version of dungeon defenders, this is a title for you. as much as i would like there to be a multiplayer, it shows that they spent their time focusing on the game in place of a split focus of how to make multiplayer work and how to make the game look nice and better yet FEEL nice. it just has a great feel!

												Orcs Must Die takes the tower defense formula and tweaks it just enough to be something a little different; there's greater emphasis on both traps and your own combat abilities rather than just towers, allowing you to become more involved in the action. Combating the invading orcs and either watching them run through your stabbing, slicing, or smashing traps or dicing them up with your bladestaff and puncturing them with your crossbow bolts rewards you with some entertaining gibs, and the quips from both your character and the green brutes is good for a few chuckles. If you're looking to kill a short time with one or two rounds or fill out a boring afternoon with several more, Orcs Must Die is definitely an entertaining diversion worth looking into.			"

												An amazingly fun and addicting fast paced third-person action game in which Orcs must die. You achieve that with your magical abilities as well as with the help of a large number of ingenious traps that you continuously get throughout the game. The difficulty and challenge gets constantly ramped up but never feels overwhelming.			"

												Solid twist on the Tower Defense Genre.Good introduction to the series if you get the whole franchise pack.Personally, I prefer the second game because there is significantly more flexibility in your game experience, more weapons, more traps, more levels, and more longevity, but the game is still money well spent.Like killing things with traps and weapons?  Check.Like good solid humor?  CheckInteresting and motivating game soundtrack? CheckLike a game that requires strategy and thinking?  CheckLike mass chaos that puts constant pressure on you?  CheckLike a overall solid game design concept?  Double Check(You will get the partial joke here, if you have ever finished the sequel).Just get the game and play it, and you will understand in less than 5 minutes.Lightning in a bottle.			"

												All the same things from Orcs Must Die 2 apply to Orcs Must Die. If you own both games, the levels from the first can be played from within the second game. I'd recommend playing it from the second game as all the new customisation features will apply to first game's levels, and you'll be able to play as the sorceress.If playing this from the first game there are a couple of things to note:* Its customisation system is not nearly as good as the second game.* There isn't as much variety as there is in the second game. Applies to weapons, characters, traps and monsters. "

												This or Dungeon Defenders or Monday Night Combat or... well, approach the notion with this question: do I have ANY friends at all? If the echoing response happens to be a sheepish ""...no..."" then call Orcs Must Die your newest and only bud.Orcs Must Die shares more in common with the likes of Lock's Quest than any of the previously mentioned seige-style titles. You, as the Apprentice, are the sole line of defense for a series of interdimensional whatsits. Good, hands-on slaughter earns bonuses; creative execution of traps earn you multipliers. This set up should dispell for you where the focus of Orcs Must Die sits: action first, clever second.			"

												For me, more outright fun than Sanctum or Dungeon Defenders. Dungeon Defenders suffers from a Sisyphean feeling of level and item grinding common to MMO's, and Sanctum feels too prescriptive in what approach you need to take to win like more traditional tower defense games. Orcs Must Die avoids this rewarding you with a new toy on each level, and only requiring grinding to beat highscores. Gaining access to new combinations, and highscore tracking, keeps replaying earlier levels interesting.			"

												An excellent single player indie game.Has 3 game modes - warmage, nightmare and high scoring. Played within that order. Once you have completed the game on nightmare you can aim for the highscore tables, but high scores are achieved by getting combo kills, so require entirely different tactics. The traps are interesting, there are a handful that you will never use and others you will use in some levels. The swinging mace is one of the most deadly traps you can use.2 DLCs - Lost adventures adds 5 maps, 1 is a map already in the game played in reverse (a very unique map and a very entertaining map, playing in reverse does make it harder). They also added a handful of new monsters, like the frost bat. Well worth getting.               - the second DLC is not as worth while, contains a few new traps and weapons. Accessable from the start of the game as well, which makes the first few levels extremely easy if used. However, both DLCs are worthing picking up when on offer.			"

												You like tower defence? You like slaying orcs? Or crushing them? Burning maybe? Or penatrating them with arrows? All whilst listening to comments of the most selfcentered♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥since duke nukem? Well then this is the game for you. Fend of orcs in an epic onslought, using your wits and your crossbow to prevent them from entering the rifts. With lots of different traps, spells and a decent amound of enemy variety this game does one hell of a job in the third person TD genre. The game is not perfect though. The levels are all very gray and brown and as you are nearing the end of each lv, your defence has usually become so solid that there is no need for you to even be there. But if you can live with that (and I know I could), then this game sure is a hell of a lotta fun.			"

												Orcs Must Die! is a tower defence game that uses a third person action oriented perspective instead of the traditional top down view of similar games.Its a very fun and entertaining game that will last you around 11 hours depending on your playstyle. A constant progression of new weapons, traps and enemies drives you through the adventure, and ensure the same strategy won't work for every level. Not only do you lay traps as in a typical tower defence game, your character can also move around and contribute to the kills to complement the traps you have set. The graphics are bright and colourful and animations are very fluid. Music and sound are crisp and clear and the game is a joy to play.Downsides, this game is single-player only. Having a friend in multiplayer mode to help cover some of multiple enemy entrances would have made it an even more enjoyable experience.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10Entertaining and fun game in a new twist on the tower defence genre. Don't miss it.			"

												Excellent tower defense game - simple and responsive controls, crisp graphics, fun storyline. A good mix of strategy and skill. The 'level grade' system and Nightmare difficulty add extra layers of replayability to the game, forcing you to adapt your strategies and use a wide range of skill and trap builds for different encounters, while simultaneously demanding better playskill from you in the form of aiming (ie. headshots can cause significantly more damage) and laying traps under pressure.

												An old but fun game combining Tower Defence with 3rd person action. The game goes with a silly and awesome humour and there is just some strange satisfaction of mowing down wave after wave of enemies. The big drawback of this first game is the lack of co-op which you get in Orcs Must Die! 2.			"

												Overall I did enjoy Orcs during the short time I spent with it, and it is a great game. However, it generally didn't stand out of the pack for me, and came at the end of a long winded era of tower defense games.			"

												Cost of spring loaded trap? 500 coins. Hearing an Orc mention he was going to retire the next day right before he is catapulted into a pit of lava? Priceless.Best $15 I ever spent on Steam. Do yourself a favor and buy it if you haven't already. Funny dialogue, interesting levels that let you get creative, and a great soundtrack with a fun art style have kept me replaying levels just for the lulz.			"

												An outstanding take on the tower defense genre. The game offers genuine choice as to how to complete levels, and the variety of levels as well as the decent challenge will keep you drawn in. It takes 8-10 hours to finish the campaign with good scores, and then there's Nightmare mode to contend with. Highly recommended.			"

												Bored? Don't know what to play? Cant concentrate? Well this is a game right up your alley. I love playing this as a relaxing fun game, although doesn't have to be one of those games.... it can also be competitive... compete between friends so see who is the best orc killer!!!!.Out of ten I would give this game a solid 8 - because is easy to get to grips with, its fun, interesting and did i mention fun? personally I loved it so much i brought all the DLC for it and the follow up 'Orcs Must Die 2'.... yet to play that though.If your still unsure look at videos on YouTube of the gameplay, playthroughs or let's play videos. I started a lets play series on this game on my channel so you could check that out and see if this game is for you.			"

												Somewhere between tower defense and horde mode there are a lot of dead orcs. A perfectly paced action game that applies enough pressure to induce flow, but has an occasional breather to prevent fatigue. Throw in a few one-liners and a metal soundtrack and this one's a winner.

												A FPS tower defense that's actually fun to play. Unlike some of it's predecessors... *cough* Sanctum *cough*.The developers knew what their strengths were and focused on them. The result is a game that's enjoyable for what it is, without losing its way trying to be something it isn't.While it's relatively short - it'll only take a couple days to ""beat"" - there's plenty of replayability if you want to perfect your strategies or just enjoy shooting Orcs in the face.Even though I'd never pay $60 for a game like this, it's hard to go wrong with an MSRP of $15.Try the demo, you'll know right away if this game is for you.

												Ostensibly a Tower Defense game, Orcs Must Die is a downright fantastic take on the genre.  With an art style reminiscent of Torchlight and a light-hearted sense of humour revolving around all the myriad ways to kill Orcs, OMD is as fun to watch and listen to as it is to play. The game offers a lot of options, and it does a good job of making them all viable.  You can be just as effective using traps to decimate Orcs as you can be wading in with Crossbow and Bladestaff.  You can use traps to deal direct damage, or take advantage of physics and fling the Orcs around like ragdolls.  You can also opt to be a weapon-wielder, lopping heads and shooting faces, or you can load up with spells and lay all kinds of elemental smackdown.  Or any combination of the above.  Orcs Must Die is an aesthetically pleasing game that transcends its origins and does not disappoint in living up to its namesake.  This game is excellent.			"
