												***THERE WILL BE FAPPING***THIS GAME IS SO BAD, IT'S GOOD.Ok, there, I've said it.But OF COURSE, it's bad. It's from Troma.""WHO THE HELL IS TROMA?"" you might ask yourself.TROMA Entertainment.The purveryors of crazy, zany, sick, twisted, hardcore, grindhouse, action/scifi/horror/romance cult movies in the universe of B-movies. That's who. They even had a Saturday morning cartoon show at one point. Their fame stems mostly from the movie: ""The Toxic Avenger"", a fugly, but ""lovable good guy superhero mutant"", and an assort of other movies, with other characters that have developed large cult followings. They've been around for about 40 years now.SO now these guys have a PC game. ACTUALLY, about 15 years ago; said they didn't release it then, figuring the game would get totally banned. *Update: ""DrSpikee"" shared this was originally a 1999 Polish game called ""Rezerwowe Psy""*.Thanks dude! :DIt appears Troma was able to use it to make their own game. (seems minus the original sex/nudity!)THE GAME:Starts with a disclaimer; and Lloyd from Troma pointing out you don't need it: you already bought the effing game! LOL, NICE! :DThen, a ""Troma"" intro, a collection of clips from their many old movies: gross, gory, hardcore grindhouse, with boobs in one scene (more on boobs later). There's the menu, pretty straightforward. Start a New Game.The game is an isometric, tactical, turn-based, squad-based shooter.You start out with 3 dudes: The Toxic Avenger (Toxie), Sgt.Kabukiman, and The Stranger.Your goal: to wipe out the Surf Nazis (see the movie ""Surf Nazis Must Die"").The game is very similar in handling to the original Fallout game, but with complete emphasis on COMBAT only. Even the inventory menu looks inspired, so fans of Fallout 1/2, will find some familiarity. When you bag someone, they die, leave a bloody mess, and their loot in a nice pile for you to pick-up through the inventory screen.Everything costs action points. Action points to walk, action points to shoot, action points to reload, to move things in your inventory even. The game is divided into ""missions"". The level areas aren't big, this is not an RPG, this is a pretty straightforward clean and sweep game: GO AND KILL ALL OF THE BAD GUYS.From this point, that is all you do. There isn't anything to interact with, but you can blow away all the different pedestrians with names with the likes of:  ""Hooker"", ""Freak"", ""Fat Guy"", ""Crazy With A Shotgun"", etc. Some will randomly draw weapons and shoot you. Shooting a ""overworked office worker"" might yield you some loot, like booze, drugs, money, a mobile phone, a porn mag, or whatever. Most of the loot appears to be just ""novelty"" items. The only things of value are any weapons/ammo they have. Like Fallout 1/2, you can waste ANYONE,  but there is no ""karma"" penalty in this game.You can also target individual parts: legs, torso, or head. Just right cilck on the target to get a small menu with attack options. Works well.However, it doesn't seem to really do anything. For example, you can't blow off legs or heads.Haven't seen any animations other than the character falling to the ground, and then a pool of blood appearing. I noticed when I shot someone with alot of strength still, in the head, they died immediately.Other times, I aimed for the head, and they were just lightly wounded.I suspect this is probably something they never had time (or budget) to finish or properly implement.To complete the missions, you only have to snuff out the BAD GUYS (with various weapons). Once that is done, there is a ""Thumbs Up"" button that appears. Click it, and you are done.Between missions, you are treated to the narrator telling the story. LOL. Man this is so bad. Sometimes, you will see a random, non-sequiter video clip. One, shows the creators of South Park in a fake commercial about hermaphrodites. Another, of Lemmy from Motorhead doing a weird PSA type thing. Another is a metal music video. Another is a montage of super-gory moments from Troma movies. (**NOTE, you will miss these if you ""left-click"". I tried ""right-clicking"" and then they played. However, the game glitched-out when the next level started.)Graphics:Not bad for a game 15 years old. There isn't anything to interact with, there isn't a load of detail in the hand-painted backgrounds/levels, but the areas are diverse and seem to look better as you progress. The animations were good.Sound:The sound FX are alright, a couple times, they didn't play, but was rare and only in an instant. A couple of sounds, seem to be right out of Fallout, like when reloading or messing with the menu. Hmmm. When you kill someone, they let out a really long, over-the-top blood-curdling scream. The characters/NPCs will make funny comments or noises at times. Like, Toxie might run out of action points while trying to go somewhere you told him to, and will stop and say something like:""Yeah, I'll get to it as soon as I finish taking my toxic waste dump!""Music: Varies, from PORNO music, to alot of  SKA and METAL, with R or X rated lyrics. It's like they couldn't afford GWAR and got some other bands who weren't as extreme. The narrator might pop-in once in a while to give a game hint. Whatever.PROS:-Straight-forward, old-school Turn-based Squad Action-Good bloody, dark humor-Interface design is simple and efficient at the same time-Novelty of playing classic cult characters from the TROMA movies and fighting other characters from the movies-If you like games like POSTAL, you'll feel right at home-Great music-the game proudly doesn't take itself seriously-Tons of bonus features, including old CD-ROM style Macromedia player interface (will be in your Steam folder), where you get a bunch of ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff. A lot of blood, boobs, and booty. There is a whole section of the ""Tromettes"", hot, naked/scantly-dressed chicks in sexy or PORN-Y poses. CONS:-Seems like you never get enough action points to do things-Some lite-RPG elements would have been nice-Inventory system is glitchy as heck!!!! I recommend when clicking an inventory/ground object, to click REAL FAST (tap) and do this in the upper-left corner of the object. Glitchy inventory system can cause you to easily pick-up/put-down an object costing you valuable Action points-How managing your inventory is never explained well. For example, took awhile to figure out character's ""backpacks"" can hold seemingly infinite amount of items!!-For a ""Troma"" game, it greatly lacks the gore; it feels dare I say: unfinished? Fallout, Arcanum, Postal, and just many others games even from that time, were bloodier, gorier. So this was a disappointment.-Sometimes, you'll spend TOO MUCH time hunting for that ONE LAST ENEMY on the map-Game mouse-scroll is way too fast and there is no way to use the keys or to slow it down-Wished the world was more detailed and fleshed out-Rough around some edgesMAYBE:-Permadeath! If one of your first 3 guys gets wasted, they're OUT.You advance into the next missions with whoever survived. OR, if you can reload from your last saved (you can save whenever)Some people will like this, some will not. So far with my game, I got a hot chick added in one mission.-Doesn't seem to be anyway to restore health during a mission, so might be too challenging for some.-Sick, Troma style humor isn't for everyone (gosh, maybe anyone, LOL)OVERALL:Remember, it's not an RPG or even some big epic game. AND DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY!You go out and kill the bad guys (and whoever else). That's it.It would be interesting if they make a new game where they implement more things to do, more gore, more interaction, etc.Some will FAP to the (mostly partial) nudity in the game (or tons in the bonus features), others might FAP to the silly, ridiculous violence. If you're a TROMA fan, you'll probably FAP to all of it.			"

												Growing up I became quite familiar with Troma movies. Our trips to the video store would often end with one of us bringing home ""Class of Nuke 'Em High"" or ""The Toxic Avenger"", or another oddball Troma film. The AAA movies were usually picked over (this was before a dozen copies of the same movie existed at one place) and nobody wanted the piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Troma movies that were always lurking in the horror section. They were cheap, easy-to-find, and they horrified clean-cut tight♥♥♥♥♥ultra-orthodox families. In other words: these movies were made for degenerates like me.The best way to describe a Troma movie is by imagining a steaming turd left to sautee in a vat of brown toilet water in a public restroom and occasionally puked on for a month. After that they take it out with a pair of pincers and dip it in fondue, then sprinkle it with confetti and truffle oil. It's Trash folks. But it's gold-encrusted trash made by sick-minded filmmakers for trash-loving fans; and when you grow up with that kind of art you learn to appreciate it like a fine French wine.Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz really tapped into something original when they started making these movies. I mean how do you categorize a film that has a handicapped kid getting slaughtered for points or a buxom beauty getting her butt burned by a mutated monster? A buffet of violence complimented by rock 'n roll music and sexual humor? This is the wonderful world of Tromaville and it is clearly a genre of its own.The video game is your basic RTS without the advanced tactics stuff. Honestly I could only stomach a short play. But its full of violence, foul language, pictures of naked women, and classic Troma songs (which can also be found as MP3s in the root folder). So what am I complaining about?			"

												X-Com meets Tromaville. I like both so I enjoy this one. If you are not a fan of turned based games and or the Troma movies, then this game isn't for you.I only played the first two missions so far, but it is fun. Control Toxie, Sargent Kabukiman and a new character the stranger and show why Surf Nazis musst die!Loyd Kaufmans narration is great, and the soundtrack is nice too (It consists of the soundtracks of the movies, and various metal and punk music, very fitting and fun to listen too, again if you enjoy that type of music). There is also plenty of Troma movie clips. Again highly recommended if you like turned based tactics like X-Com/Fallout/Jagged Alliance and if you like Troma.			"

												Please buy this, because the more money you give to Troma, the more projects Troma can undertake. That means Troma people will be able to live in TromaWorld for a while longer, and not in the real world.....and trust me, this is a win-win for everybody(Do you really want to see Uncle Lloyd wandering down your street???....Yeah, that's what I thought).As a 15 year old RPG, it is certainly acceptable, had a struggle getting the game to start the first time I tried to play it, second time it was fine. Taking items from fallen enemies could be a little easier, controls aren't as easy as they could be, but once you get the hang of it, the game does work, and it is fun enough I will be playing more			"

												Admittadly not the best programmed game. There are several bugs that have yet to be resolved. However, I must say that, as a fan of Troma and The Toxic Avenger, I couldn't help but enjoy myself. It has a wonderfully twisted sense of humor that is iconic with the studio and also has all the characters we know and love from its films. Everything from Toxie to Poltrugiest is here. If you are a fan of the Troma films and are looking for a good nostalgia trip, I'd highly reccomend this game. If you've never watched a single Troma film, nor do you intend to, I'd advise you play the original Grand Theft Auto instead.			"

												Tags : Tactical - SquadFrom what I gather this was part of topware's back catalogue, maybe an unreleased game or a prototype that they decided to launch on steam for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. It features narration content seldom seen in video games and for that alone it might be worth a look. It is nothing any adult have not heard a hundred times over but to see it made the cut as a part of a software is strangePros :+ Over the top , has a lot of character+ Cool music tracks+ Tried and true Action point/Health Point / Inventory Management appropriate for this kind of game+Isometric perspective with nice enough polish in the mapmaking-No indoor areas ?-No interactable items outside of possible loot?-No npc interaction?-Poor optimization?I tested this for fifteen minutes on a bugged out computer so this was not a proper testbench, it launched on windows 8 and it looked like it could be nice mindless fun to weed out the map of the ennemy and hear what the narrator has to say about it. I doubt there is much content past the first map if any at all... this doesnt seem like it was fleshed out to be a full gameLeave your comments to this review to clarify any misinformation i might have put hereLast advice : If you are a collector try to get this asap... I have a feeling that this might get pulled someday			"

												Wow Ive really loved troma movies for a long time.  If you are a fan of games like X-com and Troma then you might like this one! It's kind of a bad game but its troma so it kind of adds to the humor that it is so terribly bad. You can play as toxic avenger, sgt kabuki man and the stranger. Its all turn based combat, the best parts are the announcer (and owner of troma films). Some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥he says is just awesome. They show a boob in the intro of the movie too which is cool. If you think its worth it check it out, dont expect any awesome game here but if kabuki man killing hookers with his sword is your thing then check it out. Also toxic avenger carry's around his mop lolI did have some issues with the UI disappearing, hope its not a regular problem as its annoying and makes the game harder to play.			"

Kabukiman, Toxie, and Lloyd Kauffman himself, appearences from Lemmy, Matt and Trey of Baseketball fame, you'll soon realize the gameplay does not deliver.I played this for a short time, and the only thing it did for me was make me want to purchase Troma films.

												-Is this game bad? yes but...no- Is it functional? yes.-Is the game play hard?Nope. Similar to X-Com. Or the game they made for the movie Night Watch. (I know Night Watch is obscure but I wish was on steam because it was a decent game.)-Is it buggy? yes, but nothing game breaking just annoying. -Does it have Toxic Avenger and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.? Oh yes. -FMV Nudity? yep. -Is it fun or am I having fun? Yes in a weird way even though its terrible. I just wanted to finish each level just to hear what Lloyd would say next or what cool new video I unlocked. After a while I realized,""This isn't so bad."". If you are not a troma fan you may not want to buy this game. But.... for 2 bucks you may want to go to netflix and watch as many Troma films as you can and then buy this game. This is only if you are into horror/slap stick comedy that is extremely offensive. Should I buy this?Yes. Just know what you are getting into ahead of time.			"
