												Simple and short, really no lasting value. 6 units overall, 2 melee, 2 ranged, healer and slower. Place them, upgrade each ones health and attack 5 times, and use the three abilities of your main guy, the one you need to protect. That is it really. There are some resurect and teleport abilities, but they seem pretty useless as I did not need to use them once.Even counting the ""arena"" which is the same map 5 times, increasing in difficulty each time, there appears to be only 9 maps overall, even though it seems to suggest at the end that there is more, maybe unfinished? Each map will take you 5-10 mins tops. There is a high score feature that you can upload and see your scores against other players, but it basically asks you to register to do this and I felt uncomfortable putting this in so never completed it.Feels a lot like a phone or tablet game, even though I can play tower defense games on my phone that keep me busy for weeks, some of them free, all of them cost less than half as much as this.There is no way in the world you can justify spending the full price on this game, or even on sale. Should have been a little side game that came as part of the package when buying the Two Worlds 2 RPG.			"

												If there is one bright spot in Two Worlds 2 Castle Defense it is the combat animations, but this game is generally very dull in terms of content and actual strategy. The gameplay pretty much consists of placing troops, leveling them up, and waiting to win. There are a handful of spells to cast, but I rarely had to use them. The short 5 map campaign can be finished in just over an hour. This is one of those games you'll play once and likely never touch again.			"

												I love castle defense games as long as there is some story in them and it is very focused on strategy. This game however, I did not find challenging. I placed my characters, leveled their attributes and fast forwarded. The story is lacking severely from what I've seen without any character connection or goal besides ""You're doing this. Do it."" I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.			"

												Nutshell version: 2 hours of content only, no matter how slow you try to take it. Either get it for free or pass. What there was of it, was fun, though. Level 1 was a lot of fun. Do the arena first, btw. It is the tutorial and there's no indication that that's what you should do. So like I said, level 1 was fun. So was 2 and so on. My son and I had a blast debating which guy we should upgrade first. Thing is, 2 hours into it and we did every level plus the arena and finished every bit of content possible. We were both looking at the screen and saying, well, good thing we got it for (basically) free in the bundle on the christmas sale.  "

												9,99€ on this game is just the company showing that they only really care about money. This game only has a few different levels with the same mechanics in all of them. In fact this is the first game I have seen that displays all its content on the gallery of sample images on the store page.I got it in a bundle so I gave it a try. What I wasn't expecting at all is the lack of information about what you have to do. There are so few options that you can figure it out by yourself soon but there's not a single hint about what does each unit, what are they useful for, when should you upgrade them and what does that upgrade too.I've seen more work and dedication put into similar flash games released online for free.

												Pretty bad quasi-Tower Defense game. That the graphics are basic at best can be forgiven, but  the gameplay is dreadfully bland and boring. Even if  (or maybe especially if) you're a fan of the Two World series, skip this one. There are _far_ better TDs out there in the same price range.(On a side note, the game also has super-annoying online activation where you have to _type_ in your serial key, because copy&paste is disabled o_O )			"

												The gameplay is too simple. There's only 7 different units. Two of those are functional copies of another two. And one is a commander you can't place. All units have basically the same two upgrade options. Each level has a small number of fixed positions you can place your units. Also, it's short, only 6 levels and 5 arena levels. I finished it all in under 3 hours on easy. But due to the simplicity I was still bored. Fast forward wasn't fast enough. And I don't like how fast forward resets to normal speed after each wave. The graphics look nice, nothing fantasic but good.It's simple, it's short.			"

												Honestly the game is subpar, what occurs is that your units have ranges they can operate in, yet they have been given pre determined points of what you can put your units. This means the orcs will be coming at your troops in mass and your idiots won't move to save their own lives, such as an archer will literally be blasting one of your troops in the face, yet he will turn back and go to his dot because he is just slightly out of range. So this is more of a tower defense kind of game yet...not really, you only get a few unit types to work with, they are not imaginative, and only 2 ways to upgrade them, health and strength.I would rate this as one of my least favorite games ever, oh and you can't really change any of the game settings and they were so lazy that they don't even tell you what each magic spell does.

												One of the reviews I read says that this is even better than the base game that it is based on (Two Worlds II). I've unfortunately played that game and it was a horrible experience, every second of it. It is god awful in every way and has some of the worst combat I've ever seen in a game, so saying that this is even better deserves a few laughs. The first couple levels were alright but then the desert level with scorpions spikes the difficulty from a 3/10 to a 10/10. I was doing everything I could, laying down the best guys and I had champion guards, necromancer and healers, and all fire mages, all fully upgraded including my main captain, spent about 40+ minutes on the level fighting upwards of 20 waves, and late in the level on a late wave a boss scorpion still got through and killed my captain despite me doing everything I could. I tried three other times doing things somewhat differently but still doing enough that it should have warranted a victory but still ♥♥♥♥ed me over on or right before the big scorpion. Horribly misplaced difficulty spikes are a hallmark of a lot of bad games. I will be God damned if I try it a fifth time and waste another 40+ minutes of my life on an ignorant game like this. You have no freedom in how you play either. A lot of bad tower defense games are like this. You have to play an exactly exact specifically specific way, placing the towers they want you to place, on the places they want you to place them, and upgrade and build them in the ideal time frame that they want. Tower defense games with no freedom like this one are some of the most boringly linear games there are.Long story short I wasted over two hours of my life on this ♥♥♥♥ing dog♥♥♥♥♥♥garbage.Sucks massive d1ck. Sucks so bad I want my 99 cents back lol. I, no joke, would rather have flushed that dollar down the toilet than buy this game had I have known it was this d-ck suckingly bad. Paying someone to drop a cinderblock on my leg from the top of my house would've even been money better spent than buying this ugly, soulless, nonsensical, waste of time.			"

												this is sadly the best game out of the two worlds series. its actually fun and fights can be challenging at times without getting out of hand or unfair. if you like tower defense games or are just looking for a small game to kill some time, i would recommend this			"

												Rather average tower defense game that features rapidly rising enemy HP as the waves go. The available units are not very original or interesting, much less jolly, while the limitations to their placement appear uninspired.It's not the worst tower defense rendition I've seen, but it's also not worth paying money for.

												For some reason I thought you don't need much to make a good Tower Defense game. How WRONG I was... or maybe devs just doesn't understand the idea of this genre. Two Worlds II: Castle Defense is BORING. There is not much strategy you can use, Units are dull, skills are rather useless, maps are small and not a well planned for a game in this genre. I'm not sure if there is even any music when you are playing, all I heard were screams. Also, it's very short, with almost no replayability, which is a great loss for a Tower Defense game.Sure, there is thing or two I liked in this game. Like, teleportation between units. What's more... oops, that's all. There isn't more good thing I can say about this game. Can't recommend it to anyone. Don't start your adventure with TD genre with this game - it will ruin your fun with this genre. I wouldn't even say to try it out to people who are familiar with this genre because of how boring it is. It would be a different if it was some bonus thing for beating Two World II main game. Something you get for free, but for this price? Sorry, it's not even worth full price, half of it, and even one dollar. Two Worlds II: Castle Defense is worst Tower Defense game I have ever played.

Started up in a 800x600 window that doesn't capture the mouse or even accurately register when the mouse is over it. My mouse litterally only shows up in the top left corner of the game screen when i need to click a button on the bottom right corner. i completely deleted all local content and reinstalled and it kept the faulty settings. In other words i couldn't even play this game.			"

												I give this game a good rating on the stipulations that 1. You have thoroughly played and enjoyed either or both of the Two Worlds games; 2. You are intuitive to details when thrown to the orcs. This has a good soundtrack (copy pasta from Two Worlds II), and a storyline - however vague - to boot. Sadly, the mechanics aren't the best, and little to no hint as to even what level you should start off in (the Arena is the practice). Give it a try if you're a fan, but if you have any second guesses, wait for a heckuva sale.			"

												Please ignore the play time. I have finished the ""campaign"" as well as all the arena challenges.This is great, settings and options suck, the whole protection thing was crappy too. Lack of good leaderboard.Game is pretty solid, but can be easily beat by  Using beefed up archers/fire-mages. The damage they do is more powerful than anything the stupid necomancer could do. Necromancer does not raise fallen enemies. Damn.6/10 Abandonware, but still good enough to enjoy for a while.			"

												Nice concept of a tower defense. Shame it only comes with 5 maps (15 to 20 short waves each), which they dare call a campaign! And 5 challanges.... Content wise not worth the full price by far. I had a 90% off coupon, still wondering if I should have bought at that price.			"

												Tower defense game where you can spend points to change the position of your units and provide healing in addition to the normal upgrades.  Some units are cheaper to revive than heal if you sank enough gold into them.  Not worth the cost on its own, but it's part of the two worlds bundle.  Quite possibly not even worth it then due to the hundreds of tower defense games online.			"
