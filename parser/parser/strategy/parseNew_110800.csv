												I must say this is the most unique and engrossing games I have played in quite some time. The game forces you to slow down and look for clues in order to solve the array of mysteries that you undertake. Having a keen eye and a good memory is imperative to cracking the case. The interrogations are truly the most gripping part of the game; nothing is more exciting than getting a confession after spending hours unearthing clues, following leads, interviewing witnesses and chasing suspects.Team Bondi has changed the face of video games with L.A. Noire. The facial expressions in this game are unrivaled by anything currently out there, and they're not just used during cut-scenes, it's in effect at all time during the game; a level of dedication most becoming of a Rockstar Game. They're so good in fact that you're left wanting the rest of the world to be on par. I'm not saying that it looks bad but it is missing minor polish seen in other Rockstar games (I understand it's a Bondi game...) like limited damage on the cars, bullet holes are missing when a car or person is shot... and that's it. That's all the nitpicking I can pull off.Gunplay isn't as sharp as Grand Theft Auto and takes a little getting used to but it feels right for this type of game and works just fine. The focus isn't wholesale gunfights, rather poignant, key engagements that mean something; you are an officer of the law after all.Give this game a shot if you like cop dramas, film noires, GTA, tacos, fresh and unique gaming experiences.

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:L.A. Noire is an open world neo-noire police / detective game made by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It features crime scene investigation, interrogations, arrests, and possibly, for the first time in the Rockstar games portfolio, police chases where the player is the police.If you like movies such as L.A. Confidential (specially this one), Chinatown and The Untouchables, you'll definitely might want to give this game a try.PROS:+ Facial Animation: -The selling point of L.A. Noire is possibly the facial motion capture technology that was employed. It is this technique that makes the game's interrogations as close to realism as possible for the 'truth / doubt / lie' mechanic to work.+ Atmosphere: -The devs have done remarkable work recreating the wonderful city of 1947 Los Angeles. Although it may not be exactly how it was back then, it's still a large and magnificent city to explore. From the cars, the clothing, the buildings and the radio, Team Bondi certainly nailed the 1947 atmosphere.+ Investigation: -From examining clues to following leads, LA Noire delivers a great police / detective mechanic that provides fun and exciting experience.+ Sound: -Great voice acting, great selection of 1940s classic hits, a bit of radio news from that time, good sound effects and some very classical OST vibe. The voice acting makes for some very memorable characters with unique personalities.+ Playtime: -The game is extensive and will require some time to finish. From the main story, DLC cases, Street Crimes and Collectibles, there are a lot of things to do which is more than enough to make you feel that your money was well spent.CONS:- 30 FPS: -According to the devs, the reason for this was that the motion-capture technology would not function properly if it was not locked at 30 FPS. Be that as it may, most PC gamers would still expect certain games to run at 60fps minimum.- Awkward Body Movements: -I kinda feel they focused a bit too much on the facial animation and severely under developed the body animation. Most character movements are awkward and the bodies seem to move like they were made from cardboard or cement.-  No reward for Non-Lethal Arrest: -The game has optional 'Street Crimes' which can be solved by lethal or non-lethal methods (depending on the Crime). Unfortunately, there is no reward in trying to chase down a fleeing suspect and it would be much easier just to shoot them in the back. This disappointed me a lot.CONCLUSION:GOOD GAME for a GOOD PRICE. L.A. Noire captures the classical 1940-70 police / detective movies that once graced the silver screens but with a bit of modern sprinkles to it. WORTH IT?:Sale or full price, this game is worth every penny.I suggest that potential buyers of this game purchase the 'Complete' Edition which includes the DLCs because they extend the gameplay by providing additional 'Cases' for each of the game's chapters.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												L.A. Noire is a detective game, simple as that. If you're looking for another shoot everything rampage game like GTA just because this game is made by Rockstar then this is not the game for you. Sure there is shooting, but you won't be allowed to kill everyone in sight, running people over will affect your case rating etc. The Atmosphere	  Personally, I love the setting of the game, the late 40s jazz theme mixed with golden age Hollywood as well as a classic noir feel makes for a great mix, but while the storytelling is good, it's not all there. The story feels a bit like it's jumping around without finishing everything off, Rockstar gathered enough story for a movie, but not a 20 hour game. Because of this you will be left with extra things that feel like they are just there to fill up an hour of your time and parts of the story that are never properly concluded. This being said, the story has some great parts towards the second half of the game and does a great job 80% of the time, however the ending will feel incomplete.  Gameplay and Fun	 It's fun to drive around and using your siren to move people out of the way is great. The car chases are exciting at first but end up being repetitive, as with all the chases. Shootouts feel this way too and there are one or two that will feel boring. The combat tends to feel stiff from time to time. For an open world game it is very linear and the free roam mode itself actually takes some working out to access. Street crimes are fun to attend to and interrogations are challeging. The clue finding in the game is brilliant and walking around the crime scenes never gets old although you will quickly work out the set structure to finding all the clues. Sound	 The sound in the game makes for great immersion, no complaints here really. The hint sounds at crime sounds can be turned off if they make the game too easy and the whole feel of the sirens and the radio really sells the 40s atmosphere. Graphics	 The facial expressions are the best part about the graphics, I didn't notice too many hiccups in the graphics and if I did they didn't distract from the game. The faces of people look incredibly lifelike and all the other graphics are good too. The sunny setting of Los Angeles adds a bright feeling to the game. Replayability	 While you do have the option to replay your cases to get all clues and perfect your interrogation this game is likely to be one you will only play the story of once, it's still fun to drive around and do street crimes but the cases tend to be something that's best as a one time thing. Verdict	 Overall this game is great fun and a nice step away from GTA while still keeping to the Rockstart format. It feels fresh but also familiar. The graphics look very good for a game that came out in 2011. You will feel very immersed in the time period through use of sound and surroundings. The open world side has something to be desired and Los Angeles doesn't exactly feel as alive as GTA 4's Liberty City or Watch Dog's Chicago, it doesn't have much of a personality, the characters do. If you're looking for a good open world game, this isn't it, if you're looking for a good story with a mix of puzzle and regular shoot/drive gameplay and well designed characters then this is it. Get this if: You like a good story You want diverse gameplay that makes you think You like the Noir settingDon't get this if: You want full freedom in an open world You want to go on a killing spree You don't care about story  8.5/10	  "

												Behind the not so good PC port there's a very high quality game, with fun gameplay, story and amazing character face animations. All the characters were portrayed by actual actors (including random NPCs), with high quality acting. The overall atmosphere is fantastic as well, making you feel like a detective while driving around L.A. set in 40's, searching for clues and interrogating people. It starts off slow, but the story gets really interesting once you get to the Arson Department. If you like detective games, shows and movies - do yourself a favor and pick this game up.			"

												In GTA, you commit crimes and the police catches you for it.In LA Noire, it's the other way around. You're the one who catches those who commit crimes.If you love shooting people, crashing vehicles or fighting the police, then this ain't the game for you. Go buy GTA instead.This game is set on a fictional LA 1940s. It gave a different vibe when traveling in the open world.The detective stuff like finding clues or asking suspects questions were good, though they could've done better, but is IS a 2011 game. Many have changed in the gameplay of games through the years.I kinda understand why the gunplay is kinda clunky or kinda basic because maybe they focused mainly on solving cases. It's just my opinion though, but it's still fun.A very unique game. would recommend			"

												I have enjoyed this tremendously. This is probably the most expensive adventure game ever created, only without the point-and-click, of course. But you will be going from location to another location and looking for clues.You will scoff at the locked 30 fps and you'll be baffled at the confusing interrogations, however the atmosphere and the authenticity of this game is a marvellous feat. Los Angeles depicted in the late 40s is only a backdrop, but it plays its role well.Playing L.A. Noire was like watching a really great TV series – each case is around an hour and a half long, and they all tell a different story. If this were a film, it would be quite bland probably, but this is game, and with interactivity it comes to life. Also I have to say the face capture technology is not a gimmick but an integral part of gameplay, and I cannot wait for the next game by Team Bondi and Mr. McNamara.			"

												L.A. Noire is not for everyone, it's linear, you gotta make the right decisions or most of the time you'll see a game over screen.But for those who, like me, are into detective whodunit type of stories this game is for you.There's content here for all tastes in crime: traffic, vice, arson and the Homicide desk, which is the best IMO.The driving feels a bit stiff, but nothing that will bother you too much, since you can have your partner drive you places if you don't feel like spending time behind the wheel and want to get straight to business.There is quite some replay value if you want to discover all clues, get all the film reels, cars etc..*The producers really put some hard work in bringing 1947 Los Angeles back, the city is beautiful and feels alive, like every person walking the streets has a story to tell, the attention to detail in this game is amazing, its a pity that so many areas of the city are left out of the main story.Needless to say I recommend this game for those who are interested in deep narrative and focus on story rather than just mindless action.

												This is one of the best detective games I've ever played. L.A Noire is also very underrated compared to other games from Rockstar Games. Only problem with this game is the PC-port. The resolution was a little strange on my computer and unfortunately the game is locked at 30 fps. That basically means that it runs and looks  like the console version. I would actually recommend an xbox 360 controller to get the best experience.You play as Cole Phelps, a police officer. As the story goes you get higher and higher rank. You move up from a police officer to Arson Desk, Vice Desk and so on. You solve big murder cases by finding clues and interview witnesses. The story is good and comes with a plot twist and a surprising ending. The notable thing about L.A Noire is the Motion Scan though. It is a really cool technique where you use multiple cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. It looks so real, and I wish more games would use this. In L.A Noire they used 32 cameras just for the face.The biggest problem with the FPS-cap is when you're driving. The driving feels slow and laggy. However, the framerate wasn't a problem when I investigated things, and that's what you will do the most. You can have your partner drive to almost all locations (like a fast travel) which is great and prevents the problem. So if you're thinking about buying this game for the driving then I would say no, buy GTA instead. If you want a good action adventure crime game, then this is for you.It's tough to decide whether I should recommend this game or not. It's such a great concept with good gameplay, superb voice acting and Motion Scan, but the PC-port is far from good. I think LA Noire is too good to miss out on just based on the port though, so I would say i recommend it. Pick it up on sale and you shouldn't regret it. I got 45 hours of enjoyment just from the story, and I still have many side activites to do.			"

												There are games you know when you play that there hasn't been any real work put into it and most of the budget went into marketing. But there are some games that when you play, you KNOW that the sheer amount of creativity put into it and the expenses made to craft the experience and make a world has paid off.And then there's LA Noire.This game sets a new standard for the storytelling experience in games, not only with it's technology, but with it's excellent integration of good gameplay mechanics and using that as a way to unravel for yourself the world and it's mysteries.The gameplay involved in solving the cases is pretty solid, with you scouting for clues that will later be used in interrogations. Though the clue-hunting is little more than a game of click-everywhere-until-something-happens, the meat is in the driving sequences and the interrogations. The driving sequences make full use of the fact that there's a big open world out there and anything could happen. Simply driving from one place to another is a nice experience as you see in full glory the love and patience with which Team Bondi recreated 1940s LA. Of course these can be skipped but you'll be missing out on the side missions which dot the city from time to time and can only be discovered if you take over the wheels.But the true flavor comes from the interrogations. They used this technology masterfully in order to not only make the interrogations engaging, but also accessible with some exaggerations on the part of the actors which was done on purpose knowing full well the limitations this technology could have. Simply reading the expressions isn't enough since you also have to back up your accusations with evidence. This requires some thought and patience on your part and you need to read the descriptions of each clue carefully before using them. Suffice it to say that the game is worth it for these sequences and there are a LOT of them.The story too is quite excellent with many noire elements, plot twists and an overarching conspiracy. LA Confidential, the 1997 movie set in around the same time, was a considerable influence for the game.There are a few negatives though. Some cases felt like I wasn't really solving them. Even though ALL the cases have definitive culprits, there were a couple of cases where I felt I was simply going through the motions. The shooting isn't very good. The chase sequences on foot aren't really great as there are some navigation issues. Though the game is HUGE with MANY cases and the DLC also contributing to the list, there's not much to do outside the story missions which somewhat ruins the fact that these guys toiled so much to recreate this beautiful city. The PC port, though it has many of the features other PC ports lack like a good options menu and reasonable mouse support, it still is quite wonky though I wasn't too distracted by it.Minor faults don't bring down this excellent game though. It is something I would definitely recommend to any gamer who wants to play a linear story-driven non-action intensive game. Suffice it to say that after I was done, I missed the game and felt just a little hollow inside.			"

A criminally underrated game, a flawed masterpiece and one of my absolute favourites. If you love point and click games, games where you play as the detective or are just a fan of the noir genre: this one's a must-buy for you folks!I played this on the PC back in 2012 and I don't understand why it's taken me this long to make a review for this game... but here it is. I've got 120 hours on L.A. Noire and that doesn't even include the 100 hours or so I've racked up on the Xbox 360. Before I praise the hell out of this game, I'd like to go over some issues with this game in general:1. The main campaign's quite long (~20 hours) and at-times repetitive. This might not be a con for some people but it's worth mentioning regardless. Although there's a lot of variety, you won't shake off the feeling you've already done this x amount of times.2. The city hasn't got much to do in it. Another game, Mafia II, similarly shared this issue but there are street crimes or sidequests to participate in, vehicles to find and collectibles to attain. The stunning recreation of a 1940's Los Angeles is worth exploring but unfortunately there's not a lot of reasons to do so.3. The port is locked to 30 FPS. This is not a dealbreaker for people like me but again, I thought it was worth mentioning. There also exists several unofficial ways of unlocking this (and there's not a lot of negative side-effects which is neat).4. Performance can be hit and miss for a few individuals. I recommend swapping from Direct X 9 to Direct X 11 and vice versa for those people, as well as changing the Threading mode from ""single"" to ""multi"" and vice versa.With that out of the way, here's why you should get this game:1. The atmosphere. This game oozes it and you'll be immersed right away. Set in the 1940s you are placed in the shoes of a bright star who is rising through the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department. As you play as Cole Phelps and go from case to case: the voice acting and dialogue, the clothing, the cars... every little detail wants to convince you that you are in this setting. And to think an Australian team (Team Bondi) pulled this off. It's incredible and simply deserves to be mentioned.2. The story. The story doesn't reveal itself until later in the game and until then, you're working your way from one case to the next with the occasional collectible newspaper acting as a ""here's what's also going on"" feature. What I liked most about the story is that it's subtle early on and then it all starts making sense. It's nothing super-amazing but I would be lying if I said I didn't think it was good. Bits and pieces of the game world also serve the story well in reinforcing issues and ideas that were present in the 1940s.3. The characters. You've got a large roster with people of all different beliefs and personalities. Everyone feels unique, multi-layered and realistic. The characters further aid in immersing you in this wonderful game.


That's what she said.

4. The gameplay. Most of the time the game's rather slow-paced. You'll be walking or driving to a crime scene while picking up clues, but at points in the game, all hell breaks loose. A man starts a brawl with you! A criminal starts making a run for it! A shootout occurs! Moments like these help break up the monotony, and while most of them are scripted, they really are exciting. Don't go in expecting an action game though. When you're not searching for clues or being a badass: you're doing interrogations. I'll talk about this in the next point.5. The motion capture/interrogations. Never has a game utilized motion capture like this I reckon. When you're interrogating a suspect: you're not interrogating a NPC, you're interrogating someone that looks and acts like a real human being. It's something you'll simply have to witness for yourself. And this doesn't just apply to interrogations - the whole game uses motion capture for every character's face and I couldn't be more pleased with the result. Back to interrogations though... I love them. Some find difficulty with these but it's probably because the choices you have to make - Truth, Doubt or Lie - were originally called: Truth, Coax or Force. I have no idea why they were changed for the final product, as they make less sense. Still, interrogating is where you rely on this motion capture the most to see if the suspect is lying. Just like real life though: don't judge a person soley by their looks or behaviour though!6. The soundtrack. I could go on and on in this section but let me just say this: Team Bondi killed it here. You might not be a fan of 1940s music but you'll be able to appreciate just how accurate the setting feels.7. Everything else. The huge open city to explore. Being able to slap on a black and white filter in the options menu is just another thing that makes me love this game. Swapping between costumes for Cole Phelps is really nice too. Making different choices and the somewhat linear missions changing up a little to reflect this. The little conversations between Cole and his partners as you're driving in a car throughout the city. And if you don't want to drive? Being able to make your partner transport you to the destination in a few seconds or so. It's all small stuff in the end but it's the icing on the cake for me.Hopefully you can see why this game is so special to me. I believe this game still doesn't get the recognition it deserves but it's great to see more and more people are experiencing this gem. It's definetly not perfect but I believe this is a game that needs to be placed in a ""try this game before you die"" list. Writing this review... I suddenly have the urge to revisit Los Angeles. Rating 9/10.If you do plan on buying this game, I have to insist on getting the DLC for this game. It adds 5 great cases that slot seamlessly into the main story, as well as some new outfits and collectibles. I promise it's worth it.P.S.

												Review for L.A. NoirePros :- Awesome Playable Character- Strong Story- Amazing Face Animationscons :- 30FPS Lock on PC- Games looks outdated.Review : In L.A. Noire you play as Cole Phelps, War Veteran Who fought in the Second world war in The American army in Japan.After the war returned to Los Angeles he starts to work as a Cop, but after proving himself, he becomes a Detective...In the game your main goal is to solve cases as good and as truly as possible...in a City filled iwth Corruption and shady Characters...One of the things you will be doing alot in this game is Looking around, looking for clues.Interrogating people is also a big part of the game, Here is where the Face Animations play a big role...it can be really hard to see if someone is lying or telling the truth.Knowing this is a Rockstar game doesn’t mean its a shooting game or something like GTAyou're not allowed to just randomly kill people on the street or to carry a gun when you want.As a LAPD Detective your job is to protect the people of Los Angeles.There also isn't a Open world to this game, While doing mission you can have little sub mission in them,i noticed when i was driving to my next location some random event could happen on the streets, and its my choice to do something or just keep driving.this give it alot of replay value and just changed the passing abit.Overall I really enjoyed this game, and i clocked 21 hours in my first Play I also felt pretty sad and empty when the game ended.Hope L.A. Noire 2 is on its way.Release date : 20th of may 2011Developer : Team Bondi,  Rockstar North,  Rockstar San Diego,  Rockstar Leeds,  Rockstar New England,  Rockstar Lincoln.Publisher : Rockstar Games.Category : SingleplayerWebsite : http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/Platforms : Xbox360, Playstation 3, and Microsoft Windows.(Always do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.)[sorry for any grammatical errors]Follow my Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/ "

												This was revolutionary in gaming technology. Key word being WAS.I find myself having difficulty reviewing this game. It's such a mixed bag. In a nutshell, This game is fine. Just fine.The story follows you, a police officer played by aaron staton (More famously Ken Cosgrove from ""Mad Men"") as you solve cases in 40's Post war Los Angeles. Rockstar did well developing the enviroment. It does actually feel like i'm in a different period when I play this game. The story is solid, the characters are well written, and yes, the faces look legit. Thats pretty much the reason that I play the game.The game is on the other hand, a game made for consoles. The port is cancer.Good luck trying to boot it on windows 7. I had to jump through hoops just to get it playable. Oh by the way, there is a 30 fps cap. Read it agian. 30 FPS CAP. Even though you can disable it in the game files, the game really doesnt want you to. The reasoning behind this is that the facial animations were only RECORDED in 30 fps. you have the game running at 60 and the faces running at 30 and you get some weird graphical errors. Not to mention that on top of this the game is horrendously optimized. I mean cmon bondai. The game looks mediocre even for the gen it was made for, and you still can't make it run on older hardware.Anyhoo, Game is still fun enough to play because of the characters and actors. I'd reccomend it, but barely.			"

A Guide for L.A. Noire
By: ƝƖƓӇƬƁƦЄЄƊ

			I made this guide because the thread I posted to the community forum seems to have helped a lot of people. With this information in the form of a guide I'm hoping that it serves as a better source of knowledge on what...		


ORIGINAL REVIEW:Long story short, I found out that with an old, alternate version of L.A. Noire installed along with the Steam version that the Steam version worked perfectly. No Steam files were modified which led me to check the registry for changes.I used a registry compare tool and found out exactly which keys were added by installing the alternate version. I exported the 4 error handler keys and have included the download link here. Run these and the game should run just fine!I sincerely hope this helps you and that you're able to enjoy this incredible game once again!EDIT: People on the community forum have confirmed it works, try it out! ;)LINK:https://www.dropbox.com/s/pce4tzf7n5q289a/L.A.%20Noire%20Error%20Handler%20Reg%20Updates.zip?dl=1Mirror:http://www.filedropper.com/lanoireerrorhandlerregupdates "

												Really makes you feel like a professional detective of the LAPD. To be honest, this game can be repetitive sometimes, but addictive at the same time due to a great storyline behind Cole Phelps. You really have to take your time and assimilate the cases properly and find all the clues to find out the real guilty. What make me really love this game is the 40s atmosphere, on the post-war period, and of course see LA and Hollywood recreated on these period, with the old cars, interesting places, clothing, lifestyle... The face MotionScan is something unbelievable for a game made in 2011, so original and novel, the facial expressions just seems like real people that you can understand only seeing his facial movements.  Love that LA Noire mention the atrocious murders of Elizabeth Short and Jeanne French (Celine Henry in-game) by probably the mysterious Werewolf, besides you can do two cases about these murders and investigate them. Surprising final part, don't liked too much the end though, everything can't be perfect. Definitely, one of the best games Rockstar ever made, and my favorite in this company along with Red Dead Redemption.			"

												I'm (like most of the people here) unable to launch this game due to recent ""patch""Seriously Rockstar, this is beyond epic fail. FYI I'm a fan of this game with `100% completion rate and platinum trophy on PS3. I don't think it's a bad game, I just find Rockstar's execution for PC port terrible.Update: I have found myself a fix to get it working. The similar method which I used to get it working was posted by Nightbreed down below this review.P.S.This game has potential for screenshotting:

												One of the most unique games of it's kind, L.A. Noire is a tribute to old noir films of it's era. While it is open-world most missions are cases that serve as the main story. Don't go into it expecting 1940s gta because since you are a detective you cannot commit any crimes. Go into it expecting a more linear experience akin to Mafia 2. 19.99 is reasonable, but on sale this is an absolute must.			"

												What a frustrating and disappointing game.The most basic flaw with the game is the poor and inconsistent logic that's used to govern interrogations, which is the game's primary mechanic and conceit.Interrogations work like this: you ask a witness or suspect about a topic, and he gives a response, at which point you have to choose between three options to characterize that reply -- Truth, Doubt, or Lie. If you choose Lie, you must select a piece of evidence that contradicts the interviewee's statement. A correct choice nets you experience and possibly a new clue or lead, while a failure may shut down the rest of the interrogation.The problem is that sometimes you will have evidence that suggests a person is lying, but the game expects you to choose Doubt instead. Other times, the game expects you to accuse the interviewee of lying in cases where you're not calling out a specific lie, or where the evidence that the game wants you to use to substantiate the accusation does not clearly contradict the interviewee's lie.Here is an example; I'll be a little vague and change some names and details so it shouldn't be too much of a spoiler:Towards the end of a case, I was in a room with a crook that we'll call Tony. In Tony's office I found some clues, including some forged documents that were noted as having come from a corrupt businessman that I'll call Levy, as well as hard evidence that Tony had leverage over Levy. Also worth noting is that I had interviewed Levy earlier, and Levy's records helped lead me to Tony's location.During my interview with Tony, my character asked for information about co-conspirators -- this is apparently so you can learn about Levy, in case the player has not already encountered him in the course of the investigation. Tony stonewalls, saying he acted alone. To me, the correct response to this would be to call him out on the lie, and cite either the forgeries (which had Levy's name on them), or the evidence that shows that Tony has leverage over Levy (though it's really both of these pieces of evidence COMBINED that make Tony's lie obvious). But no, the ""correct"" response is to Doubt, which gets Tony to give up Levy as co-conspirator.In the follow-up question to that, my character asked who Levy is and where I can find him. This was completely stupid as my character had already interviewed Levy and knew exactly where he was. The stupidity was then compounded when Tony claimed that Levy is one of the gangsters I shot dead on my way in to Tony's office. However, I couldn't think of any evidence I could cite that contradicts that lie (""the fact that I know Levy's face"" is not a selectable piece of evidence in my notebook) so I selected Doubt. Wrong answer. Apparently, THIS is the spot where I was supposed to call him on the lie, by citing either of two pieces of evidence that did absolutely nothing to disprove Tony's claim that one of the dead gangsters is Levy.Those two pieces of evidence were a log in Levy's possession that showed that he sold the forged documents to Tony, and a scrap of paper that another detective gives you that basically just has Levy's address on it. I guess by the game's twisted logic, these two pieces of evidence each serve as a proxy for your own character's knowledge of Levy, because if you have the former evidence, or if you followed up on the latter evidence, you would know what Levy looks like. Instead that nonsense, why couldn't the game be scripted to simply check that I've encountered Levy and bypass the whole co-conspirators line of the interrogation, and just credit me with the rewards for having done the earlier legwork?It's because the game has a system, and even though that system isn't robust enough properly handle the situations that are written into the game, I guess they felt the need to stick to the system for the sake of consistency, even though the logic the system ITSELF uses is anything but consistent.The above situation also demonstrates how the game's writing can be a bit weak. What did Tony have to gain by saying Levy is one of the dead guys? He's making a false statement to a cop when he knows we already have enough evidence on him to convict, which is just going to add time to his sentence. He'd already given me Levy's name, and it would take a truly inept cop to not follow up on that and find Levy. He could be trying to protect Levy, but that doesn't make a lot of sense either -- the game makes it seem like Tony was just using Levy. At that point, Tony should've either stayed completely quiet, or he should've sold Levy out, without playing any more games. The self-incriminating middle ground approach that Tony takes is simply a contrivance to create one more piece of gameplay for the player to work through.This is just one case, but I experienced things similar to the above in basically all of the early cases. Too often you can have a solid understanding of the situation and the characters, but the mystery you face as a player does not lie in the details of the case -- but rather is figuring out what the game itself wants from you.The game also has some other issues. One annoyance is that you can drive from crime scene to crime scene, but as far as I can tell it's fairly pointless and boring. Either you end up driving around recklessly in GTA fashion (which doesn't make sense since you're playing the role of a notoriously straight-laced cop) or you sit at red lights and navigate city traffic with overly sensitive arcade-style controls. Fortunately, you can have your partner drive to your destinations for you.Another problem is that you can't directly review evidence you've collected after you've collected it. You do have access to a LIST of the evidence you've collected and a brief summary of it, but the summaries sometimes lack important info. I encountered one case where I acquired two separate pieces of evidence at different times -- both were documents that had a lot of information on them, but where it wasn't immediately apparent which details were important. You'd have to cross-reference them to draw a useful conclusion, but you CAN'T directly cross-reference them because the summary of each document that you have in your notebook doesn't include the pertinent info.Another thing worth noting is that this is a bad port. The aliasing (jaggies) are absolutely horrible, and the in-game AA feature seems to do absolutely nothing, even cranked up to 3X, which for some reason is the maximum. The frame rate is locked at 30 FPS (apparently due to the technology utilized in the facial animations -- a reasonable compromise would've been to have capped the frame rate during dialogue/cinematics, but uncap it elsewhere). Anistropic filtering is limited to 4X for no apparent reason. Screen tearing is rampant and there is no V-Sync option to address it. The game looks pretty bad, but would look fine if these technical features could be enabled and worked the way they are supposed to. It also seems to be poorly optimized -- I have a i5-2500k, GTX 670 and 8 GB of RAM, and at high/balanced settings, there was still some noticeable stutter.I haven't played deep enough into the game comment on the overarching story, but from what I have heard, it is also not one of the game's strong suits. I have since learned that there is a plot twist that I would've found infuriating if I had put more hours into the game.Overall, the game doesn't have any strong suits, other than the quality of the animation and performances during interrogation scenes, and there are some nice period touches that help capture that Noire feeling. But that alone isn't enough to make a game, in my opinion.I've tried a few times to get into this game. I want to like it, but I just can't. It's a shame. I hope someone takes another crack at this type of game though, and learns from L.A. Noire's mistakes.			"

PresentationL.A. Noire has an excellent setting, Los Angeles in the 1940's, and everything the game has to offer feels very true to this setting.The story of the game is very well written, offering insight to life in the 1940's overall as well as focusing even more on the lives of cops, crooks, and war veterans.GraphicsL.A. Noire's graphics are excellent. Even though the game's a few years old by now, it still looks spectacular, and nothing in the game is boring to look at.All the animations look great and it's worth to note that there haven't been better facial animations in video games after this game.SoundFrom the sound effects to the songs and shows on the car radio as well as the music that's been carefully selected to feel right in different situations, everything in this game sounds just right.GameplayThere are gameplay elements that will instantly feel very familiar to those who've played any of Rockstar's games before. But there are also many unique features that this game has to offer.The game is divided into different cases during which the players are also able to focus on different side quests like dealing with street crimes and finding different cars and landmarks.Questioning the suspects and other people of the world is done very well. Although, I have to say that on a few occasions, I felt that the right choices were a bit surprising to say the least.NoteworthyMy playtime of 38 or so hours includes just one playthrough with all the DLC cases included. I also did over half of the street crime missions and unlocked more that a third of the vehicles the game had to offer.I did come across a few bugs during my playthrough, but they were mostly graphical stuff that disappeared fairly quickly. I also experienced some stuttering every now and again, and the game did freeze two or three times during the almost 40-hour long playthrough. However, I feel that these had little impact to how much I enjoyed the game itself.The game does require for the player to log in to a Rockstar Social Club account, but it is possible to choose a ""Default"" account for which the player doesn't have to provide any personal information and which requires no email verification or the like.

If you like jazz motifs 40 years, the days of black-and-white film, and especially if you like detective stories with lots of crime, mystery, mysteries, chases and revelations then this is your game!!Pluses of the game:+ A good story.+ The atmosphere.+ Non-standard gameplay.+ Good animation and voice.Cons of the game:- Outdated graphics.- Some monotony in the gameplay and the lack of side missions.- Locke 30 FPS.My score: 9 out of 10 "

												Essentially LA Confidential: The Video Game. The similarities between the two are remarkable, although I'm guessing most of the inspiration originates from the books the movie was based on. LA Noire is not without its problems, but if you approach it thinking it's more like an interactive movie than a video game, you'll probably enjoy it. It just oozes atmosphere and setting. The acting is really good, and due to the incredible facial animations it's not just voice acting that you're watching.  You'll probably recognize various actors from other roles they've played (mostly on TV). It's really like nothing else I've experienced in a video games. The problem is the gameplay. There's a few parts to it: finding clues, questioning/interrogating witnesses and suspects, and fighting/driving. Finding clues isn't all that bad, although it can get kind of tedious. Questioning people is the fun part, as you have to pay attention to character's facial expressions (that originate from the actual actor that played the part). The combat, however, is pretty bad. It's clunky, shallow, and repetitive. Fortunately, it's not a major part of the game, so it's bearable.Overall, if you want to enjoy gritty, noire detective stuff, this game is for you.			"

""I can assure you I'm no war hero, detective.""  ~Cole PhelpsL.A Noire is a highly underrated game, emerging from an unusual meeting between open world action game, point-and-click adventure and a 1940' or 50' film Noire.The game places us in the role of Cole Phelps, veteran of the sixth marines, former war-hero from Okinawa who, after coming back to L.A. in 1947, takes up a job in LAPD. Through the course of the game we assist Cole in solving various cases grouped into four desks - traffic, homicide, vice and arson.Each case is diferent, and may require different aproach, but the general tools we use over the course of the game remains the same - we need to gater as much relewant evidence as we can, and later, eventualy use them to prove our point during many witnes questioning parts of the game. To nawigate through this piling mountain of names, locations and objects we get a cool interface feature resembling LAPD detective notebook, that alows us to track case progress anytime we need to.The strongest point of the game is definitely it's plot, settled in an alomost perfectly recreated 40's L.A. Cole's tale, as he rapidly advances through LAPD desk offices and departments perfectly catches specyfic atmosphere of Noire movies from mentioned times, with all it's moral ambiguity and dillemas. Above that every single case tells a story of it's own, often re-telling some well known crime-stories like 'Black Daliah' case, or creating a longer plotline connecting some seemingly unrelated cases.I'd strongly recomment L.A. Noire to any fan of Noire movies, and good thriller or crime stories. The game itself is quite specyfic and to be frank, due to the nature of it, the replayability of this title is very low (what point in solving a case, if You already know the culprit ?), but nevertheless it's still worth playing !Pros:- Amazing storyline based on 40's and 50' film Noires.- Game with one of the most convincing characters in history of VG.- Engine simulating real facial expresions and body language.- Story set in almost perfectly recrated L.A. from around mid 40's.- more than 90 historicaly correct car models to drive !Cons:- Extremely low replayability (due to the nature of the game)- Huge amount of cinematic breaks and introductions slowing the pace of action.- Controls may feel somewhat curde			"

												DISCLAIMER: IF YOU WISH TO PLAY ON 60FPS, USE WIDESCREENFIXER SINCE THIS GAME IS LOCKED IN 30FPS. FOR FOV, USE FLAWLESS WIDESCREEN AND PRESS EITHER + OR - TO CHANGE THE VIEW. THE PORT FOR THIS GAME ISN'T REALLY THAT GOOD BUT THE GAME ITSELF IS. LA Noire is an open world detective game set in the 1940s after WWII. You play as a Cole Phelps, a marine turned police officer then detective. You solve cases from traffic to homicide to vice and then arson. PORTThis game was ported by Rockstar Seeds who were known for porting other pc games either developed or published by Rockstar such as GTA 4. Team Bondi developed this game for Xbox 360 and Ps3 and a year later, Rockstar Seeds brought it to PC. Like GTA 4, LA Noire isn't really that a good a port, maybe worst if you ask me. There's no mod support so there's nothing anybody can do fix the issues this game has. The PC controls aren't that well so you need a controller. The framerate is capped at 30fps, unless you use the tool I mentioned above, it's easy to use. However some of the physics in the game will be messed up when playing at 60fps, there are videos on Youtube that shows it. But just cap it back to 30fps for a minute and you'll be fine. Also there are plenty of texture pop-ins everywhere you look especially driving. It's obvious how much they truly cared from this console port.GRAPHICSAs stated there are a ton of texture and assets popping up in the screen but you can handle after a little while. The amount of detail in this game is amazing. As a guy who lives in Los Angeles, I actually recognized a lot of buildings in the game, the amount of work put into the interior, and exterior design of the city is beautiful. As you may know, this game utilizes what's called MotionScan, where the developers used 32 high definition cameras to capture actors faces. While it looks great, less attention I believed was put into the bodies since it was done separately. STORYYou start as a cop, then rise to becoming a detective. The story is told by the cases you solve, however the actual story to the game does start later near the end when you're in vice. You can pick up the pieces to the story by picking up newspapers as you're doing the earlier cases. The dialogue in this game is well written but there were some times when I felt that the actors where overdoing it. Above all, the story is really good and dark since that's what you would expect from the noire type of entertainment. GAMEPLAYRockstar may have published this game but it doesn't mean you blast gas stations up with a rocket launcher. To simply put, the gameplay is extremely limiting. You can browse the open world detail of LA Noire but there isn't much to do in this game when not doing the cases. There are mini side quests where help people out but they're really short (Lasts about 1-3 minutes). Interrogation in this game consists of asking a question and wondering if that person's telling a truth or lieing and expose them with evidence, or doubt them if you don't believe them. Like other Rockstar games, there are gunplay but in my honest opinion the gunplay in this game feels like an arcade game. It's not the same as GTA or Red Dead Redemption's gunplay which I think is amazing (Rockstar please bring to PC).CONCLUSIONI believe you will enjoy this game especially when getting the Complete Edition which has every case the game has to offer. I know I haven't said much about your character Cole Phelps but to honest he has no personality at all. You don't know much about him in a personal level. 1.) Port isn't that good (30fps lock)2.) Environment is really well detailed and amazing3,) Don't know much about the character you play as.If on sale, get this game and have fun, it's a long game.			"

 L.A Noire Review Information Game - L.A Noire Publisher - Rockstar Games Developer - Team Bondi Release Date - 17th May 2011 Genre - Action/Adventure Trading Cards - None Achievements - yes(60)When i first saw this game at the store i wondered wether it's gonna be worth it,Rockstar games famous for making games like GTA,Manhunt and Red Dead Redemption gonna make a cop game!? It was a change from their usual games and quite a brave move.I thought this was gonna be a game nobody would remember,but boy was i wrong...   Categories Details   Story In LAN you play as an LAPD cop and later detective named Cole Phelps a former war hero in WW II. LAN is set in the Los Angeles of 1947 which has been created beautifully.In the game you start up as a cop and later get promoted due to your notable breakthroughs.At first it seem LAN has no story and it's just random cases which you have solve but later on as you proceed you unravel a story of army surplus Morphine racketeering and land bussiness scam which has Cole personally involved as his former army freinds are being murdered.It also features many sub-plots and also shows past incidents of Cole's life in the army which forms a major part of the  plot. The game's story is very well told,the way each case in the later part of the game coincides with the plot revolving around the protagonist is wonderful.The cases which are not related to the main plot are very well told as well and most of them are inspired from real life crimes which kinda gives you creeps when you play the missions featuring gruesome murders.The voice acting and facial acting is very well done as well. Yes i said facial acting. Team Bondi has used some technology using multiple cameras and used the real expressions of the actors in the game which along with good voice acting adds to the atmosphere. When the characters talk you feel like they are real people.It is one great feature of L.A Noire. SCORE: 9/10    Gameplay The gameplay of LAN is simply unique.The gamplay ranges from gun fights,melee fights,foot chase,car chase,tailing missions(both in car and foot),driving cars,puzzle solving(riddles and stuff)investigating clues,interrogation.You play the game as a cop and paly through various departments. You start the game as a patrol man then get promoted to be a detective at the traffic department,then to homicide then vice and finally arson.The best missions are the one in homicide and vice.The game's uniqueness lies in it's clue finding and interrogation.In the interrogation you question your witness and when you are answered by the suspect, you must determine wether he/she is telling the truth or lying. You are given three options in this mater, 1st option is truth which you select if you think the suspect is telling the truth,2nd option is doubt which you choose when you think your suspect is lying but don't have any proof and the 3rd is lying when you think your suspect is lying and you have proof to back up your charge.You may wonder how to determine wether your suspect is lying or not well it's by studying the expression of the suspect.As I told you earlier the technology used in this game is unique and the real expression of the actors are used. When people lie they make all sorts of silly expression(susupicious) and when telling the truth they look straight faced.If you accuse a person the of lying make sure you have got proof and from the clues listed in your notebook you have to choose the correct ones as selecting the wrong one will get that question wrong.Though making mistakes won't totally fail the case but getting less than half the questions on the case right fails the mission.Passing the missions is not the only aim,you are even rated from between 1-5 stars,the more stars you get the more salary you earn.Detucting these truth-lie mechanisms are sometimes easy and sometimes hard.You have to stay attentive in order to get the correct clues to branch to the questions. Wether they ae lying or not is mostly easy as while lying the actors make silly suspicious faces,selecting the real clue is a challenge.As this is a cop game you cannot always carry around your gun on the streets and use it,they can only be used during gun fights.Driving mechs are simillar to that of the GTA games and you can take any car on the street and drive it,only this time you don't punch people on the face but show off your batch take the car saying you need it for upholding justice.Driving is pretty easy but don't expect to see Lambourghinis as this is set in the 40's.The game has side missions in the form of street crimes that is crimes that have sprung up immediately and the crime is still in the act where you have to respond quick,it can be chasing the criminals or fighting them.The puzzles and riddles are very well done as well, most of them really challenge your brain while some are very easy.Open world is not directly in the main game(as u r actually solving a case at the beginning of all cases) but from the menu you can select the free world mode and play it but there is nothing of much interest.Crashing cars and damaging properties will affect you rating and minus your salary(though they are of no use in the game).Killing people while driving be penalised as you fail the mission in doing so. Though it has got some unique feature palying LAN at a stretch might get boring. SCORE: 9/10     Graphics The graphics of LAN are mordern considering the date of release of the game(2011) and are sweet to the eyes even now(2015).This graphics quality along with the facial feature technology used in this game for the first time in video gaming history is awesome. The city of Los Angeles of 1940's looks beautiful and is realistic(even features racialy biased cops),It really feels like your are in the LA of 1947. SCORE: 9/10 L.A Noire is a great game for all lovers of adventure and action and suspense story and noire theme lovers and every gamer(until you r a hard core COD fan who feels that COD deserves GOTY).The game is really well done and is worth every penny.Also get the DLC bundle of this game(which i had,and it gives you extra missions).Playing LAN made me feel like a real detective.Go get it,it's a must have in your library.  Overall:9/10 If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												LA Noire is a rather interesting title. It's a Rockstar game but it was developed by an Australian developer named Team Bondi. Why this is relevant is many of the developers from Team Bondi made an eerily similar game called The Getaway which also focused on cinematic action.LA Noire is unlike the Grand Theft Auto games it gets compared to. A big focus of the game is it's cinematics and it's interrogation mechanic. Where the player is required to tell if a character is lying or not. While I would say it was implemented fairly well, unfortunately the developers confuse you every so often with the range of options. Sometime a suspect isn't lying but rather just not telling enough information. And instead of selecting lie you're supposed to select ""doubt"". Thankfully the developers also implemented a lifeline style mechanic where you can ask the community what the most commonly selected responses are.While I would say LA Noire was an excellent game unfortunately it was an imperfect one. The game starts out exceptionally well and the quality of the writing stays consistant until the middle. After the homicide desk the writing begins to get worse and worse, to the point when you get to the ending you begin laughing at how ludicrous the entire thing is. I wouldn't say the experience isn't worthwhile but don't go into this expecting it to be Red Dead Redemption levels of satisfaction.It's unsurprising to find out this game had two entire desks cut (of which 4 remain in the final release) considering the storyline remains just a little half baked. It's unfortunate to see with such an ambitious game, but since it was in development for 8 years it's surprising that it came out at all.			"

												L.A. Noire has a dark secret and I am NOT talking about it subject matter! The game was programmed for consoles, then ported to the PC with minimal thought. This game, only runs on specific configurations of PCs. If one tiny thing about your PC is ""iffy"" in the opinion of the game, then it is likely that it will not even run! .NET archecture issues are common with this particular port.Tech support is nonexistant for this product! Avoid this port at all cost. Buy at your own risk. ALL the game time I have for this game is just me see the same title card over and over (as the game attemps to actually boot) with zero gameplay experience.			"

												Great game, the DLC bundle is highly recommended Pros:Something new, it's not only an original concept, it's also well executed It looks really good considering it's an old gameMotionScan - It's incredible, it's not only a detailed model, every facial animation is perfect. the character in game  looks like the actor in real life[i.imgur.com] (remember, it's a 2011 game)  Great story, I'm not going to spoil but, it's worth it, really ""cinematic"" L.A. is awesome, as every Rockstar openworld Great music, perfect voice acting Great driving physics, tons of cars, although, remember that it's not a GTABonus pro: Fantastic-Fedora-physic system, in fistfights and shootings your fedora can fall and you can get it back walking close to the hat, 10/10Cons:It isn't a great port. It crashed a few times and it's capped to 30fps (BUT it's not that bad, this is not an action game, 60fps are better but are unnecessary in this case)Not for everyone. This is not really a cons but... even if the game is tagged as ""Action"", if you are buying this game expecting a GTA you'll be disappointed. Shootings and pursuits are just a (facoltative) part of the gameRockstar DRM :C "

												After playing L.A. Noire for around 400 hours on the PS3 version, I can safely say this is one of my favorite video games ever. Everything about it is PERFECT. I love the realistic facial movements and the setting. The story is great too, badass ex-soldier in the police force catching the crooks and solving tough cases with little help is always great. The DLC's are FANTASTIC too, especially the Nicholson Electroplating DLC. I loved it so much. If you're having second thoughts about this, don't. Get it on ANY console and play it. I can't say ""pc master race"" for this because although the graphics are definitely better in the PC version, it's still locked to 30FPS. Although that doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece. Please, just immerse yourself in Los Angeles and play this wonderful game.			"

												Many have complained that the game wont start. The soultion is to, turn off  ""Beta testing"" option in Steam and the game will work again. The other problem people might have is 30 fps, this can be fixed by using the ""wide screen"" option in desktop/ graphics option prior to the game menu.  This is a flawed masterpiece and one of my absolute favourites along with GTA, Max Payne and Mafia 2.L.A. Noire's absorbing investigations and intoxicating sense of Noir style make it an unforgettable journey through the seamy side of the City of Angels.L.A. still had streetcars in 1947, but it was a city quickly becoming dominated by the automobile, and that's the only way to travel in L.A. Noire. Thankfully, driving is fun. The gunplay is very easy to pick up. You can hide behind cover, and pop out to squeeze off shots. L.A. Noire isn't all about badgering people, though. This is still an open-world game. You're free to deviate from a case, explore faithfully recreated 1947 Los Angeles, and tackle more action-oriented missions. No, you can't run wild like in Grand Theft Auto (you're a cop, accept it), but there are some other things to do. Forty ""unassigned cases"" come in as calls on the radio.Gunfights, foot chases, car chases, and the occasional simple brawl don't just spring up during cases. They're also a regular part of the street crimes that are reported over the radio, which you can choose to respond to or ignore. The voice acting is good and the visual face effect when someone is tense after telling a lie, is brilliant made. The  game has car chases, gunfights, and a point-tally to judge the quality of your police justice, but it's a slow-paced, meditative experience. The focus isn't on how good you are at scoring headshots with a pistol but instead your ability to read a suspect's face and determine if he or she is telling the truth, holding something back, or flat out lying.I felt that even if the  game had  21 cases, some of which can take more than an hour to complete, L.A. Noire drags at times because it recycles the same drama and you cant help feeling a sense of Deja Vu. There's an omniscient narrator in the early missions of L.A. Noire who disappears halfway through and never returns. I also felt that Phelt story was forcefully told and often too hasty and in bits so you never get the whole picture about his personality or his past.			"

												L.A. Noire is about a detective named Cole Phelps that worked in post-WW2 late 1940s Los Angeles. Gameplay is open world and consists entirely of interviewing/interrogating people, chasing suspects with cars/on foot, shootouts with criminals, and walking around crime scenes or area of interest to find clues and evidence. This is a pretty unique game since it's made by Rockstar, which is well-known as the creator of GTA. You get to be the good guy this time, including chasing & ramming cars that will be ended with you busting the suspect GTA-Style (remember Busted scene in GTA? you're the cop here).  Even with obvious low-budget graphics, the story was very well made and the characters expressions (face and voice) are EXTREMELY 'alive' compared to other games. This is because you get to judge whether someone is lying or not by facial expression/voice tone. Ah, if you're a classic car lover, this game paid a lot of attention to them. In short, L.A. Noire is a very out-of-the-box interesting detective game that is definitely worth the price.Now let's talk about the good things first. I'm no policeman and I have no experience in any police work, but I dare to say that with a huge amount of available cases and side missions, the game will definitely satisfy your thirst of 'problem solving' or 'mystery' or straight out 'detective work'. I definitely can't say it's realistic (apparently, shooting someone in the leg made fatal chest wounds) but it's...well-designed. The cases are all realistic with carefully designed motives and chain of events. You'll find the thrill of being in a crime scene looking for clues like footprints, shoe sizes, blood traces, injury marks, and other 'detective stuff'. You also get to judge whether someone is telling the truth or lying by looking into their faces and voice tone. Facial expression is carefully designed to show real-life 'lying' or 'truth' or 'holding out' expression (e.g. eyes looking left when lying). Bored of the same routine? Whenever you're driving, you'll receive dispatch calls that will give you side-missions. So yeah, the main advantage of this game is its well-designed gameplay.The bad parts of the game is really not that much and does not affect the gameplay. Graphics looks very low-budget, it's as if they put all of the graphics money into character's facial expression realism. But in my opinion, it's still in the acceptable level. The weapon choice is also very limited, only Colt 45, Thompson, M1 Garand, and BAR. Since the game is not focused on the gun fights, this issue has miniscule effect.  And as a good guy, you don't get to do the legendary GTA reckless driving. You don't have to follow traffic rules and all but you can't run over pedestrians or ram cars that cut you off if you don't  want your case report to be ruined. Some of the cases are also pretty complicated, giving you a long list of person of interest and clues. This particular mission gave me the 'What am I doing? Who the heck is this guy? Whoa, now who are you? What's their connection to the case?' moment. But that's the fun part, right?In conclusion, the gameplay is very unique and I don't think there are many open-world detective games out there. This advantage makes this game a 'must-play' for me and it's worth every cent. I spent over 13 hours and I'm not even a quarter finished of the whole game. The cons of the game is almost meaningless and it will not ruin the gameplay. I definitely recommend this game, it's worth it. "

												""Chasing a suspect while 10 people got ran over in the process"" 10/10 - IGNOkay for the serious review, I love this game so much. It's one of my favorite game among of any other games I owned and still replayable until now. So the storyline sets in 40's, this game made by Rockstar but you didn't expecting to be a gangster or a criminal just like any other Rockstar games but instead you became a police officer all the way to a detective in Los Angeles and your task is to protect the city by.... you know, solving crimes and stuff. For investigating the crime scene, you can find some clues around the place like blood, weird paycheck or any other interesting things for you to show some evidence to anyone you're going to interrogate. The game has very intensed motion capture to show the emotion of certain victim, suspect or anyone you're questioning whether you see his/her face like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off or really sad and its up to you to confirm if they're lying or said the truth. Graphics are good too for a game that releases in 2011 and you can see some tiny details popping out from the map. Talking about the map, its not really that 'open world' just like GTA series but there are some random activities you can do like chasing a criminal while you're on free time or collecting some vintage car somewhere around the map to keep you hooked up. Oh you can also change the game colour into black and white if you prefer the 50s Noir Movie-ish. So thats really about it and why not you pick this game up if you feel like to become a detective and want to play something different than the other. But I recommend for you to pick this game up on sale but hey thats just my opinion. Also I'll give it 8.7/10 :)			"

""SHUT YOUR FU*KING MOUTH. SINCE WHEN DOES A BAG MAN WORK A CASE?""It's been almost a year since I wrote something up here. But well, everybody is at some point back, where he started, so I figure it out, why just don't write up the review for a game, which is in my personal TOP 10. Right?When I look back, and check all the products, that Rockstar Games has put out, I'm not even sure if I'm able to name at least one, which was average or even under that. They even made a fantastic movies, didn't they?When they try to make open world game, it's understandable that comparision with Grand Theft Auto is not anything bad.  Red Dead Redemption v. GTA. / Bully v. GTA. / The Warriors v. GTA (My lord, The Warriors are even better than GTA in some way) / and also Midnight Club for some reason. And there comes the L.A. Noire. New genre that R* step a foot in, and got out as a king again and again and again. L.A. Noire is as you of course know the detective game set in 40s Los Angeles. You can compare this to Sherlock Holmes games, and Cole Phelps will be still better detective. Story is so gripping that one case might drives you crazy, and then you realize that Rockstar is just master of art in the gaming world.There is one thing, that I also realized during the exploration of LA which is really huge and more realistic than GTA V would ever be. However, the developer itself pretty doesn't give a flying f*ck if people discover beautifulness inside. I am talking about hidden spots and interesting places all over the Los Angeles. It's pretty usual that some devs puts spots out to player to see them. R* is not doing that way. They put tons of spots, and hide them even more than usually. This game is filled with landmarks, and especially golden film reels which are pretty difficult to spot. Thing is, that even after discovering 30 of various world-famous places and 50 hidden golden films, you can go further, explore on your own, and discover spots that wasn't made for casual player, but for true explorer. I've been to LA this year, and I must say, that a lot of places that are shown in this game, looks practically same (not just landmarks, also the standard streets at some point) no matter the time game is set was more than 70 years ago. I've talked a lot about the town, but I have to be honest with you, but town is most enjoyable thing for me personally in the game. More than the characters, more than Cole and more than the story and cases. More than 20 cases ready for you (which lenght of the one might be easily above 40 mins) 40 side street crimes, and enormous spots to discover for you. Great thing was, that besides the main story line, there was a lot of different stories going all way along and meet each other in the end.I've got to tell you much more, but I will leave it. I don't want this review to be another Saints Row 3 review of mine :XBonus Point: AtmosphereRating: 10/10 "

												Well, there has been some time since I've played a game this intriguing. L.A. Noire is more like a classical 'noir' movie rather than a computer game, and you get to play the star of the movie! The storyline centers a young, promising police officer -later detective- named Cole Phelps in 1940s Los Angeles. His tale has everything: crime, murder, trauma, love, politics, justice, conflict of interest and ethics... mostly conflict everywhere.The atmosphere is magnificent, graphics are more than satisfying and story builds around many twists and turns, always keeping you wondering about what might come next. The investigation process is well displayed, heavily depending on observation, whether it be a mimic of a suspect, or a tone in the witness' voice. The environment is wast and it is possible to get lost if you're not following the map indicators. You carry the full option of roaming the streets of L.A. to hunt for all kinds of achievements, and even venture out to solve trivial street crimes. I once again agreed that Rockstar never abstains from investing in environment design.Controls of the game is a bit hard to master in PC though, I think this game is better suited for PS or Xbox in that manner. Vehicles are impossibly hard to control - at least for me, but my reflexes were never that great so I'm not the one to have a final call on that -  and that would be the sole minus for me that I've observed so far. I found myself preferring my partner to drive rather than myself, and that's a bit disappointing. Oh, well: I'm not in for the perfection anyhow.I recommend it with CAPITAL CHARACTERS; for the story, graphics and display altogether.			"

												L.A. Noire: One of the greatest detection games that was ever made.+ Great story.+ Great gameplay.+ Great graphics (The game came out in 2010).+ Great soundtracks.+ Great voice acting.Once you start playing this game and you get into it, its really hard to quit it until you finish all the cases. One case closing open's another case. The game is so well made, and I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes a good detection and mystery game.			"

												Let me start by saying that this is probabaly one of the most underrated rockstart games. Hell, it's probabaly one of the most underrated games in general. While the game can be a little anoyying at times, and boring towards the middle, seeing the ending and how the story unwinds is really worth it. You can tell how much work was put into this game. It's insanley detailed. This game has movie/RPG elements so if you're into that, give it a shot!			"

												This is the best detective game on Steam at the moment. You play as Cole Phelps, a veteran who went into police work in order to keep serving his country and dispense justice. As you play, you say to hell with procedure and take the initiative to solve the crimes the lazy detectives are glossing over. This gets you promoted to become a full-time detective, and you make your way up the hierarchy of crime investigators.I'm not gonna bother dividing these things into pros and cons. If you need a detective game in your life, buy it. If you don't, read this review and buy it.GAMEPLAY:You're not buying the game for this:- This is a third person open world game, yet it has nearly nothing to find or do in terms of free roaming. Between missions you may accept a street crime side mission, but they often boil down into a chase, a car chase or a shoot-out, all of which probably won't get your blood pumping. Do yourself a favour and just follow the story; it's pretty long.- The combat is boring and generic. The weapons bear no real feeling of impact and you can take a lot more bullets than the bad guys. Melee combat is practically unexistant. The combat is merely a way of prolonging the game and supplement the story.- No reward or change if you decide to go for a non-lethal arrest.- The driving is nothing spectacular. It's far less enjoyable than in most Rockstar games in that it's pretty slow and car chases force you into just trying to keep the driver in sight until the game decides that he's arrived at his final destination. Occasionally you will be able to have your partner shoot out the suspect's tires, which feels alright, but you won't be aiming.- Interrogation is a pretty fun mechanic which is probably what this game is known for. You have to read the suspect/victim's facial expressions and pick up on uncertainty or curious claims, then decide if they're lying or telling the truth and reveal more info/clues if you answer correctly. Sometimes you'll be dealing with good liars that the game won't tell you about, who tell you their side of the story very rigidly and confidently, but without the facts adding up. This is to make sure you know have an overview of the case and it's a very nice touch.- Facial features and animations are great, since a fairly thorough facial motion capture method was used for every character and gels very well with the story. As a result, every character in the game looks like the person who performed the voice.- The game is locked to 30 FPS for the facial motion capture to work.STORY:The reason this game is nothing short of phenomenal:- Between cases, you will sometimes get a clip that goes back to Cole's participation in the war in Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbour. From the very beginning of the game, you'll be seeing these clips/flashbacks and they will play into the story as you progress. The way the game creates parallel story lines that eventually cross into eachother is absolutely fantastic.- The cases are often connected to eachother in some way; I can't say much without spoiling it. - They're also fairly devoid of plot holes and create a comprehensive and complete experience.- The job eventually expands into your personal life, even though it initially doesn't seem like you even have one.- Characters from the story occassionally appear in the side missions (street) crimes, which is a nice touch but it won't mean or matter much.- The atmosphere is extremely immersive and convincing; when you launch this game, you turn into L.A.'s top detective in a realistic city based on real places with real landmarks. The music amplifies the detective noir vibe and is probably the final aspect that gets you into the role.Every character wears clothes and sets their hair in a way that is true to the time period as well.- The voice acting is absolutely beautiful and convincing in every aspect. Team Bondi really scratched together some very talented people.L.A. Noire does what is does very well, and as long as you're willing to look past the FPS cap and just follow the main story line, you will be an experience richer.The interrogation mechanic might get dull after a while; for this I recommend you consider what you'd answer in a situation and then look up the correct answer in a guide to keep you trekking along.

												The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, The Big Combo. Why am I mentioning these movies? Because this game is a movie. The name is L.A. Noire. It takes a lot from the style of film noire of the 1940s. With that being said you're in for one hell of game. Absolutely fantastic story and characters; combined with a beautiful map and fun gameplay. It's a very unique game in my opinion; there aren't many like it. I stretched the game out for a long time (almost 6 or 7 months) so when I finished it was almost like I had binge watched a tv show on netflix and it was coming to a close. One of the few games that actually made me emotional at the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who's considering it. The game is usually very cheap during $ales and the game is rather lengthy so it's a steal. WHERE'S MY SEQUEL?!			"

												One of the most unique game I would recommend to any gamer that has strong sense of justice, and is ready to take on a game that's not like any other.   From wild car chases, bank robbery shoot outs, interrogating suspects, all behind beautifully recreated 1940s LA enviroment, that will keep you entertained for hours.Aside from the well thoughtout dialogue and huge open world to explore,  this game's highlight goes to facial expression each character makes.  Thanks to ""emotion scan technology"", LA Noire raises the bar in realism to the next level.  You would have to play it to believe it.  Love the boldness from Rockstars on making such unique game by staying away from streamline genre and using new technology to bring out a timeless master piece.Screen Shots

												Finally a game where you play as a cop! And not some traffic warden but a Los Angeles detective Cole Phelps.The investigation process is the second best part of the game, after the story (see below). The search for clues will make you really punctilious and bring deep insight into all cases. The interogation is even better with the best game facial animation I have ever seen making some characters an obvious liars whereas others might seem honest. What kind of police officer would you be without chasing criminals? This takes me to the third part of police work and that are the gunfights and chases on foot or in cars. These elements aren't the main plus of the game since it's not a shooter of any kind - if you want to buy the game for the action only, don't. However, though these are weaker than in Mafia II for example, they are a nice contrast to the peaceful investigation and they balance the neat investigating with some action, which is important for you not to get bored from finding clues only.Apart from the extraordinary facial animation the graphics is about average. The city of LA is really big and contains lot of hidden secrets, such as cars, sights etc. for completionist gamers. Though the city really is wonderful, it doesn't feel as lively as it might be. Apart from the cases and street crimes, there isn't much to watch. But that isn't much of a drawback - not many games have that (maybe the Watch Dogs will).Finally, the story. There's a lot to spoil so I'll take this just briefly. It focuses on many things and mentions lot of important topics, which make it really strong. As set in the year 1947, it connects the horrors of war and Cole Phelps' military history with the police investigations and lot of other topics, you'll encounter in the streets of LA such as drugs, racism, prostitution, rapes and lot more. I enjoyed the last Arson desk a whole damn lot because it shows nobody is plain black or white, evil or good. Some characters are antagonists, though you feel the morale in their acting, others have it the other way round. It also shows how thin line lies between good and bad, between friends and enemies.To sum up - this game promises something quite different from others as you'll be playing at the right side of the law meaning lots of new aspects and a fantastic story. The weakest thing I can think of is that you cant skip the ending credits :)9/10			"

												L.A. Noire is a beautiful tale of the grime that lurks just below the surface.GAMEPLAY:     There are 4 main types of gameplay at work here the first is investigation, the second is interrogation, the third is car chases, and the fourth is gunfights. The first and second forms mentioned make up the meat of the game with 90% of the game consisting solely of walking around, picking things up, and talking to people. The gunplay and driving could both be improved, but they both occur so infrequently and can be skipped that it is hardly considered a real negative. The biggest issue I have with the gameplay is the ""Truth, Doubt, Lie"" function. The majority of the time you'll be going out on a whim if you doubt or lie. The best you can do is choose lie first to see where Cole takes it, and if you didn't mean to head that direction choose doubt instead. Also a lot of the time what you need to present for lie will be a toss up for 2 items and the one you choose probably won't be it even though it could work. The fact is though I can't think of any way to solve the issues it has.STORY:     This is what the game is about. I don't want to spoil anything about the story, but just remember to never take a single thing you hear at face value not even the character you play. The set up is you play as Cole Phelps a war hero turned LAPD detective in the mid-late 40's. One of the best qualities of this game is the writing of all of the characters. Every single aspect of the characters was clearly taken and cared for to be formed into one of the best experiences that can be given to anyone who is willing to look one step deeper.SOUND:    Limited repeated tracks with hit-or-miss voice recordings (some people sound like they were recorded in a cardboard box while standing in the middle of the street) leave much to be desired.Cons:*30 FPS locked*Lots of random stutter*Large wonderful but shallow overwold.OVERALL:If Phoenix Wright had an affair with the 40's this game would be what pops out. And I loves meself some Phoenix Wright. L.A. Noire deserves to be on the forefront of anyone's ""to-play"" list if you have a marginal interest in Noire or love a good  story.			"

												Since they felt the need to put this on the front page of Steam again, I thought I'd come point out that this is one of the worst PC ports you can play. It's capped at 30 FPS(ugh), meaning it's very choppy. It also has a lot of issues that were never fixed.It's a shame really because it's a nice looking game, but it was basically shovelwared to PC with no effort or respect for the platform. It's a lot like the Dark Souls PC port, which is also terrible. And like that game, it's highly rated. These games are TERRIBLE on PC, yet have glaring ratings. This is why you shouldn't trust Metacritic with console ports. Everyone is over rating these because the console version is good... that's nice and all... except that we're talking about the PC version here, in the PC section, and on Steam. You can also read plenty of reports about crashes or freezes(from people that have actually played it).If you want this, get it on a console. Do not get it on PC. The PC version is absolutely terrible, and most of the reviews(even in the PC section of Metacritic) are praising it because of the console version, aka, idiots that'll probably never even try the version they are giving positive ratings to. Rockstar is another company that cares very little about the PC players, usually just shovelware porting their console games onto the platform. Btw, it also has Rockstar Studios attached to it, even on the Steam version.			"

												PROS+Collecting evidence, examinating corpses and locations and interrogating suspects (or just witnesses) is usually interesting and nice to do, though it does have its flaws (more on that later).+Dialogues are excellently written and acted, watching the plot unwrap or just listening to Phelps and his partner's chatter is always interesting. Helped by the great and highly advertised facial mocap, which still holds its own years later.+The atmosphere is gorgeous, I don't think i've ever seen a more faithful videogame representation of the noir genre and the post-WWII America in general.+Most cases are well written and don't have an obvious solution or an easily guessable culprit. Often, it's not easy to find the evidence to nail him/her and then actually use it in an interrogation to call him/her out on his/her bullcrap, so unless the somewhat slow pace of the game doesn't bother you, you'll rarely get bored.+The overarching plot of the game is interesting too, and you'll be surprised by how many things mentioned or seen early in the game make a lot more sense later.CONS-Some cases are clearly below standard, mostly padding material: they're either short, bland or both, and they'll feel pretty ""meh"".-Free roaming is an option, but it's pretty much just there for the sake of it: apart from some Guide Dang It level collectibles, there is hardly any reason to wander around L.A. if not to enjoy the scenery.-Finding clues can sometimes get tedious, mostly because sometimes some interactable, often important objects are way off course: yeah, i don't want everything blatantly slammed in my face or the game would be too easy, but certain pieces of evidence are in really obscure locations, and usually they're crucial for correctly accusing a suspect or lampshading a lie. Keep the ""clue music"" on, it's nice and it'll help you understand wether you're done or there's an improbable object hidden 60 feet away from the main crime scene.-The PC porting of this game leaves much to be desired: settings are minimal, graphic quality, apart from the higher resolution, isn't better than the console version (buildings were quite basic and low-detail even when the game first came out) and the frame-rate is locked at 30 fps due to the peculiar technology used to mocap the characters' faces not allowing higher values.-Driving and shooting are meh. They're there, some chases and shootouts can help spice things up in an otherwise still good adventure game, but they were clearly not the focus of the development team. They're not bad, simply blandly average.SUMMARYBuy this game if you love its awesome noir atmosphere and you've always wanted to literally be in books like The Black Dahlia, or just because it's a solid adventure game with top notch acting, good longevity and, unfortunately, not a lot of replay value (though if you screw up your investigations you'll probably want to do them again for those shiny 5 stars). Avoid it if you were looking for an action game with deep shooter mechanics or, worse, for a 1940s GTA. This is not that game.			"

L.A. NoireI loved L.A. Noire from the minute I saw its buzzing yellow title screen on a jazz theme background. If you're even remotely interested in the detective genre, I see no reason not to give this a shot. As usual, Rockstar does a brilliant job of conveying the intended atmosphere and location, i.e. 1940s L.A. and noir genre, while bringing into play some important themes of the era. The campaign is lengthy and involving, the mechanics entertaining and addictive, and the characters flawed and believable (thankfully the likes of Roy Earle bring a bit of much needed levity to Phelps' boy scout attitude).Pros:A good variety of cases building from basic to more complex ones;Meaty, lengthy campaign with obvious replay value to uncover every detail of this solid, mature noir story;Fantastic VO performances all around, superb theme song, decent soundtrack;Looking for clues, questioning suspects and gauging their reaction is engaging and rewarding;Amazing facial animations rendered by MotionScan are a perfect fit for this genre;Handy options to do away with the action/skip to destination if you just want to work the cases;Usual Rockstar attention to detail when it comes to evocative epochal environment/context;Notebook is a clever, non-intrusive alternative to the HUD and, along with the Log, a great way to keep track of things;Change of protagonist and partner is refreshing.Neutral:Auto-turn on stairs and fire escapes is a nice touch;Interrogate half the cast of Mad Men;A bit more variation with NPCs random dialogue would have been nice (""I say we bust in there and find the goddam evidence!"" x99).Cons:Even if it is the intended persona, Phelps is excessively stern and it gets old;Not a lot of (good) reasons to go exploring Hollywoodland;Uninspired/tedious collectibles;Controls feel a little stiff at times, as does the cover system;Some redundant puzzles while collecting evidence;City feels a bit empty/lifeless at times;Some cars in traffic will disappear if you turn the camera the wrong way (bit of a bother for Auto Fanatic).

Justice always wins.At the bottom, there is a short version as a summary for those who don't like to read.Phelps, badge 1247.So.. your name is Cole Phelps. After the end of World War II you return to the country as a hero and as one of the few soldiers who deal well with the trauma of the experiences on the front lines. You have always thought that everything is either black or white and guided by these ideals you are joining the ranks of police in Los Angeles. At first, being a simple novice from the proverbial ""traffic police,"" you manage to get promoted to the rank of detective in a special department of the LAPD, thanks to solved case. From now on, all your days will pass on briefings, visual inspections of crime scenes, interrogations and prosecutions of suspects.Mechanics of investigation looks like this: we arrive at the briefing and we learn what case are we supposed to solve. Then we go to the scene of the crime (most often we are dealing with murder), we are making an inspection of the place and we are looking for evidence that could be helpful in the case. When we are close to some significant object, the game tells us via a specific sound, so we know that in this place there is something important, of course, you can turn it off. Each of evidence gives us some new clues. After collecting relevant evidence (in which may include the murder weapon, bills, bank statements, wallets, pictures and others), it's time to hear witnesses on the scene. When you hear the answer to the question we asked, we can decide whether a person is telling the truth, if you doubt in what he/she says (though we have no direct evidence for this), or perhaps he/she is lying. After some time we reach the potential suspects, in which hearings can be supported by evidence found at the crime scene. A further order of investigation is generally subordinated to the scenario outlined by the authors, however, led by our hearings or visits to key locations can accelerate or delay the investigation. And don't worry, in the final phases of the investigations no shortage of gunfights and car chases, but if you want more shoot, invest in side missions and occupy a street crimes.When it comes to graphic design here is a little bit worse, though facial expressions and general appearance of characters fully make up for that. While the city itself has two sides of the coin: nicely presented (I mean here especially for skyscrapers, parks, alleys and smaller houses), but quite often creates the impression of a slightly extinct. On the streets moves fewer people than would indicate the size of this metropolis. And I must admit that the size of the virtual Los Angeles makes quite an impression when we launch the map available on the menu. The execution of city lacks nothing, but I would feel that it is really alive!Sound design and music is definitely one of the strengths of this production. The soundtrack is filled with 26 songs inspired by the era in which the game takes place and it is not climatically, but simply phenomenal. Subtle jazz sounds in execution of trumpets, saxophones, percussion and string instruments is a mixture, which any movie of the higher shelf wouldn't be ashamed of. A more dynamic compositions also don't stick out on a step from the rest. Equally excellent are the voices of all the characters. This game is a feast for our ears.The icing on the cake in L.A. Noire was supposed to be perfectly devoted facial expressions of the characters created by a special session of the motion-capture engulfing the faces of real actors and I must admit that it works very decently. Although facial expressions, if you can call it that way, are very stereotypical and relatively easy to recognize whether a person is calm or hiding something.SUMMARY (TL:DR)In L.A. Noire players have received what they wanted most: climate, climate and climate once more. Detective sheath, an advanced facial expression betraying emotions of the characters, crime mysteries of the City of Angels, charismatic characters and music that simply melts in our ears compensate for slightly brutal simplification of the sections of arcade and a little disappointing visuals. Sincerely, this is one of my favorite titles.			"

												+ Intersting Story+ Unique Gameplay- Repetitive Answers- Random Answers- locked 30 fps8/10It's a fun game about being a detective and solving crimes about finding clues and interrogating suspects. You will not find any other kind of game like LA Noire. The bad points are that the game will repeat clues, and you will notice them. Ex: * you found a clue... you should check out the Steam Cafe.      *Gabe says he works at the Steam Cafe... you should check it out.      * The Steam Cafe is located near the crime scene... you should go investigate it.Another problem is when you have to question someone for doubt or lie, you have to somehow bring up a clue that's comepletely off topic.Ex: Gabe: ""I've been working at the cafe the whole time. My alibi clears me!""You: ""You're lying! You're the culprit!""Gabe: ""prove it!""You: you bring up Half Life 3... ""Why isn't this out yet?!""Gabe: ""Oh! You got me!"" *correct answer*Overall, it's a good game with multiple interesting stories of crime. I completely recommend it if you're interested in solving crimes by finding clues and detecting people are lying.			"

												Let's start out with what you will probably be looking at the most: the facial animations are amazing and will help you decide if a suspect is lying or telling the truth. The graphics still look pretty decent for an older game and L.A. Noire has a fantastic atmosphere and a great soundtrack. Altough the game doesn't really have a main story, the individual cases are really interesting and well put together. Even if L.A. Noire is by no mean a free roaming game there are some fun side activity's to do. You can search the city for unlockable cars, view points(certain locations) and there are some side missions to do. The game also has some nice shootouts and chases!Sadly, this game also has some downsides. The city of Los Angeles can feel a bit empty at times and the cases can feel a bit repetitive after a while. After finishing about 70% of L.A. Noire (DLC included) it just felt to repetitive and my interest in the game was lost. I think this is mainly because there is no real story, just some individual cases.All together i would still highly recommend this game. It's truly an amazing expierence and well worth the money, Even if you don't finish it completely.			"

												I saw this game at a friend´s house and thought it had very good artistic values and an intruguing gameplay. Bought it at home and I was glad to see it is a RockStar game. This game has great graphics, runs fast, interesting story progression and good controls. Even though I am not an action fan (I prefer point and click adv. games), I had lots of fun playing LA Noire.			"

												Stop. Stop reading, GET THIS GAME!This is a fantastic story worthy of being slapped with 10/10, kudos and praise. Why? Because this game is like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", it has personality, action and narrative.You are Detective Cole Phelps, and are a badass at solving cases. You will run through numerous cases investigating clues and interrogating suspects, unraveling a conspiracy and a kickass story, and half the time your partners will ""pull rank"" or flat out refuse to do a foot chase and leave it all to you :PPros:OMG GRAPHICS. Did I mention graphics? This game has the most amazing facial graphics ever. It should be, because they use motion capturing on people's faces and you can actually see emotion in their faces!!! Once you play this game you will be disapointed with every game out there that doesn't come up to snuff. It is simply gorgeous, and groundbreaking to tell if someone is lying via actual cues in their behavior and their faces! The interactivity of the game, with player and character are grade A. The gameplayer borrows alot from GTA, with cars behaving similarly but to me feel alot better. The gun play is clunky but intuitive, it doesn't kick you out of cover akwardly or just unwieldy to do sometimes. *cough* Mass Effect *cough*. Overall, it just feels nice and awe-inspiring to see the period perfect LA, based on real cars, on real settings and with distinct personalities. From villains to partners, you will loathe, love and grumble at people who feel real and you could have sworn probably exist in real life.Con:IT IS TOO SHORT. The usual benefits of getting a game on PC are the mods. Well, it doesn't have great mod capabilities and therefore the modding community can't mod new stories and there's so little DLC. I would reccomend buying this on console unless you can find it cheaper on PC.Overall, buy it on console unless the PC version is cheaper. It's simply easier to control and feels more native on console.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. It has a terrific story and atmosphere as entertaining as it gets. Although it isn't a GTA shooting rampage, there are many cons to this game and the mechanics it takes advantage of along the lines of its un-rivaled motion capture technology used from everything to npc conversation to intense interrogations. 11/10 Would force my son to play this game.

												You get to play as a detective, finding clues and solving crimes. It is an open world city that you can move around in, kind of like grand theft auto only more story/mission driven. There is a good mix of driving, detective work, and action with street crimes. It is set back in the 40's and has a nice feel to it. The faces on the characters are really well done, especially since when you are interviewing them you need to watch their expression's and body language to tell if they are lying or not! A fun game and well worth the sale price! :)			"

You'll probably spend most of the time driving from one point to the next, but if you ever feel like that's too tedious you have fast travel.Cases were well put together as were the investigations. Shooting gangsters was nothing to write home about, but the vehicle chase segments were fun (even if civilians saw fit to throw themseleves at the front of my car half the time).  Speaking of cars, there's 95 different varieties of magnificently archaic vehicles for you to find and commandeer if that's your thing (it should be). The game might have crashed four or five times but the autosave prevented any serious loss of time. One of the most varied games I've seen in awhile, strong on a lot of fronts and always prime to switch up on you before it gets too stale. Stout Scarab best car in the game.			"

												LA Noire is one of the best and most original games ive played in long long while, it has plenty of flaws but it is still very enjoyable.The game is locked to 30 fps to preserve the factions animations while are crucial while interrogating a person and this causes the game to feels slow and sluggish at times and will take a few hours to get used to.The game is set in 1940s and you play as Cole Phelps a war hero who slowly climbs the ranks from patrol to vice and near the end stages of the game you play as jack kelso a investigator who was in the war with Cole.The are 21 main cases (26 if you buy the dlc) and they average around 1 hour each or more depending upon how many restarts and retries it takes you.The 1940s settings is really amazing, the theme overall is mature and the characters are very distinct, the cases are really intriguing to solve and there is a sense of danger in the air.Apart from the main cases their are 40 mini-cases which take 2-10 mins each and a lot of collectables and for a open world games its not really something you want to hear not enough side-quests yet it fits the detective theme of the game so it gets away in that regard.This game stays true to what it is and by that i mean for the most part you will search for clues, interrogate suspects and solves cases in doing so and the combat isnt a huge factor where you mow down hundreds of people, the combat is decent enough but since its not the main focus its serviceable, you get intuition points when you rankup and these can be used to find clues or help you chose the correct response to a question asked to a suspect, the ability to interrogate suspects is the games biggest strength as different people have different tells and you have to chose if they are telling the truth or lying and if you think they are lying you accuse them by doubting them or flatout tell them that they are lying and if you select the latter then you must provide evidence of their lie otherwise you will get it wrong.You can fail cases and get wrong suspects (in cases which have multiple suspects) if you miss any evidence or dont manage to get something out of them.The driving isnt that thankfully you can skip it by letting your partner driver which will skip the driving section of the game.The NPCs always comment on your actions if you driver recklessly your partner will warn you if you run and push citizens aside they will complain,you will pickup your dropped hat, etc LA noire gets a lot of these small things right.There is an option to play it in black in white if you so desire.There is a feature called action skip where it will ask you to skip a section of the game if you fail it multiple but these are only in areas where you wont miss out anything.Overall i really found LA noire to be a mature game where cases are intriguing and is an actual detective game where you do all the detective stuff and not just shoot people, the detective stuff is basically what you will do 70% of the time.I really wish Rockstar will make a sequel one day its been years since this game release and technology has only improved.This game truly deserves a sequel not story or character wise but mechanics wise maybe a Miami Noir or something along those lines, with new tech and ironing out the rough edges of this game i hope we get a sequel but atm we dont and that makes me sad.

												LA Noire is a crime story set in 1947 Los Angeles. Policeman Cole Phelps, a decorated war hero, is eager and principled, and a ""good caseman"". Thus, he works his way up the ladder and gets to investigate in cases with rising stakes. But there is something in his past that is haunting him. Through his eyes, players experience a world gone by that is in many ways similar to ours, yet also quite different - World War II still casts a shadow over society, police work sometimes takes incredible shortcuts just so a case can be closed or what would pass for bigotry today is still widely accepted etc.What utterly fascinated me about LA Noire was the painstaking amount of detail with which the world of 1947 had been recreated: 8 square miles of Los Angeles are waiting to be explored. While it's only necessary to use certain routes to get to case locations, it's always possible (and indeed tempting) to drive around the streets to just take in the sights and sounds (e.g. the car radio plays original programmes). I cannot count how many times I had Cole stop the car so I could check what this interesting building or that odd thing were, or so I could take a screenshot. It's likely the closest I will ever come to being in the 1940s' USA, unless time machines become a reality.Sadly, one can hardly with the game's world outside of the cases; don't assume this to be like Grand Theft Auto. At least there are a few achievements to be gained for those who like to explore every nook and cranny.Phelps will work on the cases the department to which he is assigned at the time, e.g. patrol or homicide. The work on such a case consists of collecting clues at crime scenes, shootouts, fist fights, chases and tailing people by car or foot and the interrogation of witnesses and suspects. The interrogations use a (at the time when the game was made) new technology of facial motion capture that allows the faithful recreation of every small expression in the actors' faces. That is important, because most of the time, people are trying to hide something, which will invariably show in their faces. They have twitchy eyes, swallow nervously, etc.It's up to the player to judge when they're being lied to - but a lie can only be called out successfully when evidence to the contrary has been gathered before, and when the player can correctly pick that evidence from their case notes. If a lie can't be proven, one can doubt what was said. The last option is to treat a testimony as truth.This part often drove me nuts. I could see that the person was not telling the truth, but I wasn't sure what I was even meant to prove or which evidence to use against them. Example below - attention, spoiler for one interrogation question. ----SPOILER-----One example: There was a suspect with a penchant for anarchism who had probably tampered with machinery, and Cole confronted him with the accusation. The man declined. The game asked me: Was he lying? I knew I had nothing to prove he had committed the sabotage, but he looked a bit twitchy. Therefore, ""Doubt"" seemed fitting. Yet the correct interrogation option was ""Lie"", since then, Cole mentioned his political tendencies and the suspect  asked in return whether there was evidence that he was campaigning for anarchism. Okay, so, a different thing to prove.So I chose the political pamphlet he had given to his colleague as proof - after all, passing it on to someone else showed he was proselytizing. Wrong again: The proof the game wanted was the same pamphlet from his own locker.----SPOILER-----Then, there are optional sidequests called street crimes. When Phelps and his partner drive through the streets, they will often get alerted to crimes happening at that moment, and they have the choice of responding and taking care of the situation. Those missions use some of the gameplay elements from the main game, minus the interrogations and crime scene investigation.I did get bored after a while. There is a lot of content to play through, and while the cases are varied and sometimes interconnected in interesting ways, I just had had enough of the game's mechanics. Took me a long break to get back into it.But having followed Cole Phelps through all his cases, I'm left impressed. His world is a very imperfect one, where some people commit crimes for the same selfish reasons that have always driven humans, while others try to do the right thing but may well fail at that. It's indeed a noir movie's take on reality.(Notes:1. To get the Steam achievements, the game must be played online.2. Do stay till after the credits, there is one more scene.)			"

												So I haven't finished this game on here yet but I accidentally left it on so lmao have some more hours then I've playedANYWAY I thoroughly enjoyed this game - it basically is a point and click but it's not really. The gameplay consists of going to a crime-scene and interrogating people, where deducing whether they are holding something back (doubt), telling the truth, or lying (when they're lying you always need evidence) - with the facial motion capture its usually pretty obvious. You gather clues by finding stuff at the crime-scene used for interrogations and to figure out the case. You drive to and fro everywhere you need to go. Ocassionally the more you get into the game, there will be chase sequences both in cars and on foot, and there will be shoot-outs, as well as when you have to tail a suspect (without being seen, which is annoying). The map is huge, and I suggest if you're an achievement hunter you drive everywhere instead of getting your partner to do it. I enjoyed the story (i guess there kinda was an over reaching one).Each case is pretty interesting, and the game feels very authentic in regards to the period.A problem I have is the FPS cap, because, come on we are on PC here guys we don't have to put up with 30FPS. There are guides to break the cap which is useful.Overall the game is pretty good, I enjoyed it anyway :) its quite a long one though so sometimes replayability (especially as soon as youve finished it, can be a bit daunting).

												L.A Noire is a very successful hybrid between an early 90's adventure game such as Monkey Island and Broken Sword with the open world and combat/driving mechanics of GTA.You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a WW2 veteran who is trying to work his way up the law enforcement ladder of the Patrol/Traffic/Homicide/Vice/Arson division all while trying to deal with the hostility of his co-workers and the inner corruption of the police force. If you've ever watched a Detective Noir movie like L.A Confidential then you pretty much know what to expect plot wise.The adventure part of the gameplay will be familiar to anyone who's played adventure games in the early-mid 90's. You explore the crime scenes of your cases looking for items and clues that will help you in your investigation and then questioning the suspects of the case with the evidence that you have accumulated. The interviewing part is well done with some great voice acting and animation although the facial expressions can be a bit TOO subtle at times, you pretty much can't lose though as the story will still progress even if you get all the answers wrong.The driving/shooting aspect is similar to any other open world game and you will be chasing and gunning down plenty of criminals during the 20-25 hour campaign. The theme and style of 1940's LA comes across really well with a brilliantly detailed city that has plenty of locations to explore, old fashioned cars to drive and a great albeit short period soundtrack.Anyone who is a fan of Noir movies and open world games with a mix of old school adventure will have a great time playing L.A Noire.

												A pretty impressive presentation overall, expecially at the time of release. Definitely worth playing if you a fan of noire or adventure games.The graphics probably won't wow you in 2016 but it still has it's charm with the faithful recreation of LA and the impressive motion capture. If you haven't already, it's worth the purchase.			"

												Visit the 1940s Los Angeles and help the young LAPD detective Cole Phelps solve crimes ranging from arson to serial murder. L.A. Noire is a third person open world adventure with great graphics, amazing soundtrack and fantastic voice acting.PROS:- very good storyline- amazing graphics- huge world to explore with infinite details- 90 car types you can drive and driving around is a lot of fun, there are some really cool car chases- character depth and development- great old-timey jazz soundtrack- voice acting and facial expression detail - overall noir atmosphere- if you like drainpipe climbing, this game is a perfect choiceMEH:- it's quite easy when you come to think of it: most clues are right there and you can miss some of them, you can make some wrong accusations during interrogation and still successfully solve the case- some action sequences are rigged: you are not allowed to catch the criminal too quickly, so that you have to run/drive all the fun locations developers have prepared for you (and the locations are great, so I forgave that easily)CONS:- the game saves only at certain points, so there are moments where you may lose 10 minutes of gameplay if you suddenly quit- some cutscenes are quite longTo sum up: one of the greatest games I've ever played.

												The atmosphere in this game is great, it's a sleazy 1940s LA straight out of a Raymond Chandler novel. The immersion is sometimes broken by the odd daft action sequence but overall the story is well written and executed with great voice acting and facial expressions on the models.The game is really all about the story. Although it is open world there is little to interact with - the huge and beutifully detailed game world is more there for the immersion.The main downside is that it runs horribly on PC. The game engine is locked to 30fps apparently and there are often fps drops whenever there is anything fast happening on screen. When compared to other open world games with fantastic graphics like Mafia 2 and Skyrim this game runs like a one-legged asthmatic pensioner. Seems Rockstar don't make any effort to optimise their games for the PC master race anymore.Overall I can recommend it as the techincal issues are not game breaking because 95% of the time it is exploration/puzzle/adventure type gameplay and not action/shooter type gameplay where the crappy framerate would soon give you a headache.

												An interesting idea and concept, let down by the terrible story pacing for the first 2/3rds of the main story. Not that you can discern there is one at that point. In the last 1/3, the story does finally start going somewhere, picks up the pace and becomes enjoyable. A critical part of the game are interrogations, but deciding what evidence counts as enough to expose a lie vs doubting something, or what ""truth"" or ""doubt"" will actually cause your character to do say are anybodies guess. It always felt like a total crapshoot throughout the game. Never mind that it doesn't actually matter - somewhere during testing the game designers must've realized this and you can't actually fail even if you miss all the answers.This isn't a bad game, but it isn't quite as good as the reviews made it out either. Only play it if the premise sounds enjoyable and you're willing to plow through the first part.			"

												Do you like the 50's?Do you like Detective games?Do you like dark plottwists?Boy do I have the game for you.You Play as Detective Cole Phelps (masterfully performed by aaron Staton) who just came back from the war and became a Police officer. Your main goal is given to you by each completed (or failed) case. What this includes is checking crime scenes and finding evidence that can later help you interrogate suspects who might seem innocent on the outside but holds dark secrets for you to unfold. The game hold action such as gunfights and fist fights but the real main objective is to go old school 50's detecive way. Pros ++ Amazing storyline+ Awesome voice actors+ Great soundscore+ Stunning face movments+ Fist fights are pretty cool (some hate the fist fight scenes though guess it's up to taste)+ over 20+ hours of content (including sidequest and dlc's) the story is far and deep and will take some time for you to find all the clues or finding all the possible ways you can go about a case such as who you might want to interrogate first e.t.c+ Replayability, many games usually fail with this from my perspective. The reason is because you might fail a case and arrest the wrong guy or not finding enough evidence and might wanna solve them all or if you just like the cases (have 80+ hours on my PS3 before deciding to get it on my PC)Cons -- Gun fights are limited to only Tommyguns, Shotgun and Pistols and are very tedious to deal with- The face movement may be awesome as well as the voice acting but it's sometimes hard to tell if they're lying or telling the truth as they tend to do some very shall we say... akward faces. They sometimes makes it way too easy, hard or funny looking- Tedious sidequest as they don't serve any real purpose, sure you can get XP from it but max lvl is 20 and I reached that after just 5-6 main mission quests so they serve little purpose.- Graphical glitches and slow FPS, I didn't have this problem but some have. Some have had poorly made computers whilst others had top of the line gear and still had these errors so it's random I guessAll and all I give this game a 8/10It's no masterpiece, but not far from. It has great voice acting great story and just all around fun.30 euro is and ok price epecially since you get the complete edition			"

												What can you say about this game? I played this game back on console and didn't like it's change of pace from a GTA type shoot 'em up open world.Fast forward a few years and as I matured as a person and a gamer, this game has been a hallmark in my gaming adventure. The recreation of L.A is superb, and even though I have ever visited the city, it's the small things that ground the game for me and make it a real place. Like seeing a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes in a store window or hearing a advert for it in the car radio.The cases within the game are well structured, and seem very real. The story is a masterpiece.The PC port itself is quite bad, it is locked at 30FPS. But this, for me, doesn't detract from the game itself and even with that in mind, it is still a highly recommended game from me. "

												GREAT game!  Seriously, this game is amazingly well done!  The story is very interesting and really fun -- a nice blend of foot chases, shoot-outs, trailing suspects in your various vintage cars, searching crime scenes, and role-playing detective work.  Also, I have to say that this game has, without a doubt, some excellent character animation.  The skins of the characters are based on real actors (some of whom you'll be sure to recognize from TV and movies) and the facial espressions, mannerisms, and body language of the in-game characters is suberb!The interrogation/questioning of suspects aspect of the game is, admittedly, a bit hard to learn, but once you get the hang of it it actually is one of the most interesting parts of the game.Oh, and about those vintage cars: They've also recreated an amazing rendition of late 1940s Los Angeles that you can cruise around  via your vehicle.  If you search around, you'll be able to find lots of interesting rides (rare sports cars, an ambulance, etc.).  I've thoroughly enjoyed taking cars that aren't mine and driving them to death, literally, by jumping off embankments, taking out mailboxes at 60mph, and other things we've all wanted to do with a car at some point.  By the time I'm done, my ride-of-the-day is a smoldering wreck on the side of the road.  Totally fun!Anyway, I haven't completed the game yet; I've played about 10 hours into it.  But so far, it's awesome.P.S. The DLC is totally worth it too, in my opinion.			"

												GAME WORKS FOR WINDOWS 10! CONFIRMED!HOWEVER!I only had one issue that made me restart the game.In one case, my character froze after observing a clue. The game still ran however, but I had to restart the game to resume my game.The game doesn't look too pretty due to poor PC Port. BUT, the game is still playable.The cases are rather difficult but has high replay value. The game is choopy at certain parts in the game. The cutscenes have some weird texture pop-ins at some points and character mouths get glitched.But this only happens sometimes. (1 out of every 4-5 Cutscenes) It doesn't make the game crash but I just need to point it out.Overall, 7-8/10 Depends if you hate 30 fps and wierd texture that occurs every so often. More of a movie than a game. But a damn good one!			"

												Ok, I'll try my best not to spoil anything (wrote review after I finished the ending credits):Waw, what a game. You're in for a rollercoaster that just gets faster and deeper the more you progress. In my opinion you should look at this game like you're participating actor in a very well done Noir series that could air on TV any day.For a 2011 game it also still looks pretty great on full detail, the score and soundtrack is well done, suited to the era and atmosphere of the game. Cinematography feels like a movie too.A few tips for people who are diehard about the story though:- Take some time to see the town, you'd be surprised what you find.- Learn from your mistakes, don't use wikia unless absolutely necessary or if you want that 5star rating on your 2nd try.- It's an 18+ game for a reason, respect that while you play it. Some scenes really can be shocking for some people, so take it as a warning.As conclusion (it's almost impossible to tell anything about this game without spoiling it), get it. If you fancy the era, the music, the detective genre, the noir genre, if you like puzzles, storytelling, if you like environmental accuracy or just like retro/vintage in general......get this game! You won't be dissapointed.			"

												An underrated gem.L.A Noire is an open world adventure game where you play the role of take no♥♥♥♥♥♥detective Cole Phelps in 1940's Los Angeles. The gameplay mostly revolves around investigating crime scenes for clues and scenes where you interrogate suspects and try to decided weather they're telling the truth or if they're full of crap.The awesome thing about this game is the highly detailed and lifelike facial motion capture on the characters. It's so detailed that you're not watching pre-rendered animations, you're actually watching performances by actors and it's pretty amazing to see. The game world is immaculately detailed and a joy to cruise around and experience.I loved this game and I hope you will too because it needs a sequel ASAP.			"

												This game is amazing. In its entirety it’s intriguing and different.I like the detail put into it. In most games simple unimportant characters don’t really have a face of their own, they just use the same few models. (E.g. the citizens in Half-Life 2) but in this, every character has their own face and therefore their own identity, and I really liked that. They were all built around their voice actors and it was really amazing to see 3 or 4 actors that I knew of, appear in a video game. That was something that really did impress me.It’s mainly a detective type game, and there is a lot more action to it than your average detective game. You get to drive around an open world city responding to street crime, be involved in car chases, find clues for your investigation and interrogate your subjects making sure you judge them right.I only have one problem with this game and that’s the storyline. It isn’t exactly a “game breaker” for me, I just found it a little disappointing. At first I was extremely intrigued with the plot and it felt like it was going to go somewhere great and be really good, but it just wasn’t. I found it very up and down, it leads up to one thing then completely changes the subject.At the end of every mission you are given a score as to how well you did, and there are some points where you can’t avoid doing the wrong thing, which I thought was really stupid. There’s even one part you get told off for doing the right thing! I just thought that it was all over the place when it came to plotline.Apart from that I think this game is great, it’s a lot of fun and it’s not something you see all that often.			"

												To resume L.A. Noire quickly, it's the story of a LAPD cop named Cole Phelps and his rise & fall in the police system, all while questioning a bunch of people about various crimes. This game manages to immerse you into the past, in the late 40's as a LA police officer trying to climb the ladder.I like alot of things about this game: The ambience, the music, the facial system, the captivating storyline, the relevance of almost everything placed in the decor, the dialogue, etc, and the list goes on. Rockstar/Team Bondi (R.I.P.) have done an amazing job on this game, making sure to create a different feel than in their previous games (such as Bully or GTA). There is no other game like this one, and that's a quality I love when it comes to good games.The story will run you at the very minimum at least 26 hours (DLC included) and you can then retry past cases individually to try and get better. I like to play through L.A. Noire about once every 1/1,5 years (it's kinda like a movie, where it's as enjoyable as the first time once you let some time pass and come back to it).I would recommend getting the complete edition of this game to any fan of Noire TV series or movies, and fans of well scripted detective games. DO NOT come into L.A. Noire expecting exactly the same as GTA but as a cop in the 40's because you will be very dissapointed. That being said, the game is amazing, probably the most immersive game i've played.			"

												Fantastic game.  Always enjoyed detective movies/shows, so getting this is a no-brainier.  Worth playing; Recommend getting the ""complete"" edition if if gets on sale (usually only a few bucks more than base) and it comes with a few more missions and such. Music: It has some good '40's music playing on radios, but when you drive it's just soundtrack (shame i know) But the OST is still good regardless. Would like to hear some music while I just drive around. - 8.5/10Graphics: Facial animation is stunning. The lengths they've gone to; amazing. 30fps cap. 9/10Story: The more you play, the better it gets. You get flashbacks of Detective Cole back in the war after every few cases, and reading newspapers will give you back-story on ""current events"" (or something)  9-ish/10  Plot twists on your plot twists.Driving: I don't like it. Too sensitive for me. Tap directional key and the car moves across the street. No mouse steering. No in-car radio. When driving it's always the background music. (shame). No drive-and-shoot (Your a detective with common sense. That's why.)  5/10 - Average, could be better.   -- Reckless driving will give you a lower end-case rating. so don't cause city/personal damage - This isn't GTA. You're a traffic cop gone detective. A man of the law.  -- You can always hold ""E"" to let your partner drive to the location selected (if there are case-related dialogue; that will be said, then loading screen then you'll be at the location; with you behind the wheel.  - If there are car chases, you'd have to drive no matter what.World and level designs: the city is giant. Streets seem well done with placement of names, ads, and such that is realistic.The main map has almost every street on it, so when dispatch says ""on the corner of this and that"" you check the map and see what streets to take (there's no on-road line to see where to go) 9/10- The buildings are well made, with loads of clutter of personal items like photos that make it seem like there's someone living in there.- Only enter buildings with a Golden doorknob. So don't know what floor the perp is on? look for the golden doorknob. - The cars, buildings, clothes, even some speech is something from the '40/'50s - Devs captured it perfectly.Overall: 9/10 - Play now.TL;DR: Buy this game. Sale or full, get it. Worth every cent.  Good luck detective.			"

												LA Noire is a detective game published by Rockstar and Bondi. It has some adaptations from the GTA series but they are not as large. One of them is a funny one, in GTA you were stealing cars, in LA Noire you can get inside any car by just stopping them and entering. It is developed by Rockstar so you'll have to deal with Rockstar Social club which can end in save file corrupting, losing accounts and things among those lines.The game is set in Los Angeles, as you might have guessed by the title, right after World War II. As our main character Cole Phelps, is an ex-marine, this opens up for some WW2 flashblacks and some returning co-marines that are connected to Cole. LA allows for a big setting for a game and you can also opt for a Black and white mode which is definitly as beautiful as with colours. Unfortunately the problem with a big city as big as LA is that it can lag quite a lot rendering parts of the map which makes driving not always as smootly. The music is a mixture of investigation music or music from shootouts which is the same the whole game and whenever you driving you can enjoy songs from that time mostly popular ones. If you are into that kind of music or heard such music before you'll recognise a lot of songs. The story is more the character trying to redeem himself from the actions he done in the war with a sad ending. I think the sad ending made the main character shine even more because he didn't get the respect he deserved for a big part of the game. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, although theres one part that I really found unnecessary. The demotion from Vice to Arson was pretty uncalled for, okay I agree, cheating on your wife is pretty bad. But that shouldn't get in the way of your career. I think it would've been better if they put Arson before Ad Vice and worked the ending out there. Ad vice had to do a lot with the army surplus morphine that had been stolen. It could've easily worked too.The gameplay is worked out very well, the work fits right into the setting and the cases are very good overall. The work you do in this game is detective work, which means you'll be solving cases. Or when you don't want to for a while you can solve street crimes. Before each case, at least in most of them, you get shown a cutscene showing us how the crime happened without showing faces and giving clear clues away. In the cases themselfs you find clues to help solve your case, requires you to sometimes brawl or shoot your suspects. Brawling in this game is amazing it feels like a boxing game. You sometimes also have to chase suspects or how they call it in this game subduing. It is a very bland objective since sometimes shooting in the foot doesn't fail the case for killing them and sometimes it does kill them. You are on thin ice trying to shoot a suspect you are chasing because it is not clear if it is allowed. In the cases you also get help from a partner depending on what desk you are in, I'll be mentioning the different partners and desks later. Whenever you are driving with the partner it starts a conversation with them about the case giving you side information or their insight. You could also use them as a sort of GPS. Do remind yourself that once you choose to reveal a new side mission that the partner will direct towards that. You also get to question your suspects which is for me the best part of the game. They have really spent an amount of detail to the facial expressions in an interview although the mouth may go out of synch with the voice sometimes. You have three options after you asked your question, whetether you believe him or doubt him or believe that he is straight up lying. You can recognise in the facial expressions in the small details what direction it is going in although making out a doubt from a lie depends how much you have progressed in the case and how much you can charge against him. When you are finished you get shown a case reports with the amount of clues you found and the amount of questions you have done correctly. Aside from that and the rating, in stars, you get some side information sometimes revealing what you missed.Desks:Patrol is the standard police work before we get a real taste of the detective work. This is mainly an overextended interactive tutorial more meant to show us the ropes of the game and to intrest us in the rest of the game. It also makes us more acquaintanced with the main character. Traffic surprised me more or less. If you do not know what Traffic means in cop terms, it mainly is about solving hit and runs. What surprised me that every case contained the hit and run with that little element extra what didn't make an ordinary hit and run. In Traffic you get partnered with Stephen Bekowski. He is a pretty rookie cop in the Traffic department but so are you so you learn a lot from each other making it both to Homicide eventually.Homicide is probably the longest rank you have in the game. It is twice as long as any other desk in terms of cases, unless you count the DLC cases, and the missions themself are also longer compared to Traffic. Homicide is researching and solving murders. I like how they managed the endings of the cases, giving the player an open ending, and also the question if you did the cases right. The open endings made the final case even better which was mainly designed around missing clues from other cases and most of the landmarks in LA. You get partnered up with Rusty Galloway in Homicide. He is a good cop who can't wait on his pension and he expresses that most of the time. The conversations about the cases were definitly the most interesting in the game since it was more a discussion which made me doubt too. Ad Vice is trying to stop the drug empire from happening. The Ad vice story itself is pretty short, again without DLC, but the cases are pretty lengthy on themselfs. The surprise to me whas the shoot first then ask questions later mentality in this desk. Which made it more exciting, I also think the drug empire in this game is pretty interesting how it works. They also connect with Cole his backstory , his time in the war as a marine, giving a chance to see most of the ex-marines back again. Roy Earle is impressed by your work in Homicide that's why he pulls you over to Ad Vice to be his partner. Roy Earle is a detective we already met an Homicide case and I didn't like him then and I still don't like him. He is by a landslide my least favourite parnet in any game with a buddy system. He thinks the only way to solve things is by being rude and aggressive. He does know the drug community inside out and teaches us a lot about that and also how the LAPD really operates. Arson desk is the solving of domestic fires and finding out how they happened. These cases are only meant to connect with the ending so that all the pieces fit togheter. I wouldn't mind that they had added some extra, non-DLC, but I like the appearance of the ex-marines again and the whole scandal around them. I also like that Cole isn't the only one investigating in this desk, what I mean with that will be clear once you play this desk fully. You get partnered with Herschel Biggs in Arson. Herschel has been in the war too but not the second one, which gives you an idea of how old he is at the time. Herschel is a very grumpy character but he is the only one who would never question a decision made by Cole without helping him in any way. That is how a partner needs to be. What I missed with Herschel is the conversations, they are there but very short.LA Noire is in my eyes a must pick up, if you love the setting of the 1940-1950's America with the classic detective with interactive cases which are sometimes pretty confusing to solve. I do not know if the DLC's are worth picking up, can't wait to find out for myself.			"

												L.A Noire takes you back to 1940's Los Angeles where corruption and drugs are everyday business.In this game you follow young ex-militairy Cole Phelps, who after winning several awards for his actions during the war signed up for the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department)The game allows you to solve crimes with, or sometimes without a partner. While investigating for example a murder you have the option to question a witness, by paying close attention to their facial expressions or eye movement you can find out if they're either lying or telling the truth. Its exciting storyline and character developement is what makes this game such a masterpiece.As you follow Cole's career from Traffic to Homicide to Vice to Arson you get the feeling of being in a 1940's crime movie. Authentic clothing and infrastructure support this feeling. The game also allows you to free-roam, which makes it possible to drive around the city with your partner (Partner depends on what desk you chose) and respond to calls you get from the police radio. This game could just as well be a book because of its tensive storyline and fascinating character development.Overall I would give this game a 9/10.			"

												Imagine if you wanted to play Sherlock Holmes, but instead of solving crimes set centuries ago, you substitute it with a living real-world city from the modern era, put amazing attention to detail into everything, gameplay that somehow manages to overshadow firefight sequences by a longshot AND a character with a relatable dedication to his work paired with an interesting subplot, and you've gotten L.A. Noire.The gameplay keeps me invested to a degree which I find awe inducing for such a game. I'm usually not into detective/murder mistery type games because it tends to be boring point-and-click gameplay with uninteresting writing that doesn't really reach out to me in any way.On the other hand, this game caught my eye with its fresh take on the genre, as Rockstar and Team Bondi spent a good amount of time doing research on the reality of criminal investigation of this era and while not exactly simulating real gunplay, is a fun experience that really feels grounded in reality.This doesn't exactly make it the kind of game you could play in short bursts, but rather something you wanna stretch out as with what most Rockstar DEVELOPED games tend to do. Even though this was developed by Team Bondi, I dare say it beats the production values of Rockstar titles of the time.			"

												L.A Noire is a game that i surely recommend, it put you in the shoes of a young patrol police man and, who is gonna be soon one of the most famous detectives of L.A city.this game is abit of open world still it have it own nartives, you cant do alot in that world but still there is some side missions and you can recieve callup during your playtime to do some extra jobs and missions.the game is very special in this category, and combine alot of elements into a one game.the tech of facial expression to is very worm addition to the game it self and give alot to the gameplay.8.7\10 a great peace of art.

												As good as the game itself is, you're better off buying it on a console.  The PC version of this game has been optimized incredibly poorly, and even the most high-end system will have trouble getting a playable framerate out of it.  My own rig, while not the best, should be able to play this with reasonable settings at at least 30 frames per second, but I'm lucky to get 5 while keeping the camera pointed at the ground.  Give the PC version of this a pass.			"

												For those that remember and loved the Police Quest games this one is up your ally.  La Noire lets you find clues, question suspects, do crazy car chases and lots of shoot'em ups with the bad guys.The game engine used for this game is massive!!  There are so many streets to drive place to see, that doing all the 21 mission (DLC included) will not let you experience the whole map of L.A.  What is also nice is the small little details in the game.  The radio music playing while your drive or the news broadcasts are specific to the time of the game.  The cars also all handle differently from each other.On the hunt for some of the collectibles in the game I left my partner behind, after stopping in another part of the city a black and white police car stopped sirens blaring.  My partner got out and had some choice words for me leaving him behind.  This brings me to the voice acting which is really good for a game on this scale.  The small talk between your character and you partner on the specific desk can be a times really amusing.The annoying parts of the game are 2 achievements that you need to get to complete the game 100%.  One is the hunt for the golden films reels and the other is driving all the 95 vehicles in the game.  The film reels are movies related to the time, but they are hidden in such places that you will never find them during normal game play.  A quick Google will net you clues and maps to where all the golden film reels are.  The other pain is driving all the vechiles in the game. :(  This took me a couple of days to complete.  In the end I found a site that made it easier to get some of the vehicles.  For this you need to go to the Extras in the Main Menu, then the vehicle show room.  Move to the blacked out vechile and press ENTER for about 20 seconds. Escape to the Main Menu again and go to Cases and Select the Homocide Desk (Free Roam).  As soon as the map is loaded get out of the car and you will see the car that you need drive by.  For this you will need to Google to find a picture of the car needed.  If the car does not drive by check the parking lot across from the police station to see if it is there.  Some of the cars are mission specific and will only be found in certain missions or street crimes.  This will also only work for the 2 door and 4 door types of cars.All in all this is an amazing game.  If you follow your clues and check your suspects facial expression you may become a top rated detective.   "

												This game is more than just a story-driven rpg. It's a fully atmospheric experience of unpredicable events which will keep you immersed while playing, surprise you with the protagonist's difficult and shocking past, and simply - make you addicted to the game. As dark, attention drawing, and full of violence this game is, its riddles will leave you impressed with the story's complexity and depth at almost every turn.After almost six years since its release L.A. Noire still manages to mesmerize players with its unparalleled storytelling and meaningful choices.A must play, in its genre - one of the best games of all time!			"

												The game is not the newest anymore and probably got plenty of reviews so I will try to be brief:The game is set in 1947 Los Angeles and I do really enjoy the setting and the story of the main charakter as well as the story of the cases you have to solve are quite deep and interesting. ( I wont say much about it because I dont intent to spoiler).The Missions are very well developed. You have to question suspects and pay attention for example in which order you ask questions or which evidences you provide. You have to check if you can dig up more evidence by visiting different people or points of interest, find information on places murderes happend or find information in letters, written orders or other types of papers. You often question people and either decide if they lie, tell the trueth or seem suspicious which you can tell by their facial expressions. (If they hide something they will often try to avoid looking at your or into your face and search the room with their eyes). There are shootings happening frequently. The side missions are often based on catching someone escaping from a crime scene or even shooting down all oponents. You can use their guns. Aiming and taking cover is similiar to  GTAV. So action is present in the game as too and balances it very well.It is very fun even if you fail in most cases you still will move on with the story but get less points by setting up wrong evidence or accuse them of a lie while they spoke the trueth to you. There arent many games that combine those features with an open world and an interesting story.The open world is interesting too since all the cars and environments are set in the last century. Do not expect a GTA V of course, The game is made in 2011 and the traffic AI is horrible in fact you can try to drive perfectly and the AI will simply ram you off if they want to switch the lanes.The environment is set in LA only and you cannot really leave the city. You can visit some real life landmarks, especially the train station is very nice as you can see incomming and leaving trains but sadly its also a bit glitched.There are no different radio stations which is a bit of a downer too. The city is very alive and you in fact are able to look into the different shops and even enter many houses and buildings.The pedestrians however act funny too. You should avoid to run them over since you are a cop you get a message you shall protect civillians and not bring them into danger. In fact you even can lose points if you do continue bad behavior.Another thing I personally dislike is the social club login. You always have to keep signing in but in LA Noire it simply wont save my account data and I regularyly have to retype it to be able to start the game.I payed 5 Euroes and 99 cents but the game was completely worth it. I enjoy it a lot and since you can handle the missions very differently, there is quite some replay value as well if you wanna keep puzzling on a perfect score.			"

												If you're looking for an action based game, this isn't it.That said, if you're a fan of plot-driven, detective-work based adventure games of yore, THIS IS YOUR FIX.The game has a massive fanbase in Japan for essentially being a visual novel with a sandbox framework, and it shows in both writing and execution.The only real downside I can think of is the uncanny valley potential (very large here), the fact that the sandbox is underutilized unless you go on many of the sidequests for collectables, and as a whole the plot escalation being a basic snowball in pace.In any case, a must buy for the complete version, and a major ""wait for a sale"" if you are focused on action moreso than anything else.

												Unusual, original and exciting yes yes this is exaclty L.A. NOIRE The main character of this game it's Cole Phelps veteran of the world war 2 with Japanese he returns to LA and begins work in police. L.A. Noire isn't all about badgering people, though. Remember it's not 100% sand-box . Of course we can travel in very big town , we've got almost 100 cars and 40 little missions ( if you want you can do , but if you dont want you dont need ) but the lvl of freedom it's like Mafia 2... and that's mean there is no freedom. The focus isn't on how good you are at scoring headshots with a pistol but instead your ability to read a suspect's face and determine if he or she is telling the truth etc. I have finished few times L.A. Noire and I never bored with this game . (Good game for study languages )Sounds  in this game are made very, very well The big minus of this game it's Physic , when you are driving a car it's like soap on the ice.  Of course your partner can drive from A to B  but I think it's better to drive around Los Angeles by yourself and see how beautiful is that town .In game we have few  Story Cases like : Patrol , Traffic , Homicide , Vice , Arson . PS. Game is really brutal , dont play childs , but im sure you will not listen me ... but plaese... dont fapp to killed naked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. gameplay 8/10  sounds 8/10 graphic 7/10 8/10Rockstar has done good job , game is very good 8/10 I recommends to play this game.

												This game is the best detective game there is out there. Period.You play as Cole Phelps, a war veteran that got a silver star medal while serving in Okinawa.After serving in Okinawa, he joined the LAPD.Pros: • Amazing lip sync - the lip sync is fantastic! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZaxxBU6yOA) • Superb voice acting - Character communication is outstanding! • Difficult cases - The time a case takes, varies. But One case is usually 40-60 minutes. • Amazing story line - The atmosphere (cars, roads, currency, etc.) does really look and feel like it is in the 40's!Cons: • FPS lock - Originally, the game is locked at 30fps. You can remove this cap by using ""Widescreen fixer"". The game can become buggy by using it though. Example is when driving, you barely have any brakes on your car • Short view distance - Only about 50 meters are loaded in your surroundings, but this is rarely any issue or a problem.I give this game a rating of 8.7 / 10 potatoes.

												A unique adventure game that borrows many features from mystery and action games, incorporating them seamlessly in the narrative flow, thus creating a truly special game that not everyone will enjoy. And that's because it has its own character, defying contemporary 'fast food' games that are churned out today and because it's reminiscent of endeavors made in another era, where immersion of an ultimate single-player experience was the first and last goal of their creators.

												The game is good. The gameplay is nice and all, but it feels very limited. The driving and walking physics are good, but climbing ladders, pipes, and going up fire escape stairs is very annoying. Hand-to-hand combat could've been much better.  No opinion on firing weapons, that was executed well. Driving physics are good, but car damage is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So are NPC's in vehicles. They will randomly crash into you, or stop in the middle of the road, causing you to crash into them. There's a variety of outfits, challenges (not cases) and vehicles. Now for the story part. Is it just me or does it feel that Phelps is a cop for like two weeks? I mean, he starts off as a patrolman in early 1947, and the game finishes in September '47. He goes trough the Patrol Desk in like a week, same goes for Traffic. And then there is this six month gap where he is in Burglary (cut content) and he is Homicide for another week before being in Vice.  Again, he's in Vice for a week, then he gets supsended for like a day and is already back in Arson the day after. Oh, and he has like two whole cases in there and you waste your time with the final mission just to get to see ""that"" ending. The cases that you get to play are good, so is the questioning of your P.O.I's. But yes, the only thing that annoys me is how short the game is. And, it always made me think why none of Cole's partners got promoted. Phelps solved ""The Fallen Idol"" with the help of Bekowsky, and Stefan stayed in Traffic. Phelps solved The Dahlia case with Galloway, and again, only Phelps got bumped to Vice (although trough a special request), but still Galloway deserved some sort of promotion. Other than all that, good game.			"

												Amazingly written characters and face impression technology. Well executed type of detective gameplay. Personally I find it hard to achieve the perfect interrogation because of the fact that there is no easy way and you have to use your wits perfectly but still that is what makes the game unique in its own way. I would say checkpoints couldve been more but suppose this was better and more realistic.Recommended			"

You will play as Phelps and will work your way up the ranks at the police station, you will go to crime scenes, investigate, drive, shoot people, catch serial killers. Whenever i watch a crime show i feel like i want to be evolved in solving the crimes, and in this game you get to do that you get to take control of the investigation.Definitely grab this when it's on sale.9.5/10A+			"

												Go get them Cole!L.A. Noire is in my opinion the perfect game. The perfect dose of action, suspense, story driven plot.We are given a ride thru the history of Cole Phelps. As he rises thru the ranks of the Police department, we get a history lesson has well a well paced travel into the human criminal mind. "" there is one case that makes a detective, the one that doesnt let you sleep at night."" This is the truth about this game. You deal with the ""normal"" crimes, robbery, murder, arson,etc. But nothing will prepare you for what lies further in the game. The graphic novelesk type story behind the insidious criminal mind that will remain a dark shadow while you play. Until you find out the truth. The vintage setting is just the iccing on top of this well rounded Cake. Worth it without a Doubt!			"

												I'll keep it smooth and ordered:Pro:- REAL mimics. They used a technology where they basically filmed the actors face and put it into the game. No animations, no face capture, you see real people there. That is the main selling point - at least for me - of the game because no other game used this since then. It is very expensive, that is why. - REAL(istic) movements. The motion capture worked really well, I rarely see this detailed animations. - Interesting cases. They're small full stories in themselves, but most of them somehow connects to the bigger picture. You start the game as a patrol, then as you move forward you became a detective. You solve cases at each different desk, but you only start to get the picture after half of the game. - Good main story. It is beliveable, the characters are detailed, such as their motivations. The plot twist impressed me. - I'd say nice cars as well, but that isn't a big thing to do these days. Contra:- Repetitive investigating. You use the same techniques and scripted animations over and over. - Also repetitive street crimes. Car chases, thefts and shootings. These were the three main types. Some were interesting though.- Annoying sound bugs. Had to restart the last mission from the beginning because couldn't heard sh*t from the last cutscene. - 30 FPS lock. And it drops below 24 even on a strong config. This is a smart game. The developers outdone themselves with the whole facial expression and mocap feature, but they didn't put as much emphasis on important things as they should have. My 27 hours playtime felt like 40 because I got bored many times during it. Still can't dislike it, if it's on sale go and buy it. 7/10			"

												The story was wonderful.  I really thought that Cole was going to be this cookie cutter, always a goody two shoes (and very boring) kind of guy.  And while he does start off like that, Cole goes through some massive character development, as he starts realizing that the police had some seriously corrupt individuals running the show.  This game does touch on some sensitive issues, so if you have issues dealing with things like♥♥♥♥♥♥and child molestation, AVOID THIS GAME.  Granted, it is not the main part of the storyline, but you do run across those acts a few times during the entirety of the game.  Oh and don't forget that this is a noir game.  Keep that in mind and maybe you won't be tempted to take your comp out back and give it a beatdown when you finally hit the end. When the game told me I need to watch the face of the person I am questioning to see if they are sincere or not, I shook my head.  Great, here is another game that is going to ask you to do something damn near impossible.  I will admit that there are some, where you will need to listen to the voice as well as watch their face, but you should do that no matter what.  I will say this.  I did mute the volume just to see if I could read lips, and they were pretty readable.  One word of caution... if you suck at driving cars like I do, have your partners drive.  I realize that achievement hunters will have to manually control the car (which I did too... but let's just say some roads looked a lot like a tornado had blown through and car parts were everywhere).If you like crime games, noir, open world, lots of guns, cars, an excellent storyline with a great cast of actors... just get this game.   20 bucks is a good price, but if you see it on sale do yourself a favor and pick it up.  You'll be glad that you did.			"

												L.A. Noire is a real gem of my game library! It has everything I've ever wished for in detective games: * Open world with 95 vehicles you can drive. There is an Auto Fanatic achievement for starting engine of all vehicles available in the game at least once. Searching for more cars in game made me look at cars parked along sidewalks irl and think if they are those which are missing ;) * Wide variety of cases to solve under different departments of the police institute. It successfully prevents the game from being too repetitive and you get new partners to work on cases with. * Action! You will chase criminals and suspects on foot or in a vehicle. Combat involves both fist and gun fighting depends on a situation. But you must fight appropriately back or your mission will fail and you will have to start over. Weapons can only be used during firefights. If you can't successfully finish an action mission, the game will offer you to simply skip it and move on after the 3rd try. I think that's a great deal for people who are more interested in the story than in the challenges. * Many dialogues, questioning, truth, doubt and lie choices, great face mimic. * Nice graphics, attention to the detail, great voice acting. * You get to play character who's personality you learn more about through his behaviour, conversations and flashbacks of his past. You will find out he is a person who makes mistakes and who sure has skeletons in his closet.. It's pretty amazing how complex his personality is. I really like the twists we are getting there. I must say, don't let the 30 fps cap scare you away from one of the greatest detective games. You can easily fix it and increase it to 60.L.A. Noire is definitely worth of being finished. Towards the ending the game includes the most action scenes. Before that I used to play it when I wanted to relax after a hard day at work. Then things escalated and the story got a fast speed untill it reached the typical noire fiction ending.I really recommend the game from the bottom of my heart. Go for it :)			"

												I was pretty skeptical about this game, then it went on sale and that caught my attention. I did some research on reviews for the game and one of my most trusted sources (GameSpot) gave the game a 9 - Superb and I decided to purchase it and try it.The game has performed pretty smooth so far and the graphics are good, but the atmosphere and visual depiction of Los Angeles is fantastic! The story line and voice acting is very good and quite absorbing. I've never been a big fan of crime detective adventure mysteries but this game has changed all that...I'm hooked, at least for L.A. Noire. The keyboard (you can customize) and mouse controls take a bit of practice but then it flows quite well.The downside (which is very insignificant) is the auto saves, I'm not a fan of that but in a game like this that is probably the only option.I highly recommend this game, just be sure you have a computer that can handle it...I too give it a 9 out of 10!Patrick  "

												A new approach to the adventure genre. I‘m a fan of adventure games and i loved it. Of course the game is not perfect. I was amazed by the graphics when it came out on PS3 and purchased it. Now i bought it with all the DLC. Rockstar know how to make DLC, this is real DLC which adds about 8-9 hours of gameplay and the quality of DLC cases is great. It‘s integrated into the story cases and you can‘t even tell whether you‘re playing DLC or not.The facial animations still surprises me, i so want more games with similar technology. Wouldn‘t it be nice to se a walking dead game with such animations?The overall graphics is pretty good too. But the performance is not the strongest part of this game. The game is pretty old and the framerate is not very good. Of course i used the fix which unlocks 60fps it made the game better.Solving cases is fun, you search for the clues and talk to the witnesses and suspects and must decide if they‘re lying or not. The cases are different so it never gets boring. Story is very interesting too.It‘s an open world game but i really don‘t understand what’s the point of it. You have nothing to do except for story and side missions. The purpose of all that open map is only to drive from point A to point B.Anyway just grab this when you see it on sale, it‘s cheap now and is really worth it. "

												Good concept but flawed execution. The problem with creating a crime solving game, which Rockstar understands, is that the average gamer won't be able to do it. The compromise to what could have been a cool mystery/policing type game is that it ends up being more of a hand-holding simulator, where most of the stuff is done for you. It's really trivial to do everything right because the game does so much by itself.			"

												Let me preface this by saying: I did not expect GTA: 1940. I was told this was a puzzle game with some movie-like noir elements.That was wrong. L.A. Noire is a boredom factory. You push some buttons, you look around, you click through some dialogue and out comes the snores. The game is simple, the action sequences are usually holding the shift button as you jump over fences and short walls and other manners of game props while chasing a bad guy, and the 'puzzle' elements involve looking for one of the many shiny clue objects in a scene (there isn't even any clutter to complicate things, the console effect means that even in supposedly hectic scenes like a recently trashed apartment there are only a few interact-able props, which the main character will almost immediately tell you “isn't relevant to the investigation”) or walking around a room until a piano note sounds, then pressing a button and rotating an object to get the moron detective to look at all 4 sides of a knife before deciding it could be a murder weapon. No matter what you choose from the dialogue branches, the main character shoots off in whatever direction he fancies, so any immersion into the supposed movie atmosphere of the game is broken every time it prompts you for input because the talking heads have no flow to their discussion.“Stick with it”, they cry, “the later cases get pretty good!”Hogwash. It felt like a chore slogging through every single mission, at no point was I having fun. The stories aren't compelling, the gameplay isn't exciting, the puzzles aren't puzzles, and above all the voice acted dialogue sequences are an agony to sit through (not because of the voice acting, which is average at its worst). Pass, pass ten thousand times. I would rather play a real puzzle game, a visual novel, or an action game. L.A. Noire tries to do some mashup of all three and comes out a pile of turds. I think somebody accidentally released a facial emotion tech demo.			"

												L.A. Noire is a violent crime thriller that blends breathtaking action with true detective work to deliver an unprecedented interactive experience and follows the story of Cole Phelps, an ex-military and LAPD detective trying to climb in the ranks while fighting corruption and all-time high murder rates back in the 40's Los Angeles.L.A. Noire is a such a unique adventure game that borrows many features from mystery and action games, incorporating them seamlessly in the narrative flow, creating a truly special game.There's a wide array of vehicles and cases to solve under different departments, suspects to chase, either on foot or while driving and suspects in custody to interrogate.The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is pretty good, the soundtrack and voice acting are marvelous but what really makes this game a masterpiece is the astonishing and engaging story and the character development.I highly recommend L.A.

												Ohh, Cole Phelps. So clueless, but so respected. This game is made by the same people who make Grand Theft Auto and being on the other side of things, the ""good guy"" side, is fun. It's fun to accuse people of lying and proving that they are. It's fun to beat up chumps who take pictures of little girls. It's fun to drive with the siren on so people may move out of the way (they don't). This game is so much fun, but it's not the brainless fun that GTA offers. You actually have to pay attention and use previous knowledge and clues when you interrogate, I mean, interview suspects and witnesses.

												Rockstar has a lot of issues with their Social Club... but don't let that put you off this gem of a game. The rendering of 1940's L.A. is fantastic, and if it were a game for just a driving tour of the city, it would be worth buying for that element alone. The story is engrossing, if not quite completely fleshed out, and the character development and interactions with NPCs give the narrative a great flavor of the period.I just loved exploring the city. The cases and the whole ""playing the detective"" gameplay is well developed, if somewhat tricky (I had a hard time ""reading"" people to judge if they were lying, being evasive or telling the truth). I played the game ""noir style"" in black and white, and generally had no problems identifying clues despite the lack of color contrast.I got 60 hours of gameplay in my first playthrough and there is still tons of exploration to do. Would I play through the story again? Yes, emphatically. So I think the game is worth a look in, if you are still making up your mind. If anything, I was disappointed that the game ended (but also a little surprised by how abruptly it ended: NO SPOILERS). Recommended.			"

												Only a couple hours in, and I am completely amazed by this game. The facial details in this game are unparalleled (even for a 2011 game), even though sometimes the character's facial movements/expressions do not help you in interrogation. The story is also not completely erratic like others, yet keeps you on track enough just to keep you coming back for more. However, the game is not without it's flaws. Tasks such as running and gunning while goons are unloading whole mags on you feels a bit unresponsive at times, and I've had some minor graphical glitches dealing with character's heads at times. Overall, it is a really good game, and I would recommend for anybody who likes a good mystery.			"

												Perhaps this is the most exciting game in the genre. Atmosphere Los Angeles assigned incredibly accurate. Detailing and facial expressions of characters is so good that sometimes it seems that it is a movie. Good movie in HD. The plot is captures and a few hours of play already begins to seem that you yourself detective.  In this game you need to really think a head to look at the character's face and facial expressions to detect a lie or telling the truth. That dialogue at the highest level.Despite the fact that it is such a GTA game, I recommend it to all fans of this genre because there is something to all of us and a favorite of the Mafia.10 out of 10!

												When this first came out, the first thing that came across my mind was Mafia II. And let me tell you, I like Mafia II a lot. So I thought this would be just a Mafia rip-off with only difference being the protagonist. Not a gangster, but a cop. Graphics looked similar, fighting system looked pretty  much the same and the setting was very similar too. But that was just me judging by simply looking at trailers. The differences are actually major.Later I received this game as a gift from my friend and, to be honest, I was quite impressed. That was after I managed to run it properly though. The game was rather choppy at first (which didn't suprise me since it was a well-known fact). I must admit I didn't even need to change too many things to make it playable. I probably got lucky.But enough of that, let's see what the game has to offer.Graphics is nice and the city this game takes place in, Los Angeles, is huge. It's very detailed and despite the impressive scale there are hardly any bugs. You'll find many types of cars and many character models with different textures. Almost everybody knows about the famous face expressions in this game. And yes, they did a good job with it, even though some people look more scary than real. I wouldn't call it a huge help during interviews with suspects either, because LA seems to mostly consist of professional liars. But don't get me wrong, it's a nice feature.Another good thing about this game is the music. And not only the score that puts you into right mood, but also great hits of the 1940's you will hear in the radio. Voice acting is provided by the same persons whose faces you actually see in the game, so the whole thing feels authentic. Sounds of weapons, cars and the city are your normal average sounds.Gameplay takes some time to get used to, but it's not bad. Walking, driving, shooting... You'll learn all that quickly. Then we have the other stuff that makes this game special. That means searching for clues and interviews. It might seem little confusing at the beginning, but there's a whole chapter of tutorial that also serves as an introduction for out protagonist - disciplined police go-getter named Cole Phelps. Sooner or later searching for clues will become a routine for you and you'll eventually get better at interviews. Those are made well too. You can either believe the suspect, doubt them or even accuse them of lying. But be careful! You must use correct clues to prove they're lying to you.And then we have the story. Is it good? Hard to say. It's mostly just cases to solve with a flashback cutscene from the war every now and then. Later in the game, Cole's personal life will get more space, but I won't be spoiling.I can absolutely recommend this game, even though there might be problems running it properly and you might need to find some tips on how to make it run smoother. Some cases are brilliant, some are annoying, but that's what life itself is like, so why not? Overall it's a great experience with lots of interesting stuff. In many ways unique too.			"

												L.A. Noire, why are you so entertaining and so disappointing at the same time?L.A. Noire is mostly the story of Cole Phelps, a former-marine-now-policeman working in the Angels' city. As such, he will have to work his way up the food chain, starting in patrol, soon to be promoted to trafic, homicide and what not.The game is a mix and match of several genres: it's a bit of a point n' click, but with third-person shooting and driving around, in a beautifully recreated L.A. Mostly, you'll be collecting clues on crime scenes, and interviewing suspects, while a partner lets you do all the work and comments on your action.Those parts are great. Thanks to some fancy facial-capture technology and the help of professional actors, the characters of L.A. Noire feel alive, and real. You can see their expression on their faces, notice when they tell the truth or when they lie (in which case you gotta shove a clue you collected into their face). Coles Phelps yells, gets mad, doubts... In a very convincing way. The cast includes many well-know series actors, from Madmen, Breaking Bad or Twin Peaks.What's more, the shooting parts (relatively frequent) aren't that bad, for an investigation game.But L.A. Noire's greatest success is its wonderful film noire atmosphere. Secret loves, murders, illegal gamblings, corrupted politicians and cops, jazz, femmes fatales... Everything is right here, in a post-WW2 US. A country that feels invincible, but whose confidence hides nasty stories.Great, heh?Yeah, except that L.A. Noire also disappoints. If you don't stick to the cases you're supposed to be solving, you quickly find out its greatest weakness: Los Angeles has no soul. The city is beautiful, mind you. But nothing happens. Car drives around, people walk. There are a few scripted events. But that's about it. You can't drive around and tail someone just because he looks weird. The game has to tell you to do it. You can't get into a restaurant a get yourself a coffee and read the news. You can't discuss with people. The city feels like a beautiful, but empty playground.If you're expecting a game that looks and plays like Gran Theft Auto, let's say you might be turned off by L.A. Noire. The game has little in common with Rockstar' behemoth. But if you like the film noire genre, and are willing to put up with sometimes clunky or repetitive gameplay, then you ought to try L.A. Noire. I personnally see the game as an interactive story (a bit like The Walking Dead), taking place in an open world where you can drive fancy old cars. Too bad the game could have been so much more.			"

												A brilliant fusion of the detective point and click genre and action games. This game is never boring as gameplay constantly changes up. One minute you will be looking for clues, the next minute you will be questioning suspects/witnesses, and five minutes later you might find yourself in a shootout, fist brawl, stakeout, foot chase, or car chase. While things might not progress in that particular order, the point is that you will find yourself doing all of these things throughout the course of the game, or even within the same case. The game starts to feel like many games combined into one, but the transition is seemless. This game is a must buy for those that want something different and wouldn't mind role-playing as a cop. The game itself is genre breaking and doesn't quite fit into any one genre, which is a good thing in an age where many games stick to stale tried-and-true formulas.			"

												If you are playing this game, play it as a glorified movie, not like a videogame. In terms of gameplay and player agency, the things you can really do are limited. Once you get the hang of it, the lie detection system gets pretty easy too, and even if it's not, there's always the ability to reload previous saves for that perfect score.However, it still has a really good storyline and setting. Driving around the streets of an old LA make you live in a world we would usually see in black and white, and despite what I've said before, the way you can go around a case is what can make you go missing clues or being able to score a full score on the first try.Overall, check it out if it's on a steam sale, only if you want to see the story.

												Before I start my review let me tell you the L.A. Noire is NOT the easiest game to get running smoothly. Here's what I did and it ran great on my modest Win 7 64 Bit machine. When the launch screen comes up go to Options and in the command line copy and paste ""-npd -str -nonv"" (without the quotes) into the box. Turn ""Ambient Occlusion"" off and ""Threading"" to Single. Hopefully that helps. Now. With that said, I found L.A. Noire to be a gift from Heaven. I'm a huge fan of Raymond Chandler and his stories of Private Detective Philip Marlowe swimming through the seedy side of early Los Angeles with every case. L.A. Noire has you patrolling those very streets and solving cases involving sex, drugs, murder and corruption. The major crimes found in L.A. Noire are based on real life crimes and the streets of Los Angeles circa the late 40s have been painstakingly recreated to colorful perfection. You're rewarded for oberservational skills both in clue hunting and during the interview and interrogation portions. There is tons to do whether you want to look for landmarks, well hidden bonus items or one of the 40 ""street crime"" mini-missions that you can elect to take between calls. I really liked the facial motion capture which gave each character more personality. The acting is superb and loaded with recognizable character actors like John Noble, Michael Wiles & Kurt Fuller. Gunplay and driving is as easy as what you'll find in a GTA game. Now is it perfect? No. The port is not very good. From what I understand it's a pain to run even on a beefy PC. The street crime mini missions are very short and there are times you'll be driving a while to get to them.  Overall, L.A. Noire gets a 9.5/10 from me. If you're looking for a lengthy, well told story with excellent voice acting and game play then hit ""install"".			"

												Wow. Okay, wait, let's get the bad out of the way first.1) It's optimized poorly. The game seemingly started fine, or perhaps I was too enamored with the city to notice, but DX9 or DX11, highest settings or lowest, nothing mattered. The camera would stutter, the engine would slow, and otherwise damage the otherwise breathtaking aesthetics of L.A. Noire.2) The driver and pedestrian A.I. is atrocious. For a game that forces you to spend the majority of your time driving, expect to laugh at the ridiculous decisions made by the NPCs in this game. Then, when chasing down suspects or trying to avoid... well, I won't spoil anything, but let's just say at certain points, you will yell at the television for these dummies to get out of the way.3) The action sequences aren't as interesting as the investigation ones. Basic action, such as the street crimes, or even a moderate shootout, aren't too bad but the above complaints tend to ruin any tension Team Bondi attempted to create.I think that's about it. So what did I like?1) The city. Sorry, Sleeping Dogs, you've been knocked off the top spot (previously owned by Saints Row 2) for best video game city. It's no wonder Team Bondi went bankrupt after this game. The amount of time and resources it must have taken to recreate Los Angeles is staggering.2) The characters. Thanks to stellar voice acting and the well-publicized facial animation engine, it's easy to forget you're playing a game and not watching a movie. Tip: Play L.A. Noire in black and white and the effect is even more staggering.3) The story. I'm a sucker for noir in general, and this is a pretty good tribute to the genre. That pretty much every single element is tied to the main story, no matter how minor it seems, is a nice touch.4) The investigation. Whether you're screaming at a widower -- er, I mean 'doubting' a widower -- or trying to figure out how a torn letter fits with the case, I enjoyed poking around the city's seedy underbelly and solving the (many!) mysteries.Note that I keep writing ""the city"" instead of ""the game."" Yes, it's that realistic.I loved L.A. Noire, and if you like mysteries and history at all, please don't hesitate picking up this game. Just be warned that even at 30 FPS, a computer that laughs at the recommended specs of the latest games will (probably) not run this smoothly. Fortunately, you'll probably be too engrossed to care. I know I was.			"

Both atmospheric and intriguing. The cinematics made the game look like an 60's movie. In a good way of course. The main character is a very likable person. And everything you do, every mistake and success counts. It will influence on your investigation one way or another. The cases were Insanely twisted and interesting.

												If you want an open world crime solving game, then this is the only game around.Graphics: They are fairly decent to play and use. Nothing amazing but still very good for this game.Audio: The audio is semi basic, offering no major change to huge detailing. Just an open world crime and weird sounds. That's all. Controls: The character at times handles a little weird but that is the game and not the controls. Otherwise the controls are very easy to manage. Game: It is open world GTA but you are a police man case solver, that is it.There is supposed to be a feature that allows you to read the BOTS facial expression... YET THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME in ALL expressions. So how you are supposed to tell if they are lying is beyond me!The game story will be very short if you power that only.  It is wise to do the side missions aswell and collect the secrets etc as you play through the game.  Worth the time you put into it, but it is not amazing.Would I recommend this game? Yes because it's good fun and a nice chance of pace from modern games.			"

												So , I completed this game on 100% and I can finally write a review. What can this game offer?Well , in this game you are going to play as a detective Cole Phelps and watch not only how he is going up in his career but also how he is becoming a real hero.There are 5 desks to complete in this game : Patrol , Traffic , Homicide , Vice and Arson.Each of them contains ~5 cases (only Patrol has 4) and also 1 or 2 DLC cases.Both of default and DLC cases are very interesting. Each desk offers unique cases , for example in Traffic desk you will investigate crimes related with cars stealing and in Homicide you will investigate brutal murders.To feel like a real detective you'll need to collect evidence at crime scenes and also ask questions to suspects. You'll need to see if they are telling truth or lying and show one evidence to confirm that they are lying. Sometimes it's really hard to tell if person is lying and that's why there are ""Intuition""in this game. You are getting ""Intuition points"" while you are leveling up and use these points to see what have other players chosen.This can help a lot.There are a lot of things to collect in this game from hidden badges to cars.To fully understand plot you can pick up newspapers which you can easily find during main story. There are also flashbacks in the end of some cases. These flashbacks help you to see the past of Cole Phelps.This game has huge open world(almost a half of GTA V(or even more)). To move around quickly you can ask your partner to drive the car to the selected location. This can save a lot of time.In conclusion , I can't understand why almost everyone is upset with ending of this game. I think that the ending that we have would be the best option to end the game.One disadvantage of this game is that it's locked on 30FPS.So , this game is great , shall i say. It has a great story and spectacular gameplay which will make you play this game even after you have beate it.Although , without DLC cases this game may seem to be short so if you can afford DLC bundle - buy it.I can proudly give this game 9.5/10 (because I had some problems with it and saw some bugs)			"

												If you're a fan of the 40ies era, crime scene investigations and narrative games then this is the perfect game for you!  BUY IT! Unfortunately the world in this game is limited to your detective duties and a few street crimes, as it would be suitable for a lot of open world playability, but it has even less sandboxing than Mafia II. So if you'd want an open sandbox world, you're out of luck and you'd be having more fun playing Mafia II with its DLC.However, all-in-all it's a great immersive game (awesome radio with real pieces of history!) that follows the career of Cole Phelps, an honest cop, freshly returned from WWII with the necessary traumas that he's trying to forget, while he's trying to solve murder cases. But there's more behind them than meets the eye....			"

												Technical developers made genocide over this game when they put 30FPS lock. I don't mind 30FPS,bigger problem for me is that 30 FPS are not stable,when i use alt+tab,or shift+tab,i always get annoying FPS drop,but with time,you get used to it. Also,graphic options are kinda lame-you can mostly choose between ''performance'' and ''quality''.Im active gamer for last 12 years,this game is top5 unique games i ever played.Mission are very interested,every mission in unique in some way,and also side mission are pretty cool...I would say map(which is Skyrim size) is to big for this kind of game. Another bad thing is that you can't kill pedestrians when you hit them witn car xD (althought,it's not reccomended since you'll get negative rating at the end of mission if you do so).I would also mention that this game have large number of (licenced) vehicles.If 60 FPS-i would give 8/10With 30 FPS - 6/10			"

												I've not got too far into this game just yet, but for someone who struggles with a short attention span and very rarely sticks to and finishes a game, this has already got me hooked! I love the fact that you have so much control over the game, and having to choose the correct answer (Truth, Doubt or Lie) from reading their body language and facial expressions is really interesting to me and can completely change the game play. The storyline keeps me interested and for that to happen, it must be pretty good!Would definitely recommend. It may be quite slow paced to some, but I really enjoy it! "

												Fantastic game. Facial expressions and acting are the best I've seen in a game, and the detective gameplay is simply genius making you try to figure out if someone is lying by watching their faces. The music and writing are excellent. The cases are really interesting so far. Graphics look a bit dated, but work very well. The 30fps cap doesn't bother me at all, this is not an action game.Only complaint is that the gameplay feels a bit clunky at times. The game feels much better with a controller than a k/m.Very recommended, tons of content, and high production values.			"

												L.A.Noire is a work of art, pure and simple.   The work that Rockstar put into GTA:Vice City has been heaped on this, and then some.    This game takes all of the best bits of 1940s film noire and presents it in a truly amazing format.    The game plays through like a solid story, beginning to end.  Each part of the story, while seemingly independent at first, slowly starts to intertwine together, referencing forwards and backwards, until by the end, you realise you've not been playing a ""serial case"" detective story, but a solid arc in a character's life story.   And by arc, I mean arc.  The main character has his flaws, as well as his good traits, which leads to some interesting plot twists.There's an awful lot in this game.  Rockstar, as always have laid out an entire city for you to play in.  There's all the usual things you've come to expect: Pedestrians, radio stations, cars, rat-runs, sewers, bridges, etc etc..  Lots of scope for good, solid, sandbox fun.    Sprinkled throughout the city are little side-quests, and mini-games, which (thankfully) don't get completely in the way, nor do they detract too heavily from the gameplay if you do decide to play a little sidequest now and again.   Many games of this type suffer from what I call ""too few voice actors"".  Remember the hilariously non-diverse vocal makeup of games like Morrowind and Oblivion?   Well, Rockstar decided ""screw that!"" and have a different voice actor for every character, and a different face!  There are over 25 different pedestrian models alone!   When you're walking through crowds, you don't feel like you're in a clone convention!The car physics are pretty solid, and the models are lush.  All the oldies are represented, and the modelling guys really went to town to make it look good.    The sounds are brilliant too. The way the sirens echo as you chase through tunnels, and the sounds become muted in the rain...   It just drips with atmosphere.   Turn the screen to ""B&W"" mode, and you're back in an old Bogart flick, driving through downtown LA.   The only thing missing from the game is Film Grain !All in all, I'd say that this and GTA:Vice City are Rock Star's best games.  I really hope they do a LA.N2, because this game was just so much fun to play.   I'm only sad I don't have the bazillion hours to track down every last Achievement.. Some of them are just so random, they crop up once in a blue moon.  So, here's where I'll leave it.    Thanks, Rockstar.  This was an experience I won't forget!			"

												Masterpiece. This game is awesome in every detail - motion capture, story, action. And although the DLC - not important for the story, on the other hand the DLC is set into the story so it is not some cheap ""Extra mission DLC"". And John Noble (Walter Bishop from Fringe) is amazing in his acting (in DLC) so I highly recommend to buy complete edition. Game has the same atmosphere as the L.A. Confidential movie and although is more or less set in the same time period.			"

												This game gets a straight 10/10 for me, even though it took a lot of research and finally a patch to run it. There aren't many games in which you get to test your brains as well as as your hand-eye coordination in real world scenarios. Playing a detective could never be as much intriguing or fun as it was in L.A. Noire. The game mechanics are super cool, allowing the player to gauge the characters expressions and body language and based on that, assess whether they're lying, hiding something, or telling the truth. Although the game is fairly linear, it's very interesting to see how the decisions made affect each case. It would have been even more interesting if the entire story changed on the basis of those decisions, of course! Every gamer should definitely play this once.			"

												GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GAME. This game makes you think a ton because there's so much detective work and none of the evidence pieces together, so it's your job to find out who's lying and who's not. This game involves high speed car chases, epic gunfights, awesome graphics (for its time which was 2011,) great gameplay, a huge map, and tons of costumes with special powers. The only bad thing about this game is that there are about a bajillion startup problems you will go through after purchasing it, but i do believe they have fixed it because it works every time i want to play.  Aside from all the thousands of horrible things about windows 8.1, i would without a doubt reccomend this game to anyone who is interested in detective work, thinking hard, or even have the slightest interest in forensics because this game ROCKS!!!!

												Police procedural. It's a word you hear a lot when descriibing TV cop dramas. Despite how exciting those shows can be, the word itself sounds like something incredibly boring. Probably in real life it most often is. Great music and montages can do a lot to make a detective's life look enviable. The problem with LA Noire is that there are no montages. There's this huge world to explore, yet there's no reason or pull to. Each chapter, or 'case' is so short and contained that it never feels like the right time to go exploring. Why then make the game appear so much like a sandbox? Being 'on mission' all the time, having such a focus on realism, being rated constantly: it all amounts to nurturing a fear of experimenting and going off track. Yet these are the things which evoke fun times. I enjoyed the experience of LA Noire for the unique one that it was, but I probably won't be heading back.			"

												I love this game...such a shame that the developers went bust because I would LOVE to have seen a sequel, or at least another game of this style.Some of the flashback sequences didn't make sense until I replayed through and found that it was all connected in a disjointed kind of way and the ending was very much not what I was expecting.

												Revolutionary game. For the first time ever you feel you are a true detective, solving crimes, climbing up the ranks. The retro feeling of the game is awesome, nice graphics, the game makes you feel that every case is a movie (like Colombo). The facial mimics are incredible, every twitch matters, it helps you decide wether the suspect is lying or not. I'm recommending this game to everyone who likes murder stories, the forties-fifties America. Only downside is that after a while the crimesolving gets a little dull, but it's nothing compared to everything else.			"

												After 40 hours of gameplay time I have to say LA Noire is one of the most ambitious, most interesting and most exciting games I have played in recent years. Attention to detail is top-notch as we have already gotten used to it when it comes to a Rockstar game. But here this is more commendable as this is now a ""serious"" game - you follow the story of detective Phelps, an LAPD cop, who rises from being a simple patrolman to working with the best and most influential cops in the force. You quickly realise that there are people harder to catch out there - you start with the small fish only to find clues as to how to grab the biggest sharks in town.Gameplay-wise LA Noire is a bit different from GTA IV. The missions - or as they're referred to, cases - usually start out with a crime scene investigation. You get in a car and drive to your destination where you need to look for clues. Clues are objects you can interact with - once you approach one you'll hear a chime; this is how the game tells you that you can now press a button to grab the object in your vicinity. The more clues you find the more are added to your notebook. There is usually a witness around you can interview. And this is the 2nd most important thing in gameplay: interviewing means that while you can pick your questions from a list provided you also need to ""evaluate"" the suspects' responses. You have 3 options: you either believe what they are saying, you can remain in doubt or you can shout at them calling them liars. Picking the correct answer will make it easier for you to find and apprehend the real suspect. Make no mistake: if you are wrong it does not mean game over but it will affect the scoring at the end of your case. You should also note two more things: firstly, you can have help in the form of intuition points. The more crimes you solve the more experience points you get. Once you level up you gain an intuition point. These can be used to remove one of the 3 possible answers thereby increasing your chances to 50%.  Secondly, once you accuse someone of lying you need to prove that. Phelps immediately turns the page in his notebook to the list of evidences. You need to pick the right evidence to succeed (that is, if you have found enough clues for that to appear in your list).Interestingly, some of these conversations can be the most exciting and rewarding parts of the game. Rockstar employed a special motion capture technique which makes all faces and expressions as realistic as possible. In fact, you can see the faces of real life actors and actresses - those of you watching a lot of TV series will easily be able to recognise some of these. This also means that voice acting is provided by the same people and it is of equally high quality. Suspects not telling the truth usually look away, move their mouths, grimace, scratch their head, loose their tie, etc. The mechanics for the action scenes are similar to that of GTA IV. You have the same cover system, you can brawl occasionally and you have car chases where your partner does the shooting. You just need to make sure you are as close to the suspect's vehicle as possible so that your detective partner can shoot the tires. Sometimes, your job is to apprehend a suspect in a non-lethal way - if not by brawling then by running after and tackling him. These scenes can get very repetitive which I did not mind in particular - except some of them felt a little too scripted: I thought I could get a guy if I was quick only to realise he was meant to be stopped by an accident. Another minor annoyance is the interview part: sometimes you are convinced the suspect is lying. You know you do not have any evidence so you pick the option ""Doubt"" but it turns out the guy was right so he was probably making a grimace due to being confused. As the game has an auto-save function you can easily quit and reload to try again but after a while this can be annoying. It just feels that Rockstar had a certain idea in mind for these choices and if you are lucky you can get the answer right.But what is there beside the cases you work on? Does LA Noire offer you the option of free roaming? I am happy to say it does: dispatch informs you of ongoing crimes and you can leave your current case to pursue these. Also, there are TONS of items to look for: badges, famous landmarks, film reels and 95 (!) vehicles to get into. Once you get into a car it is ""unlocked"". Under ""Extras"" in the main menu you'll find a showroom to have a look at an already unlocked vehicle. Many look pretty similar but they can be different models - sometimes it feels a bit ridiculous to get in and out of every vehicle you find in a parking lot but there's no other way for you to find all of them. I have to admit I could only collect 90% of them.As for the cases: you have everything you need. Narcotics, arsons, thefts, grand theft auto, cases with corrupt cops, serials killer, etc. The places you visit are varied and look realistic. Accompanying music and sound effects also represent an excellent quality.LA Noire has 21 cases. It feels as if you were watching a season of your favourite crime series. 21 episodes of it. And when it is over you are happy but at the same time you are eager to see what's coming in the next season. I wish LA Noire had one more season.			"

												L.A. Noire Review L.A. Noire is an intresting game, and very unlike other games and also like them all at the same time. You have your detective skills, questioning, unlike any other game, but you also have your car chases, shootouts, on foot chases, much like other games. One of the best things about L.A. Noire is that it skillfully uses these elements to create a consistent, cohesive, whole. L.A. Noire for me, helped me appreciate high production values used the right way. I believe the way L.A. Noire plays really makes it head and shoulder above many other games. L.A. Noire however doesn't come without faults. The procedural cases while engaging like, Law & Order, also get a little repetitive gameplay wise. After a couple of cases, you do the usual, find clues, investigate a place, interview witness' or suspects, and then chase the one your after. The case together though tell a great tale and it really is great especially if you are in to procedural dramas. The mo-cap system it uses is pretty darn amazing and the best I've seen yet. The performances really come through, although I would have loved for the directors, to come up with some more emotional cases or scenes, so we could really see how great this system is. About 20 or so hours in the game, you'll hit the Arson Desk, which provides some much needed reprieve from the usual procedings. I won't spoil it for you, but your entire time at the Arson Desk is unlike the other departments. At this point of the story L.A. Noire's plot really picks up and you start seeing the story threads all connect together, even threads that were started at the very beginning of the game. FOR: People who love noire, procedural dramas, and want to be a detective.NOT FOR: People who like fast paced gameplay, L.A. Noire has a slower pace than most games and it really starts to show about mid way. What probably doesn't help is the fact that it's about a 30 hour long game. While great for people who love this, it may not bode well for other with less patience. Nevertheless I suggest you buy the game, especially if it's on a Steam sale.			"

												If you`ve been looking for that gem that lets you play a career on the other side of the GTA fence, then this is certainly the one and not only that, its a masterpiece.Highly stylized and cinematic this game tips it`s hat to the Hollywood of the 1930 and 1940s taking after films like L.A. Confidential (one of my favorites).There is so much more to this than a game like GTA in the way of storyline and character interaction that it is beyond comparison. As you`ve probably read on other reviews, pain staking detail was paid to facial animation for this title giving it one of the most realistic in terms of facial rendering allowing you to look for facial and body language to determine whether someone that you`re questioning is lying or not and the subtle nuances of their mood, all of which affect your questioning and your case. Sure there`s shootouts, foot chases, car chases and stakeouts but the real heart of this game lies in the career of your character and his interactions with potential witnesses and crime scene evidence.Be prepared for an involved commitment or if you`d rather just run around on patrol, you can play with the Free Roam mode. You'll play from four desks: Traffic, Patrol, Homocide and Vice. Each has a series of cases that take you through your character's career which plays out like a classic movie with modern drama and writing. There's top notch voice and motion performance and some of the greatest moments in the game will come from your interactions with the various partners you have at each desk. Highly recommended if you like Rockstar's style and attention to detail. This title shines in its attention to storyline and the details of working in that line of work and of course if you've tired on running with one side of the law in the various virtual worlds out there, this one will give it to you in glorious detail that experience from the other side.It does require a bit of horsepower to fun smoothly though a fast dual core 2 Ghz with a half decent video card (Geforce 210 w/512Mb) should do sufficiently with the graphics options turned down which still looks great. I'm running at about 3/4 of full graphics and it looks and feels awesome with a machine a fair bit faster than what I've recommended.For the price this one sells it is a gem for certain. Keep in mind that this title is definitely for a mature audience as you will be solving cases accurately modeled from actual crime scenes. Viewer discretion is definitely advised.This title really gives you the experience from the other side of the fence to so many other titles out there and its an honest and hard hitting title for certain. A great experience and Rockstar has pulled all the stops to tell this police story.Highly recommended			"

												L.A. Noire is not just a detective game, it's truly so much more in my opinion. This game is based around the late fourties when LA is at its Golden Age of the movie industry and the evy of the world. Your protaginist, Cole Phelps, is a WWII veteran now serving for the LAPD. Every section of the game, you get a new partener who specializes in that type of section of cases to be solved. The game's map is just massive, of authentic late fourties LA streets which bring great details according to the time period. Every case is based mainly how much of the clues you've found during the case, as well the damage of you've caused to the city, but mainly the interrogation questions you had to ask and confirming their 3 types. If you like these type of games, I highly recommend L.A. Noire to you.			"

												This is a dark and controversial detective story taking place in L.A. of 1947. Everyone's a sinner in this game. It's very good at visually, musically and sometimes psychologically resembling the real Los Angeles of that time. The city consists of a couple of connected districts, from Hollywood to the central one. That is enough to make the game world huge. There are 95 types of cars from the most famous manufacturers, like Ford, GMC, Buick and Chevrolet. As for the gameplay, it feels like Mafia II combined with a groundbreaking police detective simulator inspired by well known crimes, such as The Black Dahlia murder. Among the innovations are the amazing facial animations never seen in videogames before. Unlike Mafia II, the game is mainly focused on looking for evidence, interviewing and interrogating people rather than gunfights. At the same time, nobody stops you from entering the Free Roam mode just to drive the cars, look around and prevent street crimes filled with action.			"

												For a game of this type it was relatively short.  But it didn't feel short, it felt like it dragged on and on for some reason. Can't say it was really boring, but it was repetative.  Why they couldn't have mixed the cases up a little more instead of doing the same same 5 or 6 murder investigations in a row.  Did a good job capturing the Time and Location it's set in.  Good Soundtrack. Likable characters, both good and bad for the most part.  Even the secondary characters you interview were good. Open world, but instead of playing like an open world it cut to a new ""level"" for each investigation. Entire game would have been better if the protagonist had either been a Private Eye, or if the game had fewer gun fights and car chases and more actual puzzles and investigations.  Interviews are sometimes unneccisarily difficult. Story jumps around alot.  Dramatic scenes that made no sense because there was no set up.  A single scene or few lines of dialog giving better context to the next part of the story arc would have made alot of the game more enjoyable.  in 30 hours of gameplay you wont necessarily remember someones signifigance  from a random unconnected scene from 25 hours ago.  Ending was garbage.  Overall like 6.5 out of 10.			"

												Despite the age of the game, the graphics are very well done. The facials (insert joke here) are movie like thanks to some special technology they implemented in this game. Being a ROCKSTAR game, many people purchased it thinking it would be a shortened GTA-like game. This is not what it is, although it does feel like it at times.Despite being classified as open world, there was a linear feel to the game. I truly don't understand the obsession many gamers have with ""open world"" (perhaps instead of a story, they want an escape from their miserable exsistences), but this linear story suited me just fine.  The game was more like a visual novel or interactive movie, which i enjoyed, but was also the #1 complaint many had about this game during discussions with friends. They craved more action. They wanted a GTA like experience.I found the game relaxing, THEN INTENSE, then slow, and i can see how many with attention deficit disorder (if you grew up in the 90's) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (the new excuse for the kids today) can't muster enough attention to read more than 148 characters at a time.The guides available thru steam are well written, fully detailed, and make difficult parts smoother when you had enough of scratching your head. They would let you get some drawn out achievements with ease provided you invest the time and attention span. Right now it's 70% off ($5.09 CND), and for that price it's a steal of a deal. Over all, i'd give this game a 8/10 and at its currently price, I'd stamp it with BigRig's cheap♥♥♥♥♥game buyer Stamp.			"

												The style of the game is perfect and the re-creation of 1940s LA is superbly done. It has revolutionised interactions with NPCs and emotional/character interactions in games. The driving is difficult to get used to, but it is worth it, if only to hear the music on the radio and the talk between your character and their partner. You do get fined for damage to property, injuries, and car damage, which I realised too late, and ended up with a very hefty fine. My advice would be to keep the speed down and stick to the middle of the road, because pedestrians have a habit of jumping in front of the car.			"

I click the launch button, a small window pops up saying the game is loading, the window goes away and nothing happens.I have tried many of the ""fixes"" that involve running the game AND steam in Admin mode, installing RockStar Social Club, I tried following the guide posted on Rockstar https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200149556--NET-C-DirectX-Nothing-happening-after-pressing-Launch-in-L-A-Noire-  but nothing works. I think I am going to install Windows 7 on an extra HD and see if I can get it to run. Anyone on Windows 7 have the same problem or is it only a happening on Windows 8 and 10?Im only voting it down because it cant run it ATM.

This game is simply amazing.First of all, i already got the game for two month. My friend bought me this game. Since he told me its by Rockstar Games i really wanted to try it. Some days ago i installed it and i realized its looks like Mafia 2. I mean the mood, the cars, the time. So i really like it, i just did 2 crime yet, but i really enjoyed them. Sometimes it can be very hard, at least in the begining it can be solved if you thinking, but later it will be much harder :D So, what i would like to say. If you like Mafia 2 or GTA this game made for you. May you need to solve chrimes and sometimes its seems boring, but its not. Really awesome game! Love you Rockstar!MUST PLAY!:)			"

												A WW2 game that doesn't involve WW2, you play the role of Cole Phelps. A cop who, by sheer luck, stumbles upon a gruesome murder, the first two of which have racism as the motive. Eventually becoming a detective, it becomes increasingly clear that the system is completely corrupt and it's up to your scientologist friend and fake german wife to save the world from psychology while you sort vice squad cases off on the side with a shotgun and cigar. Every cop you encounter is intentionally incompitent, and you eventually get to shoot them all when your space marine firebat friend takes to the caves to fight Charlie. Origami plays a major role in the game, making it the only game to involve folding paper into little swans important.Because it's California, drugs,♥♥♥♥♥♥on the railroad and arson by proxy cases usually lead to pedophillia and rifle stockpiles.Overall, a solid and unforgettable game, mostly because the villian doesn't do anything evil and never kills anyone.

												7/10The game is an adventure game with Rockstar trappings.You investigate crimes, follow leads, question witnesses, interrogate suspects, and occasionally subdue criminals with force.  The game has a wondeful ambiance, a great score, and very strong characters.Why not a better score than 7/10?  Three things cost it those three points for me:1) The ""GTA""-like elements feel out of place/unnecessary.  The game is 80% criminal investigation, 20% action (car-chases/shoot-outs/fist-fights).  The action bits feel ""tacked-on"" and are not fleshed out very well in comparison to the rest of the game.  Driving between locations feels largely pointless with very little to do between points-of-interest.2) The interrogation/questioning aspect can come off as a little strange at times. You might know that a suspect is lying, but it isn't always clear if you've got the correct piece of evidence to directly accuse them of lying. When you make a bad choice, you look like an idiot, but it doesn't change the outcome of the case for the most part. The story moves forward even if you bungle all the questioning/interrogating/evidence gathering parts.3) The ending sucks. It's abrupt and leaves a lot of loose ends. It feels like they ran out of time. I know that's my opinion, but I'm sure many other people feel the same.			"

												My 48 hours of play time was all on Windows 7 from earlier this year. I have since built myself a new computer with Windows 8.1 x64 and, as many reviews here state, the game doesn't launch. I tried running it in Windows 7 compatiblity mode - nothing. From the looks of it this problem has been around for years now and still no formal fix. That's pretty disgusting. This is such a great classic game. I feel terrible for people who never got a chance to play it and now never will if they're on a ""newer"" operating system. If you're on Windows 7 or earlier, I highly recommend the game. If you're in the majority of Windows users who have moved on to Windows 8/8.1 or Windows 10, don't bother. Rockstar has this same problem with GTA IV and they do nothing about it. Blows my mind. Don't they want people to continue buying their games even years later? Clearly it's too much trouble for a billion dollar company to support newer operating systems for older games. Good one you f*ck faces.Update: There is a patch that was installed where the game finally opens without crashing but, guess what, the performance is so bad it's truly unplayable unless you enjoy 12fps. I've tried every fix possible from the ""-npd"" command line, running it in DirectX9, choosing single thread, changing the resolution in game, creating a custom resolution, etc The menu seems to be capped at 24fps and in game it hovers around 28fps about twenty percent of the time - eighty percent of the time it's fluctuating between 12 - 25fps. I'm so sick of it. The best I can do is get the menu to go back to it's default 30fps cap but, once I'm in game, ithe performance is the same 18fps average. So unfair. Steam needs to put a disclaimer on the store page of this game that cleary states - If you have Windows 8/8.1 there are common issues still unresolved and to buy at your own risk.			"

												There is some really solid foundation here with the setting, stories, a city that actually feels alive and fleshed out.  Unfortunately it's plagued with sound issues, UI issues, mechanic issues, control issues, and gameplay issues that all add up to a really frustrating game that just feels like a letdown.  I was too irritated with all the problems and faults along the way to feel satisfied at the end of any given case.  Important text during important dialogue so you only get half of what you need is just poor design.  But the number one irritation is driving.  Driving across the whole blasted city over and over again with poor control of the car and a city full of fools that can't drive and a lack of streetlights in half the intersections.  And the driving has NO impact on the game other than there can be some flavor audio while you're struggling across town and you get fined for the inevitable damage to the car.  If you can actually get past all these issue and annoyances, then yes, it's an inovative game that differs from anything else I've ever seen.			"

This flaw was a constant reminder that I was trapped within the rules of the game. As ambitious as it tried to be, LA Noire can't deliver on it's promises of ""true detective work"". Maybe if they spent as much time and money on gameplay as they did on facial animation (which, I admit, is pretty epic...), I could understand the hype.			"

												So I'm kind of missing a middle option in terms of ratings here.While it's not a espacially good game. It isn't a bad game either.In terms of technical aspects. The graphics are nothing mind blowing by any stretch of the imagination, but they aren't bad either. There's a strict 30fps lock going on, which I couldn't find a quick fix to by googling (such as changing a line in some config file) So I just decided to suck it up and enjoy the ""console experience"".The gameplay:The investigating comes down to looking long enough for ""clues"" and interrogating people afterwards and deciding wether they area) lying (and you have proof in form of one of the clues you previously collected)b) lying (and you don't have proof, but are in fact just suspecting they are lying) - this option is confusingly labeled ""doubt""c) telling the truthThe rest of the gameplay comes down to some shooter-segments, some car chases. Neither of which are particualarly good.The Main positive about the game in my opinion is the Story, which I actually found pretty interesting. However the actual plot only develops very slowly during the beginning and middle of the playtime. The story gets more interesting towards the end when the plot thickens.Another Selling Point is the setting of post WW2 America in the late 40s, which isn't beeing explored in very many games. So If you think this sounds like a interesting setting just because it isn't such common theme in video games, then this might be something for you.So overall I said I don't recommend this game because there is no middle option, cause that is what this game has written all over it in my opinion. And I reserve the ""I recommend this game"" option for games that I think are actually worth recommending, such as the Witcher 3, Tomb Raider(The Reboot), or Bioshock Infinite,...This doesn't mean I think LA:Noire is bad, it's just not as good as those games which I just mentioned in my opinion.And it honestly feels kind of like a♥♥♥♥♥♥move to click the thumb down-button, because I know that people that don't read the review will just think I thought it was a bad game, when really I don't.

Not in order to use multiplayer (If it has it, I don't know.), but in order to start the game at all.  I already have an account on Steam, the service through which I bought the game.  I shouldn't be required to sign up for extra things every time I buy a game from a new company.  Otherwise what's the point in having a game client like steam.

												A truly unique game, executed well. Instead of playing as a dangerous criminal, you play as the good guy who is trying to solve crimes.This game takes place in 1940s LA. Rockstar managed to recreate the world well and it provides a unique atmosphere to the game. There's not going to be too many instances where you go around killing people with your gun, because this is supposed to be an investigation game, rather than a open world city sandbox game. The plot can be unpredictable, and keeps the player interested to continue the game. Graphics are quite nice, and the DLCs are also worth trying.However, the PC version is by flawed, too. The game seems to be poorly optimized for PC, as it has a 30fps lock and many people have a hard time running this game.Get it, if you can find a way around the 30fps lock and can fix the game with some mods.9/10			"

												Flawed gem that never really got the success it needed (and maybe even deserved).The gameplay itself swings between overly simplistic (finding clues) to somewhat obtuse and illogical (the way the interrogations are handled sounds great on paper, but simply don't hold together very well), and the driving and combat is perfunctory and servicable. Where the game really shines though is in the setting and story. You can really feel the love and attention that has gone into getting the feel of the time period right, and the details that really tie the story together.Is it cliche and perhaps a little predictable at times? Of course. But it's a love letter to a genre we don't see much of these days. It will make you want to dust of your LA Confidential DVD, and wear a sharp suit.			"

												L.A Noire is not the awesome crime investigation game it promised to be, but it is a good game overall.The face animations are outstanding, despite some exagerations here and there.The dialogs are for the most part engaging and believable.The crime scenes are detailed and interesting.However, there are no major branching paths in the story. Very rarely you can fail a investigation, when suspect interrogations fail, your superior scolds you and suddenly you repeat the dialog sequence all over again.I had extremely high expectations for this game, it didn't deliver completely, but it is an immersive game nonetheless.

												The story is decent, but the narrative is superb and one of the best ever. The game is a mix out of 3rd-person action and detective gameplay. Thankfully, the detective part is a lot bigger. You interview people, decide if they tell the truth or lie and prove that they are not telling the truth. It's a unique experience and, as I said before, one of the best. 1940s LA really feels authentic.			"

												In typical Rockstar/GTA-style, L.A. Noire puts you into the role of Detective Cole Phelps, a war hero who is now is fighting crimes at the police of Los Angeles in the early 1940s.During the game you join 5 different police divisions, each with their own field of activity: Patrol, Traffic, Homicide, Vice, Arson. Each division features 4 to 6 varying cases, which are - some more, some less - tied together. There is also a major backstory that runs like a thread through all divisions and cases.Detective work involves a lot of search for clues and interrogation which, thanks to the Motionscan technology, provides never before seen facial animations in the game to make it possible to tell apart whether or not your suspect is lying.A complete playthrough will take you, at the very least, 20 hours, however, if you inspect the crime scenes overly carefully and make use of all dialogue options, you can easily get 25, 30 or more hours of gameplay out of it, so it's well worth its money!

												Wow, what a game... first, let me say that I've always been interested in WWII and the post-war world in the United States.  This game combines all my interests into one package.  It is fascinating to just drive around and look at things (clothes, cars, shops, etc...) and see how they were in 1947.  The gameplay is also well done too, you basically wander around in L.A. and try to solve crimes by looking for clues and talking to people.  The lip-synching is fantastic, L.A. Noire could almost pass for an animated movie.  When questioning witnesses, you have to really look at their faces to see if they are lying or telling partial truths, it takes some practice but you'll get good at it with just a little time.  Think of this game as a time machine back to the late 1940's, it lets you experience the time period in a way that you could never do by just reading books or watching movies.  I was a little worried about the performance issues I'd read about but the game runs absolutely fine on my old dual core PC (with a few small additions in the launch options).  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about it... get it now and start playing, you won't regret it.			"

												L.A. Noire is an engrossing tale derived the famous City of Angels that has you playing the role of an L.A.P.D. detective.  It features a vast open-world environment set in 1947 just after the Second World War. The characters, level of detail and the mature setting draws you into the era and presents the player with a unique blend of third-person action and point-and-click adventure. You will be thrown into car chases, foot pursuits, shootouts, interviews and setup to investigate crime scenes where you must establish motive and means. L.A.  Noire is simply a must for gamers!			"

												Great story about post-WW2 Los Angeles, I love the setting. It is very interesting to play as a detective, looking for clues and reading people's facial expressions. The technology they used for realistic faces helps it a lot. On the other hand, shooting feels quite dull, I do not think there should have been that much of it. Also, driving is boring too, even though there's an open world, it just feels empty, and most of the time you will probably want to skip it.All in all, L.A. Noire is a very good game, definitely worth trying, especially if you like detective genre games.			"

												Highly recommend this game if you are into the whole detective games scene.. Firstly graphics are from 2011 but are really good for its time. The way you have to look at the persons face to tell if they are lying is amazing and also difficult at times, but its do-able. The music of this game is really well made if you are a jazz fan like myself. This game has a very interesting and captivating story which keeps you playing it. The dlc is worth getting as it adds more missions to the game and keeps you playing it longer, therefore the complete edition is worth the price. In my opinion it is worth the price, time playing it and worth listening to the music.Please remember if you disagree this is only my opinion of the game :)			"

												One of my favourite games.  Extremely well researched 1940s setting.  Occasionally things are phrased in very non-American ways owing to the game's Australian origin but besides that the setting is flawless.  Monroe's old-time Irish-American accent is lovely.  You won't hear that stuff from yanks these days (not to mention John Noble's fecking Australian; brilliant).The game itself is mostly flawless detective work, with some nice car chases and shootouts but most of it's nigh-perfect detective work.One of my favourite things about the game is the fact that it's obvious every single section was tweaked after applying the initial foundational mechanics.  You can tell they cared.And the story is fantastic.			"

												If you can make your computer handle it, which mine could not until they patched in single-threaded rendering, then you are in for one hell of a treat.  This console-only gem (for years) haunted me because my Xbox friends could play an actual CSI game where you do actual crimesolving based on your own individual intuitions.  Watch lots of Cop TV before going in; it will help with the interrogations, where the only thing you have to judge the truth is the answers to the questions you pose as an officer.  Nobody else has pulled off a real ""CSI"" game without makiing it into a click-and-point adventure game; this is NOT that game.  You'll find yourself beating people up, solving puzzle-like crimes with rational logic, and getting into gunfights and car chases, so I suppose it's a little more ""Miami"" than CSI.			"

												I cannot recommend L.A. Noire as L.A. Noire is:1. Currently broken, although there is a fix. Here's a link: https://steamcommunity.com/app/110800/discussions/0/366298942102103678/2. Locked at 30fps with no easy work around to get even 60fps working (even though it strangely supports many resolutions and monitors natively, including my 144hz 1080p monitor).3. Has stuttering issues that are quite hard to remove.4. Has way too much added loading time due to the terrible Rockstar Social Club functionality.5. Has troubles running in Windows 10.6. Not a huge deal, but only supports DirectX 9 and 11, but not 10 (I don't mind it not supporting 12 yet).Technical issues aside and my distaste for 30fps 3D open world games (they give me motion sickness), is a fantastic game. I played it a considerable amount of time on consoles, and enjoyed it thoroughly.If you like tinkering games and spending a considerable amount of time making this game playable, then I would definitely consider that, but for the average consumer, avoid this game.Compared to when I bought this game in the beginning of 2014 and ran it reasonably well at slightly above 720p on my weak laptop without a graphics card compared to running it on my mid-end desktop now with all the post-patch issues, this is just flat unacceptable Rockstar!How and why would a studio knowingly make a functional game unfunctionable, and then do nothing to fix it? It makes no sense.Until or unless Rockstar Games fixing the issues with this game (namely points 1 and 3), nearly everyone should just avoid this title. If you really want to play this title without the hassle, just buy it on consoles.			"

Set in a convincing depiction of Los Angeles in 1947 , it casts you as Cole Phelps, returning war hero turned cop.L.A.

												Why is this listed as a strategy game? It's a mystery adventure with open world elements and a bit of gunplay. If you're into crime thrillers and things of that nature then chances are you'll like the narrative as much as I do. It's really the best part of the game other than the mo-cap animations. The biggest flaw in the game is the logic you will have to follow in order to perfectly complete each case. Some trains of thought are simple to understand, some will leave you lost. Related to that is the system where you have to interview people of interest and determine if they're honest, lying or just leaving out some details. If you're unfamiliar with body habits in regards to lying (rockstar has the insight to base it on real science lol), it might be hard to get the right answer. But it's a good game and you'll get maybe 20-30 hours out of a playthrough depending if you get the complete edition. That comes with a handful of DLC cases, and most of them are pretty interesting and offer a way to flesh out certain characters more.			"

This feels very real and exciting, and I don't think there has been another game similar to it. Definitely 10 out of 10.			"

This game represents a breakthrough in a certain type of realism in a 3D game - a truly realistic, largely seamless translation of actors' faces into the virtual environment. The main gameplay element is reading other people to a degree that requires attention to their faces, achieving a new level of immersion worth experiencing. The rest of the game is also very well made. A few graphical deficiencies can be overlooked. The game seems to run fairly well for a console port.			"

												Flawed gem that never really got the success it needed (and maybe even deserved).The gameplay itself swings between overly simplistic (finding clues) to somewhat obtuse and illogical (the way the interrogations are handled sounds great on paper, but simply don't hold together very well), and the driving and combat is perfunctory and servicable. Where the game really shines though is in the setting and story. You can really feel the love and attention that has gone into getting the feel of the time period right, and the details that really tie the story together.Is it cliche and perhaps a little predictable at times? Of course. But it's a love letter to a genre we don't see much of these days. It will make you want to dust of your LA Confidential DVD, and wear a sharp suit.			"

												L.A. Noire es un juego especial, este juego está hecho para cierto tipo de gamers, particularmente me gustó, el problema de L.A. Noire es que si lo tuyo no es 'hacerla de Sherlock' te podría aburrir, además de que sufre un gran problema de optimización, simplemente este juego no va como deberia andar... El juego trata sobre resolver casos, eso es basicamente el juego, asi como resolver misiones secundarias donde atrapas a los villanos en acción, es un juego muy repetitvo, por eso digo que si esto no es lo tuyo, seguramente L.A. Noire no es para ti, le doy 8/10			"

												L.A. Noire is a great game, has a great storyline and it's so good that after i got all trophies for PS3 back in 2011, i bought it on sale today. I recommend L.A. Noire to everybody that likes Strategy games mixed with action.10/10 in my book.			"

												Wow, what a game... first, let me say that I've always been interested in WWII and the post-war world in the United States.  This game combines all my interests into one package.  It is fascinating to just drive around and look at things (clothes, cars, shops, etc...) and see how they were in 1947.  The gameplay is also well done too, you basically wander around in L.A. and try to solve crimes by looking for clues and talking to people.  The lip-synching is fantastic, L.A. Noire could almost pass for an animated movie.  When questioning witnesses, you have to really look at their faces to see if they are lying or telling partial truths, it takes some practice but you'll get good at it with just a little time.  Think of this game as a time machine back to the late 1940's, it lets you experience the time period in a way that you could never do by just reading books or watching movies.  I was a little worried about the performance issues I'd read about but the game runs absolutely fine on my old dual core PC (with a few small additions in the launch options).  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about it... get it now and start playing, you won't regret it.			"

												Great story about post-WW2 Los Angeles, I love the setting. It is very interesting to play as a detective, looking for clues and reading people's facial expressions. The technology they used for realistic faces helps it a lot. On the other hand, shooting feels quite dull, I do not think there should have been that much of it. Also, driving is boring too, even though there's an open world, it just feels empty, and most of the time you will probably want to skip it.All in all, L.A. Noire is a very good game, definitely worth trying, especially if you like detective genre games.			"

												I'm currently in the middle of the game, as a homicide detective. As I don't want to provide spoilers, I'll try to be brief. At first I thought that the crime or chapters of the homicide cases were poorly written because although some of the clues pointed out to the ""person of interest"" being the criminal, even though not everything fit into place. After playing through the chapters a few more times, I thought maybe it was just the developer's way of portraying the LAPD in the 1940's and their focus on convicting a suspect instead of actually finding out who did it and delivering justice; justice however is relative to the person dishing it out and the person receiving it. It could also be that all the cases lead up to a true mastermind framing everybody else, so that is something to look forward to. Overall, the gameplay is pretty enjoyable in the sense that it is quite similar to GTA. So if you're a GTA or mystery fan, and you are also interested in playing the role of the cop instead of the role of a robber, I would highly recommend this.			"

I don't give up that fast, but after hours I am fed up.So Game is a lot of fun if you're able to launch it.Think I switch to the PS Version of my husband even though I like the PC Version better.Thanks for nothing :(			"

												Игра, которая на первый взгляд казалась очередным клоном GTA, Mafia и прочих, оказалась очень и очень приятным сюрпризом. Плюсы:1) Геймплей. Сцены расследования и вдумчивого поиска улик вовремя сменяются погонями и перестрелками, и наоборот. Ни от того, ни от другого заскучать не успеваешь.2) Графика. Дело даже не самой графике, которую я на 100% не оценил из-за не слишком сильного железа, а в лицевой анимации. Персонажи проговаривают каждое слово, эмоции переданы очень и очень достоверно. Впервые вижу такой высокий уровень исполнения.3) Миссии. Они всегда увлекательные и интересные, со своей предысторией. За кровавым убийством обязательно скрывается драма, бармен не хочет выкладывать на-гора всю информацию, похищение оказывается следствием кризиса между супругами, а плохой парень в итоге оказывается хорошим. Даже побочные квесты, которые можно принимать при движении по городу, не повторяются, и их действительно интересно проходить. В этом отношении Rockstar, как всегда, не подкачали.4) Музыка. И та, что играет на радио, и та, что звучит во время расследований - уместно, атмосферно, выполнено на высоком уровне.Минусы:1) Первый и главный минус - Rockstar Games Social Club. Отвратительное дeрьмо, которое постоянно забывает мой пароль, лагает, просит зайти снова, в общем, всячески мешает играть. Если бы можно было приступить к игре, не заморачиваясь с регистрацией, стало бы только лучше.2) Еще один минус, менее существенный, но все же заметный - открытый мир. Песочница тут довольно-таки безжизненная, но основная проблема не в этом, а в том, что открытый мир тут не играет никакой роли, мы бы запросто могли обойтись и без него, автоматически перемещаясь по локациям, связанным с текущим расследованием. Местный сендбокс не делает ничего, помимо растягивания геймплея ненужными поездками из точки А в точку Б. Вспоминается старая добрая Mafia, в которой перед каждой миссией нужно катить через весь чертов город на убитом драндулете.3) Излишняя казуальность. Потратив так называемые очки интуиции, вы можете узнать правильную реплику при допросе или увидеть расположение всех (!) улик на месте преступления. Это ломает геймплей, связанный с расследованием.Итог: очень интересный эксперимент от Rockstar, не лишенный недостатков, но определенно стоящий того, чтобы ознакомиться с ним. 7/10 только лишь за отвратный RGSC.

												Top Tip: to fast travel to any location select it on your map and then hold e until your character gets into a car and then it fades to black.  This is very important as LA Noire is approx 8 square miles and it does take some time to drive from one side to the other.  The game is fun, but it has a few issues.  As a console port the game is fixed at 30fps.  This is due in part to the special technology used to graphically capture actors’ face expressions.  The biggest problem that I have with the system is it sometimes sticks me at 25 FPS despite having a GTX 980 and plenty of headroom.  Overall, the graphics look pretty good and are satisfactory as long as it keeps running at 30fps. The gameplay is good too.  The cars drive well; the gunplay is fun, I wish there was more of it.  The detective questioning can be aggravating.  If you challenge a witness’ statement as a lie you must present some evidence to prove it, sometimes there are multiple pieces of evidence that indicate they are lying but choosing the wrong one results in a failed question. When interrogating two suspects you may be forced to charge someone who you don’t think is guilty just because you failed one interrogation.  The last issue is that if you suspect someone of being the criminal you cannot actually go after them unless it is scripted in the story.  I have mixed feelings about the plot, they make Phelps do some very uncharacteristic things to progress the story and bring everything together.  However, the scams that the local government and business owners put together is interesting and clever.  Overall, I am not much of a fan of detective stories, shows, etc; but this game is fun and if they come out with a second one I will pick it up.     "

Posted: May 19, 2015
												Spent 45 hours playing this and in the end, can't really recommend it. I think the concept is pretty cool and I really wanted to like it, but it has several major flaws:1) Boring - this game is just boring. It's like a very long movie in slow motion. You can't fast forward the cut scenes so everything is very slow paced. The game does not evolve from the first mission, you don't get more skills so it is all the same over and over. Talk to some people, chase down a suspect (which you are scripted to never catch), shoot some bad dudes, repeat.2) Bad conversation system - in conversations you can choose Truth/Doubt/Lie, the problem is that it is a crap shoot which one to pick. You are supposed to hear the voice and look at the animated face to determine if they are lying. That is all fine, but even if they are lying, you need to choose between Doubt/Lie, and if they are telling the truth it is still Doubt/Truth, it's whatever random choice the programmers decided is the correct answer. To elaborate, someone can be telling the truth, but if you don't think they are telling enough of a truth (not enough details) you are supposed to pick Doubt. That leads to save scumming/using a walkthrough since the system is so ridiculous. 3) Laughable story - most of the non-DLC missions are connected by a main story. It is too bad you can see the big story from a mile away. Even worse is that even though you can tell what is going on, you repeatedly arrest innocent people because you have to. In about half of the cases - I repeat, in HALF OF THE CASES - you have no option to actually arrest the true criminal. Best case is that you choose between two innocent people. You are hailed as the best detective in the LAPD - yeah ok.It isn't all bad, the game is beautiful and the voice acting is great. Issue is that the key systems don't work and the game is boring. If they had ditched the main story, actually let you catch true criminals and made it into a 10  hour game, then maybe it would have been better. One of the very few times where less would have been better.4/10			"

Posted: January 11, 2016
												By the time I am writing this review, I have not yet finished the game, but I am 10 hours in and would like to share my opinion and impressions, which hopefully will help you to decide whether you should get this game. First of all, I'll start with the positive things: - The vibe and atmosphere/Setting: They did an AWESOME job at setting up the right setting and getting into the spirit of LA in 1947, at least IMO. I do like this period a lot, and the look of the game (if you like, you can play this in b/w as well), the music/radio broadcasts (unfortunately, no way to switch radio stations manually, apparently. No custom music either, but then again, listening to modern music in the car would kinda ruin the immersion), the cars, fashion, lingo etc... just GREAT. Also, since this is based on old thrillers and stories by guys like Raymond Chandler, they went for that vibe, and did it VERY well... this does feel a lot like a that noire crime fiction Chandler was famous for. - The general idea is very cool and, IMO, refreshing - interrogating people and, based on the clues you found and their facial expressions (done with actors and motion capture) figuring out whether they're lying or not... great job there! The IGN review says that sometimes, it is too easy to tell when someone is telling a lie or getting nervous - but doesn't that add even more realism? After all, not everyone is a good liar irl!- The gameplay. The cars DO feel a bit... odd, chases can get a tiny bit frustrating, the shooting mechanics are far from perfect, but between examining crime scenes, searching for clues, interrogating witnesses and suspects, using your notebook to find clues, car chases, shootouts and some interludes to deepen the story, there is some variety.- The characters. I really like the main protagonist, and some of his fellow policemen. Sure, there is quite a bit of clichè to be found here, but that again fits well, as this is a tribute to the noire-genre, which never was deep literature anyway. Now for the less than positive or even negative parts:- On rails. To a certain degree, the game takes away your freedom. An example: In one case, I apparently missed a clue at one of the places I visited. I was doing interrogations at the police station, and was not able to go back to those places and pick up the thing I missed, which would have made solving the case easier and unlocked some additional questions/accusations. - Evidence. Basically, if you think a person is not telling the truth, you wanna choose ""doubt"". If you pick ""lie"", you have to prove the person is a liar with a piece of evidence/clue from your notebook. And sometimes that doesn't work right. Not a bug, it's the writing. The abbreviated details of the clue or piece of evidence might make you think that it is clear evidence the guy is a liar, but when you choose it, the game says it's wrong or not enough. - Some frame rate issues. This game is by no means recent. I don't have a killer gaming pc (i7, 16 gigs of ram, Nvidia GTX 960 with 4 GB of ram), but I would think that it should be able to run this game well... and still, there are frame rate issues, the game sometimes slows down. Odd, when games like Unity, Mad Max, GTA V, Witcher III or even Arkham Knight perform much better on my system. YMMV. - Repetition. Sometimes, the cases are TOO alike, or at least the procedure you do is. There is a bigger storyline with a certain series of murders, and at one point, it was like ""OK, another murder like those other ones. Check for clues. Interrogate. Visit a bar. Visit another place. Interrogate. Done"". Of course, those steps should be part of it in a crime/police-game, but I think there should have been more variety in the cases or the activities that are involved in them. I did enjoy the homicide cases (after the first or second promotion), but didn't enjoy the drug-related cases I was given after my next promotion- Mechanics. As I said, driving feels...wonky. Mind you, you are not driving a very recent sports car or something like that, but the controls feel a bit clunky sometimes, and so do the physics. I did play the game with an Xbox controller. Verdict: The idea was refreshing, and they really nailed it with the setting and vibe. Unfortunately, there are flaws to the whole Lie/truth/doubt/clues/notebook-system. Sometimes it's misleading, not elaborate enough, and sometimes it's too much ""on rails"". However, the story, vibe and the idea itself are great, and even though it's not perfect, I'd give this a 7.5/10. I got this while it was on sale and do not regret it at all, I do enjoy the game. Check out some gameplay videos maybe, and if you can get it on sale and dig crime/police-games and the era this is set in, check it out!			"

Сцены расследования и вдумчивого поиска улик вовремя сменяются погонями и перестрелками, и наоборот. Ни от того, ни от другого заскучать не успеваешь.2) Графика. Дело даже не самой графике, которую я на 100% не оценил из-за не слишком сильного железа, а в лицевой анимации. Персонажи проговаривают каждое слово, эмоции переданы очень и очень достоверно. Впервые вижу такой высокий уровень исполнения.3) Миссии. Они всегда увлекательные и интересные, со своей предысторией. За кровавым убийством обязательно скрывается драма, бармен не хочет выкладывать на-гора всю информацию, похищение оказывается следствием кризиса между супругами, а плохой парень в итоге оказывается хорошим. Даже побочные квесты, которые можно принимать при движении по городу, не повторяются, и их действительно интересно проходить. В этом отношении Rockstar, как всегда, не подкачали.4) Музыка. И та, что играет на радио, и та, что звучит во время расследований - уместно, атмосферно, выполнено на высоком уровне.Минусы:1) Первый и главный минус - Rockstar Games Social Club. Отвратительное дeрьмо, которое постоянно забывает мой пароль, лагает, просит зайти снова, в общем, всячески мешает играть. Если бы можно было приступить к игре, не заморачиваясь с регистрацией, стало бы только лучше.2) Еще один минус, менее существенный, но все же заметный - открытый мир. Песочница тут довольно-таки безжизненная, но основная проблема не в этом, а в том, что открытый мир тут не играет никакой роли, мы бы запросто могли обойтись и без него, автоматически перемещаясь по локациям, связанным с текущим расследованием. Местный сендбокс не делает ничего, помимо растягивания геймплея ненужными поездками из точки А в точку Б. Вспоминается старая добрая Mafia, в которой перед каждой миссией нужно катить через весь чертов город на убитом драндулете.3) Излишняя казуальность. Потратив так называемые очки интуиции, вы можете узнать правильную реплику при допросе или увидеть расположение всех (!) улик на месте преступления. Это ломает геймплей, связанный с расследованием.Итог: очень интересный эксперимент от Rockstar, не лишенный недостатков, но определенно стоящий того, чтобы ознакомиться с ним. 7/10 только лишь за отвратный RGSC.

												This is a comically enjoyable game, especially when you factor in all the mad-men cameos the shockingly good voice acting and the attention to detail. the interrogations are a bit hit or miss, but it's an intriguing title even if half the clues result in the same ""maybe, if... no.""

												This was only the second game on the Xbox 360 that I got 100% of the achievements for (Oblivion being the 1st).  This is still one of my favorite games.  I've been keeping an eye on the PC version for a while and finally scored a great sale during Christmas 2013.  It was awesome picking this back up after years of having it beaten on the Xbox.  The PC version looks much better and it works flawlessly with the Microsoft controller for WIndows.LA Noire uses the RockStar Social Club.  It is not required, but it is handy to use the club's stats pages to check your game progress if you are shooting for 100% completion.  I found it easier to create a R* account via their website before going into game.  The Social Club still has my 360 stats as well as my new PC stats.It is a shame that the developer studio was closed down years ago.  Hopefully R* will find another developer to make a sequel to this awesoms game.			"

												All in all a very atmospheric game, which allows one to submerge himself into post-war LA.Minuses are: - very weak in certain plot areas, which leave one wandering about the imbecility of the police portrayed, as well as the impossible prowess of the culprit in planting evidence at just the right moment (Homicide squad cases);- there is no way to disarm an armed opponent, even if you shoot his weapon hand (which is perfectly possible due to the good aiming system), you can only shoot to kill. not a very police-like attitude.- most cases follow a similar structure, which is theoretically hidden by their actual storyline, but can still feel like repeating routine procedures. Could count as a bonus on portraying police-work correctly though.Despite this, in my opinion, a very worthwhile game, solid 8/10 from me.			"

												More of a movie than a game, L.A. Noire puts you into an intriguing backdrop and lets you run wild in a world of Vice, Drugs and Crime. In addition, the technology harnessed to make social interaction all that much better is truly satisfying even if some of the dialogue is a bit cheezy. Good game.			"

												Story - I should start off this review by saying I am totally biased in favor of this game and it is my favorite game in my library at the time of writing.  I love the setting of the 1940's and especially the noir and detective aspects.  This game is the closest you will get to playing L.A. Confidential: The Video Game.  I found the story and even the individual cases to be very engrossing and they feel like actual crimes that could have been committed.  I love a video game with a great story above all else and this one totally delivers on that.  All of the characters feel very real and have more depth than in other Rockstar games.  Cole Phelps, the protagonist, at first seems like a squeaky clean detective, but as the story goes on, that changes and you become very engrossed in him as a character.  When you add a deep and perplexing murder myster to that, I was hooked.  There are even real historical characters (gangsters like Bugsy Siegel) in the game and scientology makes an appearance (in an interesting way) too.Gameplay - You assume the role of Detective Cole Phelps and investigate crimes, interrogate suspects, tail suspects, and sometimes get in shoot outs and fist fights.  I really like the way L.A. Noire handles investigations.  You have to find clues at the crime scenes by picking up and examining objects.  When you find suspects, you can interview them and respond in three ways (truth, doubt, or lying) depending on what they say.  This is probably the most challenging part of the game because unless you're very good, it can be hard to know whether to doubt or call the suspect a liar.  You can and will arrest the wrong person if you get too many questions wrong or don't find all the evidence.  Fortunately, there are plenty of guides out there to help you if you are worried about getting it wrong.  In total, the game has somewhere between 20-30 cases and it took me around 30 hours to get through them all.  I never got tired of playing L.A. Noire and would have played many more cases if I could.A lot of the other game play is really similar to Grand Theft Auto.  Driving is arcadey in a good way and shooting is cover based and pretty fun too.  While you spend more time investigating in missions than doing shooting and car chases, the game also offers street crimes which are often foot or car chases with a shoot out or a fist fight thrown in.  These aren't necessary to beat the game but they are fun and were a nice addition.  Presentation (Graphics and Sound) - The graphics in L.A. Noire are both dated and incredibly impressive at the same time.  I'm pretty sure this game uses a version of the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine and while the graphics are solid, they do look like a PS3 game and if you have a good gaming pc, you can certainly find games that look better.  What makes this game great though is the acting and animation of the characters.  L.A. Noire uses a newer animation system that captured the way the voice actors looked and acted when delivering the lines.  This makes it possible to see when someone is lying and it also makes the characters look really distinct and believable.  I hope we'll see more games use this technology in the future.  In addition, the makers of this game put an incredible amount of detail into replicating the Los Angeles of the 1940's.  The city looks and feels real.  There is so much detail and nothing feels recycled when you drive around. The sound is excellent from the voice acting to the authentic music on your car radio when you drive around.  I love the theme song for this game and think it sets the mood for the game better than almost any other I've seen.  Overall - As I said at the beginning, I truly love this game.  From the story to the realism to the satisfying game play, I think L.A. Noire has it all.  If you don't care about these things, especially a great story then it is very possible you will like this game a lot less than I do or lose interest in it before beating it.  I've certainly heard people say that they felt this way and I think this is just one of those games that some people will really love and others will just find to be pretty good.  However, if my review sounds appealing to you, this game is one of Rockstar's best and that is really saying something.As far as achievements go, this game is very easy to get a high percentage on by playing through the game once and trying to grab achievements as you go.  You will want to find a good guide for getting five stars on every case and for making sure to use all the weapons in the game or you will have to repeat parts of the game.  The one that kept me from trying to get them all is an achievement that makes you drive every car in the game.  There isn't an easy to find all of these cars and you almost need some luck to get them all.  That one is a bit of a bummer but I would still say that compared to other games, L.A. Noire has more reasonable achievements, especially if you can live with getting 90% or so of them.9.5 (out of 10)			"

												A little bit of action, a little bit of driving, a little bit of shooting but like 80-90% of the game is similar to watching a well-directed detective drama. Or rather being a part of it. As the game becomes a bit repetitive and linear, you're getting a pivot. And then it's like the game plays you...up to the very end. Love this feeling.You know, I've installed Windows on my Mac just to play it. Well worth!			"

												On consoles this game is great. On pc it is poorly optimized. I can't use my controller to play because starting the game with it plugged in causes the camera to constantly rotate for no reason even after turnin off auto camera. The 30 fps lock was a bad idea. I understand that the purpose of it is to have the animations work as they are supposed to but it should be an option, not required. After gaming on a Pc anything lower than 40 fps starts to hurt my eyes after some time. I have a gtx 970 and the game sometimes drops to 25 frames and looks miserable. I do love this game though. The thought put behind each case was well done and overall its a pretty good game for its time. Minor adjustments to the Pc version could have made this game great.			"

												For all it's flaws, I loved L.A. Noire.The port, first off, is woeful. After you've contended with Rockstar Social Club updating and generally being a nuisance, the fight is getting the game looking pretty while keeping the framerate consistent. I played the whole thing through at the locked-in 30fps, and had a fine time.For it's time, this is a beautiful, innovative game. The facial models make characters readable and relatable, and the generally minimalist nature of the game - few HUD features popping in or out, heavy reliance on sound rather than visual signposting - allows the game to unfold like a dense TV series rather than a videogame. The atmosphere is exceptional, and period music and vehicles only add to that.The story is good, although it wanes towards the end. The same goes for the gameplay - it is fun, unique, and rewarding, but also blows its wad off the bat: by the endgame, you're doing the same things you were at the very start.Even still, a fantastic single-player experience.

												Set in the 1950s Los Angeles and in the aftermath of World War II, Team Bondi conceived an amazing game that balances between cinematography and mystery-solving. This game require intuition and patience as the gameplay focuses mainly on collecting clues & evidences and judging suspect’s statements.The storyline mainly focuses on Cole Phelps, a dishonored World War II veteran and an ambitious yet intuitive LAPD detective. Cole Phelps started as a simple patrolman, but with time, he showed initiative and solved his first murder case, and gained his Captain’s attention. Not long, he got promoted to the Traffic Desk solving more cases, and cases after cases he is now a member of the infamous Vice squad.You will also briefly follow the footsteps of Jack Kelso, Phelps' old friend and arson investigator. Near the end of the game, you will be contacted and hired to investigate a house fire, but along the way, you will uncover the dark intentions of a certain building contractor, and offered a new job as the DA's investigator.The gameplay is based on ""Cases"", but most people would call them ""Missions"". Here, you will be taken to Cole Phelps' consciousness and try to solve said cases with your partner. You will start in the briefing room, the Captain will give you a new case, and you will have to drive to the crime scene, search for clues, question or interrogate suspects and witnesses, fight and occasionaly kill uncooperative suspects, and calling R&I. Your standard issue notebook contains all informations regarding to the case, and Detective Phelps will write down new clues and persons of interest. Each actions will result in a different outcome of the case (You arrested the wrong person, the true suspect escaped, etc.) but said outcomes will result only but slightly to the next case dialogue, unfortunately.The action sequences include on-foot pursuits, vehicle pursuits, fist-fights, and shootouts. Amidst the cases, you can respond to street crimes. (robbery, shootouts, etc.) The interrogation sequence is unique. When intercepted with a dispute, you will be given three options, which is Truth, Doubt, and Lie. The first two options are pretty self-explanatory, but the third option, to prove that someone is lying, you must present adequate evidence regarding his/her statement. You can also judge the P.O.I's statement by carefully watching their facial cues. (Some suspects are far more resilient than others though).If you have completed a ""Desk"" or even all cases available, and if you are bored, you can select ""The Streets Of L.A."" which is a free-roam mode for you to collect gold film reels, collect cars, respond to street crimes, or just simply sightseeing.The storyline also features flashbacks of Cole's war-time adventures, and these flashbacks will cross paths with the main storyline and the ending would place the final piece of the puzzle.An amazing game of its time.Ten out of ten.

												Not a very good pc port but god is this game amazing. I really loved the hell out of it even though there was a lot of missed potential. I liked the main character Cole Phelps a lot but plenty of people were mixed on him and I understand why, he should have been characterized a bit more. They hardly show his personal life and they mainly follow him when he's on the job and not when he's at home with his family. There also should've been more to do in the open world and the ending was kinda rushed. I'd give it a 9 out of 10 but I really want to give it a 10 because of how unique and polished the game felt but the lack of characterization for certain characters and a lack of open world side content brings it down a bit. Really recommend it, it's one of my all time favorites.			"

I do highly recommened a guide when you take on the investigations though as some entire story arcs depends on a SINGLE question being asked in a certain way. Visually nice, not modern though anymore. Good voice acting. Great driving, acceptable gun play. Basically a GTA title if GTA had more self respect, meaning not EVERYONE in LA Noire is a scumbag.

												A lot of people don't like this game on pc because of ""bad porting"" and while i agree there are some really minor things that could have been changed, it doesnt change the gameplayI've played this on two different consoles and i like it for pc the best (loading times are super fast and im not sure why but i appreciate games more when my face is 6 inches from the screen)the story is hella good and EXCITING and the game lasts a long time!!! especially with the dlc so i think its worth the moneybe warned that when you first start the game you may have some lag/fps issues even though your computer meets the requirements but there is an extremely easy fix that literally takes 1 second to do (you just copy and paste a short code into a box on the launcher)the map of la in the game is really cool too its really big and you can walk around the city and steal peoples cars and not get in trouble its cooland you dont have to just do the main story line either, there are lil street missions to dothis is probably one of my favorite games and i reccomend it to u, friend			"

												A masterpiece falling short.Had a long think about this review. The technology is nothing short of breathtaking and well worth it as a tour de force of what great tech can add to a game.The gameplay feature of reading the charactors tells is, i think, a great inovation and also, a difficult whip to crack. It can feel a little lopsided as some of the acting i over egged and thus paints the conversion as somewhat bipolar. Although this could of been negated by yet more acting, I can understand that the complexity of such would of either burnt out the actors or moved the game into a different year for completion. I've heard of the heartache associated with the production of the game and can understand why. Its easy to dismiss when coming from a place of ignorance with some of those slight bugs but when looked at as a whole, the game broke some ground, not only in gameplay but technology aswell, not to mention tying them together. I applaud the huge undertaking this game was. One thing that was a little underwhelming though.....the driving... its not a driving game as we already know, its really a detective game but the driving elements, for me, could of been more fun with you being driven around rather than do the driving. I like driving games but when the driving is profuctory rather than part of the game, its best left out. Would of really enjoyed being driven around and take in the sights, scouting for suspects etc....perhaps have a little gun fight along the way etc. I think that would of lended better to a detective game than a sort of limited driving sim with lowend mechanics. Last thoughts, although the main portion of development missed the driving aspects its understandable when you have such attention paid to a rather breathtaking level of charactor detail and nuance.

												L.A Noire is a game set in Los Angeles after World War II, during the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"". You play as Cole Phelps, a detective who must work his way through the LAPD, solving cases and making arrests. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I sincerely congratulate Rockstar on their fine work.Firstly, it should be known that the voicework and character animations in this game are fantastic; without this, the game wouldn't work half as well as it did. The characters move and interact seamlessly, due to the innovative use of motion capture technology. During interviews, the player has to read into facial expressions and determine whether a suspect is lying or telling the truth. Due to the impressive animations on display, you can read every eye twitch, uneasy posture and downward glance. These interview sections are the highlight of the game, and it was genuinely entertaining to complete them using evidence and intuition.The basic game mechanics function just like any other Rockstar game; a large (beautifully made) open world, in this case, the grime and glamour of 1950's Los Angeles. You can roam the city on foot or in a vehicle, resolving street crime cases and responding to pleas for police intervention. During a case, you'll often have to travel around the city to meet suspects and other characters, so you'll easily notice the size and attention to detail put into the open world. Additionally, during a case you have to analyse different pieces of evidence, and you'll quickly learn how to integrate these pieces of evidence into the case. It was truly immersive to act like a proper detective, and fans of old crime shows will be delighted here.Without giving anything away, the story is quite investing, and you'll find yourself truly interested in Cole Phelps' story. I don't want to spoil anything, but Rockstar really knows how to make a decent narrative.The only flaw with this game is the horrible optimisation for PC; the graphics are high quality and very consistent, but the port is not well optimised at all. I can barely maintain an acceptable framerate throughout the game, but I persisted due to the quality of the game content. This may be my own error due to using an AMDD Graphics card.Overall, L.A Noire is a highly worthwhile and entertaining experience. The immersive story and gameplay really held me right to the end, but the poor optimisation is the only thing holding this game back from a 10. Well crafted, and I'd love to see a sequel to this one. 9.5 / 10			"

												What an incredible game. Been playing for 30 hours now and haven't finished it yet. Still have a couple of cases to go and some street crimes.Edit: Finished the game 100% and managed to get every achievement. Loved every minute of it.When you first play the game, the story might go a bit slow, but it doesn't take long before you get sucked into the whole story and drama. For those who are looking for some kind of shooter and/or action game, you've come to the wrong place. L.A. Noire is a detective game and meanwhile there are moments you end up in a gunfight or a car chase, basically the game is about finding every clue and correctly interrogate every suspect. This is what makes the game so much fun and unique. It's something I've never experienced before.And not just that. Every case just gets more and more interesting. Heck, some of them are even close to disturbing. L.A. Noire isn't afraid to hold back.Another thing I love in this game is that the music really helps you. Like when you are walking around on a crimescene, looking for clues, just listen to the music. It will give you a hint where to find things. Same goes for the interrogations. The music (or more like a jingle) will let you know if you, for example, correctly accused someone of lying. Of course, when you do the latter, you have to make sure you have the right evidence to back up your accusation, which is another thing what makes L.A. Noire so much fun.The whole atmosphere of the game is nicely done as well. L.A. Noire takes places in the 1940's and (like the title already suggests) in Los Angeles. I really enjoyed roaming the streets in those wonderful cars (and I'm not even a car-fan!). Roaming the streets (of even just going to the next location for your case) can be dangerous though. One of the things I really, really disliked where all those other people ingame, on the streets. The traffic is horrible, cars just run into you or stop right in front of you for no reason. And sometimes it doesn't even help to turn on the sirens. Some people even JUMP right in front of your car. So yeah, driving around in L.A. Noire can be very frustrating.Another thing I had to get used to were the graphics. They aren't bad, but they aren't very lovely either. At first it kind of had this cardboard-feeling. And it took me a while to get used to the faces, in the beginning I just kept thinking ""what is going on with their mouths?"". But, it turned out that the way the creators of L.A. Noire used expressions on the faces worked very well. The faces are very expressive and can really help you out during interrogations.Overall L.A. Noire is a really great game, which I have enjoyed so very much (and still am!). It's been a while since I've been so enthousiastic about a game. I definitely recommend this game.Pros:Strong storyAll the casesInterrogation systemAtmosphereMusicGreat main character, very likableFacial expressionsThe carsCons:TrafficTrafficTRAFFIC (especially pedestrians)Moving, sometimes you get stuck "

												I'd forgotten how much of an immersive and distinctive storytelling experience L.A. Noire is in the four years since I completed it on the Xbox 360. It's essentially a hardboiled detective novel brought to life in a highly cinematic gaming experience. I just picked up the complete edition on sale for dirt cheap, and before I knew it, I was spellbound and had spent the entire evening playing it for several hours straight in a single sitting. As the minutes turned into hours, I found myself once again drawn into the game's shadowy world of vice, corruption, and murder that brilliantly captures the atmosphere of 1950s Los Angeles in a medium it had never been explored. The narrative revolves around one main character and a few minor ones and slowly (some would say tediously; this is not a typical open world sandbox game, so don't approach it like one...it requires patience and an open mind) progresses through a series of cases in which you repeat many of the same gameplay elements (inspect crime scenes for clues, go to new locations they lead you to, track down and interrogate suspects, and rinse & repeat in various orders with some chase & gunfight sequences thrown in for pacing as well as optional dispatch missions you can take on in the middle of a case), but the writing, variety of rich settings, and overall presentation are top notch and keep the formula fresh and the mysteries (both in individual missions and the overarching story) tantalizing regardless of linearity. The graphics have aged a bit (even running on maximum settings, pop-in is more evident, draw distance is shorter, and environmental textures that comprise foliage & buildings are much less detailed than the current standards), but none of that detracts from the experience or the dense, vibrant world and performances that made this game so great back in 2011. The motion capture technology it employs is still great, allowing it to showcase very nuanced facial expressions. This PC port is optimized very well, running at a high, stable frame rate and improving on an already visually compelling console game.If you haven't played this yet, I highly recommend it, especially since you can now get the complete package for around $5 which includes the original four standalone DLC missions and two previously console-exclusive missions that are inserted into the campaign, making this akin to a director's cut. A smart, savvy game with dark themes for mature audiences.			"

Muita gente dizia que Mafia 2 era melhor que L.A, e vice-versa. Mas quando joguei, percebi que um é muito diferente do outro, e os dois são bons. Porem essa analise é do L.A, então continuando: Os graficos são bonitos, podiam ser melhores, mas é bem aceitavel. A jogabilidade com o carro é um pouco artificial. Não gostei muito de dirigir nesse jogo (Mas a Rockstar facilitou pra quem não gostou, e a maioria das missões voce escolhe se voce ou seu parceiro dirige). O sistema de interrogar as pessoas foi bem planejado, e é um grande enfoque no jogo.L.A lembra bastante filmes que retratam a década de 1940 e 1950.

												I felt the need to beat the game before I wrote a review on it just so I could get a full-scale view on it. I think I've put about 27 hours into the game before I finally did beat it (and that's without any DLC), so if you're looking for a long game that is worth your money, then L.A. Noire should definitely be considered. You play as Cole Phelps, a war veteran that has returned to the States to enlist as a police officer in Los Angeles. Throughout the game, you will solve cases by collecting evidence around crimescenes, conducting interviews on suspects or witnesses, and driving around the city. Lots and LOTS of driving (Since driving will take up a large chunk of time, the game allows you to ""fast Travel"" to the selected area by holding ""E"" next to the car). Every so often, you'll get promoted and moved to a different set of cases (Such as Arson, Homicide, and *Motor Crime*). *I'm not familiar with what Motor Crime is known under*Phelps' life in the war is shown through flashbacks between each case, slowly placing the parts to make a giant picture.The gameplay is pretty simple:  You are assigned a case and you must piece together the clues to solve it. L.A. Noire offers many features that aren't availible in other detective/mystery games. First, the map. L.A. Noire is a gigantic free-roam map (you'll mainly be driving) that takes a LONG time to drive from one side to the other, even going 80 mph. The city is filled, and I mean FILLED with AI life that walks or drives along through the city, making it feel like an actual city. Many of the places on the map are real places or based on real places that were/are in Los Angeles as well. Another feature that I must mention is the interrogation. When you interrogate a person, you will ask them a question, to which they will respond with an answer. You then must decide if they are telling the truth, if you doubt them, or if they are lying (and you can prove that they are lying). You can decide these based on evidence you had found at a crime scene and by looking at the amazing facial expressions the character emits. For example, if a character is staring straight at you while talking, they're probably telling the truth, while if a character keeps avoiding eye contact, you might want to push for more information. The facial expressions in the game are spectacular and the mouth-to-voice dialog is spot-on. Yes, they deserved their own little two-sentence paragraph right here, that's how good they are.I got 27 hours out of the campaign and bought it while it was on sale for $10. After playing, I know that I would have bought it for the full price, due to the well-planned and just delicate features that the game highlights. I must mention one bug that I had with the game...at times, the game would run slow. Most of the time, it ran smoothly and I had no problem with it, but at times, (when Rockstar was busy perhaps) the game would be slightly laggy. Not enough to make the game unplayable, but enough to be quite annoying. Fortunately, if I left and came back a few hours later, I would experience no lag. Finally, I want to promote the different action there is. Often while working a case, you'll be driving and get a call over the radio to respond to a street crime, essentially a side mission. There are many different types of action you will face in the game. There are car chases, police shootouts, tracking missions (missions where you follow the suspect without being seen), running-for-your-life-missions, and many more.Overall, I give the game a 9/10.

It's a movie, it's a novel, it's a TV-serie, it's a puzzle, it's a tragedy, it's a fiction, it's the truth. Playing a sandbox game as a good policeman is something you will get use to easily.In the beginning you probably will find the game hard to play and have success in; but when you get into it, you will wonder the finale as much as you will wish that it won't end.Buy it if your rig is enough.*  You don't need to wait for Steam Sales to come.* LA Noire has average optimisation. It uses constant 30 FPS because of its technology. When/if you get 25- FPS, it may hurt your eyes. Having a recommended system will solve your problem. "

												I have to admit I'm quite a sucker for Rockstar games.  I played All GTA games (except 5), all Max Payne games, And some of the Midnight Club and Manhunt games.  When I decided to play this game I knew I'll love it. I knew it from the day I heard of it. And I do.  L.A. Noire has an unique noire feeling that actually make you think you are there and everything seems very real and alive. Unlike GTA where you (or at least I don't) don't actually care much about many of the characters you encounter, here you literally have to discover the life of every victim to solve the case and the fact that you see the victim covered in blood and all beat up makes it more real and somehow personal.  The more you play, the violent the murders are and this makes you really wanna get the murderer and kick his #$@!.  The game comes with an awesome soundtrack and offers an extra goodie - you can actually play the game in grayscale.Literally noire. This is the only game with this kind of feature I've encountered so far.  Unfortunatelly, L.A. Noire revealed again (if this was ever the case) that Rockstar #$#% at porting games to PC. In the past few years I noticed that every new Rockstar PC port is worse than the old one and so on.  But L.A. Noire is by far the worst port ever, technically speaking.  I haven't encounter gameplay bugs but the game is not fluid and has serious FPS drops when you least expect it. You get to see trees and cars and houses materializing up out of thin air (the effect is interesting - unlike GTA where those actually popped up, here I see a Star Trek teleport-like effect :|) Moreover, It doesn't seem to get better when lowering the settings.  In the end, I really want to downvote this game but I can't. Despite it's technical issues, L.A. Noire is a really unique game.			"

												Hey kid, this game ain't for you.Loved it from beginning to end. It had a few flaws. The Rockstar Social Club screwed up my ability to play my game for a while, so I had an interum of a few months between starting and being able to finish. The other thing is that while the game gives you a big ol' world, there ain't much to do in it. The cases themselves are take the spotlight and that's not a bad thing.If you're looking for action, you'll get some of that. If you're looking for sleuthing you'll get that too. For a game that took a step outside/between genres, I'd say they did a damn fine job.			"

												I felt the need to beat the game before I wrote a review on it just so I could get a full-scale view on it. I think I've put about 27 hours into the game before I finally did beat it (and that's without any DLC), so if you're looking for a long game that is worth your money, then L.A. Noire should definitely be considered. You play as Cole Phelps, a war veteran that has returned to the States to enlist as a police officer in Los Angeles. Throughout the game, you will solve cases by collecting evidence around crimescenes, conducting interviews on suspects or witnesses, and driving around the city. Lots and LOTS of driving (Since driving will take up a large chunk of time, the game allows you to ""fast Travel"" to the selected area by holding ""E"" next to the car). Every so often, you'll get promoted and moved to a different set of cases (Such as Arson, Homicide, and *Motor Crime*). *I'm not familiar with what Motor Crime is known under*Phelps' life in the war is shown through flashbacks between each case, slowly placing the parts to make a giant picture.The gameplay is pretty simple:  You are assigned a case and you must piece together the clues to solve it. L.A. Noire offers many features that aren't availible in other detective/mystery games. First, the map. L.A. Noire is a gigantic free-roam map (you'll mainly be driving) that takes a LONG time to drive from one side to the other, even going 80 mph. The city is filled, and I mean FILLED with AI life that walks or drives along through the city, making it feel like an actual city. Many of the places on the map are real places or based on real places that were/are in Los Angeles as well. Another feature that I must mention is the interrogation. When you interrogate a person, you will ask them a question, to which they will respond with an answer. You then must decide if they are telling the truth, if you doubt them, or if they are lying (and you can prove that they are lying). You can decide these based on evidence you had found at a crime scene and by looking at the amazing facial expressions the character emits. For example, if a character is staring straight at you while talking, they're probably telling the truth, while if a character keeps avoiding eye contact, you might want to push for more information. The facial expressions in the game are spectacular and the mouth-to-voice dialog is spot-on. Yes, they deserved their own little two-sentence paragraph right here, that's how good they are.I got 27 hours out of the campaign and bought it while it was on sale for $10. After playing, I know that I would have bought it for the full price, due to the well-planned and just delicate features that the game highlights. I must mention one bug that I had with the game...at times, the game would run slow. Most of the time, it ran smoothly and I had no problem with it, but at times, (when Rockstar was busy perhaps) the game would be slightly laggy. Not enough to make the game unplayable, but enough to be quite annoying. Fortunately, if I left and came back a few hours later, I would experience no lag. Finally, I want to promote the different action there is. Often while working a case, you'll be driving and get a call over the radio to respond to a street crime, essentially a side mission. There are many different types of action you will face in the game. There are car chases, police shootouts, tracking missions (missions where you follow the suspect without being seen), running-for-your-life-missions, and many more.Overall, I give the game a 9/10.

												Intially i played this on ps3 and stopped pretty early on found it boring and repetetive. fast foward 3 years from now and have seen the light. This a fantastic game with an amazing attention of detail (Cole phelps picking his hat after being punched, details in interiors)) The settings is amazing the ACTED not voice acted but ACTED has to be the most ambitious thing ever. There isnt much gun fights or standard action but uses common sense an paying attention this fits to more of a older point and click adventure game. On the port side the port is awful. Frequent frame drops crashes and stuttering so i reccomend you get the console version. Overall this has to be my favorite games ever!			"

												Wow, what a spectacularly dull game. To all those complaining you can't get it to launch, youse are the lucky ones... well that's not true but the game's not great. First of all Cole Phelps is just an extremely dulll and unlikeable character. His smug, smarmy facial expressions are captured perfectly with the only real reason to take a glance at this game. The facial animation is still better than most today however the texture quality has not aged well and coupled with the choppy framerate it just doesn't look as good as it once would've. The story doesn't seem to be going anywhere interesting after more than six hours (I've played an hour or two offline as well), it just seems to be a kind of episodic deal. Crime or two, promotion, another crime or two. If you're into detective stuff and noir style then maybe, just maybe you can get into this as there is kind of a gap in the market for this stuff. Just don't expect much in the way of action.This game essentially plays itself during any action sequences. You just hold the trigger down and move forward until the other guy stops running. The shooting is very basic, not bad in any real way, there's just nothing to it. There's nothing really noteworthy to say about the driving either. The meat of the gameplay is the detective stuff. This consists primarily of listening to people talk and using the advanced facial capture stuff to read faces and determine if they're lying, with the help of evidence and context of course. Oh and bad acting works to your advantage too sometimes. You literally just pick Truth, Doubt or Lie which is just doubt but you have to pick a bit of evidence to back it up. You also walk around picking things up and looking at them with great interest. The thing that bugged me the most with this is the fact that it immediately tells you if you got the dialogue tree wrong which just compels me to retry until I get it right and subsequently I end up hearing the same bits of dialogue a dozen times. It'd be more immersive if it just sort of went forward with no specific indication, at least not until the end of the case. For the last one I just used a walkthrough but that made it thrice as boring which is when I realised that I was not enjoying it enough to play anymore.Long story short, don't play it if you're autistic.

Posted: November 27, 2013
												Let's start with the graphics. For starters I was actually amazed that L.A. Noire was the first console game that had near-flawless if not flawless anti-aliasing. I kid you not, you could take a look at the telephone wires from up close or from afar and there would be no jaggies. Nevertheless, I attempted to convince myself that my mind was playing tricks on me and that some anti-alised objects were just polished to perfection. I was partially right; it's only the telephone wires, cars and some other objects that have no jaggies.The graphics settings for the PC version are:Antialiasing: 1-3Anisotropic Filtering: 1-4Ambient Occlusion - Yes/NoFacial Quality - Quality/PerformanceTexture Quality - Quality/PerformanceShadow Quality - Quality/Performance/BalancedLighting Quality - Quality/Performance/BalancedEnvironment Map - Quality/Performance/BalancedLevel of Detail Quality - Quality/Performance/BalancedScreen Space Ambient Occlusion - On/OffGlobal Detail Level - Quality/Performance/BalancedAnd there's also a command line for various set-up options.If you have a high end PC you can get 30 FPS if you pick all Quality.However, if you choose Performance, you ALSO get 30 FPS.So they converted the game to PC yet they forgot to raise the FPS cap, hmmm weird. Honestly, I did not notice much difference between the PS3 and the PC version graphic-wise. I mean all those extra graphics options are nice for the ego-boost but I had a hard time telling the difference especially with the frequent texture popping.What I mean is that the game's graphics suffer immensely when you drive your vehicle for instance. Objects just pop out of thin air and grow out of the ground slowly enough for you to notice. You may drive and look ahead at some of the box-like buildings when all of a sudden they begin to acquire the necessary features such as windows, doors, color, etc.Also, in many instances the game practically plays by itself. Again, that was done with the controller movement in mind. You may run after someone through the rooftops, fire escape ladders, alleyways and what not and be automatically redirected to pursue the suspect. The game GUIDES you forces you after the suspect because it assumes you may not be able to make that sharp turn with your controller; all you'll have to hold is the ""forward"" button.-----Part 2Make no mistake, this is not GTA set in the 1940's. There are no friends to call, bars, memorable and charismatic characters, outrageous cinematics, funny encounters, motorcycles, TV shows, dating, witty radio broadcasts describing the decadent elements of American Culture. This is a very mature, somewhat dry and serious game, perhaps it is too serious. There is a fair amount of thin adult humor that might not even catch your attention but the dialogue is extremely well written to say the least. The game plays and feels just like one of those black and white detective movies. Maybe the game is too serious in fact, there is little room for fun. Nor is there a single set objective mission to complete per se. You just keep the L.A. populace safe from petty and serious criminals.If anything, the game is divided into chapters much like in Mafia 2 and there are some miscellaneous missions to complete aside from the main story. Each story starts with a few seconds video showing what happens to the victim. There are actually clues within those short videos that might help you solve the crime better and faster. So this is like a sand box game with no toys to play. Sure there are 30 secret cars spread out around the city to find and there are badges and newspapers to look for (if you like achievements) but otherwise there is little to do in the city.The driving is very unrealistic, it feels arcadish but at least you don't get annoyed every time you try to make a sharp turn and attempt to regain controls. However this unrealistic consolish driving feels out of place in this serious game. I guess they had to make it easy for the controller. At first you may think to yourself ""wow, how did I manage to make that turn, not run over the pedestrian and still be able to pursue that vehicle"" - again, the game helps you do all that.For the most part the shooting is okay except when it's not. True, I still prefer the mouse to a controller but once you enter a confined area, the constricted camera speed will force to you aim as slowly as you would with one of those analog sticks.Crime-solving is where the game shines, or supposed to shine at least. Sometimes it will get tedious and samey even though the scenery, the objects, the part of town and the characters are different. At least it got tedious sometimes in my case because I had to pay attention to almost everything. If you have an analytical mind, it will help. If you have a short-attention spam, then good luck. Every case requires your utmost attention and even if you mess up with most clues, facts and interrogations you will still complete the mission only with a low rank. As a result, you will advance slightly slower in the game and have access to less suits, fame and what not. So there is no real sense of danger or fear of messing up HOWEVER you cannot reload your game if the interrogation goes awry for one reason or another, not unless you want to start the chapter all over again. So there is plenty of incentive to not mess up; you want gain those experience points and exchange them for intuition or ask the community option to help you conduct interrogations more effectively.In the end, the 6-year period to make the game and a million dollar debt among other things forced Rockstar to close down their Team Bondi Studio. What can I say, next time, try to make the game faster and RELEASE THE PC VERSION ALONG WITH THE CONSOLE VERSION TO INCREASE THE REVENUE.Thank you very much.			"

												The first few hours, I found myself genuinely interested but that slowly dwindled away as I realized the game was the same mechanic, wash and repeat for 50 hours. The plot was somewhat complex, which I admire, however it became incredibly absurd. At one point, the main character suddenly does something completely out-of-character and way out in left field.Honestly, the facial animations are good but the face textures are just god awful that it takes away. The city feels barren, the color palette is lackluster, the npcs all seemingly have the same lines, driving from point A to point B was incredibly boring, and I could go on and on. This is a complete game, but man what a borefest. I found myself anticipating the ending so much just so I could get my closure and move on.			"

												        Okay let us get started with this.This game has a great story, amazing gameplay, stupendous voice acting and outstanding facial animations. One of the best games out there along with GTA 5. This game is a pure classic.        HOWEVER, HOWEVER, HOWEVER, there is one thing about L.A. Noire that pisses me off tremendously. The game is capped at 30 frames per second. As a PC gamer with a powerful rig, this pisses me off because i play most of my games (90% of them) at 60 fps and higher. Playing at 30 fps did not seem right at all. It feels sluggish, and it does not look smooth at all (to me at least).          Nonetheless, you can uncap the framerate by using WideScreenFixer. You will be able to play it at 60 fps if your PC is powerful enough but then uncapping the framerate would mess up one thing. The driving. Driving is one of the key elements of this game and after you have uncapped the framerate, driving physics will be slightly altered. It will be harder to drive around as the vehicle will feel ""floaty"" like how the driving in GTA 4 feels like. But if you can get used to that, then there should not be a problem at all.          That would be the only issue in this game so if you can overcome it, you will have a great experience playing it. I would definitely persuade anyone out there to purchase L.A. Noire.			"

												This is really quite sad example of how the game industry sometimes works. The game may not be on the top shelf of quality, barely fitting 'the solid-good' one. And yet it IS a good game. And not in the way of 'guilty pleasure' good, no. This title is a great example of a sereis in which the second one corrects every mistake of the first one. Unfortunatelly we do not have the possibility to play second one and we are left with this flawed piece of a 'sketch'. And whilst it is a quite nice idea for a drawing, it is not by any means perfect one. Starting with a mediocre graphics, very hard to rate depending on which side we are looking at (faces and interiors are really nice, the rest is... meh). The gameplay is I'd say quite poor and very repetitive. And yet this title took more than 20 hours of my life. And I do not regret it at all. Because as far as the plot, the character, the music adn the climat goes the game is just outstanding! I could really, (without any problems whatsoever) close an eye on a technical side in this case. Take it without a hesitation if you are the player for whom the story development is more important than a gameplay. Especially if you liked the Sabouteur and you are keen on the 40s, noire, and jazz			"

												I give this game a pass and recommendthat you do too.Honestly, there's nothing wrong with the game.  Everything is functional and works fine.  It plays well.  The problems for me are twofold: other games have done all of the elements better, and context.Running is fine, shooting is fine, the sound effects are fine, driving is fine, the open world is fine, interrogations are fine, investigations are fine.  There's nothing particularly wrong with any element and like I said the game is functional.  It works.  It's just that so many other games do everything better.  Pretty much any sandbox -- though most notably GTA -- does almost all of the elements better just because of context alone: it makes sense when you're in a huge gunfight or you're firing randomly at people, or driving like a maniac down the road.  Or, you know, stealing a ♥♥♥♥ing car.  I'm not saying that these events never happen if you're a police officer but I have to scratch my head at the ideas of it.Interrogations are fine.  They're ok.  They're acceptable.  However, any game in the Turnabout Courtroom series does the interrogation model so much better.  I never thought I would miss saving between interrogations because of life totals, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I do now.  This one and done ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just aggrivating, especially when the answers are so vague at times (Hi, I'm showing you a blood stained weapon found in your car, in relation to a question about blood all over your car.  Why is this deemed wrong?  And now I'm out of the interrogation).  I get that you can ♥♥♥♥ the interrogations up and your progress isn't stalled but it is frustrating to have so many options before you and see that several could work.  At  least in Turnabout courtroom I'm just slightly perplexed when one of them is wrong, because you know what?  I can keep going and try again.The open world makes no sense to me.  I don't understand why it was necessary for this game, as a large part of it is just driving from one point to another for story missions.  Sure, on occassion a crime pops up, but you have to accept that as your new mission anyway.  It's not like you drive by and one is going on, and you can take care of it or ignore it.  There's no organic feel whatsoever.LA Noire does create a very wonderful world that I enjoyed to drive around, it's just that it was hollow.  You know, like the rest of the game.It took me a few weeks of not playing to decide but I came to the conclusion that I did not want to finish this game.  I'd seen enough of it and felt that, after 6 or so hours, it would just be more of the same.  I'm open to being wrong, and maybe I'll open it up again later and change my mind, but for now I'd rather just play another game.  One that's actually fun and not aggrivating.			"

Tried to return it, but steam said I played it for 3 hours and 2 hours are there limit for returns.  More like three days of problem solving with no reward.  If it wasn't going to work with my setup then why is there no warning or system check.  In this case my system was too new.  Shame on you steam.			"

												This game was awesome during the seemingly Tutorial. Everything seemed smart and clueful. But a few missions into the detective game and I am frustrated by trying to get a perfect case in an bull**** rigged question and answer system. In this 'case', I refer to the Ambassador's stolen car The consul's car.When talking to a witness, you get 3 choices of answers: Truth; Doubt; Lie. But in this certain case, I doubt the witnessess are telling the truth, and I have no proof he and she are lieing, so I choose doubt. My guy blows his top and calls the witnesses liars, and the game tells me I failed to choose correctly. So I restart the case many times. Finally I chose that the witness is telling the Truth. My guy calmly tells the witness he is lyeing, and the witness confesses and gives more evidence. Game tells me I chose correctly this time. WTF!?!?! This is bull****!!! The two answers are backwards, but are scripted as if it were correct. This kept happening during this certain case, and I have to wonder if the rest of the cases are also scripted to mess with the player instead of acting correctly. Its so frustrating to be told you are wrong when you were correct, and slapped on the wrist for it, until you answer incorrectly and are rewarded for it.The fun parts though are the action scenes if you are driving a squad car. You stop for a bank robbery and kill all the bank robbers in 40 seconds. Then you wish there were 10 more bank robbers so you felt it was a challenge. Most of the time there seemed to be 4 bank robbers, but then there were 5 or 6 the last time, so I hope that my level increases the difficulty of the action scenes. On the downfall, most of the action scenes are incredibly easy. I assume its because I learned the controls really well, but I hope they get incredibly difficult.The worst part was running the case again forces you to re-live the entire storyline times X. There is no scene skipping, EVER! I looked on the RockStar page and someone asked for a kb key to press to skip scenes and they said backspace, and this was also shown in the control options. But backspace does not work! So... replay 25 minutes of scene footage to get to the part where you ask 3 questions to a witness again. Aaarrgghh!! Now this is frustrating. I wish it told me what I was going to say before I chose an option. Like:Truth: I bet you know more than you are letting on.Doubt: You know you are lieing, tell me the truth!Lie: You're lieing! I have proof you did it in the lounge with the candlestick!but... it doesn't. You have to play 25 minutes to see what you are going to say during a questioning.Cons:Citizens look too much alike. I question one citizen, and in the next case there is another citizen who looks exactly like the previous citizen. I don't get it... in a small town, or a big city, all main characters should look unique. At least change their clothes and their hair.Backwards choices.Catching bad guys not involved in your case does not lead to opening new cases against them.Unlock cars by stealing them. Can't buy them.No money system. Except for some sort of city damages that doesn't seem to affect you.Easy action missions.Can't skip scenes.Can't skip chatting.No reason to explore the world if its not involved in your own mission.Can't use your gun, unless the game makes you take it out. And its not wise to use your gun even when the game forces you to take it out.Can't pull your fists out, unless the game makes you.Your guy yells at people on his own. You aren't controlling him. Its a movie, not a game.Mini-map does not rotate. No options for the mini-map.Large map takes 2 seconds to load, and 3 clicks to get back to game, which is 8 seconds. This is frustrating since there is no GPS. You are likely to drive into a long tunnel, instead of going towards your destination.As you play, you realize there is less and less of a reason to explore anything unless it is literally handed to you. (Marked for inspection at the scene by a previous officer.) (Look for shining objects, cause if its not shining then its not ever important.)Many items to inspect are blocked by other items to inspect, making it hard to inspect even if you know that it is there to inspect. a missing flag on an argentinian ambassador's car is blocked by a missing license plate. This type of clue blocking happens in many cases.Can't look at your watch in game.Can't tell what date it is. But many records of the date when someone signed something.Pros:Feeling you are smart when you catch someone in a lie. (If the game feels like being truthful.)Open world.Environment feels real, where there are loads of things to look at, but seldom does anything belong to the case you are working on. You get used to this, and stop looking at things that don't belong to any case ever.Game is set before finger printing, and everyone grabs a gun and fingers the crap out of it no matter what. Game shows how a police officer can walk right into anyone's house if they are invited inside for a different reason, then beat up the citizen and search his house for any reason what-so-ever. No need for warrants when police are invited inside.70+ cars to unlock.Fun (but easy) action missions.No GPS guidance, because you are in the 1940's.tl;drAll in all... I feel to answer what you want to answer, you need a walk-through. But this goes against playing the game and sleuthing! Why not just watch a youtube video of this game instead?If the game had a second tutorial on how to think like the developers thought that investigators should interogate citizens, then this game could have been a ton of fun and a shining star. Otherwise, you are left with writers trying to outsmart a player through cheap tricks. And by tricks I mean: thinking you Doubt someone, so you say Truth so that you ""Doubt"". "

 Pros  There's a big world for you to explore. The clue solving and lie dector gameplay is entertaining The street crime (minigames?) are really fun It tells good stories (I'm not sure if there is an over-arching plot)  Cons   While the world is big, there is NOTHING to do outside of the main objective and street crimes.  The lie dector gameplay is broken and gets stale fast. you can click lie for everything, it will go through a scripted sequence, and if you're wrong, you simpily take the statement back. Also I couldn't tell the answer 99% of the time just based on their face.  There are a few street crimes and they get looped after a while (I liked them, but after the 100th time they're no fun)  You only get your gun in (some) street crimes (and maybe a few missions)  The characters aren't fleshed out enough (Partners are jerks that have no real purpose and switch after a few missions. The main character has no real background story with the exception of the war flashbacks that happen inbetween missions)  The controls are slippery (cars feel like they have butter under the tires and the character movement is awful in a way I cannot explain). OVERALL L.A. Noire is an interesting game that is fun, but only for a few hours. I can only recommend it if it goes on sale for $5 or if you're a real fan of 1950s(?) detective games. Don't buy this.

												[7/10] – L.A. Noire is a very entertaining action detective simulator that has incredible attention to detail and a phenomenal animation system. Yet sadly, its 30fps cap, and dodgy controls at times leave a small void inside me. Even with its flaws, it’s a very fun and mature title, and worth the price of admission. If you like GTA/Mafia II style open world games, but want the intellectualism offered only by more mature titles, then this is for you. It definitely makes you think, and punishes you for poor detective skills, so good problem solving is a must. There are also some pretty awesome action moments with a Hollywood feel to them, and usually don’t disappoint. Overall I thought it was a good ride while it lasted.			"

Posted: January 6, 2014
												The year 1947 the case ""The Red Lipstick Murder"", a woman is found murdered and brutally beaten then dumped at a park just across the LAPD Police Station. Your job as a new dectective is to scout the scene, find clues, find the suspects and interogate them using your intuition and facts to chase down the killer. This is just one example of fantastic cases that you have to figure out and bring down the killers and criminals who commit crimes across L.A. You play as Phelps, a World War 2 veteran and all around do-gooder. Phelps is an honest man who has a strict honor system and puts his all into a case that he is working on. Phelps starts out as a common on the beat cop who likes to put his nose where it usually doesnt belong. He quickly excells through the ranks and without giving any spoilers he becomes a hero cop and is promoted to detective on the trafiic cases. I find this incredibly interesting since you dont immediately start out as this recognized protaganist in a game filled with crime and criminals. But these guys and gals you come across in L.A arent people you really expect to be murders and rapists. These people are your average run of the mill, hard working citizens who just try to make a living in the city.But looks are deceiving. Some of the citizens are actually complete psychopaths!While the core story is really interesting the gameplay is somewhat lacking and the visuals if inspected have small bugs. I found on serveral occasions that some doors i tied walking through would sometimes bug and stay perma shut until i restarted the game. I dont know if that was a problem with my PC or just in general a problem. However I have never encountered it another game. Anyway combat reminds me alot of Red Dead and they are made by the same developer so it was good to see that the combat was very detailed and carefully made. Combat really only comes into play every now and then so if you are a gamer that needs tons of action L.A Noire is not for you. Gamers with patience and pay very close attention to facts and facial expressions will succed in L.A Noire on some occasions. (there is a part where you have to deal with an actress, nasty buisness and very deceiving) L.A Noire also requires gamers who are very mature because there is nudity in L.A Noire and it will go into detail about the cause of death. So if you are quesy I wouldnt recommend this game for you. Finally the last thing to talk about is the enemy mechanics and investigation mechanics. These are really the most important parts of the game and sometimes they do incredibly well. On very few occasions the Ai would suddenly come out of cover shooting but instead of returning back to cover, they stayed there trying to shoot me. Once they needed to reload you could easily gun them down and fire at the next enemy. Like I said, this rarely happened so i wouldnt really be too concerned about it. The criminals who arent firing at you are usually running away from you or trying to fist fight you. Never once encountered any problems with the runners or the fighters. Fighters usually ended with you knocking them out and arresting them, and the runners could completely take a turn for the worst. On one occasion, the criminal took a man hostage and you have to gun the criminal down but be careful not to shoot the hostage or then you will be bagging a body and letting the criminal have the last laugh. But in another spot, there is an  insane man that you have to run down and catch before he can fatally hurt himself. I loved parts of the game like this and suggest you do the side quests that come up as they have their own unique part in the game.Now to the investigation mechanics, these are incredibly well thought out and cleverly displayed! When you enter a crime scene a chime and mystery music begins to play. This all together adds to the atmosphere of a late 1940s crime thriller and does an excellant job at setting the mood. Also the music plays a part when you are investigating, when you here a chime that mean that there is something that could be a clue. I think this is all together inventive and really nails a video game thriller. I recommend this game but am going to give it a 7.5 / 10   Mainly because the lack of combat will push some of the gamers who need action in the game, another reason is some bugs really just throwed me off.

												You could say L.A. Noire is a GTA where you play the cops, but that would be selling the game short. It's definitely not as ""sandbox"" as its counterpart, since you play through each case in succession. However, every single one of your decisions can have an impact on the rest of the case; and your career.Graphically speaking, there's only one thing that bugs me: the 1940s Los Angeles seems to lack detail, most notably because of a very aggressive LOD policy. Some textures are also low resolution. But it's a very minor thing.The facial animation of this game is just insane and brings an incredible amount of life to the characters; they're really believable, and you can observe the suspects while you're taking notes — it can help you determine whether they're lying or saying the truth. The acting is top notch, and does not seem forced for the most part.The game is slightly confusing at first, but the immersion it offers afterwards is breathtaking. I really recommend playing it.

												Wow, this is exactually as I expected.  Even though I have not really been interested in the noir genre, I can say this is a real treat. This game really takes overall gaming to the next level; with use of a high tech camera system filming real actors and actresses, you choose if a victim/murderer is lying or telling the truth based off of their facial and vocal expressions. My major problem is that with a simple laptop, I didn't really get the best performance with this game, even on the lowest settings.To rap this up, this game is a must buy for gamers into the mystery/noir genre, and if it's for 4.99; all the better to pick up and play this game.

												Rating: 10/10This is probably the most mature 3rd person game I have ever played. The crime-solving is so unique, I'm enjoying every single aspect of it, from finding clues to making conclusions. Foot/car chases and shootings are also pretty nice. It's almost like one long and big detective movie and I will recommend it to players who actually wanna use brain while playing a game :)			"

												Short and simple this is a detective, free-roam kind of game. Solve crimes by examining crime scenes, interviewing people, and investigating leads. Good amount of gun fights, brawls, and chasing. A very long story and all the cases basically tell the main plot, which I enjoyed! Get the DLC for even more content. Maybe not that much replay value, but for 5 dollars it's a steal.			"

												Thrilling, yet under control. Dark, yet intensely intruiging. L.A. Noire is an exciting experience, for all gamers!The game is really engaging and interesting because the storyline is rich and well thought out. Ironically, this is L.A. Noire's shortfall as well. The game mechanics seemed pretty cool, but cases after cases, you realize that the mechanics are not very indepth. This makes the game feel repetitive and tedious after a little while.But if you find yourself immersed in the storyline, these little things won't bother you at all. "

Even if you are not a huge crime drama fan, La Norie is still made by Rockstar so there's plenty of things from the story to the gameplay that will keep you hooked until the very end. You play as Cole Phelps, a military veteran that returned to LA as a police officer. You solve cases and go up in ranks. Each case as a unqiue twist and all need speical attention if you want to get the right guy. If you ever thought about how cool it would be to work as a detective than do yourself a favor and pick up this game !			"

												L.A. Noire is a fantastic game.  It's not like Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption. You don't rely on killing your enemy. Instead, you have to rely on intuition and good detective work. Its story, presentation and gameplay are all solid with the new facial technology probably being the best part of the game. With 87 hours under my belt and a 100% completion rate, I feel good giving this game two thumbs up.			"

												To start with, I can honestly say I've never had a love for a video game like I've had for L.A. Noire. The graphics are not the greatest ever seen, detail in objects lacks; how ever during interrogations, facial expressions are very well drawn. I don't full-on action games, I like ones that have a strong story line to aid it; L.A. Noire's story is the best graphical story I've come across so far. The characters are very well described throughout the story and scenes in the game make you think. There is no shortage of surprises and suspense is not scarce. If you're one to enjoy a mysterious but thrilling action game (with some very nice jazz in the background), then L.A. Noire is without competition.			"

												First of all, it's a unique experience with a captivating story, based on real cases. The interrogation mechanics and finding clues feel entertaining. Facial expressions are unbelievable - behind each character there is an actual person (appearance and voice). In some cases you might even recognize them, especially if you know the TV series Mad Men.On the other hand, roaming around the city is boring. Even though the noire atmosphere is good enough, there is almost nothing to do apart from the main story. Thankfully it's possible to let your partner do the driving most of the time.			"

												Here is my review for L.A. Noire, i'll keep it as simple and short as i can.Pros and cons;+ Open world game with a really big map and a lively city allowing free roaming if you want to.+Excellent graphics, beautiful made city+ The soundtrack is awesome, fitting the game atmosphere perfectly.+Probably the best character models i have ever seen, their faces are exactly like the actors impersonating them, with real expressions.+ Fantastic voice acting.+The characters, both protagonists and antagonists, are well made.+Fantastic and well made cases, the game has a really good plot  with an explosive finale.- Sometimes the game was a little buggy while it was raining, i dont think it was my PC since it is top notch. Im not sure why i had that problem, you might not have the same.- Repetitive gameplay that after a while it got a bit frustrating and boring, you almost always do the same thing; go to crime scene, investigate, visit a bar or another place related to crime, chase suspect, interrogate, decide who is guilty.So, as you can understand on your own, this is a really good game that i think all fans of detective-crime games should try it. It might be a little difficult for some while interrogating and making the proper questions, but after a while you will get the hang of it. It can also be a little challenging while finding evidence, but thats what i liked about it. Just buy it, its worth the money, it was an awesome experience for me.			"

The only problem I have is deciding if the person is 1. telling the truth 2. not telling the whole truth, or 3. flat out lying.

												Ugh...I am REALLY conflicted about L.A. Noire. I bought it back during the Steam sale, and I loved the game--or rather, I loved what I was able to play. The game is not technically compatible through Steam with Windows 8, but it initially ran fine on an AMD Radeon 7750. I had buyer's remorse with the AMD card, bought an NVIDIA card with higher benchmark scores, and suddenly the game didn't recognize my new card even though the game supports it. I spent weeks over email trying to resolve the issue with Rockstar, only for them to tell me to run it in compatibility mode (something you can't do through Steam) because it's incompatible with Windows 8. If you have Windows 7/XP, buy this game because it is very well-acted, pretty, and has a very cool approach to being a cop in LA. If you have Windows 8, be very certain your system will run it before purchasing.			"

												If you're okay with finding ways to work around horrible framerate (changing resolution back and forth for me) and an fps cap of 30, you'll find a great game in L.A. Noire. This game is really unique. You get thrown around into every police department, which keeps cases fresh. From homicide to arson, you always have a big case to solve. The face capturing is the best I have ever seen. It's so accurate that you'll recognize many actors' faces. I found it very challenging and rewarding when correctly interrogating suspects. As someone who searches around for treasures and such in games like Uncharted and Bioshock, I enjoyed looking for clues, many of which are well hidden. The DLC is a great edition, with awesome side missions like Nicholson Electroplating and Reefer Madness. The driving is kind of bland, but the 1940s L.A. map is huge and the hidden cars were a nice touch. Plus you can have your partner drive you everywhere if you want. I also found it nice to place a Rockstar game with historically real places, vehicles, criminals, and social paradigms. There are even fictionalized versions of real crimes like the Black Dahlia Murder (which you actually get to solve). Overall, the cinematic feel, great acting and gameplay made L.A. become one of my favorite games. If you're really into mid-19th century film noire, you can even put the game in black and white. Pick up the complete version during the next steam sale.			"

												L.A. Noire, by Rockstar and Team Bondi, is, without a doubt, a unique experience. The advanced facial technology which is by far the game's most famous feature really is incredible and for that alone everyone should try it out because there's nothing like it.It's a slow-paced, methodical game. There are action sequences but these are an exception, not the rule, to this game. This game's main strength lies in its investigation and interrogation sequences, coupled with excellent acting and good plot. Note that I'm typing ""acting"" and not ""voice acting"". The technology in this game has finally reached the point where I can say that every character in this game is acting, and not just lending their voice to the game.You can totally mess up in your cases, by the way. Like completely. But even if this happens to you, the main storyline will still keep progressing, albeit in dynamic and different ways. Your partners, peers, and superiors will comment on how you couldn't get that one case done, or if you did, praising you on your foresight. I found this really neat and a lot more investigation games should go for this dynamic direction as well instead of keeping you stuck until you find the perfect solution. (I'm looking at you, Phoenix Wright, and some point and click adventures as well)As the title implies, it perfectly evokes that feeling of a 40's Los Angeles in a dark, depressing, noir setting. The vehicles, buildings, city, music, up to the radio commercials themselves are spot on. There is freeroam as you'd expect to find in your average GTA, and street crimes which are always action oriented as fun sidequests. The story of LAPD detective Cole Phelps is very interesting and involved, and while this game is about solving crimes, it's also about telling the story of this man, who isn't perfect, has its ups and downs, and is just amazing to go through. Fantastic protagonist.I will say though that the ending felt kind of rushed, and there were a few loose ends. Closure where it was mainly needed was given though, so don't worry, this game didn't pull a Mass Effect 3.More games like L.A. Noire need to exist. Even though I've had a LOT of cases to solve, I'm still yearning for more, and I'll definitely replay this after a few years at the very least so my memories won't be as clear and I can fumble about again, because it actually makes it enjoyable and realistic for me, that even the star detective such as Cole could get fooled and get it all wrong once or twice.It's not all rainbows and sunshine though! This game is a bad PC port. Rockstar are known for being subpar when it comes to the PC, and L.A. Noire is no exception. I've had to open up a bunch of launch commands, even get a .dll file to get my game into a playable state. It doesn't help that its capped at 30 FPS either, because according to Team Bondi, the facial animations could get wonky were you to go any higher than that. 60 FPS fixes were applied and this wasn't seen though, so it's highly debatable.If you can get this on the PS3 or Xbox 360, then do so as you won't have to deal with these issues. If you can't though, at least try to give it a go anyway because like I said, this is an awesome game if it happens to like your PC and everyone should play it. I'm all for a sequel or a game set in the same style as this one!			"

												WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.Pros:A very well put together narrative, which catalogues the rise and fall of it's characters, in typical Film-noir fashion.Strong, believable characters with excellent delivery both from their respective actors and the awe-inspiring motion-capture technology utilized.Your partners. Their random banter and distinguished personalities are a joy to behold, they act both as the lancer and the foil to Cole's personality, and do an excellent job of playing off of Cole's own musings.Meh's:Lack of penalty for not upholding laws (especially when dealing with traffic), Cole can drive as recklessly as he wants, even right next to other cops without them giving a damn.The structure of the cases, especially between Homicide and Vice. In Homicide, you just finished solving a case that had made a mockery of the LAPD, and in turn, acted as a very rewarding end to that desk. BD would have served as a greater case to end the game with, although given the circumstances, I'm inclined to believe that the narrative was constructed before the individual cases, and that the cases merely served to facilitate Cole's fall from grace.Cons:The save system is check-point based, which is fine, until you realize you have to restart a case and lose an hour's worth of gameplay because the game decides to auto-save after a failed interrogation.Combat, atleast on the PC version, is rather finnicky and temperamental. The gunplay itself works, but the cover system is unresponsive and has baffling key-binds.All in all:If you're willing to deal with slow gameplay coupled with investigatory work and puzzle-solving, this game is right up your alley. It's not a masterpiece, but it will serve as the industry-wide standard for detective games in the future.			"

												L.A Noire. One thing i can say about this game is great. This game make you feel like real detective. With very good story make this game even better. You will like playing GTA but play as detective not vallian. In this game is not just about shooting a gun and car chasing, but you need use your brain to solve a single case. I can't tell you more of this, you must try this your self.Final Score for L.A Noire is 8,5/10			"

												This game cured my porn addiction during the Homicide cases! 10/10 No doubt!However, there are in-fact downsides... Even if you do have a computer capable playing Grand Theft Auto IV, you may still suffer very bad gameplay experience because of its limited 30 frames per second refresh rate and some other technical bits about the bad performance of the game...Since this game is not using Rockstar's Advanced Game Engine but a modified unnamed engine, I guess you may find that some driving aspects and shooting mechanics are slight different in the works from GTA IV...Workarounds are of course limited and not throughly proven to fix all solutions surrounding the game, example:-str or Single Threading game setting-nonv to disable nVidia 3D stereoscopic view (if you are using AMD or Intel GPU)-npd works by extending the compatibilty of GPUs which are not in their native supported DirectX version. If you have a DirectX 10 GPU but there's no DX10 option, you better choose DirectX 9 renderer and add -npd to the command lineBut if you managed to iron out (or even ignored) these NG stuffs, you will really get to experience the game at it's best!Played on an Intel Pentium Dual Core processor PC with 2GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics with some drawbacks.

												The answer to the question ""what would happen if Rockstar actually tried to make a game with some type of structure, rather than just wheeling bags of cash to the bank thanks to a long-running sandbox franchise?"" LA Noire is damn good. The storyline's a blast, the writing is good, and, despite some hilarious hiccups, the detective mechanics stand out as something that few games are daring to try. The overall package is a good game, and it feels all the more better for how much the developers went out on a limb.			"

												An incredibly unique game that tried something amazing but comes with a huge risk of falling into the uncanny valley for many people. It really serves more as an interactive story than anything else. The driving, shooting and fighting is all below average for a Rockstar game. The investigation, interrogation and puzzle mechanics are what's worth paying for. I've always wanted more of this. My dream setting for this game's sequel would be 80s Miami Vice.			"

												The atmosphere in the game is great. Music, cars, scenery, clothing, you really get a feel for the time period. The start of each new chapter gives the feel of a new episode of a crime drama on TV. This is a good fit, as the game is quite a bit like an interactive movie.The game controls are a bit like Bully (also from Rockstar). Grand Theft Auto controls would have been better, but the game plays perfectly fine with a controller.The graphics are quite good. The latest and greatest lighting and textures may not be present, but the game does a great job with facial expressions. This is a good thing, as most of the game revolves around your ability as a detective to identify when someone is not telling the truth.Gameplay has youin the role of a detective. You look for evidence, question suspects and in your ""off time"" run down street criminals as sort of little mini missions.The evidence searches are quite easy if you set the controller to vibrate when they are nearby. Without the aid of vibration, it would be very easy to miss a clue without clicking every shred of paper you walk close to.Suspect interviews are a little tougher. You ask a question and get an answer. Then you have to  decide on facial expressions (shifting eyes, a smile, looking away...etc. if the suspect if not giving the full story, or if they are flatout lying. If you choose correctly, you are rewarded with more information and some points. Choose wrong, and you will fail to be promoted.There are intuition points you earn that can help to find evidence and determine if someone is lying, but you can burn though these quickly and will need to solve more crimes to refill your suply.There are fight scenes with guns and fists, and chase scenes in vehicles. If you fail these smaller missions several times in a row, the game shows you merry and allows skipping the mission without penalty.As I said, the game is very much a story that you are taking part in. Gameplay is not very difficult, and while you can replay missions to do better, the story and cutscenes do not really make for interesting replay value. I'm enjoying the story, and am intrigued enough to keep going. Overall the game is good. I think the only downside is a low replay value.There is some type of online social component to the game, but I've not been able to connect to it, The game is a few years old, so maybe the servers have been shutdown?

												Most games compete in certain brackets and standarts, so their flaws and advantages are defined compared to those that are similar. That means that games which don't fit into those regulations should be judged differently. L.A. Noire, no matter what anybody says, is truly a unique and unrivaled experience, unlike anything you've ever played before. In that light, it deserves any player's attention and respect. It has its flaws, but those are heavily outweighed by the game's positive sides.Since the pros are a lot more significant than the cons, lets start with the drawbacks.Cons:-""Fake"" Open world. In the beginning of the story, the player is thrown into an immensely large world of the late 40's LA. Its level of detail and magnitude are on par with those of the GTA Series. The world is HUGE. But I couldn't help but feel like a prisoner in the middle of a desert. With such freedom, there should be a lot of thing to do, right? And that's where LA Noire struggles. Frankly, there's almost nothing to do other than the campaign. The Street Crimes, although elaborate, are extremely repetitive: all consist of drive to the scene, then catch this guy/shoot them/trail the bandit. No real variety there. Other than that, the Landmarks, although crucial for certain cases, are uninteresting; the same story is with the movie reels. The game world is only saved by the outstanding atmosphere and the overall great representation of the 40's LA: it is simply entertaining to just drive around, pay attention to details and feel the history in your hands.-Repetitiveness. Though it is clear Team Bondi tried to include as much variety as possible(neither street crimes nor main cases are exactly the same), the true nature of the game is very plain and monotonous. In some cases, especially the homicide desk, the gameplay comes down to ""go to scene, inspect, go there, interrogate, go there, done."" At that point in the game, it is repetitive, boring, and disappointing. It has to be said though, it may be a good thing. I have never worked as a detective and cannot judge whether that's just realism; maybe so.-The ending. Objectively, it might not be bad. But it does not fit any of the criteria for a good, satisfying ending: it doesn't connect with the major plot lines and characters, it doesn't intrigue or send a great message, it doesn't fit the style of the story itself. Some say that it fits the ""Noir"" genre and can only be understood by ""mature audience"", don't really understand what ""noir"" means. At least LA Noire puts an end to the story, unlike some other games where the ending is DLC'd.Now onto the good parts,Pros:-AMAZING immersion and atmosphere. Truly incredible to play a game where the player feels so related to Phelps and others. There are only several titles I can name which come close in atmosphere to the perfectly replicated post-war Los Angeles of LA Noire. Everything feels realistic, smooth, and satisfying. The city of LA is alive and full of cool landmarks and details to explore. Some characters are relatable and felt for, some are disgustingly unpleasant. When major plot lines come up, the emotional response to the fate of the story and characters is deep and real.-Uniqueness. LA Noire is truly one of a kind game. Noir style is objectively interesting, detectives are appealing to some people. In gaming those two styles aren't seen often; in fact, a simple google search for both yields the fact that this game is exceptional. No other game provides such feel of responsibility for your actions and requirement for logic and attention to detail. The face-capture technology also allows interrogations to reach a new level. All interactions with suspects and your notebook are something completely new and very interesting.-Vice and DLC cases. To put it plainly, none of the cons apply to the Vice desk and most DLC cases. Both are a undoubtfully a 10/10 experience. Early on Ad Vice, the player learns true responsibilty for actions as minor characters may actually die depending on the success or failure of the detective. As other desks cases can get tidious, Vice provides an outstanding variety of settings, actions, locations, and colorful characters, connected by an highly entertaining and unexpected plot details and twists. As for DLC cases, they are the same way - incredibly fun and interactive. 5 awesome cases - a great value for 1$, no doubt. The last one is a real visual treat as well.-Face capture technology. Something new and fresh. A real improvement to the industry introduced in a game which really needs it the most. The game and the characters feel much more alive and responsive than even before, which provides for a true detective experience.In conclusion, LA Noire is entertaining but inconsistent. Some parts of the game are a masterpiece, some are an unfortunate failure. Overall, definetly worth trying out for both fans of Noir/Detective and non-fans. 7.5/10			"

												Rockstar have done it again. They've created another game with a richer story than you'd get from a modern Hollywood blockbuster.They combined it with a new style of game. L.A. Noire tells the story of Cole Phelps, an LAPD detective in post-war Los-Angeles. While the game has the same look and feel of GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption.L.A. Noire's gameplay is completely different. Gone is the ability to shoot up the average passer-by; as Cole Phelps, you're a good cop in a world of corruption. Instead of pumping lead into the criminals, you now have to coerce information and confessions out of them. Suspects must be interrogated in order to open up new avenues for you to investigate. This game takes a bit of brainpower and skill in order to read whether your suspect is telling the truth, or if they're trying to serve you a plate full of stinking lies. Revolutionary, refreshing and compelling. L.A. Noire will keep you hooked as long as you can appreciate it for what it is.8.5/10			"

												A nice attempt at a detective game, and while the execution is certainly interessting the gameplay has massive logical/coherrence flaws that make it awfully dull down to the point where you can either get 30% wrong or simply use a guide to get everything right.Things that would serve as sufficient indication of the involvement into a crime magically do not matter when not presented along with the right question, and dare you attempt to nail your suspect on a piece of evidence that is just as damning as the one the game wants you to pick then all your evidence can go right to hell - you wont get a confession.It's certainly an impressive production but theres a ton of polishing left to do on it. Nontheless well made, you wont be playing it over and over again but the one time you will, you will enjoy it.			"

												Ugh...I am REALLY conflicted about L.A. Noire. I bought it back during the Steam sale, and I loved the game--or rather, I loved what I was able to play. The game is not technically compatible through Steam with Windows 8, but it initially ran fine on an AMD Radeon 7750. I had buyer's remorse with the AMD card, bought an NVIDIA card with higher benchmark scores, and suddenly the game didn't recognize my new card even though the game supports it. I spent weeks over email trying to resolve the issue with Rockstar, only for them to tell me to run it in compatibility mode (something you can't do through Steam) because it's incompatible with Windows 8. If you have Windows 7/XP, buy this game because it is very well-acted, pretty, and has a very cool approach to being a cop in LA. If you have Windows 8, be very certain your system will run it before purchasing.			"

												If you're okay with finding ways to work around horrible framerate (changing resolution back and forth for me) and an fps cap of 30, you'll find a great game in L.A. Noire. This game is really unique. You get thrown around into every police department, which keeps cases fresh. From homicide to arson, you always have a big case to solve. The face capturing is the best I have ever seen. It's so accurate that you'll recognize many actors' faces. I found it very challenging and rewarding when correctly interrogating suspects. As someone who searches around for treasures and such in games like Uncharted and Bioshock, I enjoyed looking for clues, many of which are well hidden. The DLC is a great edition, with awesome side missions like Nicholson Electroplating and Reefer Madness. The driving is kind of bland, but the 1940s L.A. map is huge and the hidden cars were a nice touch. Plus you can have your partner drive you everywhere if you want. I also found it nice to place a Rockstar game with historically real places, vehicles, criminals, and social paradigms. There are even fictionalized versions of real crimes like the Black Dahlia Murder (which you actually get to solve). Overall, the cinematic feel, great acting and gameplay made L.A. become one of my favorite games. If you're really into mid-19th century film noire, you can even put the game in black and white. Pick up the complete version during the next steam sale.			"

												L.A Noire plays out in the mid-20th century, just after the Second World War. You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a good hearted cop who was a soldier in the pacific during the second world war. The game confronts you with a time period where racism was rampant, drug abuse was growing, and violence was all too common. The city of L.A is one of the major stars in the game. Every street is full of life, with people going in and out of bars and shops, people reading the daily newspaper before going to work. The game feels as though its actually come to life. MotionScan, a neat piece of technology which Team Bondi created to capture the emotions of the characters on screen. It works splendidly, giving each conversation an engrossing hook that typically associated with great film and television dramas. When a character lies, you can see it in their face. Interviewing a suspect is the hardest and most important thing you will do in the game. You ask a question, listen to their response and then attempt to decipher whether it's a lie, the truth or something you should ""doubt"" and inquire further about. You don't only listen to what they saying, but you have to look very carefully at their faces as well. The slightest twitch in there cheek, or there eyes darting quickly to the left can help you uncover the truth. There is more to L.A Noire than just interrogation. There is a fair amount of crime-scene investigation, patrolling and beat work. At crime scenes, you are able to examine the victim up close to try find clues. You will walk around crime scene picking up all sorts of objects to see if they hold any clues. Outside of the regular story. L.A. Noire offers a few other tasks. You can explore the city and look for historic L.A. landmarks, tackle random side mission crimes as they come to you over your C.B. radio, as well as play additional DLC cases. Once you have finished a story, you are ranked to how well you answered questions, how many you got right, and how much damage you did to your car and the the city of L.A. The sounds in the game are amazing, with cars and busses going by, to the sound of the sparks coming from the electric wires as the tram drives past you. The acting is completely believable and really helps set this game apart from other detective games. The Verdict:For all of its attention to detail, L.A. Noire hits the occasional false note. But if you put that aside, L.A Noire can be a very entertaining game, with an open world to explore and lots of interesting cases, The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair. L.A Noire is a perfect game that I would definitely recommend to everyone. Pros:+ Open world of an authentic and outstanding 1940s style of atmosphere+ Memorable story+ Great use of motion capture+ Compelling investigation and interrogation mechanics + Amazing graphics+ Brilliant acting + Amazing soundCons:- Some restrictions during pursuits and shoot-outs feel artificial- Can become a bit repetitive at timesScore: 9/10			"

												As a cinematic experience, LA Noire is very good. It has a stack of content, compelling stories, great voice acting and revolutionary facial animation. It tackles challenging themes in a mature manner. It offers a large area to explore, built with great attention to detail.As a game...it's a mixed bag. The distractions - driving, shooting, tailing and collecting items - are nothing special. The core is the investigation - searching for clues and interrogating witnesses/suspects. The former is decent, with helpful difficulty options. The latter has its moments, both good and keyboard-smashingly bad.Two examples. A witness is asked about a document found in the possession of somebody else. There is no reason to be sure, or even reasonably suspect, that she is aware of it. When she denies knowledge of it, an appropriate choice response would seem to be ""Doubt"". According to the game, it's ""Lie"" - even though her response seems to confirm that she was unaware of it, making the ""Lie"" a strange choice. Even worse, there is another situation where you are expected to select ""Lie"", when the actual lie arises from the response to your challenge upon choosing ""Lie""!The single checkpoint save is also frustrating. Realise you made a mistake (seeing witness in a certain order cuts out a possible question in an early mission, for instance) or encounter a mission-breaking bug after a checkpoint save, and you have to go back to the very beginning - 30+ mins of unskippable dialogue and driving.There's also port issues - a woeful 30fps, graphical pop-in and the like.For all that...it's still a compelling experience. As much as it annoys me, I keep coming back. It may require a new keyboard by the end, but it'll be worth it.			"

												You're one of the LA's finest, a former military veteran who is looking to build a successful career out of law enforcement in 1940's post World War II L.A. with fancy suits and muscle cars. It's men's world.Playing L.A. Noire is like taking part in an interactive movie. It's more than just watching the action as you get to take part in it. And the outcome of the cases is determined on your gut, your attention to detail, and interrogation skills rather than just wating the actor to state their line. If there is at least a tiny bit of detective in you and you want to get to the bottom of things then you'll find the storyline captivating and it will drag you in like honey.As of gameplay, mouse & keyboard combo is tolerable. Walking and running around with keys and using mouse to look/aim works fine most of the time. Driving is slightly awkward when you want to drive straight or especially when trying to take sharp corners in high speed due to the fact that the camera turns slowly behind the vehicle unless your mouse hand is in sync with your keyboard hand. Many times I've ended up smashing bumpers with oncoming traffic or rear fender taking contact with nearby mailbox or lamp post. However, as this is not the most important mechanic I bare with it. Car chases are still fun.Interrogation of people is the one that gives you the most ""what ifs"". Do I believe what this person is saying with their eyes rolling out of their heads or do I push my luck to squeeze the last bit of information they have? Or do I dare to state they're lying and then provide them with evidence that I know what the real case is? And you'd better have the evidence with such allegation or the conversation may be short lived.The gameplay involves occasional chases both on foot and on wheels, some gunfights and brawls. They play out decently not getting too much attention from the story itself. In overall, there's a nice balance of action, seeking and dialogue to my taste and it keeps me tempted to replay a case after a case until I get the gist of how it should have been.If you have no patience and you couldn't care less about the story then this might not be the game for you. But if you're into the era and the mysteries of police detectives then I highly recommend L.A. Noire.			"

												this game was excellent, it's largely something unlike the majority of game experiences i've had. I really enjoyed the interrogation mechanics and the use of the motion capture technology for the actors faces to be realistically portrayed in the game was just awesome.the game loses some steam right after the early sections, it becomes sort of repetitive and the action sequences (driving and shooting sections) are spaced out a little too far for a few hours of gameplay, but make it through this slower section and the game's story and action pick up and hook you into the experience hard enough to push through to the more exciting final chapters of the game.I experienced a few minor technical issues - mostly with the controls at certain sections of the game, navigating tighter spaces when looking for clues can be a bit clunky and the cover shooting mechanics felt very unpolished and I tended to avoid using the cover system because of that.9.5/10 experience overall. Had the pacing been a little better in the second act of the game, and the control issues not been there it could've been a 10/10. These two small issues didn't keep me from loving the game regardless though. Probably a top 10 game of all time for me.get it now			"

												Rockstar have done it again. They've created another game with a richer story than you'd get from a modern Hollywood blockbuster.They combined it with a new style of game. L.A. Noire tells the story of Cole Phelps, an LAPD detective in post-war Los-Angeles. While the game has the same look and feel of GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption.L.A. Noire's gameplay is completely different. Gone is the ability to shoot up the average passer-by; as Cole Phelps, you're a good cop in a world of corruption. Instead of pumping lead into the criminals, you now have to coerce information and confessions out of them. Suspects must be interrogated in order to open up new avenues for you to investigate. This game takes a bit of brainpower and skill in order to read whether your suspect is telling the truth, or if they're trying to serve you a plate full of stinking lies. Revolutionary, refreshing and compelling. L.A. Noire will keep you hooked as long as you can appreciate it for what it is.8.5/10			"

												An investigative TPS that really is one of the most authentic, beautiful, handsomely done games of it's style. That said, nothing I can say will do this game justice.

The story is so driving that you feel great character depth; despite being utterly ♥♥♥♥ing confused in the first few hours of the game with all the seemingly random cinematics.

												L.A. Noire is one of those games that can really surprise you with how good it is. While it has some open world aspects to it, the game is actually quite linear as far as mission structure and story are concerned. This is not a bad thing. It's like watching an old mystery movie, combined with point-and-click game concepts, and GTA mechanics and gameplay. It all fuses together to form a unique game that is very interesting to play through.The visuals are quite good, and even today could be mistaken for next-gen quality. The faces are very expressive, much more so than most games in general. This is because part of the game is about reading your subject when interrogating them to see if they are lying or not.While the different elements of this game are derivative from many games you've probably played before, the experience and setting make this a game feel unique. It is certainly worth the playthrough for just about any gamer.7/10 ""Good""			"

												Wow. Quite an incredible game.Pros: -By far the best facial epxressions I've ever seen in a game, which is good because they play a very key part in interrigations.-Once you learn the classic tells of a liar, interrigations become much more fluid, and less rage inducing.-A very immersive and a great portayal of a 40's detective.-Great music & ambience.Cons:-A tad bit long, I have played this game off and on over the years and only just now beat it.-Not a very good port. The game works but unfortunately there are FPS issues, and not just because it is locked to 30 (often drops to 24, but I found that if it happens, just go to graphics settings, change 1 setting, hit apply, and then it's back to 30-repeat as necessary).-Probably best to play this on a console-although if you get this on steam I strongly recommend switching to PC controls for firefights, and using controller for everything else.

												Another Rockstar so immersion is outstanding, again play with headphones.  The feel of, I'm guessing, 1950s LA is tremendous and is really remeniscent of LA Confidential, so I instantly loved this.The voice acting is really well done indeed and I'm guessing the actors bodies were imaged for each character in this, so it's a big bravo on that.  The story is very impressive and it was excellent to see the main plot ticking over in the background whilst you're following a meandering path, which will eventually lead you to said plot.  The graphics and sound effects were excellent and joined with the innovative element of interrogation you have a winning formula that deserves to be a big fan favourite.  Also hats off to attention to detail with the vehicles.  They had no crumple zones and such in those days, as they were just girders on wheels and if you hit something you really hit it with a crunch.If you don't have this then get it.9/10			"

												WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.Pros:A very well put together narrative, which catalogues the rise and fall of it's characters, in typical Film-noir fashion.Strong, believable characters with excellent delivery both from their respective actors and the awe-inspiring motion-capture technology utilized.Your partners. Their random banter and distinguished personalities are a joy to behold, they act both as the lancer and the foil to Cole's personality, and do an excellent job of playing off of Cole's own musings.Meh's:Lack of penalty for not upholding laws (especially when dealing with traffic), Cole can drive as recklessly as he wants, even right next to other cops without them giving a damn.The structure of the cases, especially between Homicide and Vice. In Homicide, you just finished solving a case that had made a mockery of the LAPD, and in turn, acted as a very rewarding end to that desk. BD would have served as a greater case to end the game with, although given the circumstances, I'm inclined to believe that the narrative was constructed before the individual cases, and that the cases merely served to facilitate Cole's fall from grace.Cons:The save system is check-point based, which is fine, until you realize you have to restart a case and lose an hour's worth of gameplay because the game decides to auto-save after a failed interrogation.Combat, atleast on the PC version, is rather finnicky and temperamental. The gunplay itself works, but the cover system is unresponsive and has baffling key-binds.All in all:If you're willing to deal with slow gameplay coupled with investigatory work and puzzle-solving, this game is right up your alley. It's not a masterpiece, but it will serve as the industry-wide standard for detective games in the future.			"

Their expressions change realistically according to what they are saying and in what context or mood they are in. Surely all the software developers are going to have to use this technique with their characters from now on? Just having lip syncing without facial expressions won't cut it anymore after this.The game itself is original and compelling. I can't think of another game anything like it. I can't believe that it appears that there is no sequel in the works either! It will be a great shame if there's no follow up.Brilliant and totally original.			"

												Respect to Rockstar for originality. Really refreshing gameplay, never played anything like it. Overall pretty much all of the elements are high quality too, nice visuals, great soundtrack, interesting and mature story. The action and driving although far from perfect are decent enough. The investigating, interrogation and story is were the game excels though. Plus I enjoyed the use of the motionscan technology (facial expressions).I did feel it dragged on a bit but remedied by taking a break now and again, one of the main flaws was the most fun part of the game - interrogating suspects and witnesses sometimes failed due to the way the system works and how it is named. Finally it seemed a shame that in such a lovingly crafted and detailed  world there was very little, if any reason to explore away from the main story. A favourite film of mine is Chinatown and LA Noire at points made me feel like I was taking part in my own similar movie. I hope they make a sequel one day and it remains in that era. 9/10 "

It's like watching an old movie where you get search for clues and follow leads.

												Really incredible. The game play itself isn't anything spectacular, but the world that Rockstar has created in 1947 Los Angeles is really something to experience. I have spent hours just driving around, sightseeing, listening to the radio, finding various secrets. My dad lived in L.A. In the mid 50s, so I got to share a bit of his youthful memories through the game. He even recognized the song playing on the radio!An interesting side note: Rockstar used over 180,000 aerial photographs in order to more accurately reproduce that noire feeling of 1940s Los Angeles. Actual radio broadcasts, commercials, and music (The Bickersons, The Jack Benny Program, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald) were also used to further immerse the player.A fun game, but if you're at all into 40s Americana it's worth buying just to cruise down Holywood Blvd in one of the 95 vintage cars listening to Bing Crosby.I certainly enjoyed it!

												You could say L.A. Noire is a GTA where you play the cops, but that would be selling the game short. It's definitely not as ""sandbox"" as its counterpart, since you play through each case in succession. However, every single one of your decisions can have an impact on the rest of the case; and your career.Graphically speaking, there's only one thing that bugs me: the 1940s Los Angeles seems to lack detail, most notably because of a very aggressive LOD policy. Some textures are also low resolution. But it's a very minor thing.The facial animation of this game is just insane and brings an incredible amount of life to the characters; they're really believable, and you can observe the suspects while you're taking notes — it can help you determine whether they're lying or saying the truth. The acting is top notch, and does not seem forced for the most part.The game is slightly confusing at first, but the immersion it offers afterwards is breathtaking. I really recommend playing it.

												This game cured my porn addiction during the Homicide cases! 10/10 No doubt!However, there are in-fact downsides... Even if you do have a computer capable playing Grand Theft Auto IV, you may still suffer very bad gameplay experience because of its limited 30 frames per second refresh rate and some other technical bits about the bad performance of the game...Since this game is not using Rockstar's Advanced Game Engine but a modified unnamed engine, I guess you may find that some driving aspects and shooting mechanics are slight different in the works from GTA IV...Workarounds are of course limited and not throughly proven to fix all solutions surrounding the game, example:-str or Single Threading game setting-nonv to disable nVidia 3D stereoscopic view (if you are using AMD or Intel GPU)-npd works by extending the compatibilty of GPUs which are not in their native supported DirectX version. If you have a DirectX 10 GPU but there's no DX10 option, you better choose DirectX 9 renderer and add -npd to the command lineBut if you managed to iron out (or even ignored) these NG stuffs, you will really get to experience the game at it's best!Played on an Intel Pentium Dual Core processor PC with 2GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics with some drawbacks.

												Tired of running people over and holding up convenience stores?  Well it's time to put on your Badge and take to the mean streets of Los Angeles during the Forties with several big name criminals including the infamous Mickey Cohen.  Any interest in Gangster history in L.A.?  You owe it to yourself to play this IMO entertaining story line.  Also at this point, with this game coming up on four years at time of review and price drops, you may as well pick up the Complete Edition which adds DLC missions, including Reefer Madness, which was a hysterical case to work on.

												LA Noire makes a bit of a compromise between genres to appeal more players, in this case a mix between a free roaming and a Noire novel adventure. I believe that if the whole town was to be depicted in a smaller way, there could have been a far better and deeper rendition of some beautiful places you happen to walk through (and that could have left more resources for other ""details"" as a better plot for some cases and more gameplay depth). As it is, the game is a good adventure that lacks quite a bit of everything to really sparkle. The plot as a whole is interesting, the last chapters and the end are rather...sad and bitter. I think the Metacritic score is quite appropriate, i wouldn't give more than 7,5-7,8 to L.A. Noire.P.s. being a console port, it will perform average at best.			"

Even if you are not a huge crime drama fan, La Norie is still made by Rockstar so there's plenty of things from the story to the gameplay that will keep you hooked until the very end. You play as Cole Phelps, a military veteran that returned to LA as a police officer. You solve cases and go up in ranks. Each case as a unqiue twist and all need speical attention if you want to get the right guy. If you ever thought about how cool it would be to work as a detective than do yourself a favor and pick up this game !			"

												I joined the site when Steam made me an offer I can't refuse which is this game. Borrowed and played it on my Playstation 3 for a while and got bored but something about the ""Noire"" aspect and the era the game is set in drew me back to this title which is why I decided to buy it, this time on PC.After playing just a bit farther than I had in the past, I have to admit that I missed out. I get the hype and I get why people love this game. It has so much more depth as the story progresses. It is beautifully written and most of the actors involved are brilliant (kudos to the casting director!). The story keeps you hooked and if I  was a decade younger I'd be playing this game nonstop from start to finish in one seating.The graphic quality is not on par with its PS3 counterpart, it's better. It's a given that you need a decent GPU to run it and fortunately I got a pretty good one installed on my laptop. Control leaves something to be desired since the mouse can't never replace a Dual Shock controller once a game is optimized for said controller which this game certainly is. But it's still more than playable, just needs some getting used to when inspecting a crime scene. In many ways this game is just as good as the PS3 one just with more customizing options. Get yourself a nice controller and you might be able to enjoy this game more. It's such a shame that the game developer (Bondi) is shut down, we need more games with the same innovation they brought to this one. I mean, performance capture for games? It's absolutely brilliant! Hope other devs would look into the same technology and use it to make story-driven games like this one here.If you have never played the game or don't have a copy of it on Steam or what have you, get this game. It's a classic (literally)!			"

												This is yet another masterpiece of a game delivered by Rockstar. The addition of 'real' facial expressions may seem a bit gimmicky but is essential when questioning suspects. It is up to the game player to determine whether suspects are telling the truth or lying, and this can be done by carefully watching facial expressions. However, if you accuse a suspect of lying you will need to have some kind of proof to back it up. Graphically, the developers has done an amazing job - there does not seem to be a noticable repetition of buildings within the map. Vehicles are rendered beautifully and appear to be fairly faithful to the real things. It is a shame that the game is limited to 30fps on the PC but it is a solid 30fps (played with Fraps running to check). The XBox 360 version has moments where the FPS drops well below 30. Sound is used very well, using a dramatic score when something important is happening in the game. Music is also used during the searching of clues and helps the game player stay within the 'search area'. NPCs have dialogue but it can be quite repetitive. Sound effects are spot on, even down to the sound of aircraft flying high up overhead and chirping birds, etc.L.A. Noire will appeal to gamers who like to think and solves clues. It may appear to be similar to the GTA series but the missions are in no way similar. If you are an arcade game fan this game will not appeal as it is very difficult to pick it up for a quick blast.			"

												My overall impression of the game is - it should have been done differently. Even though I enjoyed its setting and atmosphere, I can't help but think that there are so many things that could have been improved - such as the storytelling (after 35 hours of gameplay I still can't say that I fully understand the main character's motivations) or graphics (beautifully done faces plastered on fake looking bodies didn't exactly work for me). The city is unnecessarily big and, sadly, feels quite empty. Perhaps the game would have been better off without the forced sandbox feel. However, I enjoyed the majority of the cases and would deffinitely want something similar to be developed in the future - just without the aforementioned faults. I'd rate L.A. Noire 7 out of 10 - even with all its small issues, the game managed to hook me for the whole 35 hours. I don't think I will come back to it though; it's just a one-time experience.			"

												This game is underrated, but it is suprisingly an amazing game. In L.A. Noire you're playing as a cop that goes by the name of Cole Phelps. The game takes placein 1940's Los Angeles and I think the game developers did an amazing job creating this game. During thetime you play the game you really get that feeling that the city is supposed to be 1940's L.A., when almost everyone wore a suit and a hat! They actually did a good job with the music as well, because you can only hear old music, and not dubstep or house music.Also, the facial expressions in this game is amazing. Too bad they haven't used this technique in other games.The PC-port for this game has been criticized, and I agree that the PC-port could be alot better. However, the game itself is amazing, the PC-port doesn't ruin the experience of playing the game, in my opinion.			"

												It's like playing a movie, in the best way imaginable.I've seen previews of it, and I was intrigued. I heard more about it and I really got interested. I saw someone demo it and I was immediately sold. This game is not for everyone, however. It has gritty visuals and intense subject matter. If you like the Black Dahlia film or Noir detective stories, you may like this. The sound direction is superb, and the music is very well done. Some tracks can wear on the nerves, but the action tracks put you in the moment.This game plays very well on Windows 7, but crashes do happen on occasion.Overall, this is a very excellent title, and the actors are superb, for the most part. If you watch Mad Men, you may see more familiar faces than just Phelps. This is a huge leap for in-game visuals, as the talking heads do look very good most of the time. Some glitches can be jarring, but they're few.It's a large game, and requres a lot of RAM and a very capable video card. Nevertheless, it's well worth the visit to 1940's Los Angeles if you want a good detective procedural.			"

												This game cured my porn addiction during the Homicide cases! 10/10 No doubt!However, there are in-fact downsides... Even if you do have a computer capable playing Grand Theft Auto IV, you may still suffer very bad gameplay experience because of its limited 30 frames per second refresh rate and some other technical bits about the bad performance of the game...Since this game is not using Rockstar's Advanced Game Engine but a modified unnamed engine, I guess you may find that some driving aspects and shooting mechanics are slight different in the works from GTA IV...Workarounds are of course limited and not throughly proven to fix all solutions surrounding the game, example:-str or Single Threading game setting-nonv to disable nVidia 3D stereoscopic view (if you are using AMD or Intel GPU)-npd works by extending the compatibilty of GPUs which are not in their native supported DirectX version. If you have a DirectX 10 GPU but there's no DX10 option, you better choose DirectX 9 renderer and add -npd to the command lineBut if you managed to iron out (or even ignored) these NG stuffs, you will really get to experience the game at it's best!Played on an Intel Pentium Dual Core processor PC with 2GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics with some drawbacks.

This game really takes overall gaming to the next level; with use of a high tech camera system filming real actors and actresses, you choose if a victim/murderer is lying or telling the truth based off of their facial and vocal expressions. My major problem is that with a simple laptop, I didn't really get the best performance with this game, even on the lowest settings.To rap this up, this game is a must buy for gamers into the mystery/noir genre, and if it's for 4.99; all the better to pick up and play this game.

Undoubtedly compromises had to be made to make them fit which I think were minimal. I also applaud their foresight to employ new technology and use it to create a critical element of the game (face capture).Finally the atmosphere is just great. So much polish, so much attention to detail. It feels a shame this whole world was built and may never be used again.			"

												It's like playing a movie, in the best way imaginable.I've seen previews of it, and I was intrigued. I heard more about it and I really got interested. I saw someone demo it and I was immediately sold. This game is not for everyone, however. It has gritty visuals and intense subject matter. If you like the Black Dahlia film or Noir detective stories, you may like this. The sound direction is superb, and the music is very well done. Some tracks can wear on the nerves, but the action tracks put you in the moment.This game plays very well on Windows 7, but crashes do happen on occasion.Overall, this is a very excellent title, and the actors are superb, for the most part. If you watch Mad Men, you may see more familiar faces than just Phelps. This is a huge leap for in-game visuals, as the talking heads do look very good most of the time. Some glitches can be jarring, but they're few.It's a large game, and requres a lot of RAM and a very capable video card. Nevertheless, it's well worth the visit to 1940's Los Angeles if you want a good detective procedural.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. It has a very amazing story and atmosphere as entertaining as it gets, wonderful level design and top class voice acting. Although it isn't a GTA shooting rampage, there are many cons to this game and the mechanics it takes advantage of along the lines of its un-rivaled motion capture technology used from everything to npc conversation to intense interragations.

												L.A. Noire is a wonderful game with a detailed story. Its packed full of twists and turns at every corner. It gives you an amazing, detailed account of the past and takes you through one of the best detective mysteries thats been written. If you are a fan of Noire material, you'll get a kick out of this. Its challenging, detailed, and can get you at the edge of your seat at the drop of a hat. I highly advise this game if you are a fan of the old times, and if you're a history buff like me. I give L.A. Noire a 10/10.			"

												This game supposedly doesn't work for windows 10 users but after I upated my PC I never had any issues. Aside from that the game is amazing. I still haven't beat it, but I'm really close to the end and so far I love the story. It would seem like the gameplay would get repetative after a while but it's really not. The game constantly has you on the edge of your seat waiting to see where the case takes you next, and believe me, it takes you to some really unexpected places. The whole game revolves around searching crime scenes and various other places related to your current case for clues, interrogating various people, and the occasional fist fight, gun fight, or car chase. This game will teach you right off the bat to pay close attention to detail and never rule anything out. You have you be very thorough with your investigations of crime scenes and anywhere else the game has you search (apartment buildings, bars, railroads, etc.) even the most minute things could be an important clue in helping you solve your case.The interrogations are brought to life by the face caption which essentially puts a real actors face on a game characters body. This helps a lot because the main point of the interrogations is to read the suspects face to determine whether they are lying or not. This would be incredibly difficult to do with a game character's face. You have three options when interrogating someone, they will make their statement and you have to choose truth, doubt, or lie. Truth is pretty obvious, lie is for when you know they are lying and have proof of it, and doubt is for when you think they may be lying but don't have any solid evidence to back you up. Most of the time you can tell if people are lying because they will try to avoid making eye contact, fold their arms, shake their head a lot, etc. Essentially what someone does if they are actually lying to you in real life. You can also tell if they are lying by the way they speak, if they are lying they may stutter a lot, have a lot of voice cracks, or just generally speak in a higher pitched voice. And most of the time if they are telling the truth they will have no hesitation when they speak, they will maintain eye contact, etc. The combat in the game is nothing special, it seems like it was ripped straight out of GTA. This isn't a bad thing because it's not the main focus of the game, and it's still pretty fun nonetheless. But again, nothing special. The car mechanics can be somewhat tedious at times but for the most part it's just like any other game. Nothing new there.There is a lot of sequences where you will find yourself chasing a suspect through a back alley or across rooftops. You can try to gun down the escapee, shoot into the air to scare them, or just try to get close and tackle them.The city of L.A itself is very big and well designed. It looks really good and feels very alive. You can drive around for hours just enjoying the sights of L.A. There is also a lot of side missions and events to keep you entertained.The story is really enjoyable, I don't want to spoil anything, and trust me, you don't want it spoiled for yourself. Just do your best to avoid spoilers and enjoy the story for yourself.The game also has several platforming sections, but uh... we don't talk about those... best to just get them over with and then forget they ever happened in the first place...That's about all I have to say. You should definitely buy this game if you're into detective stuff, or if you just want to have a fun experience.Also, like I said earlier I had no problems launching the game, but if you do I know there is fixes for it. It is definitely worth it still to buy the game, even if you have to do some wonky stuff to get it to work.			"

												First off let me begin with saying how amazing the storyline in this game is. You start off as a LAPD officer named Cole Phelps a former 1st Lt. in the U.S. Army that fought in WWII. All the cases are believable and could all happen in real life. When you interrogate people it feels so real. Even though you can tell when someone is lying you have to show proof how you know they're lying through the clues you have found throughout the case. The gameplay mechanics are also beautiful and the game runs smooth, except for a couple of glitches. Ex: A lady waitress glitched inside of me while I was sitting down and her♥♥♥♥♥was in my face while I was interrogating someone at a club. This definitely gets on the top of my list for best RPG games. Plot 9.5/10Mechanics 9/10In total I'd rate this game a 9/10			"

												Great game, i really recommend it.First of all I have to say that this is the first game i´ve ever played that I really felt like being in a movie, that's a cliché in other games but in this one isn't it, concretely in a film noir, the environment and the style do their best to put in the role, never said better.Special attention to motion capture in faces that shows the care that had the Housers brothers to catch the spirit of cinema in a game with characters a well characterized.But... all that glitters is not gold, the game have some negative aspects for example the imprecise system to cover and movements.But for me the main lack is in the script, basically i think that is better that the Houser bros has dedicated to videogames because the story never had a engaging script, with a not very good ending.Even that things I think that is ""you must play"" for all the people who love noir cinema, or just wanna have a different experience in gaming.

												A great experiment with mixed results, the use of face capture technology is very impressive but probably won't age well. Tying the unique tech to an interrogation mechanic is a great idea, though sometimes the interrogations themselves can be frustrating and illogical, even to the point that I'd just restart the mission if it became a wash. Shooting and driving are both passable and functional, except for a frustrating sequence in the finale which involves way more shooting than the rest of the game. What I love most about this game is its adherence to Noir style, complete with all the backstabbing intrigue that comes with it. Nearly every Noir trope is in full effect here, and there's some truly excellent acting to be found, on par with Hollywood productions, probably because there are a great deal of talented character actors involved that you'll probably recognize from this thing or that. The story is solid and kept me hooked, and its final scene is brilliantly delivered. As with others I've enjoyed, this is a game I recommend not for the strength of its mechanics, but for its ""feel"", and in terms of making you feel like a hard-boiled Noir detective, you won't find anything better on the market.

												A great game that has an interesting setting and gameplay mechanic.The game world is based around post-WWII LA.  The story is focused around detective work on various cases that range from traffic crimes, to homicide, to arson, and vice cases.  Each case has clues you have to discover as the scene and from the various people you question about the case.  Finding more clues gives you more options in questioning.  The question mechanics involves you paying attention to how the person acts, basically you’re trying to tell if they did the crime, had a part in it, or are innocent.  This mechanic also extends to trying to get information out of some people, i.e. do you gently try get more information or go on the aggressive and force them to tell you.  The better you do at questioning and clue finding will result in a higher case score.If you have trouble questioning people there are points you can spend to either narrow the choices or if you’re online can see what the majority did.  These points are earned through various success levels on completion of a case, i.e. the better you do the more points you get.The cases are divided into the various desks you work at while on the force.  Each desk also represents a promotion in rank on the force.  Due to the theme of the game some of these cases can be extremely graphic and like with the age and culture your dealing with the language can also be mature.Gameplay involves you or your partner driving to the scene of the crime.  If you drive you'll be able to do side missions, street crimes, that come in from dispatch while you’re on the road.  These street crimes are not the best element of the game as they mostly have you running and gunning down criminals, they get repetitive quickly.  Once at the scene of the crime you’re able to look for clues and get information from other characters (other officers, the coroner, and witnesses), from there it tracking down leads, questioning people, and the occasional car chase.Overall, the game does provide a unique experience and is definitely worth picking up.  However, you should buy the Complete Edition as it adds a number of cases that extend gameplay, without them, I wouldn't advise picking up the game.  The reason is because there are some desks that don't have many cases and the additional content adds a lot more meat to the game. If you don’t own the game and see it on for a 75% off or higher sale I’d highly recommend picking it up.  Game length would be about 40-50 hours if you do most or all of what it has to offer.			"

												L.A. Noire is an incredible interactive experience where you play the role of a detective in a wide variety of different police cases. The first noticeable thing is the amazing detail of the faces. And this is important because it is the player's job to determine whether people are telling the truth or lying based on their facial expressions during interviews.The gameplay is essentially broken down into driving to different scenes, searching for clues, interviewing people, and occasionally chasing down suspects. It is really unlike any other game on the market and it does a great job at drawing you in. Musical chimes are used to let you know when you are next to something relevant so it is important to keep an open ear.The story feels realistic and is broken into shorter chapters meaning it's easy to pick up again after not playing it for a while. The acting is superb. All the characters feel genuine and it is obvious they put their heart and soul into their roles adding to that sense of realism. The game also showcases some great music as well. With 30+ hours of enjoyment, this is a must play game in my book.			"

Go and assist other crimes. Or just don't. Be a good boy and run after your fleeing suspects, or shoot them down.Drive carefully, or be a gung-ho.It's all up to you. The character conversations are incredible. The lip-sync used in this, is just the best i've ever seen. At the beginning, i had to just open a browser, and confirm if that voice was Liam Neeson's.

												I joined the site when Steam made me an offer I can't refuse which is this game. Borrowed and played it on my Playstation 3 for a while and got bored but something about the ""Noire"" aspect and the era the game is set in drew me back to this title which is why I decided to buy it, this time on PC.After playing just a bit farther than I had in the past, I have to admit that I missed out. I get the hype and I get why people love this game. It has so much more depth as the story progresses. It is beautifully written and most of the actors involved are brilliant (kudos to the casting director!). The story keeps you hooked and if I  was a decade younger I'd be playing this game nonstop from start to finish in one seating.The graphic quality is not on par with its PS3 counterpart, it's better. It's a given that you need a decent GPU to run it and fortunately I got a pretty good one installed on my laptop. Control leaves something to be desired since the mouse can't never replace a Dual Shock controller once a game is optimized for said controller which this game certainly is. But it's still more than playable, just needs some getting used to when inspecting a crime scene. In many ways this game is just as good as the PS3 one just with more customizing options. Get yourself a nice controller and you might be able to enjoy this game more. It's such a shame that the game developer (Bondi) is shut down, we need more games with the same innovation they brought to this one. I mean, performance capture for games? It's absolutely brilliant! Hope other devs would look into the same technology and use it to make story-driven games like this one here.If you have never played the game or don't have a copy of it on Steam or what have you, get this game. It's a classic (literally)!			"

												L.A. Noire is a game released in 2011 by Rockstar Games and Team Bondi. You play as Cole Phelps, who just entered the police department of Los Angeles. You'll play as him, you'll have to solve all sorts of cases. Nearly all the characters of the game are really charismatic, and you'll love some of them and hate others. The story is really attractive and you'll not stop playing this game till you have finish it. When i play it for the first time i was like ""Well it just looks like a Movie-Game"" then i finished it and i said ""Wow, i need to get all achievements for this game !"" So i did this, after 40 hours i got them all. If you play the game without trying to get all achievements I guess 10/15hours is enough to finish it, it's already a nice lifetime for a game like that. Once again, Rockstar prove that they can do something else that GTA and that the render is awesome. If you want to get all cases with 5 stars without any guide/walkthrough, i can tell you that you'll have some difficulties.. The game have such a growing difficulty, i mean at the begginning it's quite easy, items you need to find are easy to find, people that you investigate doesn't hide that much their expressions, but when you're at the middle of the game it's getting harder and then at the end, harder again :)As i said before, the story is really branching i mean, i was re-acting as the ingame characters, and the cases are interesting. If i had to rate this game it would be: -Graphics 19/20-Gameplay 18/20-Audio 20/20 (depends of you but, i loved it)-Accessibility 18/20GLOBAL RATE: 18.75/20 Hope you enjoy that review, leave a like if you did :P			"

												L.A Noire plays out in the mid-20th century, just after the Second World War. You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a good hearted cop who was a soldier in the pacific during the second world war. The game confronts you with a time period where racism was rampant, drug abuse was growing, and violence was all too common. The city of L.A is one of the major stars in the game. Every street is full of life, with people going in and out of bars and shops, people reading the daily newspaper before going to work. The game feels as though its actually come to life. MotionScan, a neat piece of technology which Team Bondi created to capture the emotions of the characters on screen. It works splendidly, giving each conversation an engrossing hook that typically associated with great film and television dramas. When a character lies, you can see it in their face. Interviewing a suspect is the hardest and most important thing you will do in the game. You ask a question, listen to their response and then attempt to decipher whether it's a lie, the truth or something you should ""doubt"" and inquire further about. You don't only listen to what they saying, but you have to look very carefully at their faces as well. The slightest twitch in there cheek, or there eyes darting quickly to the left can help you uncover the truth. There is more to L.A Noire than just interrogation. There is a fair amount of crime-scene investigation, patrolling and beat work. At crime scenes, you are able to examine the victim up close to try find clues. You will walk around crime scene picking up all sorts of objects to see if they hold any clues. Outside of the regular story. L.A. Noire offers a few other tasks. You can explore the city and look for historic L.A. landmarks, tackle random side mission crimes as they come to you over your C.B. radio, as well as play additional DLC cases. Once you have finished a story, you are ranked to how well you answered questions, how many you got right, and how much damage you did to your car and the the city of L.A. The sounds in the game are amazing, with cars and busses going by, to the sound of the sparks coming from the electric wires as the tram drives past you. The acting is completely believable and really helps set this game apart from other detective games. The Verdict:For all of its attention to detail, L.A. Noire hits the occasional false note. But if you put that aside, L.A Noire can be a very entertaining game, with an open world to explore and lots of interesting cases, The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair. L.A Noire is a perfect game that I would definitely recommend to everyone. Pros:+ Open world of an authentic and outstanding 1940s style of atmosphere+ Memorable story+ Great use of motion capture+ Compelling investigation and interrogation mechanics + Amazing graphics+ Brilliant acting + Amazing soundCons:- Some restrictions during pursuits and shoot-outs feel artificial- Can become a bit repetitive at timesScore: 9/10			"

												As a cinematic experience, LA Noire is very good. It has a stack of content, compelling stories, great voice acting and revolutionary facial animation. It tackles challenging themes in a mature manner. It offers a large area to explore, built with great attention to detail.As a game...it's a mixed bag. The distractions - driving, shooting, tailing and collecting items - are nothing special. The core is the investigation - searching for clues and interrogating witnesses/suspects. The former is decent, with helpful difficulty options. The latter has its moments, both good and keyboard-smashingly bad.Two examples. A witness is asked about a document found in the possession of somebody else. There is no reason to be sure, or even reasonably suspect, that she is aware of it. When she denies knowledge of it, an appropriate choice response would seem to be ""Doubt"". According to the game, it's ""Lie"" - even though her response seems to confirm that she was unaware of it, making the ""Lie"" a strange choice. Even worse, there is another situation where you are expected to select ""Lie"", when the actual lie arises from the response to your challenge upon choosing ""Lie""!The single checkpoint save is also frustrating. Realise you made a mistake (seeing witness in a certain order cuts out a possible question in an early mission, for instance) or encounter a mission-breaking bug after a checkpoint save, and you have to go back to the very beginning - 30+ mins of unskippable dialogue and driving.There's also port issues - a woeful 30fps, graphical pop-in and the like.For all that...it's still a compelling experience. As much as it annoys me, I keep coming back. It may require a new keyboard by the end, but it'll be worth it.			"

												Play as Detective Phelps the meanest mofo since that Fabio guy from Assassins Creed. This guys elbows put lightsabers to shame. Talk to people and suss out whether or not they are full of it. Most of the time if they look like they're lying, they're telling the truth. What's up with that? Also one of the first missions is all like some dudes robbing a bank you kill these guys with no repercussions, nothing at all. This guy is not only above the law he is the law. Is he Judge Dredd? Maybe. The driviing in this game is hectically bad, maybe Phelps is actually a massive alcoholic but it only effects his driving? Anyway Phelps ends up stabbing one to many people with his elbows and♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down I dont understand why, he cant help his elbosexual urges. This game seems pretty good. Razorbladeelbows/10			"

												To start with, I can honestly say I've never had a love for a video game like I've had for L.A. Noire. The graphics are not the greatest ever seen, detail in objects lacks; how ever during interrogations, facial expressions are very well drawn. I don't full-on action games, I like ones that have a strong story line to aid it; L.A. Noire's story is the best graphical story I've come across so far. The characters are very well described throughout the story and scenes in the game make you think. There is no shortage of surprises and suspense is not scarce. If you're one to enjoy a mysterious but thrilling action game (with some very nice jazz in the background), then L.A. Noire is without competition.			"

This game is a visual pleasure.- The storyline is quite interesting.- Acting and voice overs are unparalleled.Cons:- The interface is clunky, probably the result of a poor conversion from console.- You don't get to do much and what you get to do is somehow repetitive (click here, find clue, choose questions to interrogate suspects, action sequence, end of story)Overall it's a nice to have game just for the visuals, the sounds and to show off how ""cool"" a computer game could be, but it definitely lacks depth, has zero replayability and does not offer much.

												This game is a masterpiece,people who complain about the framerate problems don't know what a community forum is,not to mention how easy it is to fix.It has everything you ever wanted:action,mystery,drugs,a good ol' M1 garand and last but not least a plentiful supply of child molesters.Since im an overachiever (and since I have no life) I completed the achievments where you need to find 50 golden reels and drive all of the cars,and that was painful,took me like 8 hours.The ending killed a part of me.The game is similar to GTA in certain aspects like driving and combat but here your the good guy.No, hollywoodland and vinewood are not set in the same world.Features things to keep you busy with like street crimes and running around the map to find police badges,or those damn reels.The sound of Cole turning a victim's head still hurts to think about.Pick it up on a sale with the dlc,it offers great a bunch of new cases to solve.Oh... and this: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/281847490928408325/F370376017E37670BBD81AC608E3B1B3D7BF2504/(No spoilers).

												WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.Pros:A very well put together narrative, which catalogues the rise and fall of it's characters, in typical Film-noir fashion.Strong, believable characters with excellent delivery both from their respective actors and the awe-inspiring motion-capture technology utilized.Your partners. Their random banter and distinguished personalities are a joy to behold, they act both as the lancer and the foil to Cole's personality, and do an excellent job of playing off of Cole's own musings.Meh's:Lack of penalty for not upholding laws (especially when dealing with traffic), Cole can drive as recklessly as he wants, even right next to other cops without them giving a damn.The structure of the cases, especially between Homicide and Vice. In Homicide, you just finished solving a case that had made a mockery of the LAPD, and in turn, acted as a very rewarding end to that desk. BD would have served as a greater case to end the game with, although given the circumstances, I'm inclined to believe that the narrative was constructed before the individual cases, and that the cases merely served to facilitate Cole's fall from grace.Cons:The save system is check-point based, which is fine, until you realize you have to restart a case and lose an hour's worth of gameplay because the game decides to auto-save after a failed interrogation.Combat, atleast on the PC version, is rather finnicky and temperamental. The gunplay itself works, but the cover system is unresponsive and has baffling key-binds.All in all:If you're willing to deal with slow gameplay coupled with investigatory work and puzzle-solving, this game is right up your alley. It's not a masterpiece, but it will serve as the industry-wide standard for detective games in the future.			"

												Well, the game is broken. Most people can't seem to launch it since a recent patch, hence the many negative reviews. However, one community member, namely Nightbreed, found a solution to make the game work fairly easily. And it is reported by many members to work.You can find his solution here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/110800/discussions/0/366298942102103678/So, once we're through with launching the game (even though Rockstar tried hard to make it impossible), we have a nice game after all. There is noire, there are realistic facial expressions (which we have to learn how to read if we want to crack all the cases), and the story itself creates a nice atmosphere. Maybe one of the greatest trait of this game is that it's one of a kind. Trust me, there might be other detective games, but none other recreates the unique game experience that L.A. Noire provides. It's not action pumped, although it does have shootings once in a while, but instead it entrails us with well written dialogues, interesting, and often mind-boggling cases, a knack of humour, all presented to us in a 50's style, with a hint of noire in it.One of the greatest cons I could highlight from this game is a technical one: As it seems, the game is limited at 30fps, so those who have a keen eye for 60fps and beyond, might need some time to get used to it.Other than that, if we get past that tiny little thing, that the game doesn't start in it's original form, I could hardly come up with cons. And why would I?Fix the game, then play the hell out of it. Case closed.			"

OLDER VERSION OF THE REVIEW HERE***************************************************THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE GAME ITSELF, BUT ITS CURRENT PLAYABILITYAs you might notice from a lot of recent reviews, L.A. Noire is currently unplayable on Windows 10 64bit, and perhaps other operating systems too.I tried all the fixes out there, checked the integrity of .NET framework (both 3.5 and 4), have latest upgrades and drivers installed. Compatibility modes, run game as administrator, run Steam as administrator, reinstall, check game cache, everything. Nothing worked.It just shows the loading screen after the loader and stops working. Windows Event Viewer shows an error saying 0x40000015 unknown application exception. The faulty module is MSVCR90.dll (part of VS2008 runtime, THIS IS NOT THE MISSING MSVCR90.DLL PROBLEM).Seems like the problem has persisted for quite a while, and Rockstar isn't too keen on fixing it (and has one of the worst customer support websites out there).This is the reason of a negative review - I am yet to play the game. If they fix it at all, that is.The reason why there aren't more negative reviews out here is that I was forced to farm ""playtime"" by repeatedly trying to launch the game to be able to write this time.

												Despite the apparent playtime I have not actually gotten past the launcher for this game.

												I just installed this on a new computer stong enough to run it, and all the sudden it won't launch. Rockstar did some update or patch that screwed it up to where it won't launch. I haven't had a chance to really play it yet to where it's more than 4-6fps at the lowest graphic settings possible. Now I have a super computer and was hoping to get deep in this game, but now it's broken.			"

												What is so amazing about a 2011 game and a love letter to old noire movies like ""The Untouchables"" and ""The Black Dahlia"" from rockstar and team bondi that puts you into the shoes of a rookie detective Cole Phelps? Everything. L.A. Noire is all about amazing you with its crisp gameplay, groundbreaking facial capture technology (at the time), and great atmosphere and setting.Set in 1946 Los Angeles, the second world war has come to a close and living soldiers have to make a living somehow. Cole Phelps decides to go into law enforcement, and the story ramps up from there, no spoilers at all from me, you just have to trust me. I bought this game on my xbox360, ps3, and now my tablet, (surface 3), and the game still manages to feel new to me. The controls on PC are great, I love the default control, but you can easily adjust and edit those controls in the options. You can use any game controller as well. One thing for tablets though, using the right click if you have no mouse gets troublesome pretty fast, but for desktop users it is fluid, no doubt.The graphics are beautiful, but the game is capped at 30FPS (I believe) and that might bug people, but you can always tinker with the graphics in  game anytime. ANYTIME. No more launcher people!Facial capture technology is what really shines here though, as it displays the emotions and ""tells"", (which you need for interrogations and questioning people at the crime scene). perfectly. The gameplay is fun if you like puzzle games, third person games, story rich games, or even just noire like games. The feeling and atmosphere as stated above is just incredible. Just incredible! It has.... Puzzle solving and deducing. Gunplay. Car chases and on foot chases. Hand to Hand combat. Tough decision making. Drivingand more.The length of this game is also fantastic, though near the end, I began to lose track of the story as I didn't like something that happens. I won't spoil it completely, but you'll know what I mean. Why was that necessary? Stick with the ideas you had. Not to mention, I didn't entirely get the ending, it is a bit underwhelming, and very unexpected.All in all though, this game is definitely worth a buy, even more if you can pick it up on sale. Here's to hoping for L.A. Noire 2 folks :)Get Cole Phelp'd			"

												Rockstar have done it again. They've created another game with a richer story than you'd get from a modern Hollywood blockbuster.They combined it with a new style of game. L.A. Noire tells the story of Cole Phelps, an LAPD detective in post-war Los-Angeles. While the game has the same look and feel of GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption.L.A. Noire's gameplay is completely different. Gone is the ability to shoot up the average passer-by; as Cole Phelps, you're a good cop in a world of corruption. Instead of pumping lead into the criminals, you now have to coerce information and confessions out of them. Suspects must be interrogated in order to open up new avenues for you to investigate. This game takes a bit of brainpower and skill in order to read whether your suspect is telling the truth, or if they're trying to serve you a plate full of stinking lies. Revolutionary, refreshing and compelling. L.A. Noire will keep you hooked as long as you can appreciate it for what it is.8.5/10			"

												Play as a detective in post war L.A. and solve multiple cases. The characters' facial animations have been done in a totally new way and it looks superb. Their expressions change realistically according to what they are saying and in what context or mood they are in. Surely all the software developers are going to have to use this technique with their characters from now on? Just having lip syncing without facial expressions won't cut it anymore after this.The game itself is original and compelling. I can't think of another game anything like it. I can't believe that it appears that there is no sequel in the works either! It will be a great shame if there's no follow up.Brilliant and totally original.			"

												Wow. Quite an incredible game.Pros: -By far the best facial epxressions I've ever seen in a game, which is good because they play a very key part in interrigations.-Once you learn the classic tells of a liar, interrigations become much more fluid, and less rage inducing.-A very immersive and a great portayal of a 40's detective.-Great music & ambience.Cons:-A tad bit long, I have played this game off and on over the years and only just now beat it.-Not a very good port. The game works but unfortunately there are FPS issues, and not just because it is locked to 30 (often drops to 24, but I found that if it happens, just go to graphics settings, change 1 setting, hit apply, and then it's back to 30-repeat as necessary).-Probably best to play this on a console-although if you get this on steam I strongly recommend switching to PC controls for firefights, and using controller for everything else.

												Tired of being criminal in every open world game?, tired of open world games olny being about slaughtering innocent people?, welcome to L.A Noire, where missions are olny things to do. This Story driven 1940s game world is a bit empty, but story is quite good, some times i felt i drove most of the mission time. But good animations, and thrilling cases made it up. And how can i forget you can collect list of cars, film reels and police badges to spend free time in the city. This game is on to something, but still could evolve to something beatiful, Best played once.			"

												Okay so all my life I have been a fan of mystery and noire movies, so much I wanted to play a game taking place in the 1940's but never found quite a good game. Until I ran across l.a noire is so amazing I was not able to play on pc due to my computer not being the best and it would lag to much on important parts of the game however I did love this game so much I bought it for xbox and started the game over and finished it. It's like watching an old movie where you get search for clues and follow leads. The interrogations feel so real and great I love the fact you get to choose who to convict after looking at the evidence with multiple suspects in a case. Great game 10/10 if you love noire movies and mystery BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW			"

												LA Noire is a unique and fun game in the aspect of how it plays. The main goals are to collect clues, interview witnesses and solve crimes with a cast of very real characters. I don't mean this lightly, having worked in security and talking with LEO, the different characters are people you will or have met before. The game is nearly six years old now, but still feels and looks pretty modern. Casual and veteran players alike will enjoy most of the game. People living in LA will appreciate the games setting and take on a fictional 1940s. Don't come in expecting action like GTA, it's quite the opposite, but in a nice way. Think of it like listening to music from this time compared to modern tracks. Where I feel the game lacks is namely it's pace after a certain point of the game and it's main character, Cole Phelps. Much like Zero Punctuations comments, Cole comes off as a robot and for me I don't see much change at all. It makes controlling him quite boring after a certain point. Yes, he is a straight as arrow cop wanting to redeem himself, but he's so detached for most of the game it feels a bit akward and the few times he does seem to show emotion or connect, it's almost like filler. Lastly is the ending, I won't spoil it, but to me it felt lackluster and as if the team inteded to make a sequel, but got canned before they could. I still would recommend the game for it's unique approach to gameplay, but don't go in believing all the hype, because honestly, if they had made Cole develop as a character more, and the ending a bit more concluded, I felt the game would have overall been a fair bit better.

												Fun detective game.  Before you engage in interogating or talking to anyone, search the area for clues.  You can back out of some conversation but once you blow it, you have to reload.Facial animations are incredible, like Deus Ex or better.  But I can't say they're as accurate, sometimes when I think someone is lying they're telling the truth, and when their body language says they're lying, they're telling the truth, or when they seem to be telling the truth they're lying, vice versa.  I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, just seems hard to tell sometimes.  You have a cheat ""intuition"" system that helps you deduce these investisgations, pretty handy.Locked at 30fps, can force 60fps with 3rd party software (Artmoney works).  Awesome at 60, facial animations a little buggy, mostly their blinking is too fast, so they look a little nervy.$5-6 on sale.			"

												The suspect was taken into the station. I searched the place for more clues. Didn't get much out of it. I went back to interrogate the suspect. He was with me on okinawa, he was never really my friend, but he wasn't really my enemy. I started with small talk about the war back in the day. But he's fed up and said cut the crap. So i started questioning him about the murder. He got no alibi at the time of death. It was a simple question, but a complex answer.Now the hard part, I have to decide. Is it the truth? Or a doubt? Or maybe a lie. I decided to trust him. And he gave me another lead. I went on with that lead with my partner. It was pretty convincing, so i decided to take him as another suspect and brought him to the station. While searching the place, i found the murder weapon and proceed to interrogate him. He gave an alibi. I chose the lie, and show him the evidence. I charged him, and the DA will do the work next.I went home, not to the usual place. It was a blue room, i saw an angel singing i always kill.  I was tempted. The next morning i went to the office, there's another murder. So i went to the crime scene, expecting a new body.

OLDER VERSION OF THE REVIEW HERE***************************************************THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE GAME ITSELF, BUT ITS CURRENT PLAYABILITYAs you might notice from a lot of recent reviews, L.A. Noire is currently unplayable on Windows 10 64bit, and perhaps other operating systems too.I tried all the fixes out there, checked the integrity of .NET framework (both 3.5 and 4), have latest upgrades and drivers installed. Compatibility modes, run game as administrator, run Steam as administrator, reinstall, check game cache, everything. Nothing worked.It just shows the loading screen after the loader and stops working. Windows Event Viewer shows an error saying 0x40000015 unknown application exception. The faulty module is MSVCR90.dll (part of VS2008 runtime, THIS IS NOT THE MISSING MSVCR90.DLL PROBLEM).Seems like the problem has persisted for quite a while, and Rockstar isn't too keen on fixing it (and has one of the worst customer support websites out there).This is the reason of a negative review - I am yet to play the game. If they fix it at all, that is.The reason why there aren't more negative reviews out here is that I was forced to farm ""playtime"" by repeatedly trying to launch the game to be able to write this time.

												It's like playing a movie, in the best way imaginable.I've seen previews of it, and I was intrigued. I heard more about it and I really got interested. I saw someone demo it and I was immediately sold. This game is not for everyone, however. It has gritty visuals and intense subject matter. If you like the Black Dahlia film or Noir detective stories, you may like this. The sound direction is superb, and the music is very well done. Some tracks can wear on the nerves, but the action tracks put you in the moment.This game plays very well on Windows 7, but crashes do happen on occasion.Overall, this is a very excellent title, and the actors are superb, for the most part. If you watch Mad Men, you may see more familiar faces than just Phelps. This is a huge leap for in-game visuals, as the talking heads do look very good most of the time. Some glitches can be jarring, but they're few.It's a large game, and requres a lot of RAM and a very capable video card. Nevertheless, it's well worth the visit to 1940's Los Angeles if you want a good detective procedural.			"

												Worth reviewing for a lump of coal or a badge. However...Highly engrossing. Some say it's repetitious, probably due to each case essentially having you starting from scratch. I don't see how it's any different to highly popular crime shows. Watch a whole DVD of that in one sitting and I'm sure you'll see repetition too.It was a very ambitious choice to mix a number of elements. Undoubtedly compromises had to be made to make them fit which I think were minimal. I also applaud their foresight to employ new technology and use it to create a critical element of the game (face capture).Finally the atmosphere is just great. So much polish, so much attention to detail. It feels a shame this whole world was built and may never be used again.			"

												What is so amazing about a 2011 game and a love letter to old noire movies like ""The Untouchables"" and ""The Black Dahlia"" from rockstar and team bondi that puts you into the shoes of a rookie detective Cole Phelps? Everything. L.A. Noire is all about amazing you with its crisp gameplay, groundbreaking facial capture technology (at the time), and great atmosphere and setting.Set in 1946 Los Angeles, the second world war has come to a close and living soldiers have to make a living somehow. Cole Phelps decides to go into law enforcement, and the story ramps up from there, no spoilers at all from me, you just have to trust me. I bought this game on my xbox360, ps3, and now my tablet, (surface 3), and the game still manages to feel new to me. The controls on PC are great, I love the default control, but you can easily adjust and edit those controls in the options. You can use any game controller as well. One thing for tablets though, using the right click if you have no mouse gets troublesome pretty fast, but for desktop users it is fluid, no doubt.The graphics are beautiful, but the game is capped at 30FPS (I believe) and that might bug people, but you can always tinker with the graphics in  game anytime. ANYTIME. No more launcher people!Facial capture technology is what really shines here though, as it displays the emotions and ""tells"", (which you need for interrogations and questioning people at the crime scene). perfectly. The gameplay is fun if you like puzzle games, third person games, story rich games, or even just noire like games. The feeling and atmosphere as stated above is just incredible. Just incredible! It has.... Puzzle solving and deducing. Gunplay. Car chases and on foot chases. Hand to Hand combat. Tough decision making. Drivingand more.The length of this game is also fantastic, though near the end, I began to lose track of the story as I didn't like something that happens. I won't spoil it completely, but you'll know what I mean. Why was that necessary? Stick with the ideas you had. Not to mention, I didn't entirely get the ending, it is a bit underwhelming, and very unexpected.All in all though, this game is definitely worth a buy, even more if you can pick it up on sale. Here's to hoping for L.A. Noire 2 folks :)Get Cole Phelp'd			"

												LA Noire is a unique and fun game in the aspect of how it plays. The main goals are to collect clues, interview witnesses and solve crimes with a cast of very real characters. I don't mean this lightly, having worked in security and talking with LEO, the different characters are people you will or have met before. The game is nearly six years old now, but still feels and looks pretty modern. Casual and veteran players alike will enjoy most of the game. People living in LA will appreciate the games setting and take on a fictional 1940s. Don't come in expecting action like GTA, it's quite the opposite, but in a nice way. Think of it like listening to music from this time compared to modern tracks. Where I feel the game lacks is namely it's pace after a certain point of the game and it's main character, Cole Phelps. Much like Zero Punctuations comments, Cole comes off as a robot and for me I don't see much change at all. It makes controlling him quite boring after a certain point. Yes, he is a straight as arrow cop wanting to redeem himself, but he's so detached for most of the game it feels a bit akward and the few times he does seem to show emotion or connect, it's almost like filler. Lastly is the ending, I won't spoil it, but to me it felt lackluster and as if the team inteded to make a sequel, but got canned before they could. I still would recommend the game for it's unique approach to gameplay, but don't go in believing all the hype, because honestly, if they had made Cole develop as a character more, and the ending a bit more concluded, I felt the game would have overall been a fair bit better.

Its gameplay is new, innovative, and intriguing and the story is a good one. There is a lot of content here and all of it is fantastic. 1940s L.A. is beautiful and one of my favorite game settings ever. The story has some great twists and is good overall, but the ending is abrupt and doesn't work as well as it could've. In the end, L.A. Noire is a must play as it is unlike anything out there. it's not the best game out there, but it is quite high up there.			"

												Note: Review based on console version. Don't let the low play time fool you!LA Noire is a wonderful experience in gaming. There aren't many games like this out there, which is a shame. Take on the role of a Police officer in post WWII Los Angeles. The city has been lovingly re-created with all the streets and famous landmarks. However, don't expect a GTA style sandbox; this game is very linear and all about the main story. Also, while the city has been expertly crafted, you won't be given much reason to explore it; no non-mission specific buildings are able to be entered and there is very little to no interactivity with anything in the city. Getting past those faults though, this is a great detective game with a unique twist. You must read the facial expressions of the people you interogate and make assumptions based on that. While this doesn't always work smoothly, it's super cool trying to read the characters and try and tell if they're lying or not. This game also has a great style. If you couldn't tell, it's a classic Noire style presentation and can even be played in black and white (recommended for that legitimate noire feel). This game is not for everyone. It can be slow and after finishing the game, some may not want to replay missions when they already know whodunnit. If it does pique your interest though, pick this up on sale.			"

												I just finished the game and I'm looking for a word to describe it but I can't find any other than 'masterpiece'. I got the Complete Edition, invested 40+ hours in it and enjoyed every single bit. I am going to write some  pros and cons and I want to mention that the cons are purely subjective.+ Remarcably designed city and cars.+ Formidable and progressively complex cases.+ Well made characters and personalities.+ Tons of historical, cinematical and musical references. I believe the work invested in the game's documentation was huge.+ Educational stuff.+ Much attention payed to the details even if sometimes there are mismatches.+ Intermission movies.+ Great soundtrack.+ Jack Kelso .- Car control (sometimes). It is true that the game's main goal are the cases themself but the cars and the driving  constitue a substantial part of it. The cars doesn't feel heavy enough and the driving is really arcadish especially during some chases. I don't say that it's ruining the game, it's not a car simulator, but it was a bit disappointing.- Enemies never shoot you when you are climbing a drain pipe. - The gunfights are pretty much easy. Except for a few, gunbattles are not challenging at all. Taking less damage before you fall it could have been more interesting or bad guys with better accuracy.- Jack Kelso parts. Too short and too few. I loved that character and his side of the story and it wouldn't hurt to add a bit more of it.- The ending. Left me with many unanswered questions. I was waiting for a more detailed explanation of the latest events. But I won't give any spoilers. Overall this game was a great experience. I would give it a 10 for the design, 9+ for the action and 11 for the research behind it. Therefore I recommend it with great, great pleasure.			"

The game play is amazing, and to be honest im gonna leave it towards other people to go on about that. I just wanted to put my peice out there saying that this game is worth your money.But also because i wanted to end all the claims of how bad a port it really is. Yes it is not the best port, but compared to  GTA IV and its GFWL port, it's pretty damn good. People saying 30fps is a con are just wrong, flat out wrong. People need to put it under a plus. 30fps is so smooth in this game, because the engine was NOT designed for 60fps. I myself have played about half an hour at an uncapped 60fps and i couldn't go on any longer, while yes it looks smooth as ♥♥♥♥, the driving is horrible, like driving on a ice skating rink and the brakes don't work, and the facial animations look worse.To fix the framerate though because it does have trouble keeping a solid 30fps. Copy and paste this in your command line in the launch options.-npd -str -nonvIt works for most people, including me.			"

You'll play as him, you'll have to solve all sorts of cases. Nearly all the characters of the game are really charismatic, and you'll love some of them and hate others. The story is really attractive and you'll not stop playing this game till you have finish it. When i play it for the first time i was like ""Well it just looks like a Movie-Game"" then i finished it and i said ""Wow, i need to get all achievements for this game !"" So i did this, after 40 hours i got them all. If you play the game without trying to get all achievements I guess 10/15hours is enough to finish it, it's already a nice lifetime for a game like that. Once again, Rockstar prove that they can do something else that GTA and that the render is awesome. If you want to get all cases with 5 stars without any guide/walkthrough, i can tell you that you'll have some difficulties.. The game have such a growing difficulty, i mean at the begginning it's quite easy, items you need to find are easy to find, people that you investigate doesn't hide that much their expressions, but when you're at the middle of the game it's getting harder and then at the end, harder again :)As i said before, the story is really branching i mean, i was re-acting as the ingame characters, and the cases are interesting. If i had to rate this game it would be: -Graphics 19/20-Gameplay 18/20-Audio 20/20 (depends of you but, i loved it)-Accessibility 18/20GLOBAL RATE: 18.75/20 Hope you enjoy that review, leave a like if you did :P			"

												L.A Noire plays out in the mid-20th century, just after the Second World War. You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a good hearted cop who was a soldier in the pacific during the second world war. The game confronts you with a time period where racism was rampant, drug abuse was growing, and violence was all too common. The city of L.A is one of the major stars in the game. Every street is full of life, with people going in and out of bars and shops, people reading the daily newspaper before going to work. The game feels as though its actually come to life. MotionScan, a neat piece of technology which Team Bondi created to capture the emotions of the characters on screen. It works splendidly, giving each conversation an engrossing hook that typically associated with great film and television dramas. When a character lies, you can see it in their face. Interviewing a suspect is the hardest and most important thing you will do in the game. You ask a question, listen to their response and then attempt to decipher whether it's a lie, the truth or something you should ""doubt"" and inquire further about. You don't only listen to what they saying, but you have to look very carefully at their faces as well. The slightest twitch in there cheek, or there eyes darting quickly to the left can help you uncover the truth. There is more to L.A Noire than just interrogation. There is a fair amount of crime-scene investigation, patrolling and beat work. At crime scenes, you are able to examine the victim up close to try find clues. You will walk around crime scene picking up all sorts of objects to see if they hold any clues. Outside of the regular story. L.A. Noire offers a few other tasks. You can explore the city and look for historic L.A. landmarks, tackle random side mission crimes as they come to you over your C.B. radio, as well as play additional DLC cases. Once you have finished a story, you are ranked to how well you answered questions, how many you got right, and how much damage you did to your car and the the city of L.A. The sounds in the game are amazing, with cars and busses going by, to the sound of the sparks coming from the electric wires as the tram drives past you. The acting is completely believable and really helps set this game apart from other detective games. The Verdict:For all of its attention to detail, L.A. Noire hits the occasional false note. But if you put that aside, L.A Noire can be a very entertaining game, with an open world to explore and lots of interesting cases, The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair. L.A Noire is a perfect game that I would definitely recommend to everyone. Pros:+ Open world of an authentic and outstanding 1940s style of atmosphere+ Memorable story+ Great use of motion capture+ Compelling investigation and interrogation mechanics + Amazing graphics+ Brilliant acting + Amazing soundCons:- Some restrictions during pursuits and shoot-outs feel artificial- Can become a bit repetitive at timesScore: 9/10			"

												As a cinematic experience, LA Noire is very good. It has a stack of content, compelling stories, great voice acting and revolutionary facial animation. It tackles challenging themes in a mature manner. It offers a large area to explore, built with great attention to detail.As a game...it's a mixed bag. The distractions - driving, shooting, tailing and collecting items - are nothing special. The core is the investigation - searching for clues and interrogating witnesses/suspects. The former is decent, with helpful difficulty options. The latter has its moments, both good and keyboard-smashingly bad.Two examples. A witness is asked about a document found in the possession of somebody else. There is no reason to be sure, or even reasonably suspect, that she is aware of it. When she denies knowledge of it, an appropriate choice response would seem to be ""Doubt"". According to the game, it's ""Lie"" - even though her response seems to confirm that she was unaware of it, making the ""Lie"" a strange choice. Even worse, there is another situation where you are expected to select ""Lie"", when the actual lie arises from the response to your challenge upon choosing ""Lie""!The single checkpoint save is also frustrating. Realise you made a mistake (seeing witness in a certain order cuts out a possible question in an early mission, for instance) or encounter a mission-breaking bug after a checkpoint save, and you have to go back to the very beginning - 30+ mins of unskippable dialogue and driving.There's also port issues - a woeful 30fps, graphical pop-in and the like.For all that...it's still a compelling experience. As much as it annoys me, I keep coming back. It may require a new keyboard by the end, but it'll be worth it.			"

												If you are looking for a detective game and find the CSI series too boring you should definitely buy L.A. Noire. The game's set in 1947, after the second world war. The gameplay is set in an open world similar to GTA. You work cases, ranging from homicide, vice, arson and traffic as the main story line unfolds itself. You can play the game multiple times and discover new clues which lead to a deeper understanding of a case. You may miss vital parts or accuse an innocent person, or let a guilty one go if you don't find all evidence and process each crime scene. Definitely buy this game it's worth it.			"

												More like a movie rather than a game, L.A. Noire is a splendid interactive translation of a noir novel, in particular Black Dhalia and L.A. Confidential by J. Ellroy (which I also recommend). The 1950 Los Angeles is immersive and realistically reproduced, framing a brilliant plot and a character developement worthy of a book. Interactive dialogues are the soul of the game, being also the key to conduct interrogatories and solve cases: for this purpose a very detailed facial motion capture permits to evaluate emotional reactions and to expose lies. Detective work is realistic and capturing, allowing personal investigation lines and always letting the player to deduce and judge in first person.Although cinematographic narration overwhelms the gameplay, L.A. Noire is another confirmation of what level of care Rockstar puts in his videogames.93/100			"

Let's Play L. A. Noire: Craziest Glitch Ever! Headless Game in Medias Res! Nosy Old Hag, No Head Bug 
A Video of L.A. Noire
By: Knave of Hearts

			Watch the rest of my playthrough of L.A. Noire, starting from Homicide department and cases related to the BD Tex / Black Dahlia murders:...		


Worst PC port ever, to even launch the game you need to find somewhere and download an old version of Rockstar Social Club, install in, back it up, let the game autoupdate it (it won't launch without updating and the last update doesn't load the game) THEN delete the new version and restore your backup. After all of that you need to set compatibility in the new back♥♥♥♥♥♥way for Windows 7/8 and repeat every time before launching... A hidden gamble is if it'll launch from Steam directly or from the game folder. It's like roulette, really! ""Rockstar"" can't do PC games and swindled actual developer (Team Bondi) out of money... even Japanese developers with no experience on PC make better ports. Never buying a game from a publisher with such a pretentious name, even on a big sale. Oh and it's so full of bugs it's barely playable.That said, the game itself is amazing. ""Rockstar"" games just needs to crawl under a rock and slowly die, since they manage to be a publisher worse than EA, Ubisoft and Capcom all together.			"

												If you’re like me, and enjoy a film-like narrative in a videogame, this is the game for you. The writing is phenomenal, the amount and variety of cases you come across too. It’s a huge game, that took me something like 50 hours to clear. However, you have to come into it aware that the game mechanics are somewhat of a bore. The vastness of the story elements contrasts with the limited gameplay. The open city is a good thing, the cars and such too, but if you’re expecting Rockstar’s GTA controls and gameplay, you’ll be disappointed.			"

												This game is exceptional its great and its very challenging to, somtimes youl think someone is telling the truth but they are telling a lie. This game hzs great facial animations that look soo life like, i played this on ps3 and its even better than i remeber. But i do have problems with this game. Like how music plays when you get a inteveiw or interagation response wrong, that is a real problem with this game my only problem. Because it just makes you feel like you could do that better and then like the completionist i am i restart. it takes away and im trying to refraine from using it. Also intution seems to be useless in some respects because its more fun to play without it. If you are planing to play this game please what you want to do is never restart a case, thats what i have done many times and all it dose is take away from the fun. And this game is great everyone interested in a game thats like a movie should try it. This is one of the best games i have played and its fun to get back into it. Other notes about the game is that its better to have the dlc (wich i dont have but the dlc adds more cases wich is more gameplay(i recomend waiting for a sale of the dlc if you want or the goty version i got this game for 5.00 american)). Just I love this game and lots of other people do to if your tihnking about buying this game, then do it and another thing to note when buying. Its a game locked to 30fps (WICH IS NOT A BAD THING). When people see games locked to 30fps they dont want them instantly but 30fps is needed for this game. And if you dont like it you can change it. And the reson for 30fps is because of the facial animations i dont think that, the game is desigend to run the animations in 60fps or higher. And thats probably the same for the new batman game but i digress this game is amazing and get it if you have, the money or patcents to wait for a sale. "

												I've played this game a couple of times on the PS3 but wished to own it on PC. First thing though unlike other rockstar games GTA, and RDR it is very different from them. It is a detective game where you examine and solves cases which is done amazingly. It isn't a shooter or action game in general, it is a mystery game with an interesting story following the detective Cole  Phelps.Long Story short it is a detective game with minimal action so keep that in mind at you will enjoy it			"

												This game is exceptional its great and its very challenging to, somtimes youl think someone is telling the truth but they are telling a lie. This game hzs great facial animations that look soo life like, i played this on ps3 and its even better than i remeber. But i do have problems with this game. Like how music plays when you get a inteveiw or interagation response wrong, that is a real problem with this game my only problem. Because it just makes you feel like you could do that better and then like the completionist i am i restart. it takes away and im trying to refraine from using it. Also intution seems to be useless in some respects because its more fun to play without it. If you are planing to play this game please what you want to do is never restart a case, thats what i have done many times and all it dose is take away from the fun. And this game is great everyone interested in a game thats like a movie should try it. This is one of the best games i have played and its fun to get back into it. Other notes about the game is that its better to have the dlc (wich i dont have but the dlc adds more cases wich is more gameplay(i recomend waiting for a sale of the dlc if you want or the goty version i got this game for 5.00 american)). Just I love this game and lots of other people do to if your tihnking about buying this game, then do it and another thing to note when buying. Its a game locked to 30fps (WICH IS NOT A BAD THING). When people see games locked to 30fps they dont want them instantly but 30fps is needed for this game. And if you dont like it you can change it. And the reson for 30fps is because of the facial animations i dont think that, the game is desigend to run the animations in 60fps or higher. And thats probably the same for the new batman game but i digress this game is amazing and get it if you have, the money or patcents to wait for a sale. "

												Solid, interesting crime thriller, but with rough edges. Good things:-Paints an incredible atmosphere of 1940s L.A., with stunning historical detail. -Unique and innovative way of moving through cases based on being able to read lies through social cues. -Interesting companions with a lot of fun, banter-y dialogue. -Fun car chase mechanics - you can't run over citizens when you're a cop, so you have to restrain your GTA urges. -Really strong voice acting and motion capture.Bad things:-Driving AI is atrocious - other cars will swerve straight into you, and you suffer the blame for it. Also, civilians are horrible at avoiding your police car, even with full sirens blazing. -The Truth/Doubt/Lie mechanic can be a little harsh and often slightly unfair with how it determines a 'correct' response. -Slightly repetitive and formulaic for the first 3/4 of the game. -Roy Earle's existence. I'd definitely recommend picking this game up in a sale, especially for the thrilling crime atmosphere of a noir cop. At full price, though, I'd have to think hard about recommending it, because it often frustrated me, or felt a little too repetitive by the middle sections.			"

												Another great Rockstar game. I love old times, so this one is best for me. But there could be more options like in GTA so the game could be played unlimitedly. As I replay some cases It's not that much of a fun as replay missions in GTA:San Andreas, but still fun.Looking at faces of suspects when you interrogate them is really hilarious(like interrogating Max Payne 1).Story and cases are really great from beginning to the end.8/10 ''All you had to do was to catch the damn criminal, Phelps.''I cried in the end.

												A great game for either a puzzle/detective fan or a 60's crime novel/movie fan. This game focuses on cinematic and getting the feel of an actual noire film. It strongly focuses on the crime puzzles with the well mixed action sequences such as car chases or shootouts. Interrogating the suspects are better then most detective genera games with one of the latest (back in the 7th gen) motion face capture. Pros-cinematic-enjoyable puzzles-cool open world map-nice story-great action sequenceCons-Strange ending (I hear, haven't completed game yet, I'll update after game completion)-Lack of things to do in a large world (but being a tourist is fun)			"

												The second I opened the Game I fell in love. Being a Fan of Rockstar's work, this was one of the few games I still needed and wanted to play! I love the idea of being a detective in the 1940's, solving cases and stopping crime. It's like playing Grand Theft Auto but from the Police's Point of View! I love Interrogating people because, sometimes when they're lying to you They make the stupidest of faces and I can't help but crack a smile. The main character of the story is really interesting as well! One of my favorite things about this game has to be the SoundTrack! it makes you feel like you're really a detective in the 1940's, especially the Menu theme! I find myself not wanting to close the game just because of the music, thats how good it is.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing, allowing you to explore a faithfully-recreated long-dead Los Angeles in its 1940s heyday, while solving crimes and unraveling a well-written story. Remarkably, the developers managed to create a world that actually feels like 1947, rather than just feeling like a 1940s-flavored game world that doesn't fully convince you a la Mafia II. What adds to the realism is that the characters, particularly some of your partners, are astoundingly politically incorrect for any medium from the 2010s (although certainly a historically accurate portrayal of how people might have behaved).The face-replication technology creates, for the first and only time in my gaming experience, faces so realistic that real-life actors can be easily recognized in many cases. The only downside to this game is that the developer went under, and while they were planning a second game in this mold,  titled ♥♥♥♥♥ of the Orient and set in the political turmoil of 1930s Shanghai, it was finally officially canceled in 2016. I am deeply saddened by this and I hope that one day there will be a sequel to this game. Had a series of these games come out over the past few years, we may have seen a mini-revival of the adventure genre, but unfortunately this will stand alone, and in my case will be replayed every year or so.

												Pros:- Its Fun - Its a 100% full Noir experience - A very great detective game- The Graphic is amazing- The Story is very addicting and unexpected- The gameplay is great- The cases and objectives are challenging - The characters, map and objects are simply beautifulCons:- Can't do much on the streets, just driving your cars and visit places. You cant actually shoot anyone- Some of the case's inquisition progress are actually kinda hard, you really cant tell weather what option to choose, look through wikia for some tips.Conclusion:If you're really into detective games, this is definitely a Must for you. L.A. Noire tells a story of Detective Cole Phelps, a veteran who returns to Los Angeles and taking on work as a Police officer of the LAPD. Your main objective is to crack cases and solve mysteries throughout the whole game. Not only L.A. Noire allows you to be a true detective but also it gives you a full experience on the Noire world like in the movies: The Godfather, The Untouchables or Gangster Squad. I'll definitely recommend you to play this game.Personal Advice:- L.A. Noire is nothing like Grand Theft Auto, you won't be able to walk around the streets and shoot somebody, all you can do is just drive around and visit places. Just stick to the story, solve the cases, and enjoy the game.			"

												When I first got this game, it absolutely sucked due to two things: The first being the 30FPS framerate cap that would often drop below 25, making it choppy and unplayable (espescially during the driving segments). the second being the controls, the controls are so cryptic and never told to you (for example you are never told how to open your note book).

												More like a movie rather than a game, L.A. Noire is a splendid interactive translation of a noir novel, in particular Black Dhalia and L.A. Confidential by J. Ellroy (which I also recommend). The 1950 Los Angeles is immersive and realistically reproduced, framing a brilliant plot and a character developement worthy of a book. Interactive dialogues are the soul of the game, being also the key to conduct interrogatories and solve cases: for this purpose a very detailed facial motion capture permits to evaluate emotional reactions and to expose lies. Detective work is realistic and capturing, allowing personal investigation lines and always letting the player to deduce and judge in first person.Although cinematographic narration overwhelms the gameplay, L.A. Noire is another confirmation of what level of care Rockstar puts in his videogames.93/100			"

												CSI: Los Angeles 1947 style...Developed by Team Bondi, L.A. Noire sets you up as detective Cole Phelps. Unlike in previous Rockstar entries (ie GTA), you play asThe story is unique and has a few twists to keep you interested. You start of as a rookie cop, after returning home from army service from Japan. After a series of cases you move onto different cases including homicide, vice and arson. Gameplay involves a mix between evidence gathering, chases and combat. In each case, you need to look to look for clues at the crime scene. This will involve interacting with items at the scene (picking up and observing stuff) as well as questioning witnesses. When you intereact with items (e.g. bodies, cups etc) you can move the item around to observe them from different angle and therefore hopefully finding the sclues you need. Some of the items that you pick up at the crime scene may add no value to solving the case what so ever, so they would have best been left uninteractable to the player to save time.A unique mechanic to the game are the detailed facial expressions from characters. You need to look at character's facial expressions closely when asking questions to tell whether they are telling the truth, lying or you have doubts. If you choose truth, then you proceed in asking other questions. The lie option involves you showing proof (from the evidence you collected) that they are indeed lieing. The doubt option is used when you have a feeling that they are lieing, but you don't have the evidence to back it up. Furthermore, you may recognise some of the faces from actors you know.Combat is decent but not spectacular. You are limited to the weapons that are in you police trunk. Most of time you will have a shotgun in the trunk,but if you have DLC you can get the tommy gun as well. There is a cover system, so you can hide behind cover such as cars, buidlings and furntiture to avoid bullets and heal. Your health is indicated by the screen turning red and regenerates over time when you're not being shot. You can also pick up enemy weapons if you ran out of ammo. Combat is quite rare and generally occurs near the ending levels of the game during police raids or chases.During chases the aim is  to catch and interrogate the suspect. this involves sprinting at them and trying not to get too far behind. When you are close enough,  you need to aim your gun at the suspect for a period of time before you can apprehend him. Sometimes chases may be in vehicles,. In this circumstance, you need to chase and ram the other vehicle until they get stuck and therefore arrested.There is a free roaming element to the game, however your activities are far more limited than GTA. You can't pull out your gun and shoot civilians. You can ram down civilians during cases, but that will lower your score. You can't buy stuff either and there are only a limited number of buildings  you may enter. There are some random crimes which you can solve while free roaming the city as well as collectable items and cars. Otherwise your free roaming options are more limited compared to GTA games.The audio is fantastic. Music does a great job at settiing the 1940's atmosphere. Character voice acting sounds perfect as well.The graphics are decent for the time. Character modles may not look that great, but the city of Los Angeles definitely looks like it was from the 1940's. There are some noticeable landmarks as well, which you can find.If you're looking for a detective game that oozes with 'Noire' feeling and American 1940's atmosphere, then L.A. Noire is the game for you. However, those looking for a GTA game will be dissapointed. "

I simply could not stomach looking at this game that i used to love so much in such an awful light.It's a real shame that i bought this from a very popular steam key sight because i 100% would've made this my very first steam refund, and i'm not saying that to be a cynical twit. I know that I personally enjoy playing this very game, but there's a wall of non-compatiblity preventing me from enjoying it again. Wether it's AMD, or windows 10, i understand issues with older games can and do exsist. I just wish it didn't have to be L.A. Noire that it all had to cumulate in.Update - i've upgraded my gpu to a gtx 1070 since the original review. It now launches in dx11. alt+tabbing ruins the aspect ratio and forces you to switch to another resolution then switch back to the original that you want to fix it. After the first drive to the gun shop i've found the pop in to make the game unplayable. cars floating off the planet until the road pops in mere feet away. also after driving at some speed you can stop the car and watch light poles and benches pop in one by one. it's far too distracting to take the game seriously and i just have to accept its dead. Rip L.A.Noire (or atleast until we get a remastered edition).			"

												One of the best games Rockstar ever made? La Noire is about a cop named Cole Phelps that keeps getting promoted (from Patol desk then all the way until arson desk.) you can do it in color or in Black and White (I think Black and White is better for this type of game.) this game is like is like a lie dectector, but you have to pay attention to details instead of a machine telling it or no. when asking questions to witnesses you can choose 3 things when they answer, Truth, Doubt or lie. this is when paying attention to details comes in you have to see how they have say their answers and their face expressions they have also pay attention to how many times they blink or move their head all over the place. but without anymore detail about the game it's a true classic game and a masterpiece of a game. 9.5/10			"

												I played this on the Xbox 360 when it came out and I loved it so after I built my PC I wanted to check out if it had any differences and whatnot. I'm glad to say it looks even better and the gameplay is just as awesome as I remember. I wasn't fond of the ending, but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't played it yet.Developed by Team Bondi and Rockstar Leeds and published by Rockstar Games, this is another gem for their vault. There is more than enough content in this game plus the DLC that it was well worth the money I paid. I've always been fond of police/detective type games so this was a good mix of that as well as action and great storytelling.The graphics in this game are well done for its time and when you're interviewing people the facial expressions are amazing. The storyline had me invested throughout the whole game and I was disappointed at a few points, but that's because it was based on what I'd say/do in those situations and not the main character.Anyway, if you haven't tried this game out yet I'd highly recommend it.

												This game is exceptional its great and its very challenging to, somtimes youl think someone is telling the truth but they are telling a lie. This game hzs great facial animations that look soo life like, i played this on ps3 and its even better than i remeber. But i do have problems with this game. Like how music plays when you get a inteveiw or interagation response wrong, that is a real problem with this game my only problem. Because it just makes you feel like you could do that better and then like the completionist i am i restart. it takes away and im trying to refraine from using it. Also intution seems to be useless in some respects because its more fun to play without it. If you are planing to play this game please what you want to do is never restart a case, thats what i have done many times and all it dose is take away from the fun. And this game is great everyone interested in a game thats like a movie should try it. This is one of the best games i have played and its fun to get back into it. Other notes about the game is that its better to have the dlc (wich i dont have but the dlc adds more cases wich is more gameplay(i recomend waiting for a sale of the dlc if you want or the goty version i got this game for 5.00 american)). Just I love this game and lots of other people do to if your tihnking about buying this game, then do it and another thing to note when buying. Its a game locked to 30fps (WICH IS NOT A BAD THING). When people see games locked to 30fps they dont want them instantly but 30fps is needed for this game. And if you dont like it you can change it. And the reson for 30fps is because of the facial animations i dont think that, the game is desigend to run the animations in 60fps or higher. And thats probably the same for the new batman game but i digress this game is amazing and get it if you have, the money or patcents to wait for a sale. "

												apparently there are a lot of people posting bad reviews recently for no good reason.edit: apparently there were issues with launching the game after a broken steam update, should be fixed now.also people wondering why this game wasen't fixed sooner, well it was a steam issue not with the game and also the developer doesn't even exist anymore...this game is an absolute must play for anyone with even the remotest intrest in detective stuff/police stuff, or just a open world game with a good story.it has only 2 flaws;1. driving controlls are kinda wierd but easy to get used to.2. locked to 30 fps, can't do anything about it because it would mess up the facial animations (one of the games greatest features.)pros include but are not limited to;1.great story2.beautifull recreaton of 40's L.A.3.amazing facial animation's of actual recorded actor's wich brings us too the next point.4.excellent acting most of the time, though some side characters are clearly lower budget.5.enough collectables, though not really the focus of the game (cars, land marks.)

												L.A. Noire is an incredible interactive experience where you play the role of a detective in a wide variety of different police cases. The first noticeable thing is the amazing detail of the faces. And this is important because it is the player's job to determine whether people are telling the truth or lying based on their facial expressions during interviews.The gameplay is essentially broken down into driving to different scenes, searching for clues, interviewing people, and occasionally chasing down suspects. It is really unlike any other game on the market and it does a great job at drawing you in. Musical chimes are used to let you know when you are next to something relevant so it is important to keep an open ear.The story feels realistic and is broken into shorter chapters meaning it's easy to pick up again after not playing it for a while. The acting is superb. All the characters feel genuine and it is obvious they put their heart and soul into their roles adding to that sense of realism. The game also showcases some great music as well. With 30+ hours of enjoyment, this is a must play game in my book.			"

												Interesting cases, very good (and long) story. Sometimes a little unfair on the question/answer parts (at least for a non-native english speaker). Still fun and full of carefully elaborated characters. Playing it now on modern hardware eliminates the clunkyness of the PC controls - seems to be a little buggy on minimum required hardware. Facial animation is even today second to none. The ""open world"" city is quite empty but each crime scene or other enterior has been crafted very carefully. Extremely high production value wherever you look.			"

												Very addictive game story despite that it sometimes repeats itself. I just loved the atmosphere of the game: post war period, superb voice acting (best from my experience so far), detailed facial expressions. All that makes you feel that you are watching some kind of interactive detective movie. I'm no fan of detectives but this game got me. As someone noted this before it is sometime too easy to determine which suspect done what but sometimes it can be kind of tricky as well and all in all when you finish the game you won't think ""oh well..."" rather ""Wow, this game was really good after all. That is how real gaming experience should feel"".			"

												8.5/10 Masterpiece. The game took 5 years to finish the development and you can see why as you play.The game invites you to a world of crime and do not hold your hand while you do your best not to miss any single clues or ask the wrong questions. It is surprisingly realistic when it comes to investigations, and if you enjoy crime themed shows, or enjoy books like Sherlock etc, this IS the game for you. Especially the intensive interview part of the game is unique and you really have to look into your notes (that you took while investigating) and read their expressions, tones etc to really hack the cases. As the game progresses the case gets harder and harder and it pushes you little bit at a time.Overall, the game is beautiful and well designed and the gameplay is solid and unique. Although the freedom part of the game is relatively inclusive but it is intentional in order to focus you to the police work.The only thing I dont like about the game is the fact that it requires quite a good computer considering the fact that the game came out quite a long time ago... but still, a masterpiece.

It should be taken to the slammer. It's the best way to play it out of all versions but is capped at 30 by default. It can easily be uncapped but the performance woes don't stop there. Getting near houses related to a case has brought my previous PC builds to a DayZ crawl. Good game bad port. Still reccomend this over a PS3 or 360 copy though.			"

Very well written story and great music which really puts you right into L.A. 1947.  Another Rockstar/Team Bondi masterpiece you need to have played through.			"

												A revolutionary and beautiful game. Kudos to the artists, animators and devs who worked so hard on this. In today's costly development market, games like this are rare.Certainly has its gameplay imperfections. Combat and controls can be awkward and frustrating on PC at times. But for all that, you get an beautiful and immersive world. Just driving in period Los Angeles is worth the price of admission to this game, But on top of that you get great music, complex characters and great dialog. This is a passionate production that honors the noire genre.I hope they make a sequel.			"

												Such a great game. The story, the facial expressions, the humor of it is so perfect. You play as a cop in the 40's and work your way up the ranks by completing the missions assigned to you, the game starts out pretty fast but gets slower by the last ""desk"". My favorite part of this game was the homicide desk because there was so much mystery involved, therefore making it so you have to search everything contributing to your addiction to the game. This game is great and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of playing as a gangster in the GTA series.			"

												LA Noire is a game that completely nails the gumshoe detective atmosphere but loses a bit on the overall narrative. Each case is about 1.5-2 hours long, and replayability is non-existant if only because by the time you finish the game you're tired of the simplistic mechanics. By ""simplistic mechanics"" I'm referring to the GTA style driving- and shooting-mechanics.Aside from that, the meat of the game is in detecting people's reactions to your pointed questions. The ability to see a doctor put his hands behind his back and suck on his lower lip as a telegraph that he isn't telling the truth is something that is very difficult to pick up at first but once you get the hang of it you start to really appreciate the development work that went into making it more about sussing out liars and cheaters than about reaction time and purchased upgrades. This game comes highly recommended also because of the way it draws you into post-WW2 Los Angeles: a city that is exploding with the popularity of movies and the pursuit of the american dream. The connecting narrative involving the eventual conspiracy scenario really didn't do too well to provide a driving force from case to case. The villains in the game seem very static and aren't fleshed out too well. As a result, actually finishing the game took some determination because you really don't care by the end.That being said, I highly recommend playing this game which is now super-cheap in 2014. There are quite a few memorable experiences in it and the concept and execution of the atmosphere is well-worth it.			"

												Basically GTA for the faint of heartPros-Unique Gameplay-Cool Technology used to make it, Motion Scan Techonology-Some Replay Value-Dark and Twisted Story-Open World (-ish)-Over 30 hours of gameplay-Feels like a movie-Noir feel to the game-Game takes a long time to finish, so alot of gameplay delivered-Dark but sometimes funny writing-Collectables-Strong Voice Acting-Can get multiple people playing in this game since they can discuss about which choice to pick during an interrogation-Vehicles all drive differently-Made by Rockstar :)Cons-Not like GTA or Max Payne, you play as a good cop, you must obey the law-Game randomly throws twists at you mid-game which don't feel clever or shocking-During the Arson desk, it destorys everything it has done to build up to an conclusion-Some of the driving parts, i just gave it to my partner because some parts the place you go is the other side of town-Cars won't drive out of the war when your siren is activated-Ending, made me sad but still it is a rockstar game so what do you expect?Overall, L.A. noire is a must play, you'll probably never play a game like this for a while or until they release a sequel. The feel to the game is truly unique and makes me click launch L.A. Noire every time I go onto steam. Even though parts of the game are delivered weak, majority of it outshine the cons therefore making the cons not really not that big of a deal. Even though the ending for me was a let-down, overall I loved the game and wanna play it again.Rating: MUST BUY!Final Verdict: 10/10Yes,yes there are cons in this game, alot of em but this is one of the only games that I actually WANT to finish. Normal games I play for 10 mins then just never come back again but not this game. I actually WANT to play this game and I regret nothing paying money for this game. You may think I am over-rating it but if you look at my gamelist, tell me how many games have I actually finished?			"

												This game tickled me in all of the right places.  I love the period setting (40's, post war), the motion capture (using MotionScan) of facial expressions, the cars, the story...it all worked for me. A brief mention of a technical detail is necessary however.  The game is capped at 30 FPS and this can result in some performance degradation.  You'll read numerous complaints about it being a console port and that it's unplayable.  True it is a port, but unplayable?  That is completely unfounded. Now that we've gotten that out of the way...If you're a fan of film noir and the crime thrillers of yore, you will enjoy this game.  It is not even necessary for you to be particularly good at gaming to complete a play through.  While there is action woven into the cases, most of the time you're putting the pieces together or interviewing suspects.  Some cases had me stumped at times, but I found that all the more encouraging to examine the evidence, make connections and solve it.  My recommendation to anyone considering playing this game, don't be tempted to find a walkthrough to breeze through the cases on auto-pilot.  Give them an honest try and use what's given to you. Games have boundaries so use that to your advantage to make your deductions.  You won't regret it and when you get that 5 star rating at the close of the case, you'll start believing you're ready to join local law enforcement (I jest). I have to emphasize the MotionScan technology used to capture facial expressions.  This was a necessary and very impressive component to the game.  While interviewing suspects you have to examine their facial expressions and behavior to determine if they are lying or telling the truth.  It is impressive...I don't think enough people give the studio credit for this achievement.Story wise, I was intrigued by the fact that the story emphasized the impact of WW2.  I don't want to talk about the story too much as to give anything away. The actors casted for the characters were believable and well played.  I started looking them up on IMDB to see where I recognized them from.  In some ways it made me long for the days of FMV in the late 90's but I really loved the style and animation as it stood.  I read that in a potential sequel (not a direct sequel) to LA Noire, they may be working on doing full body motion capture with the MotionScan technology rather than just facial expressions.To further highlight how much I enjoyed this game, I even embarked upon completing the achievements and gophering around collecting all of the cars and film reels. Do yourself a favor, give this one a run.   "

												I remember an argument when this game came out that Cole Phelps was a weak character because his actions seemed unlikeable and his character was definately flawed. We see him throughout the game being torn down by his own past , we no longer see him cling to the ivory tower of hypocrisy we saw him in, in the beginning of the game. Playing as Jack Kelso at the end is supposed to make us feel like we made a mistake judging Phelps too early because Kelso is a character who is way too nice and lets others trample over him just so he can call himself an honorary man who lives for a higher purpose. But after the ending, you realize that Phelps was right to abandon his fortune for his passion, that there is no higher purpose but to live with what you want out of life and to chase what you want with reckless abandon. His mistake was joining the marines with this mentality and getting most of his men killed in battle and many more civilians killed. In the end, Elsa healed Cole but when let his guard down, he got the retribution he deserved not for commiting adultery but commiting an act of hubris that led to a long and winding path of death and misery. If you think about it this way, Cole was the suspect the whole time, becasue his warcrimes led to most of the game's murder cases.			"

Absolutely brilliant and gripping all the way to the shocking end. If you don't own this alreay, you need to. If you own it but haven't finished it, you need to.

												Usually I try to finish the games I start as quickly as possible. I do the side quests, I try some achievements, but before playing any other game I try to finish what I started. That’s not the case with LA Noire: I avoid playing it. Why? Because it is in another league completely. The game is so good I’m taking my time to finish it. Literally MONTHS. I simply don’t want to end the story too quickly, I’m sipping it.The graphics are amazing, playing in 1080p with ‘quality’ settings and DX11 is an incredible experience. On the downside, there’s a 30fps lock, but that doesn’t compromise the gameplay because the action isn’t frantic. I find the game to be historically accurate as well. It definitely portrays the beginning of the American “Golden Age” (check the “Old Economy Steven” MEME for further references) in a clear-cut manner. There’s a “Bukowskian” atmosphere surrounding the setting and the characters (Bukowski was living in Los Angeles during the 40’s and both “Ham on Rye” and “Factotum” are accurate descriptions of that period). Coincidence or not, there’s a character in the game named “Bekowsky”...The characters are cynical, disillusioned, smoking drunkards, racist sexist♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the “noir femme fatales” shares many of the features of the male characters. LA is portrayed as a XX century Babylonian city packed with all sorts of lowlifes, degenerates, powerful and perverted directors and producers (L.A. didn't changed all that much, huh?). Due to its dedication to the Noir genre the game ends up rated Mature. This definitely isn’t a game for young gents. There’s plenty of nudity in some crime scenes, and the developers don’t hide anything, which is great, otherwise the game couldn’t qualify as a proper Noir-detective title.Since I have already established that this game is a marvelous piece of art, let’s see the cons:•	30 fps lock.•	Rockstar Social Club is required to play the game.•	The aforementioned Rockstar Social Club will eventually request your password, and you won’t remember it because the password needs to be 300 characters long, with 20 special characters, numbers and 125 capital letters. Why? Why??•	Every time you update the Rockstar Social Club, which is mandatory, otherwise the game won’t start… it’ll request your password again. And guess what: that 300 characters password you created 4 months ago won’t work because YOU WON’T REMEMBER IT. And when you request to reset it, all sorts of issues are going to popup. Seriously, you can count on it.•	Rockstar Social Club again. It’s useless. It’s dead weight and it’s sadistic towards the gamers. Steam offers everything a gamer needs, we don’t need extra-layers of crappy proprietary-software between us and the fun. It’s some sort of annoyance toll.•	Rockstar Social Club is worse than Uplay .

												L.A. Noire is an openworld sandbox set in L.A., but it doesn't have to be. Between searching for clues and watching a suspect's face to see if they're lying, this game could support itself as a linear puzzle/shooter (although actually shooting most suspects is frowned upon). And it's not as if the open world actually adds much, the only missions other than story missions are ""random encounters"" over the police radio that let you actually shoot your gun and remind you this is a Rockstar title. But as I said, the mystery solving is superb! The amazing acting and mo-cap work shows through the small details in how a character reacts to certain lines of questioning. The game actually makes you think and put things together! The one thing I don't like about how the investigations are set up, is that it's impossible to fail. Other than the previously mentioned ""shooting suspects"", you'll always complete the level and catch the bad guy. You either figure it out yourself, or the game will spoon feed it to you, with supporting characters making constant comments about how ""WE SHOULD MAYBE TAKE A LOOK IN THAT GARBAGE CAN I THINK"". But if you're actually trying, they tend to shut up. It takes a while for an overarching plot to emerge as well, and I can't say I've completed it, but I definatley will.			"

												Getting right into the end game now. Have actually really enjoyed LA Noire. The stories and characters are very believable - very maturely presented - and the facial animation is absolutely outstanding. There is a tendency for the formulaic which is fairly unavoidable with most games of this nature (drive here, find clues, interview her, next location, gun battle, etc). However I've been kept engaged both with interest in the story and the general challenge level of the game.Of particular note I've found the loving recreation of 1940's Los Angeles most intriguing. The sense of place and time is absolutely outstanding and well worth the investment. For achievement hunters, the achievements are reasonably constant and offer a good challenge with a handful that only the most dedicated will reach.Recommend it.			"

This game comes highly recommended also because of the way it draws you into post-WW2 Los Angeles: a city that is exploding with the popularity of movies and the pursuit of the american dream. The connecting narrative involving the eventual conspiracy scenario really didn't do too well to provide a driving force from case to case. The villains in the game seem very static and aren't fleshed out too well. As a result, actually finishing the game took some determination because you really don't care by the end.That being said, I highly recommend playing this game which is now super-cheap in 2014. There are quite a few memorable experiences in it and the concept and execution of the atmosphere is well-worth it.			"

												Basically GTA for the faint of heartPros-Unique Gameplay-Cool Technology used to make it, Motion Scan Techonology-Some Replay Value-Dark and Twisted Story-Open World (-ish)-Over 30 hours of gameplay-Feels like a movie-Noir feel to the game-Game takes a long time to finish, so alot of gameplay delivered-Dark but sometimes funny writing-Collectables-Strong Voice Acting-Can get multiple people playing in this game since they can discuss about which choice to pick during an interrogation-Vehicles all drive differently-Made by Rockstar :)Cons-Not like GTA or Max Payne, you play as a good cop, you must obey the law-Game randomly throws twists at you mid-game which don't feel clever or shocking-During the Arson desk, it destorys everything it has done to build up to an conclusion-Some of the driving parts, i just gave it to my partner because some parts the place you go is the other side of town-Cars won't drive out of the war when your siren is activated-Ending, made me sad but still it is a rockstar game so what do you expect?Overall, L.A. noire is a must play, you'll probably never play a game like this for a while or until they release a sequel. The feel to the game is truly unique and makes me click launch L.A. Noire every time I go onto steam. Even though parts of the game are delivered weak, majority of it outshine the cons therefore making the cons not really not that big of a deal. Even though the ending for me was a let-down, overall I loved the game and wanna play it again.Rating: MUST BUY!Final Verdict: 10/10Yes,yes there are cons in this game, alot of em but this is one of the only games that I actually WANT to finish. Normal games I play for 10 mins then just never come back again but not this game. I actually WANT to play this game and I regret nothing paying money for this game. You may think I am over-rating it but if you look at my gamelist, tell me how many games have I actually finished?			"

												This game tickled me in all of the right places.  I love the period setting (40's, post war), the motion capture (using MotionScan) of facial expressions, the cars, the story...it all worked for me. A brief mention of a technical detail is necessary however.  The game is capped at 30 FPS and this can result in some performance degradation.  You'll read numerous complaints about it being a console port and that it's unplayable.  True it is a port, but unplayable?  That is completely unfounded. Now that we've gotten that out of the way...If you're a fan of film noir and the crime thrillers of yore, you will enjoy this game.  It is not even necessary for you to be particularly good at gaming to complete a play through.  While there is action woven into the cases, most of the time you're putting the pieces together or interviewing suspects.  Some cases had me stumped at times, but I found that all the more encouraging to examine the evidence, make connections and solve it.  My recommendation to anyone considering playing this game, don't be tempted to find a walkthrough to breeze through the cases on auto-pilot.  Give them an honest try and use what's given to you. Games have boundaries so use that to your advantage to make your deductions.  You won't regret it and when you get that 5 star rating at the close of the case, you'll start believing you're ready to join local law enforcement (I jest). I have to emphasize the MotionScan technology used to capture facial expressions.  This was a necessary and very impressive component to the game.  While interviewing suspects you have to examine their facial expressions and behavior to determine if they are lying or telling the truth.  It is impressive...I don't think enough people give the studio credit for this achievement.Story wise, I was intrigued by the fact that the story emphasized the impact of WW2.  I don't want to talk about the story too much as to give anything away. The actors casted for the characters were believable and well played.  I started looking them up on IMDB to see where I recognized them from.  In some ways it made me long for the days of FMV in the late 90's but I really loved the style and animation as it stood.  I read that in a potential sequel (not a direct sequel) to LA Noire, they may be working on doing full body motion capture with the MotionScan technology rather than just facial expressions.To further highlight how much I enjoyed this game, I even embarked upon completing the achievements and gophering around collecting all of the cars and film reels. Do yourself a favor, give this one a run.   "

PriceI bought the Complete Edition of this game for 5.99,- During a steam sale.Introduction L.A. noire is a Third person open world game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar, even though there is a lot of instances where you need to use your gun, this is not a shooter game. You play as Cole phelps : An honest cop in a city full of corruption, murder and drugs. Later in the game you will play as Jack Kelso : a claims investigator for California Fire & Life, an Insurance Company. This game takes place a few years after WW2, Phelps was a marine during WW2 and is a little bit traumatized by some events during WW2. Graphics / Surroundings L.A. Noire’s map is based on LA just after WW2, with players given the chance to explore it next to solving crime. The Graphics are a little underwhelming for today's standard but they're still fine. The city looks amazing, with surprisingly much detail. The cars, clothing and people all feel very real, because of this unique feature called motion scan : They record people while voice acting with multiple cameras, this way you can make faces look more realistic and display emotions better. With this feature you can sometimes see if someone is guilty or is not.The people in the background all seem pretty real as well, talking to each other and talking about you (Cole phelps) For example : ‘Isn’t that the cop who solved that big murder case’.This makes the city feel a lot more realistic.AudioVoice acting in this game is great, especially Cole Phelps’s Character (Aaron staton, who you might know from Mad men) is performed very very well. Music in the car is just jazz music that was very popular around 1947 in LA, i personally don’t like this very much. You will hear News on the radio sometimes, This part is done pretty good.GameplayGeneralThe gameplay within the cases itself is very good, the rating system, the different characters, searching for evidence / clues, the shooting is very well done and the interactions between characters seem good / realistic.RanksYou play as an LAPD detective who will climb the ranks by solving crime : You start as a beat cop. You responds to radio calls, until you get your chance to prove yourself. when you've solved your first big crime as a beat cop you will get promoted to Traffic, mostly solving hit & runs, when you get to your last traffic case, you will come across your later to be partner roy earle, who is a dirty cop trying to protect an informant. Ones you have solved this case you will get promoted to Bunco (Fraud Division) and later Burglary (Robbery), unfortunately these 2 departments are left out of the final game. So in the final game you will get promoted from Traffic to Homicide, The five murders you will be working are kind of ‘connected’ : Based on the real life Black Dahlia killer. After you solved this case, you will be promoted to vice, where you will be partnered up with Roy earle, the guy who you had trouble with during a Traffic case. Cole doesn’t really trust him, and that seems right because of him Cole will be demoted after a scandal with Cole cheating on his wife. You’re going to get demoted to arson,where you will investigate a couple of connected house fires.CasesEvery day you will get a new case starting with you seeing the crime happening ( This doesn’t always happen). Then you will go to the crime scene to investigate it and interview possible witnesses. Then you will probably have some kind of a lead and from there on you will keep interviewing people, investigating houses of suspects or searching for cars on the street. After doing a lot of investigating you're going to arrest and charge a suspect, this sometimes ends in a shootout. Interviews / InterrogationsThe interrogation system works like this :You have 3 options to choose from.Truth : You think the suspect is speaking the truth or you have no evidence to prove otherwise.Doubt : You think the suspect is lying (Based on facial expression, or just on instinct) but you do not have the evidence to prove it)Lie : You have the evidence to prove your suspect is lying, you have to select this evidence.This does feel a little bit strange because if you doubt : Cole will sometimes get really mad for no apparent reason, This is because they changed this system during development.Searching for clues / evidenceWhen you’re at a crime scene, or a house of a suspect you can look around and you have to find clues, so you can continue your investigation. There are objects laying around everywhere; some important, some not. Ones you picked up something you have to look at the most important thing and focus on it, You will write the clues and P.O.I's all down in a little notebook.RatingOnes you have solved a case you will have a chat with your boss at that time, who is either happy or mad based on your result. Your result is influenced by the amount of clues you've found, amount of questions you've answered right, and the amount of damage you've done while driving around ( For example if you destroy multiple cars; your rating will be way lower).DrivingDriving is kind of  bad because of the 30FPS lock and general performance issues.But you could let your partner drive (Kind of fast travel), but when you are in a car chase it will still be annoying.CollectiblesThere are 3 collectibles : film reels, newspapers and cars.Film Reels : These lay across the entire map, finding all of them will get you an achievement.Newspapers : These give a little bit of background information about cole phelps and other returning characters.Cars : there are a lot of different cars, driving all of them will get you an achievement.StoryCole Phelps is an LAPD officer who was a marine during WW2, in flashbacks his history in the marine corps is explain, this part has a lot of influence at the last two missions. You will have a few different partners during his career, some he can trust, some not. The one thing that i found really annoying is that you have no influence at all on you  cheating on your wife. At the end when you’re investigating multiple arson’s you will find evidence of a conspiracy which includes your bosses, the DA, and other people, that are behind covering up a bunch of insurance frauds; houses that are being burnt down, for money.Performance / SettingsThe game is locked on 30FPS which is really annoying, apart from that the game ran just fine for me. A few lag spikes while driving is about it. Graphical bugs are there plenty, for example during a Traffic case you will get one big white thing in your screen. Verdict1. Must Play 2. Recommended 3. Recommended on sale4. Not recommended5. Don't Buy			"

												Just finished it tonight, and I don't say this lightly: Best videogame ever. Perfectly balanced in terms of difficulty, visually beautiful, but what really makes it is the story / script. Absolutely brilliant and gripping all the way to the shocking end. If you don't own this alreay, you need to. If you own it but haven't finished it, you need to.

												L.A Noire delivers an exceptional story focusing on the exploits of a WWII officer turned detective in post-WWII L.A. The game efficiently blends story within story (past and present), via chapters that seamlessly blend together, efficiently creating a believable narration of one mans journey though a troubled time, and a troubled country. The game boasts amazing facial animation techniques, thus creating a greater range of viable facial contortions for the actors to express. The authenticity of the time is expressed in great detail as shown with the vehicle designs, the setting of the city, the music, and the people. The game boasts an extremely interactive environment in the form of interrogations, crime solving, clue searching (all being core aspects of gameplay), and in a most realistic way. Vehicular chases of any sort are exhilarating and finely executed (as well as the pedestrian chases), although general movement is a tad clunky, and unfortunately the combat mechanics are relatively mediocre, if fluent and stable. In conclusion: L.A Noire is well worth your time and your money, and is a must have for any fan of the mystery/thriller genre.			"

												Many people think that L.A. Noire is something like Mafia but they are wrong. Those games have common only the age of story maybe. The biggest difference is in the adventure part of L.A. Noire, you'll have to find evidences and to speak with suspect people mostly in the gameplay. Though shootouts aren't frequent (just in optional missions and at the end of the game) and if you get to some they are boring, the investigations of cases are seriously funny and the system of dialogs is great. You have to decide, if suspect person says truth or lies at the moment. If you choose a lie, you must prove your contention by the appropriate evidence that you have found. You can make a pressure per person as well, if you are not sure. The storyline is higher than average and the surroudings of the City of Angels is very nice. I recommend to buy DLC's as well, there are the best cases in my opinion.			"

												This is one of those game that you must have played at least once. The technology used on the faces is almost in an uncanny valley kinda of thing, but it's still very enjoyable.As a detective in a 1947 L.A., that is pretty detailing and very accurate picture of the city in the past, you're suppose to discover the truth, see behind the lies of the all the suspects and find the one truth. And you gotta do that not just by using evidence, à la Ace Attorney, but also by reading the physiology of the person in front of you (well, it's more the face, and their expression but you get the point).Anyway, is a good game and with an awesome scenario and very interesting features. Definitely worth a try!			"

												One of the best games I have ever played! LOVED IT9/10---------------------------------Simply brilliant piece of game art. There is not much talk around this gem but LA NOIRE sits up there with those Half lifes, GTAs, Mass Effects or whatever best game you know.It has such a great story, and great ... is GREAT. You are going to feel like you are part of a noire film from the 30's. I freakin loved that. It is so greatly written and it is quite deep so I experieced that feeling ""I need to do something else but ♥♥♥♥in hell I need to know who killed that woman"" and then spent like another 4 hours playing LA NOIRE.The reason why LA NOIRE is underappreciated is that it is quite a different game. It stands between Tomb Raider, GTA and Sherlock Holmes adventures. You are not gonna shoot everybody you meet and you are not gonna have an opportunity to do that. This game is not about shooting or car chasing... it so complex that you forget you are playing a GAME.Simply loved it. If you love detective style films.. you're gonna love LA NOIRE too. It just feel so real.AMAZING GAME!			"

												Amazing Classic. Never played much detective games so story driven like L.A. Noire but this was my very first. Glad I played it.... But the frustrating optimization issues, lag, refusal to launch issues is really what degrades this masterpiece from receiving a good review. I ended up not finishing the game because it doesn't want to start anymore. Great.Pros:- Highly immersive- Very story driven with a 1950s theme- Enjoyable arcadic detective gameplay- Free Roaming L.A.- Dramatic cutscenes (movie-like)- Life-like facial animation & expressions- Diverse & influencial characters- 1080p support (for an old game this is a huge plus so thx for doing this)- Engaging casesCons:- Very poorly optimized (Newer OS struggle to run this game properly in its locked 29.97 fps)- Refuses to launch (for reasons unknown to this day I can no longer get the game to load)- Not made to be played in PC port (clearly designed for consoles)- Doesn't take advantage of multithreads/unable to run directx11 (stuck with directx9)- Have to spend too much time tweaking/finding fixes just to make the game work smoothly- Unrealistic driving - Forced to listen to copyrighted music (no option to turn off radio music or a way to separate game music from 3rd party music)- Interrogations limited to 3 options only. Feels dumbed down- Sometimes facial expression cues don't match with their previous statement, leading to a misunderstood decision during interrogations.			"

												First of all, at the time of writing, in order to get the game to work you need to download registry files from another copy of the game that DOES work... fortunately, there are very kind people in the community who figured this out and shared these files to everyone, so thanks very much!Second; this game as a whole was a bit disappointing. The unskippable cutscenes, indecipherable facial expressions and very linear progression are insufferable in a game that is designed to make you want to go over the cases again and correct what you did wrong the first time. If you get one question wrong, and it's the last question in the case, forget it... you have to do it all over as that was probably one of the most important questions (same goes for if you're at the end of a case and forgot to collect one piece of evidence at the beginning of the case). You can still complete the level with a good rating, with slight differences in how you get to the outcome, but ultimately the end result is still the same... Most of the time... It just depends if you're a perfectionist or not (which the game encourages, but why would you want to go through all that again?!)What did it for me was when you have to choose the wrong murder suspect on purpose in one case (yes, almost all evidence points towards the other guy, and it's not just my opinion, you are cryptically told to pick the wrong guy throughout the level and I only got the hint when I failed the mission). That is straight up unfair; all questions and evidence gathered and I get 2/5 stars for picking the ""correct"" answer?			"

The game boasts an extremely interactive environment in the form of interrogations, crime solving, clue searching (all being core aspects of gameplay), and in a most realistic way. Vehicular chases of any sort are exhilarating and finely executed (as well as the pedestrian chases), although general movement is a tad clunky, and unfortunately the combat mechanics are relatively mediocre, if fluent and stable. In conclusion: L.A Noire is well worth your time and your money, and is a must have for any fan of the mystery/thriller genre.			"

												Many people think that L.A. Noire is something like Mafia but they are wrong. Those games have common only the age of story maybe. The biggest difference is in the adventure part of L.A. Noire, you'll have to find evidences and to speak with suspect people mostly in the gameplay. Though shootouts aren't frequent (just in optional missions and at the end of the game) and if you get to some they are boring, the investigations of cases are seriously funny and the system of dialogs is great. You have to decide, if suspect person says truth or lies at the moment. If you choose a lie, you must prove your contention by the appropriate evidence that you have found. You can make a pressure per person as well, if you are not sure. The storyline is higher than average and the surroudings of the City of Angels is very nice. I recommend to buy DLC's as well, there are the best cases in my opinion.			"

												This game is the odd ball of Rockstar's games. Being a school bully, an ex-outlaw, a psychopath, or a gangster is pretty cool, but have you ever wanted to be a cop? Probably not. A detective? HELL YEAH! The game is pretty much based around crucial information you gather to reach a conclusion that normally ends in gun fire and a trip to the morgue. It has superb voice acting and story. I liked this game so much I spent months kicking down doors and shouting, ""L.A.P.D.!"" at the top of my lungs and scaring the crap out of everyone. So, point fingers (sometimes) and take names (literally) in this noir-ey detective game.			"

												Never do you play a game that has no clones, or at least not as good as it. That game is L.A. Noire.Lets look at the Pros, Mixed, and Cons.+ Very fun gameplay. I want to let you know that this game IS a puzzle game, but not as you might expect. You have to find certain clues, not doing any stupid pushing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's very fun and addictive, and wants me to have more of it. Also, there is some shooting and driving involved. However, if you wanted this to be a GTA in 1940, then you will be disappointed. However, you should love it, even if puzzles are not your thing.+ The Sound if FANTASTIC. If I had to rate this game on Sound, it would be a 10.5/10. It's that DAMN GOOD. The soundtrack is great and so 1940s! In fact, I noticed a lot of music from Fallout 3 in here, which also has awesome music. The voice acting is also perfect. It sounded like it could have been real detectives.+ The graphics are pretty dang sweet. The character models, especially their faces, are great. I never noticed bad lip-syncing, unlike most other games. I know there is one issue invloving graphics, but I will later address that in the review.+ A long story. It took me around 24 hours to beat L.A. Noire, and I was not rushing. It's fantastic well it lasts. However, well it lasts.+ Side Missions. They are not that good, but not bad either. It is nice that they added this, so this will not go against the review.Mixed:- 30 FPS capped. This would be a huge con IF it were not for a damn good explanation. So, this game was originally a console game, just like Red Dead Redemption (By the way rockstar, add it onto Steam. I don't care that it's almost 5 years old, I really want to play it) As we know, a lot of console games are locked at 30 FPS (Destiny, Fallout 4, etc.) However, Rockstar noticed there was a huge problem. The lip-syncing on PC was not good at all. They had a total of 4 choices: 1. Let there be bad lip-syncing, removing points from the PC review. 2. Redo THE ENTIRE GAME FOR PC, which could have taken a long time. 3. Make the gameplay 60 FPS, but the faces 30 FPS, possibly making bad lag, as well as confusing most people. 4. Keep it the same, but face there will be only be regular players who will outrage. I think 4 was the safest bet, plus it does not run that bad. At 30 FPS, it is fantastic. However, I still wish there was at least an option.Cons:- The gameplay gets boring a bit fast. After the 30th time of having a shoot out, it gets tiring. However, only the shooting. The interviews and car driving never get old.- This game has glitches, which might not seem bad, until I tell you. Screen-tearing, graphical glitches, and more are only uncommon, not rare.- Very little replay value. There is no second route, like GTA, Fallout, or Elder Scrolls. The next time you play it, it will be the same, which makes it boring. However, there is DLC if you can not get enough, which you would have to be crazy to not be.FINAL VERDICT9/10 L.A. Noire is a fantastic game.At full price it is worth it. On sale, you would have to be crazy not to buy it. I love this game and am praying that Rockstar will make a sequel, improving the games flaws.

												One of Rockstars best games.If you love films like LA Confidential you will adore this game.The game recreated 1940s cop drama so well and really brings you into the world.Gun play is solid and driving is like a go kart, which is fine.Interrogations are somewhat troubling as some of the 'correct' answers dont fit. For example, you are must select the better bit of evidence : A neighbour who heard noise? Or a repair log stating the husband was out of the house getting his car fixed?Answer, the woman.Overall fantastic game and a great PC version7/10 : Pick up on sale-1 Interrogation sections-1 not being able to pick my hat back up-1 game only get good when you reach arson squad			"

												I've played some of this game. Not enough that I can give spoilers, but enough that I think I can make a decision. The decision is this: Wasted. Potential. In a summary, I'd say this was an elaborate point and click adventure. That's not a bad thing. If you enjoy your clicky adventures little on the easy side, then no-probs. It's awesome.Story is broken up into separate little ""cases"", investigating whatever crime of the day. This means even short sessions can be satisfying enough.The only problem is, it's a shoddy console port. Can't ever trust Rockstar in this respect. Look up. It was released Nov 2011. It even looks like Nov 2011. It's not eye-poppingly beautiful either. Maybe some complex (read ""stupidly archaic and inefficient"") shading, that's it. It runs horribly. Unless you've got a beast of a machine, you shouldn't be playing this game. Just don't. If you do, then go ahead. You won't get the top-notch graphics your machine might be usually chugging out, but you will get a completely unique experience.			"

The story was pretty awesome with a lot of twists I didn't expect. It also shows pretty well how corrupt the police were at that time and how even the best men can do bad things. The gameplay was rather enjoyable. Running, gunning, following traffic laws until you get bored and decide to just drive on the sidewalk even though there's people there. Good stuff. The main thing that sets this title apart is the interrogations where you have to decide whether or nor people are lying. This is really, really, really awful at times. The graphics are amazing and everything appears to be from the proper time period. The sound is equally as good except I notice some reverberation or muffling with some of the voice acting. Awesome game, get it and its DLC.			"

												Don't even think to compare this game to GTA-series. It's very different from some stpd thug-simulator like Watch_Dogs or GTA.Playing this game requires you to roleplay a detective of LAPD. Game is very immersive. City outside the buildings is vivid and alive. Graphics and sounds are very good.Act like a restless and proud detective. Drive retro cars carefully, stop at traffic lights if not in a hurry, embrace the atmosphere of 40's, listen to some flavor music while driving to settle your mind boiling with clues and suspects from current case. Interogate victims and suspects, look carefully and gather clues at crime scenes, don't get shot in firefights and get upperhand at HtH brawls.Take your part in ongoing plot.Interogation logic could'be weird at times, but doesn't break immersion or plot. Cases could be solved faster if you ask right questions and find important evidence upfront. This promotes replayability of the game.Verdict: This game is incredible if played right! Highly recommended.			"

												Pretty good.  I don't finish many single-player games as I am easily bored, but I finished this one.  The storey keeps you hooked.  It's well worth the cheap price you can get it for these days.  I payed a lot more.The driving sections are worth it only to hear the banter between the cops.  You can skip them afterwards (although you can find side-missions if you don't).  The city looks nice, but it is largely just for show (you can't interact with much).  The facial motion-capture and acting is the best I have ever seen in a game.  In fact, it's so good that it makes the rest of the character models and environmental graphics look stragely aweful (but they aren't really thad bad!).If you're reading this, I'd suggest you buy it.

												It's a quite interesting game with some unique gameplay mechanics and excellent facial animations, but...It is somewhat let down by horrible driving controls that are extremely over sensitive and the cars handle like tanks. All the movements in general have a really weighty, clunky feel to them, and there are many times when performing simple actions, such as climbing over a wall during a chase fail because you initiate it at slightly the wrong angle. Quite frustrating and difficult to get used to.The investigation mechanics are the only thing the game really has going for it, and they are great, but I can't help have the feeling that the game would have been a LOT stronger overall if it focused more on that side of things than on crappy gunplay and drawn out driving sequences.Probably the most irritating thing is that cut scenes are unskippable...So if you restart a case, you have to sit through all of the dialogue, then drive back to the crime scene etc....This is bad in any game, but in a game that relies heavily on story exposition it is pretty unforgivable.It does have an interesting story as well. Probably worth picking up in a sale if you are interested in the premise, but don't expect an action game, or rewarding gunplay, or enjoyable driving experiences.			"

I love the facial animations put into the game and the great story with some jokes as well as investgating, shootouts, and interriogation. Interriogation is proboaly my favorite thing about this game, sure the game is nothing like ""Grand Theft Auto"" from Rockstar but the team did do a great job and mastering this game. But they are some problems with lag with people whos PCs are more than perfect to play on but has a bad PC port but if you have a good PC, like me, than trust me this will be worth your money just for the story and interrogations alone.

												Fantastic detective game with a very enjoyable story, characters that are interesting, some of the best facial animations yet, a wonderful creation of old school LA and the detective gameplay is a TON of fun. The game is not as open world as say GTA or Watch Dogs, but it goes for story alot more and also has the great detective work, looking for clues, interviewing people about crimes and trying to figure out if they are lying or telling the truth. If you want more story/character driven game pick this up, more linear than most open world games but the fantastic detecitve work, story, characters and animations are top notch. The game is capped at 30fps because of the facial animations they use, which might annoy some people, but once you play you will see it is not a big deal. Didn't have any crashes in the game and no big game breaking bugs. Not perfect but overall I had a blast on this game the two times I beat it. Not the best graphics ever but as I said the animations are fantastic and most everything else is well done.Looking for a fun detective game? Pick this up asap!			"

												Bought L.A. Noire today, this game is fantastic, I played it on Xbox a few years ago and now I wanted to experience it on PC. Only problem is the RockStar Game Auto-Updater will not connect to its servers and then when I select Offline Mode it never stops Synchronizing so I cannot play the game!! My PC can run this game no problem either and I have a good internet connection so it has nothing to do with me. RockStar needs to get their **** together because I paid money for a game that should work no problem and the game cannot even connect to their serves...

												This game in very well made and at times a blast to play. However in the game there are sequences, mostly towards the end, that just go on and on and really took me out of the experience. Most of them feel as if they were made to prolong the story play time since they slow down the progression of the story. If it werent for this i would be recomending this game since it is in all other respects a stellar video game, it is just these sequences complety broke the experience for me.			"

												The concept of the game is a good one. The story and type of gameplay could have been good (although i'm pretty sure I would make a terrible police investigator)BUT, the game itself is terrible. There is a terrible problem with framerate, and the fixes provided by the community (not the developers) don't always work. Many levels of the game are buggy and impossible to pass, specifically those that involve ""grappling"".The fact that there are so many problems is very annoying because without them it would be a very good game. But as it stands, you should not bother getting this game.			"

												BAIT AND SWITCH!When I bought this game, it didn't require me to surrender all of my personal details to create a rockstar account (which offers no benefits, btw).  Now, in order to play the game I already paid $60 for, I need to create an account.  Since this wasn't necessary when I bought the game, this is clearly an example of bait & switch, which is illegal in the US.Despite the fact that rockstar changed the requirements after the fact, Steam seems perfectly happy allowing rockstar to continue to ♥♥♥♥ over their customers with shoddy ports that require EVEN MORE telemmetry than their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console counterparts.tl;dr: The game I purchased for $60 is no longer playable unless I surrender my personal details, which was not part of the original deal.  Steam has utterly failed to give a ♥♥♥♥, telling me I need to deal with rockstar, because they won't provide a refund on a product whose terms of use apparently changed without me being notified.  This is an extremely underhanded business practice, and we shouldn't be putting up with it.  NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM ROCKSTAR!!!!!!  Once they have your money, they'll see fit to steal the product back from you, and Steam will do NOTHING.			"

Not that we got that out of the way, this game is AMAZING.  It's so much fun to play as a cop in the 1940's.  It feels right... so right.  It's such a long game, I mean the campaign took me over 20 hours to complete.  It has some parts that aren't that fun but oooohhh, such good times.  They need to make another game like this, either in present times or in olden times again.  There are so many cop shows these days, we need more cop games!  Tired of GTA and all that, played way too much of that, I just want to be a cop.  Please Rockstar, I hope you're working on a police game or something like that.  I really hope you are!			"

												This is an openworld/sandbox game, but instead of being the bad guy, like in GTA or Saints Row, you are a cop working your way up on the police department. I'm enjoying the gameplay, only find it's a litle bit hard to drive and keep control of the car. But it's nothing that keeps you from playing the game, you just have to get used to the driving. I'm really enjoying the story and the cases. You get to interrogate suspects and examine crime scenes to find clues. Really cool game! In my opinion this game is worth buying, especially if you enjoy openworld/sandbox type games. I strongly recommend!			"

												This has got to be one of my favorite games of all time.  The story about Cole and his experiences really drew me into his life and made me care about his character.  The crime scenes are very fun to search around and look for clues, although when you're stumped it can be frustrating at times you can save up intuition to help you out.  The action sequences are very intense and can be challenging at times.  They do offer to allow you to skip them if you're having difficulty but where's the fun in that!  The interrogations are the hardest part of the game for me.  It takes a while to see how the different characters will react and lie to you.  The game is really long but I enjoyed every moment of it.  If you love crime/detective shows this game is a must buy.			"

												This game is a must for anyone that likes crime drama or detective noir. This is not GTA. GTA is more like Saints Row which are both great games but not much like this game. LA Noire is more like Mafia or Hard Rain set in the post WW2 era but it plays more like a movie. So the equation: ((HR x 2) + M) may be a start.What the game lacks in action it makes up for in story. It will draw you in -I played it straight through which is unusual for me. While solving the main story mystery there are mini-games/crimes that will show up. Some of the mini crimes tie into the main storyline but are not essential. They are great if you feel the need for some action. There are also cars, badges and film reels scattered about that you can collect in a Free Roam Mode.The only issue I had was the 30FPS cap on the game which can make the game seem choppy at times but it doesn't ruin the game. This is a great game and I am looking foward to the next installment. I recommend buying all the DLC with this game before you play since it adds so much to the story.			"

												I've only played through the first campaign and that's a story in itself.  It is a cinematic game akin to Mafia 2 which was an incredible experience.  The fault of this game is the confusing interrogation of the suspects and witnesses.  The whole lie/truth/neutral stance really makes no sense to me whatsoever because whatever I click, Cole's response is never what I expect him to say.  If I knew what he was going to say before I click it would feel so much better and probably give me more correct run throughs.  I also failed to pay attention to some of the characters from the larger story arc but that's my fault so the story campaign was a little confusing.On the bright side, the shooting and fight mechanics are awesome.  Driving around LA is great fun.  The world looks and sounds brilliant though it does run a little slow on my computer.  The dialogue and character interactions are top notch with excellent voice acting.  The facial expressions are a shining highlight and it makes those interrogations special even if I don't choose the correct option.  Don't get too wrapped up in the interrogations, maybe it's all my fault, but the rest of the game is good enough, especially for 5 bucks on sale.			"

												I fully recommend this game, for those who like crime-solving games, games with mystery or suspense, or for those who enjoy the '50s noire detective/gangster theme. I myself enjoy all three of these elements, and so find this game incredibly addictive and enjoyable. The game is designed so that mistakes can be made during clue collecting (ie, you miss a clue) and interrogation (ie, you fail to call out a witness on a lie, or accept a lie as the truth) without a failure-state; it simply makes it more difficult to come to the correct conclusion at the end of the case, or it leads to a decreased score on the case. Each case has a very powerful film noire feel, and the cases are often based on historical cases from the 50s. You play Detective Phelps, an WW2 veteran who has turned to detective work for the LA police, and you interact with diverse, interesting characters, all with great voice acting and motion capture. To sum it up, there's not really any other game like this one, so if it appeals to you, get it! If you get it today, it's on sale for 4.99, but if you get the complete edition for an extra 10 cents, it comes with a couple extra cases and other DLC. What a steal!			"

Some of the downsides in the game include the fact that in order to get into 5-star performance, you will have to go over all the witnesses and locations and find sufficient amount of clues provided. This is very annoying as some of the witnesses aren't helpful to the cases and will not provide anything needed to solve the case in all of its components.			"

												I'm surprised at the relatively low scores here. I think this game is fantastic. It is what Mafia II was supposed to be on the storytelling/narration front. I'm normally very sensitive to shoddy ports, but this port doesn't seem to have consolitis at all in my opinion. I never played the console version so I can't compare. It certainly seems to control better than, say, Dead Space 1 or 2 did on the PC. The acting, story, and facial animations are world-class, and the facial animations really do raise the emotion of the scenes...you can see people's Adam's apples move when they gulp, for crying out loud! Doesn't sound very important except when you consider that much of what you're doing in the game is trying to find out if people are lying or not. I would say this is a GOTY contender if it weren't for the fact that Arkham City is about to come out, which I assume will dominate. My only gripe is that the cars handle way too well for cars of that era. They're very 'sticky'. It has worked perfectly 'out of the box' for me (purchased on Steam), no stability issues at all, except the game crashes whenever I quit. Obviously that is a non-issue, doesn't affect the experience at all because it only happens when I quit. I also don't have any of the frame-rate issues that some are reporting.			"

												Now I haven't put much time into this game on Steam, because I mostly purchased it for the DLCs. But I have played this game thouroughly on Xbox. I have beaten the game 4 times, with 5 stars on every mission and have every acheivment. This game, in my opinion, is one of the best games of all time. Sure, this game definatly has it's flaws, but the story, characters, and world make up for it plenty.Pros:Team Bondi does a great job of creating atmosphere in this game. The storyline is somewhat complicated, but simple enough to follow. This game is often misconcieved as being developed by Rockstar, not published, so what a lot of people expect is action-packed gameplay with an outragous and funny story. This is NOT GTA, it has a very slow and methodical pace, which I personally am a fan of. The cases and investigation are extremely entertaining and will keep you guessing until the end. Granted, this is not a game that I could binge play. The story also takes some unexpected twists and turns. Ultimatly, this is a story-centered game.Cons:The gameplay outside of investigations is a bit bland, with nothing to really do in the world. Sure there are patrol side quests (and over 100 cars to collect which is pretty much impossible), but no other side quests or activities. It would have been cool to have something like a bowling or racing activity, or just something to make you more immersed in this world. The fighting mechanic is also a bit shallow, but then again it is not a game that revolves around melee or gun combat. The chase scenes are a bit pointless at times and become sort of tireing. Also, the ""Truth, doubt, or lie"" system as I like to call it can be painfully easy - With the characters you are interrogating making the most rediculous and uncomfortable-looking faces. Some may find the ending to be disappointing or unrewarding. WARNING: As with all Rockstar games, this is a pretty bad PC port, so beware of bugs and glitches.In the end, I may be biased because I am fasinated with the topics in this game. But it is something that left a lasting impact on me. A fan of old point-and-click mystery games or crime dramas would love this game. If you have the money to buy it, you should, because it is simply an experience that no gamer should miss out on.			"

												So, what is Rockstar known for right now? Well basically a game where 9 year olds run around screaming N***ER and other curses, and using their in-game currency to jet blow-jobs from hookers.Their also known for, ""AYY NICO LES GO BOWLING.""Now, let's think of some other really good games of rockstar, such as Bully Scholarship, and GTA San Andreas and more.But one in particular, L.A. Noire, oh boy are you in for a treat. I didn't enjoy detective games as much as I did before playing this game, I bet even if you hate detective games, you will LOVE this game.I can only think of pros, like no cons AT ALL! - Car Driving is amazing- Great gameplay features and objectives- Good shooter- Stunning graphics- And it lasts you more than 20 hours, and you prob will wanna come back to it and replay it.PLEASE GET IT, STOP LOOKING AT THE OTHER REVIEWS.

												What an Incredible game! One of the deepest and richest storylines for any game I have every played. Not only do you feel good after solving a crime, but you actually feel like you are in the game with Cole Phelps and his partner. The searching of evidence is extremely easy with music and sound effects making almost impossible to miss a clue, but remember, not every clue is necesasary to the case! The driving is absolute perfection but I felt that at times, the car felt terrible for how far in the story you were (not a spoiler). I feel once you progress further, the car you drive should get better. The action mechanics are awesome, chasing down a baddy and tackling him to the ground is a satisfying thing. Though the shooting mechanics of the game take time to adjust to and some enemies take at least a full magazine of ammo to kill if it is not a headshot, it is easy to adjust to. The interview process of the game is extremely detailed, where a simple swallowing of saliva, could show the persons doubt. Make sure you look at your notebook and check every piece of evidence to make sure the accused isnt lying. This game has some small flaws, but are easily overlooked and one of the best police/detective games ever! 9/10			"

By the time I finished my chores and dropped my mom off at her local gym for her to prepare for her soon to be successful weight loss program; I decided to play this critically acclaimed contemporary ""masterpiece"" that the reviewers laud.When I reached about 5-6 hours in the game, I discovered a plethora of flaws about this poorly designed hype creator.No storyline: Where does the storyline lieBad characters: Bad charactersLack of entertainment: Lack of entertainmentPros: My friend recommended this game to meThis game is truly a disaster.

												This game is freaking great. You take control of a paranoid schizophrenic patient who believes he's a detective in the 1950's. The entire game is a lie, and the people that you ""kill"" in-game are just hallucinations, as you actually are running around downtown L.A. like an absolute madman in ""real life"". I feel bad because there's this one part where you need to kill a little girl to obtain the secret information from the FBI overlords, and if you think that she's ""lying"" about her story, you kill her and take her papers. The reality in that is that you kill her in real life, and then take her kindergarten schoolwork. It's a twisted game that will leave your computer full of kum when you're done with it.			"

What it is aboutL.A. Noire is an action-adventure crime game played from a third-person perspective. There are cases to be completed, such as investigations for murder, to progress through the story. Inbetween all the cases, the player can roam in the 1940's Los Angeles to complete in optional activities, which appear through the police radio. Combined together, one can spend many hours to complete the game.The game is known for MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. This technology is one of the important things in the game, as you have to guess if the witnesses you are interrogating are lying or telling the truth.L.A. Noire is capped to 30 frames per second (MotionScan is the reason for this), and the graphics, for a game being released in 2011, look kinda plastic and lifeless (applied to objects that are not alive). MotionScan does make the game feel a little alive, although nowaday's techniques let MotionScan stand in the corner for being the Ugly Betty.The available DLC expands the base game for a few more missions, giving it a little more time to survive the time you are playing it :-)In a nutshellL.A. Noire definitely set a new level for reality in 2011. Being beautiful, brutal, difficult and action-packed in one, this game is a must-play for every player that likes AAA-titles from previous years and for players searching for a temporary addiction!

												It's not as varied or as modern as Naughty Dog's 'Last of us', but the audio, graphics, story , gameplay and complexity of Rockstar Games L.A. Noire is still one of the best for this genre and I've no idea why David Cage after all these years, still hasn't learned how to make a decent and believable game []o_O]Despite being a poorly ported to Steam for Windows OS and being over two years old, it still sounds and looks far better than any current XB1 or PS4 ...thing. The games atmosphere drips film noire with authenticity to match and some brilliant acting/voice overs, which all make it truly feel like L.A. Confidential the video game {}^_^}Naughty Dog (much like Psygnosis was) is pretty much Sony's ♥♥♥♥♥ now, so we won't be getting of there fine work (though limited to 720p/30fps), so for us Steam for Windows OS only users, L.A. Noire is outstanding and highly recommend alternative []^_^]			"

												This has got to be one of my favorite games of all time.  The story about Cole and his experiences really drew me into his life and made me care about his character.  The crime scenes are very fun to search around and look for clues, although when you're stumped it can be frustrating at times you can save up intuition to help you out.  The action sequences are very intense and can be challenging at times.  They do offer to allow you to skip them if you're having difficulty but where's the fun in that!  The interrogations are the hardest part of the game for me.  It takes a while to see how the different characters will react and lie to you.  The game is really long but I enjoyed every moment of it.  If you love crime/detective shows this game is a must buy.			"

												L.A. Noire involves breath taking graphics and structure of the story so that as you play it, You think that, you are watching a 1940's detective movie. The facial expressions (animated by real actors and 32 different cameras to get every possible angle of the expression) , will blow you away. A great mix of clue finding, interrogating, and action, make this a game that I for one, had trouble stepping away from. The story line is intense and awe inspiring. A very recommended game for those who enjoy the action, adventure, and mystery genre. [9.5/10]			"

												The game was very refreshing and fun at the beginning but by the middle of the game towards the end the game became repetitive. Chasing criminals by foot or by car, trailing people to find out where they are headed, becomes annoying after awhile and extremely repetitive. the game should of been shorter ending in homicide or maybe just less missions. after 20 hrs of chasing people you don't want to chase anymore.

												L.A. Noire,A story written as an allegory, for the people who still enjoy games which aren't stuck on the level of mindless shooters, yet it delivers a fresh story sewn with love, sins of humankind, the filthy corruption of highly elected officials, and with great passion as well. If you want to have mindless fun with a game, L.A. Noire IS NOT for you. But, if you want to have a game which has a masterfully wroten storyline, with A grade characters, and with real life incidents, then this game is a must have for you.The game follows the rise and the fall of Cole Phelps, a ""war hero"" veteran who had been honorably discharged under mythical circumstances, who is quickly rising through the ranks of the LAPD, starting as a simple patrolman, but becoming a fearful member of the Administrative Vice squad later on.The game is based on the ""Cases"" which you would call missions. In these cases, Cole and his partner have to get to the crime scene after the briefing, search for clues, interrogate the locals or the witnesses, and occasionally phoning R&I for information regarding the case.These cases require sharp thinking and take a ""certain animal cunning"" for getting breakthroughs during interrogations, or simply just finding the right clue to lead you to the perpetrator. Your handy notebook will be helping you during the cases, neatly categorizing persons of interest, clues and locations.When interrogating a person, you have to choose a reply to their statements, those being Truth, Doubt (most of the time) or Lie, but in order to prove them to be lying, you have to choose an adequate evidence regarding the allegation. Facial capture being one of the game's key factors provides you hints of whether a person is telling the truth or is hiding something.The action sections of the game include on foot or car chases, shooting large groups of armed thugs, or simple fistfights.Besides the story cases, you can go for street crimes -  which are side missions -  such as armed robberies, ""mental cases"" or detaining people for being communists (laughed hard at this, but considering the year is 1947, it's understandable)If you're a bit bored, you can just go into free roam mode after completing cases on a given desk, and try to get all of the hidden Gold Film Reels, try to get all of the city landmarks in Los Angeles, or you can collect cars, and lost badges of the LAPD.The storyline is really well written and is sewn through several strings. The more you progress, the more of Cole's evil past, Courtney Sheldon's story, and the character development of Cole you will see. These strings will cross paths at the end of the game, and you will get the full picture (no spoilers intended). If you haven't tried this game out just yet, then you have to check it out right away! Wish you all a happy time detectives!10/10 "

												A truly fantastic game. The storyline is linear in a way that doesn't feel like it is; a great illusion to have. The game looks great, plays great, and it is without a doubt worth the money. After you've completed each desk there's a free-roam option which allows you to go and complete those street crimes and find those collectibles (and engage in some senseless bad driving), and replay each case to get those missed clues and five stars. I found the story-ending to be a bit anti-clilmactic, personally, but that's my only real complaint.The most beautiful part? Walking up and down stairs. Honestly.			"

												At a time when narrative in gaming is constantly trying to find its own identity, L.A. Noire does a fine job of giving you the right amount of control amongst the very well acted cutscenes. The facial recognition tech hasn't been attempted since, and for good reason. L.A. Noire is constantly ranked amongst the most expensive games ever made - and it shows in the quality of the facial animations. I will say, though, that in large crowd shots, it is quite easy to tell which characters have the facial motion capture and which don't - and the ones that don't (i.e. equivalent of 'extras' in movies and television) do not look very good.

												What an Incredible game! One of the deepest and richest storylines for any game I have every played. Not only do you feel good after solving a crime, but you actually feel like you are in the game with Cole Phelps and his partner. The searching of evidence is extremely easy with music and sound effects making almost impossible to miss a clue, but remember, not every clue is necesasary to the case! The driving is absolute perfection but I felt that at times, the car felt terrible for how far in the story you were (not a spoiler). I feel once you progress further, the car you drive should get better. The action mechanics are awesome, chasing down a baddy and tackling him to the ground is a satisfying thing. Though the shooting mechanics of the game take time to adjust to and some enemies take at least a full magazine of ammo to kill if it is not a headshot, it is easy to adjust to. The interview process of the game is extremely detailed, where a simple swallowing of saliva, could show the persons doubt. Make sure you look at your notebook and check every piece of evidence to make sure the accused isnt lying. This game has some small flaws, but are easily overlooked and one of the best police/detective games ever! 9/10			"

												L.A. Noire took me really long to complete with all the DLC, around 40 hours and it was hell of a run. This game was filled with amazing detective based mystery cases and a very distinct story line.The action was fun and amusing, chasing down people on foot and inside the vehicles. The gun action was also basic and easy to understand , from taking cover to blind firing your ememies or even just straight ramboing it.Taking the vehicles back to 1940's was a very neat idea, driving old cars was fun for a change wrather than the ones in the GTA series. They are over 90 vehicles and I only found half of them.The map is huge and there's just so much to explore.The main factor of the game is the motion capture of the face, the facial expressions were probably the most detailed and realistic I've ever seen in a game. When it comes to asking questions, i'm sure many people will get stumped or unsure on either choosing the ""truth"", ""doubt"" or a ""lie""I will give this game 9/10 just because the ending wasn't how I wanted it to end.

What it is aboutL.A. Noire is an action-adventure crime game played from a third-person perspective. There are cases to be completed, such as investigations for murder, to progress through the story. Inbetween all the cases, the player can roam in the 1940's Los Angeles to complete in optional activities, which appear through the police radio. Combined together, one can spend many hours to complete the game.The game is known for MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. This technology is one of the important things in the game, as you have to guess if the witnesses you are interrogating are lying or telling the truth.L.A. Noire is capped to 30 frames per second (MotionScan is the reason for this), and the graphics, for a game being released in 2011, look kinda plastic and lifeless (applied to objects that are not alive). MotionScan does make the game feel a little alive, although nowaday's techniques let MotionScan stand in the corner for being the Ugly Betty.The available DLC expands the base game for a few more missions, giving it a little more time to survive the time you are playing it :-)In a nutshellL.A. Noire definitely set a new level for reality in 2011. Being beautiful, brutal, difficult and action-packed in one, this game is a must-play for every player that likes AAA-titles from previous years and for players searching for a temporary addiction!

												While visually impeccable, the game plays like your favourite 50s detective flick (I'm looking at L.A Condfidential.) There may be a few performance issues (it is a port) but nothing game breaking.The story is superb (mostly) and there are a few plot twists that one would never have seen coming. The shooting is as basic as you can get but feels very refreshing from GTA or Call of Duty. People go down in 1-3 hits, like they should. Driving is a little 'iffy' and the cars a sometimes hard to handle; you'll find yourself crashing quite a bit. L.A Noire is flawless in most ways (gameplay and storywise), and I'm about to enter my 4th playthrough. While there is not really 'free roam' (there is, but it's only to replay the emergency calls you get in the story) the 15+ hours of story and interrogations should keep you perfectly entertained. I still don't get how they did the faces, they look amazing. For £4.99 on sale, you are duty bound to get this and play it.			"

L.A. Noire is a nice and pure detective game. A must play for any fan of the genre.The place and setting is charming and beautiful, but also dark where you wouldn't look - which is just perfect. The story is great, and every mission feels different and unique.What's most fascinating is the mechanic where you read peoples facial expressions to tell whether they're telling the truth or not. That; together with the clues you find, and the small details you take notice of, and through a careful method of interrogation - makes you able to find the persons that are responsible for the crimes that has taken place.

												This has got to be one of my favorite games of all time.  The story about Cole and his experiences really drew me into his life and made me care about his character.  The crime scenes are very fun to search around and look for clues, although when you're stumped it can be frustrating at times you can save up intuition to help you out.  The action sequences are very intense and can be challenging at times.  They do offer to allow you to skip them if you're having difficulty but where's the fun in that!  The interrogations are the hardest part of the game for me.  It takes a while to see how the different characters will react and lie to you.  The game is really long but I enjoyed every moment of it.  If you love crime/detective shows this game is a must buy.			"

Ignore the DRM since it is non intrusive, ignore the complaints about fps and graphics, I have no problems running this game at all with a new system.  Game requires more thinking skills than shooting/action.  Facial animations are top notch.  Graphics are true to giving us a realistic 1940 LA Time Period.  This is a highly recommended game!			"

												This game is freaking great. You take control of a paranoid schizophrenic patient who believes he's a detective in the 1950's. The entire game is a lie, and the people that you ""kill"" in-game are just hallucinations, as you actually are running around downtown L.A. like an absolute madman in ""real life"". I feel bad because there's this one part where you need to kill a little girl to obtain the secret information from the FBI overlords, and if you think that she's ""lying"" about her story, you kill her and take her papers. The reality in that is that you kill her in real life, and then take her kindergarten schoolwork. It's a twisted game that will leave your computer full of kum when you're done with it.			"

												This game is a must for anyone that likes crime drama or detective noir. This is not GTA. GTA is more like Saints Row which are both great games but not much like this game. LA Noire is more like Mafia or Hard Rain set in the post WW2 era but it plays more like a movie. So the equation: ((HR x 2) + M) may be a start.What the game lacks in action it makes up for in story. It will draw you in -I played it straight through which is unusual for me. While solving the main story mystery there are mini-games/crimes that will show up. Some of the mini crimes tie into the main storyline but are not essential. They are great if you feel the need for some action. There are also cars, badges and film reels scattered about that you can collect in a Free Roam Mode.The only issue I had was the 30FPS cap on the game which can make the game seem choppy at times but it doesn't ruin the game. This is a great game and I am looking foward to the next installment. I recommend buying all the DLC with this game before you play since it adds so much to the story.			"

Some of the downsides in the game include the fact that in order to get into 5-star performance, you will have to go over all the witnesses and locations and find sufficient amount of clues provided. This is very annoying as some of the witnesses aren't helpful to the cases and will not provide anything needed to solve the case in all of its components.			"

The facial expressions (animated by real actors and 32 different cameras to get every possible angle of the expression) , will blow you away. A great mix of clue finding, interrogating, and action, make this a game that I for one, had trouble stepping away from. The story line is intense and awe inspiring.

												Some of the gameplay elements and aspects of this game left me wondering if the game was open ended or if it was just streamlining me into conclusions from very little basis. Some of the aspects of the story don't seem to make sense and the connecting of evidence to crimes and plot twist are...Peculiar. However, regardless of all this, it is interesting to play and excitingly different from most games. Plus if you run over pedestrians nobody cares. Seriously try it. Do it right in front of the police station they won't give a crap.			"

												First of all, this is not Grand Theft Auto. LA Noire is about looking over evidence, questioning witnesses, figuring out who's lying and why. The game has fine sense of style, it's plot and characters taking inspiration from noir film and literature of the 40's and beyond. It's pretty fun collecting clues, putting together the big picture and pinning the suspect. However, for all it's fantastic concepts, LA Noire stumbles in it's execution. There's a big open-world to explore, but no real reason to do so. Some of it's abitrary 'game-ness' can interfere with the actual mysteries you, as a player, try to think though and the writers sometimes have a different opinion of what 'evidence' is.BUT. It's arcing story and development is what drives the game home and getting around a world of 40's noir charm is great. There are few big games out there that try to do what LA Noire does and I don't regret spending 20 hours staring at Andrew Staton's face.			"

												L.A NoirePositives:+ A very cool and well thought-out detective thriller set in 1940's California, U.S.A. Playing as Coles Phelps you investigate homicides, thefts, drug trafficking and fraud, identifying crime scene clues and speaking to witnesses to gather evidence.+ A really nice feature of this game is the facial expressions used by characters. A lot of effort was put into this by the developers. After carefully observing how a person of interest behaves or talks, you can doubt what they are saying, judge whether they are lying, or believe them. If you're successful, you'll squeeze more information out of them leading to additional avenues in the case. This is good because it rewards the player for engaging in the game and playing it properly.+ Nice shootouts with several different types of weapons, although confrontations aren't that frequent. Use tommy guns, pistols or shotguns to take down foes. There's 40 street crimes to complete separate from cases.+ An intriguing storyline of crime, love and flashbacks of Cole Phelps life in the Marines during World War II. The ending is one you won't really expect. Really enjoyed it.+ Around 40-50 hours of gameplay with all DLC, trying to do your best on every case.+ Graphics are decent.Negatives:- The graphical quality of the game world could be improved. As it stands it still looks fine, but stunning visuals really do add to immersion.Overall Score: 9/10It's hard to fault L.A Noire. This game kept me entertained and had lots of playtime available, the DLC adds some epic firefights and the story was great. Definitely recommended.			"

												LA Noire is exactly as advertised, a dark gritty noire story. And thats great, this is why i love Rockstar, they never fail to impress. LA Noire puts you in the shoes of Cole Phelps, a beat cop who is working way up to detective. Now beat is pretty much the tutorial section, after this you earn Traffic detective. Now the story in this game is phenomenal, or at least each story (for the most part). Each desk you get a different partner, my favorite being Stefan. There is one flaw i have though with the partners though, they all have the same progression and personality. Like at first they dont really care for you too much but after your first case in each desk they think your the bees knees. The atmosphere in this game is great too, i love the 1940s feel and aesthetic. But theres also a flaw with the world in this game too, its kind of linear, what i mean by this is theres nothing to do outside of the main missions. They give you the option for free roam after you complete a desk but it kind of sucks, the characters in these free roam missions are cool but besides that the missions can get kind of repetitive. Theres no restraunts to go to, no movies to see, no bowling alleys, ♥♥♥♥ theres not even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ radio. But besides that i really dont have any flaws with the game world. Now with the main missions themselves, there pretty good, the best desks are Vice and Homicide. Each desk is different, this game even takes you into the investagation of the BLACK DAHLIA MURDERS!!! its pretty cool stuff. Now the funnest part of the missions in my honest opinion is questioning, but damn it can be frustrating too. So thats my review for LA Noire, i know it was long.LA Noire9/10Would doubt again			"

												At a time when narrative in gaming is constantly trying to find its own identity, L.A. Noire does a fine job of giving you the right amount of control amongst the very well acted cutscenes. The facial recognition tech hasn't been attempted since, and for good reason. L.A. Noire is constantly ranked amongst the most expensive games ever made - and it shows in the quality of the facial animations. I will say, though, that in large crowd shots, it is quite easy to tell which characters have the facial motion capture and which don't - and the ones that don't (i.e. equivalent of 'extras' in movies and television) do not look very good.

												I've been looking for a game with good story for quite a while. After playing great titles like Fahrenheit, Mafia, and Alan Wake I wanted to touch up to those. L.A. Noire, even though an underdog in my book (was able to get it long time ago but decided not to due to bad optimalization for PC and some negative expectations from initial experience when trying it out). Despite all that I got it on the summer sale for 5 euro and it proved to be a great buy.Each case had a different original flavor to it, and I found myself feeling vibes of L.A. Confidential, True Detective (on Homicide department). I spent 24 hours on this game during 1 playthrough, and you could spend even more, if you completed all of the side-missions where you battle street crime. This game may be linear, but it sacrifices its freedom for great story-telling and immersion. So if you're into detective stuff (actual detective stuff, using wits, and intuition) then buy this game.			"

												I've bought this game for the PS3 first and was caught up in its nice story and gameplay.Bought it again for the PC because of DLC's and coz it was on sale at the time being. Money well-spent, imo.You are Detective Cole Phelps who is working for the LAPD. Your job is to solve crimes by bringing in witnesses, suspects etc. You follow leads and tracks you find at the crime scenes and use them to arrest the criminals. What I like really much is the fact that the emotions and gestures etc of the characters you talk to are also very important to find out if somebody is lying to you or telling the truth. Motion capturing ftw.Can only recommend this game. It also has very nice plot twists and I just love the time it takes places in. (I'm in love with that era, so my review might be a little biased :P)7.5/10			"

												L.A. Noire is reminiscent of a lot of us. We’re decent people sure, but we’ve become bloated with wasted potential. Maybe I should go ahead and compare Noire to a high-end escort. Sure, her parents are disappointed but she’s certainly bringing something different and enjoyable to your evening. You should definitely play L.A. Noire but like me you may walk away feeling that it could have been much more. There are also a slew of problems both technical and performance but the experience is fresh, invigorating, and will keep you playing through the night.L.A. Noire is heavily influenced by film noire. If you despise that genre maybe this game isn’t for you. The story is smothered in a thick layer of atmosphere with character personalities practically picked from the classics. Sure, some of the characters are definitely cliché but this plays to the games benefit. It’s supposed to be reminiscent of film noire and it does a damn good job at it. I won’t go too much into the characters or story because that’s something players should experience firsthand for themselves. It’s good and you should play it. The story can be described as paced and methodical. Unlike other Rockstar titles you won’t be blowing through waves of armed baddies every moment of the day. You’ll play as Cole Phelps, a veteran of World War II turned by-the-book detective in late 1940s Los Angeles. Because you’re a detective you’ll spend less time in shootouts and more time investigating crimes, interviewing suspects, and driving around in style. The investigations continue to introduce diversity in their story and characters but the central process generally stays the same. You’ll interrogate witnesses, chase down suspects, and sort through crime scenes for clues. The most prominent game mechanic is of course the interrogation mechanic in whom you judge whether your witness/suspect you believe the person you are interrogating is telling the truth, you doubt them, or they are lying. This is where MotionScan shines the brightest. The depth of the character’s expressing is fantastic and you’ll have to use those expressions to figure out whether they are telling the truth or not. At times dissecting the truth from the lies is rather difficult but most of the time it wasn’t too hard. A lot of the character’s tells are regurgitated over and over and the facial expressions are generally overdramatized. Regardless it is a ton of fun to interrogate someone to get one step closer to solving the case. Be careful though, there are consequences to doing a bad job. Outside of the main storyline there is little to take part in. There are side missions called “street crimes.” Unlike the campaign they are more or less regurgitated and not at all worthwhile in my opinion. You can also drive around and find all of the landmarks or try to find hidden cars. For such a large world there really isn’t a whole lot to do with it. You're free to explore the world but there is simply not a whole lot to see or do. It's like a fantastic themepark tucked away in some beautiful place but with only one ride.I first played L.A. Noire all the way back in 2011 on the Xbox 360. I fancied another play and decided to snag a copy for the PC. The unfortunate reality is that the PC version doesn’t offer much more than the Xbox 360. The game is locked to 30fps and suffers from some of the performance issues that the Xbox 360 suffered. I feel as if the game must have been rushed for its PC release. I suffered the occasional stuttering and even tearing despite have vsync engaged and more than enough hardware to handle the stress. The draw distances appear to be as short as they were on the consoles. I feel as if the game could have been made to better utilize the PCs superior power. Unfortunately it appears that this wasn’t the case. While the game is certainly playable these performance issues can be distracting and I feel as if they shouldn’t have ever been there in the first place. The most glaring annoyance is the FPS limit which may be more than a mild annoyance to PC gamers. Now, I have heard that the FPS limit was for the benefit of the facial animations. Apparently there is a FPS unlocker created by someone but I have yet to see how the facial animations work at higher frame rates.I decided to play the entirety of the campaign using my gamepad. Like Grand Theft Auto the game, in my opinion, is much better enjoyed with it. The driving was on-par or slightly above that of GTA IV. The combat mechanics feel unrefined and clunky, a problem that was equally persistent in bothering me on the 360. Fortunately combat is not the focus of L.A. Noire. I would consider the controls functional but not superb. The audio including the voice acting and background audio are no less than top notch. While you’re driving you are treated to period music and commercials. The voice acting and music score are engaging and enjoyable. Everything works seamlessly together to make you feel as if you’re really a detective in 1940s L.A. The recreation late 1940s L.A. is impressive. It is evident that a staggering amount of attention to detail was applied in its accurate depiction of the time. This applies to everything from the clothes, cars, hairstyles, architecture, and interiors. The game used a technology called MotionScan to record and transplants real actor’s facial expressions into the game. Overall this brings a truly unique cinematic experience and supports the games interrogation mechanic. It is a thrill to see so much detail in a game character and brings the world and experience alive. MotionScan could certainly use some polish and refinement but the implementation of the technology is definitely a good one. A handful of character animations are strange wonky. I wish some more attention could have also been applied to the more action-packed cinematic cut scenes. I know the game was made all the way back in 2011 but there’s a few that look downright silly. The game does a fantastic job of getting you absorbed in the world but there’s moments when an unpolished visual moments pulls you straight out. There exists the occasional discrepancy between textures. Some texture is lovely such as those for cars and interiors. On the other hand the gun textures (and reloading animations) are poor at best. Despite flaws L.A. Noire is an enjoyable and enthralling adventure. The game introduces new game mechanics, a story, and an environment that truly sets the game apart from the rest of the pack. It doesn’t matter that it came out three years ago, give this game a play. 8/10.			"

												The game can be split up to 5 parts according to cases. Patrol, Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Patrol cases are like tutorial so there is nothing to add much. Traffic cases are about small time issues like hit-and-runs, stolen goods, injuries or fatalities. It is good for a start up and it let's you to warm up to game. Homicide is about murder as you can foresee. From my opinion it is the best part of the game (All murders are related to real cases). Vice is the hardest ever you can get. It contains drug traffic, mafia and some other serious♥♥♥♥♥♥ The last one, arson is about burned houses. Not much to add.So let's look at the criteria of this game:Music: Nice action and investigation musics. When you get close to a investigation area.Plot: Really realistic plot. You get Cole's, who the main protagonist by the way, background info and as you continue you get into Cole's deep feelings. As the game starts to end, whole plot is completing to connect to each other.Cases: Though i finished the game, i was really really bored at Arson. As the game continues nearly everything stays as the same, except plot. You can't get anything new as you play further so it may get boring. Same evidence tactics and same interrogation methods etc.Interrogation: Interrogation is the most important thing. It is as important as collecting avidence. It opens so much options early on in the case. While interrogating, you need to look closely in the faces of charachters to understand whether they are lying or not. After you conclude that charachter is lying, you need an evidence to pressure him/her. As you continue it gets harder to understand from faces. Afterall interrogation system/mechanic is really good.However it is too ♥♥♥♥in hard to connect to game as it requires Rockstar Social Club♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hate this system as much as UplayLauncher. Rockstar really gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it. My only negative comment is about this.So if you like playing investigation games and hate Rockstar, 8/10 i would recommend you to buy when it's in sale.			"

If youre looking for loads of action and FPS Material, LA Noire might not be your thing, but you should try it out regardless. 8,25/10 I am glad to have bought it and loved playing it to death.			"

												You play as a LAPD detective Cole Phelps, set during post-World War II time of late 1940's Los Angeles. You play as a dectective as you solve cases each chapter while interviewing people, while involving in car chases and gun fights. The beginning of the plot will start off slow and a bit uninteresting, but will get its suspense and interest later on towards the haft of the story. You'll spend a good hours of gameplay once your hooked into the story, as well as the dlc's. The setting is really done well as it really well captures the feel and society of 1940's America. Game is still fictional but does still contains real world facts.			"

												The game was very refreshing and fun at the beginning but by the middle of the game towards the end the game became repetitive. Chasing criminals by foot or by car, trailing people to find out where they are headed, becomes annoying after awhile and extremely repetitive. the game should of been shorter ending in homicide or maybe just less missions. after 20 hrs of chasing people you don't want to chase anymore.

												L.A. Noire,A story written as an allegory, for the people who still enjoy games which aren't stuck on the level of mindless shooters, yet it delivers a fresh story sewn with love, sins of humankind, the filthy corruption of highly elected officials, and with great passion as well. If you want to have mindless fun with a game, L.A. Noire IS NOT for you. But, if you want to have a game which has a masterfully wroten storyline, with A grade characters, and with real life incidents, then this game is a must have for you.The game follows the rise and the fall of Cole Phelps, a ""war hero"" veteran who had been honorably discharged under mythical circumstances, who is quickly rising through the ranks of the LAPD, starting as a simple patrolman, but becoming a fearful member of the Administrative Vice squad later on.The game is based on the ""Cases"" which you would call missions. In these cases, Cole and his partner have to get to the crime scene after the briefing, search for clues, interrogate the locals or the witnesses, and occasionally phoning R&I for information regarding the case.These cases require sharp thinking and take a ""certain animal cunning"" for getting breakthroughs during interrogations, or simply just finding the right clue to lead you to the perpetrator. Your handy notebook will be helping you during the cases, neatly categorizing persons of interest, clues and locations.When interrogating a person, you have to choose a reply to their statements, those being Truth, Doubt (most of the time) or Lie, but in order to prove them to be lying, you have to choose an adequate evidence regarding the allegation. Facial capture being one of the game's key factors provides you hints of whether a person is telling the truth or is hiding something.The action sections of the game include on foot or car chases, shooting large groups of armed thugs, or simple fistfights.Besides the story cases, you can go for street crimes -  which are side missions -  such as armed robberies, ""mental cases"" or detaining people for being communists (laughed hard at this, but considering the year is 1947, it's understandable)If you're a bit bored, you can just go into free roam mode after completing cases on a given desk, and try to get all of the hidden Gold Film Reels, try to get all of the city landmarks in Los Angeles, or you can collect cars, and lost badges of the LAPD.The storyline is really well written and is sewn through several strings. The more you progress, the more of Cole's evil past, Courtney Sheldon's story, and the character development of Cole you will see. These strings will cross paths at the end of the game, and you will get the full picture (no spoilers intended). If you haven't tried this game out just yet, then you have to check it out right away! Wish you all a happy time detectives!10/10 "

												At a time when narrative in gaming is constantly trying to find its own identity, L.A. Noire does a fine job of giving you the right amount of control amongst the very well acted cutscenes. The facial recognition tech hasn't been attempted since, and for good reason. L.A. Noire is constantly ranked amongst the most expensive games ever made - and it shows in the quality of the facial animations. I will say, though, that in large crowd shots, it is quite easy to tell which characters have the facial motion capture and which don't - and the ones that don't (i.e. equivalent of 'extras' in movies and television) do not look very good.

												The game is a bit strange, to be honest. Not just because it’s not the classic “runny gunny” variant of Rockstar games, but mostly because I have solved 4 or 5 cases and it feels like I haven’t really done much. I’ve unlocked outfits that look like repaints of the same basic thing (Watch_Dogs would later come to have the same exact problem), and I seem to be unlocking intuition points I don’t really need since I can just Shift+Tab to a guide that tells me when people are lieing.I don’t want to sound like a mouthbreather who can’t handle not having violence in my face every ten minutes. But after 3 hours and two gunfights, I feel there should be a /little/ more peppered around.My very first case I failed immediately when the perp ran away. I went to fire at him, just once, and actually managed to hit him in the leg. Instant “You failed” screen, “Man got injured” it said. No kidding? He was fleeing.So I find a street crime a little later, THINKING I shouldn’t be shooting the masked perp with a firing gun. Since I couldn’t figure out how to melee with my gun drawn, I just tried rushing him. Mission failed. “Officer down” it says.Christ, make up your mind.Another street crime was a more clearcut gunfight, which was enjoyable but the game CLEARLY didn’t emphasize the gunplay. The controls were a bit sluggish as my dude slowly gets out of cover and slowly figures out that I’m holding the shift button to sprint to a different piece of cover. I haven’t died yet, but I have taken a few shots because Cole won’t move his friggn’♥♥♥♥♥I will admit, first impressions were pretty decent. They’ve taken a slight (but only slight) dip due to the clunky movement. I also don’t feel like an “open ended” game is the right platform for the investigative style it’s going for. Indeed, it’s hardly open ended at all. I can’t really “stop” any investigation and wander. Sometimes my police car gets a call that I can generally divert and deal with, but there’s no ‘wandering’ available. I’m wondering why the world is this large when all I can do is “Investigation” and “shoot some Mexicans over here”. Even clothing is changed via the menu, no shopping to be done.Is a more open world “unlocked” later? Rockstar is sometimes fond of that. If so, that’s fair. I’ll keep playing it (though mostly in one-hour chunks so my computer doesn’t explode).			"

												I would like to write a review of this game. I really would.However, after much trail and error, searching online for answers and contacting Steam for a refund... this pile of garbage will not even launch. The game just hangs on the loading screen forever. This is actually an improvement over the first attemtps when it crashed and gave errors. Verified the game cache multiple times, reinstalled the game, set the DirectX to 11, set in different compatabilty modes, tried a diffrent Social Club launcher (really? It NEEDS Social Club to play??) I HAVE played this game on the Xbox 360 a few years ago. As I recall, it was pretty good. However, for the PC version I give it a 0/10.STAY AWAY. At least I only paid about $8 for this. (refund denied)			"

												L.A. Noire involves breath taking graphics and structure of the story so that as you play it, you have to constantly remind yourself to use the controller because you drift away thinking you are watching a 1940's detective movie. The facial expressions (animated by real actors and 32 different cameras to get every possible angle of the expression) , will blow you away. A great mix of clue finding, interrogating, and action, make this a game that I for one, had trouble stepping away from. The story line is intense and awe inspiring. A very recommended game for those who enjoy the action, adventure, and mystery genre.			"

												Being a game, it has its charms. NPCs glitching through doors, funny animations at times, crazy car physics, silly health regen, etc don't detract from the setting, the series of cases, detective mechanics and quite realistic representation of people.I don't like the overarching story though. It falls flat in some places, especially with how Cole Phelps falls from grace arbitrarily it seems. The individual cases are quite well written, but the overarching story is not.Highly recommended.			"

												In L.A. Noire you play as Cole Phelps and begin with him joining the LAPD. During your game he rises through the ranks in the force. However don’t expect to see Cole react to his amazing progress in the police with anything other than a blank expression. This is indicative of on overarching problem the game has. While the story tries to make Phelps a compelling character there is a glaring disconnect between him and the player. You never see his family despite their existence being important to the plot. While you see moments from his time at war they never feel overly impactful. I didn’t care about Phelps which in a story like this is a deal breaker.The game focuses far too much on the technology that went into making it. While the facial recognition technology used is amazing that isn’t what makes a good game. The facial expressions are often laughably over the top (which is understandable when you think that it is actors being told to ‘look like your lying’) and destroy the immersive experience the game is trying to present. It often ends up with characters being too far inside the uncanny valley for them to be truly relatable However the game world is beautiful and represents 1940s Los Angeles very well. It’s obvious that a lot of time and research went into creating this world. It is full of landmarks, street crime and collectables to find. Yet the game lets you skip every driving section where you would have a chance at finding them. This feels like two games squashed together. One a detective based drama and one a GTA style action game in 40s LA. My issue is these two styles don’t fit as well together as they could and so the game feels split with neither mechanic living up to its potential.			"

												L.A. Noire has some seriously high production values.  For the time, the graphics were excellent, and the lighting and voice acting are universally superb.  If L.A. Noire were a movie, it would be a really good looking movie.However, L.A. Noire is not a very good game.  The primary problem is a lack of focus.  The gunplay isn't very good, but it's not the focus.  The cars don't handle very well, but they're not the focus.  The focus is the story, but the story is so scattered that it becomes impossible to care about what's happening.Because of the episodic nature of the game (each case is a self contained unit) you never really get to know any of the characters.  There are a few exceptions, including a mob boss who gets lots and lots of development, then vanishes with zero resolution in the last hour of the game.  Also, the game is CONSTANTLY throwing flashbacks at you to build up the villanious pop psychologist Fontaine, who has been telegraphed from day 1 to be the chief antagonist.  Then, he dies at the last moment to a character we know nothing about, and the final battle is with a bunch of faceless mooks.  Yay?The story was clearly what L.A. Noire was riding on, and the story is bad.  I cannot recommend this game.			"

												It's a good game but not a great one. I don't know you folks but I find it boring to do the same sh*t over and over again and in these days, a lot of gamers whine about this issue. I'm not saying this game makes you do same thing over and over again. Cases differ from each other in many aspects but basicly they are all the same to me. Go to crime scene, gather evidence, interview with some people, gather more evidence, interview with more people, then it comes to accusing. The game is actually based on gathering evidence and reading peoples faces correctly. But it's not enough, you have to bring up the right evidence in order to push the guy you are interviewing. And these things repeats itself in every case. So, about 11 hours of playing I asked myself, ""Why am I even playing? Just to go gather evidence and interview people?"" Well yes, that's basicly what the detectives do. So I shouldn't whine about this. It just bores me. Maybe you can enjoy it. Persnally, I think you should buy it when its on summer sales or else like %75 or more discount.			"

												Best LAPD Simulator out there.  A game where you send innocent people to jail and murder everyone as you disregard the public's safety.  Phelps is the hero LA deserves. Also the final level you run around a sewer with a flamethrower.  I wish I was kidding.  Better luck next time Rockstar.			"

												L.A. Noire is everything you expect and more. An honest detective simulation of the highest standard set in the open world of, you guessed it, L.A. Created by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, I had a feeling this game was going to be fully fledged out, and they certainly delivered on that.You start off as a police officer with a strong justice driven ideological view, hellbent on making something of himself. You are given the opportunity to make your way up the law enforcement food chain, meeting new chracters and learning parts of the main character Cole's past life. I am only 6 hours in to the game as I write this but the cases so far feel very genuine. The game has a good sense of humour as most Rockstar games do but this one touches on some very dark material. I personally feel that this is a good thing and doesn't give the player the feeling that they are being babied. Although the game doesn't give too many incentives to go out exploring as some other open world games do, the world is huge and feels like a very authentic, and I'm not sure it would make sense in a game like this. The real draw to the game is the detective work afterall. There are some interesting side missions that you can get called in for but generally they all play out the same way. Bad guy breaks the law. Catch or kill the bad guy. Still, the setting is always interesting and it is something to do if you aren't satisfied by the campaign when you have completed it.My favourite part of the game was the interrogations. When interrogating a suspect/victim you are given the opportunity to decide whether you beleive they are lying or telling the truth. Using some impressive technology called ""MotionScan"" the faces of the NPC's in game almost feel real, albeit a tiny bit creepy at times. Thoug the system was fun and required thinking, I couldn't help but feel that sometimes it was impossible to tell if a character was being truthful or not. Maybe I'm just terrible at the game but it felt like sometimes I was required to guess rather than read the NPC's expressions.There are some cool ideas in the game that help keep you immersed in the game. An example of this are the doors in the game having golden handles when you may enter them, which means that you never run from door to door to check which are openable and which aren't. There is also no fast-travel feature in the game, but that doesn't mean you have to drive yourself everywhere. You're a cop, therefore you have a partner. You can tell that guy next to you to drive you from case to case which will skip to the area you need to go, but not before you and your partner's dialogue for the sequence is played to you. A particularly intriguing feature of the game is the ability to search crime scenes. This is a very fun feature that requires you to walk around the area and find clues. They are well explained to you as you find them so as a rule you should never feel like a clue is irrelevant. I did find that after a few consecutive crime scenes without breaks that finding the same beer bottle or cereal box on the floor became a little annoying, but completing a crime scene after finding all the clues in the area was a great feeling every time.Driving in L.A. Noire is fun but a little arcadey, which some people may like while others may not. I personally feel neutral towards it because I got my partner to drive me around everywhere after the first few hours and the is more about thinking intelligently than the actual gameplay mechanics. There is no lock-on system in L.A. Noire. Shooting can be a pain in the bum if you are using a controller to play the game, but you do it so briefly and so rarely that this should not prevent you enjoying the interesting gun scenes. In other words, guns are certainly not overused. Speaking of violence in this game, there is a boxing mechanic in the game that pops up when a suspect decides to engage you in hand to hand combat. This is as simple as blocking and punching and I found that mashing the attack button usually got the job done. I'm not too fussed about it because as I mentioned previously, the real gumption of the game is the detective mechanics.The main character of the game is interesting. He is quick witted and seems to be a very highly-principled officer, a nice change from Rockstar's usual hardstyled criminals we are usually made to play. I did feel that he could be a little spontaneously aggressive at times and he doesn't seem to treat his partners that well. The setting of the game is realistic. The game does not shy away from a lot of protruding themes of the time including racism, Nazi Germany and sexism. I will say that I feel Rockstar used these effectively to help you distinguish between the characters you are supposed to like and the characters you aren't even though for the time a lot of these things were considered ""normal.""Overall, I would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good story and some engaging mechanics. The game requires you to think about what you are doing without punishing you too much for making a mistake. The game doesn't baby you and a lot of the content is certainly aimed for an older audience, but if you are interested in an immersive interractive experience look no further than L.A. Noire.			"

												A different sort of game, L.A. Noire allows you to step into the world of James Elfroy's L.A. Quartet.  While a sandbox, it is a different type, rewarding inspection of the crime scene more than blazing away at bad guys.I typically play one case (which can last one to two hours) before giving myself a break.  A lot of friends have burntout on the game, which is a shame.  It can be a slower paced game, but it doesn't take away from the fact Rockstar created Los Angeles of 1947 in near perfect detail.			"

Despite what several of the reviews said, I willing to give it a shot.The problem I encountered is that the FPS locks around 30 FPS and seems to fluctuate frequently, which made the game difficult to play.L.A. Noire seems like a good game that people could really enjoy, but the PC port just isn't the greatest. If you want to play L.A.

												This game is a pile of hot garbage. Unless it has some amazing reveal (like you've been in the animus or dreaming or delusional) after the first couple cases that sheds light on why the potrail of cops is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the basic gameplay mechanics are ridiculously flawed, I don't understand why it has any positive reviews. I see people compare this to a nega-gta, but honestly it just feels like playing gta from the prospective of a cop (who kills just about as many people as a side gta character). It doesn't do the ""detective"" experince well at all; the cases are either stupid simple or the pc makes ridiculous leaps in judgement about evidence and suspects. It's impossible to immerse yourself when the pc is soooo speculative, and you get no sense that you're in anyway stearing what he's saying. There are only ever 3 dialouge options, and none of them say anything about what happens when you choose them. Most of them cause the pc to explode completely unprovoked about something you wheren't even thinking of! I BARELY FEEL LIKE IM PLAYING AS THE PLAYER CHARACTER. Also, its racist as ♥♥♥♥, all of the cops are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s; it is litterly impossible to apprehend anyone without beating them to the ground or killing them. AND THIS IS NOT CALLED OUT AT ALL. There doesn't seem to be any tounge in check to the racism, not even time period awarness. There are moments of exteremely excessive police brutality AND NOT A WORD IS SAID, there is no undertone of acknowledgement of anything, its like the game just shrugs its shoulders and walks away without addressing it.  This game isn't even worth an in-depth review, so here's a comparative one: Imagine GTA but all the story is told through the worst designed and most historically ignorant Telltale game ever made.

												do not buy this game it will not work on win 10 and steam wont refund if u had it longer than 2  weeks even though they ask you to explore alll possible ways of getting it to work which i did now im stuck with a game that dont even bloody work thanks steam. but that wont be the end of it cause in the uk we have trading standards and they view this as not fit for purpose and i will get refunded regardless all u have to do is report it to trading standards and then report to your bank and under the visa guarantee you are covered for such instances. steam should not be selling games knowing that there are issues or at the very least issue a warning so atleast you are made aware. this is just another reason why the gaming industry needs to be better regulated to stop us gamers from being taken advantage of. i like steam very much but when things like this happen it really does spoil what should be fun and the majority of us work damn hard for our money only to be sold games that have issues and i really dont believe for 1 min steam arent aware of issues on some games. so from now on i will not purchase a game until i know for 100% it is as described and fully works.

												Most people were unimpressed, I'm not one of them.The order of the missions is out of whack at first glance, but if you've studied or really understand film noire I think you'll ""get"" where the devs were going. Unfortunately, most people don't, and so get lost. That's mostly on the devs in my opinion. A game should be enhanced by subtly following tropes, not require them to enjoy the work.Maybe play it once and then read the wiki to understand all of the nods and connections to film noire. The game will really bloom in your head at that point. Or if you know what Double Indemnity is, or DON'T think the Maltese Falcon was the only ♥♥♥♥ing film noir film ever made then you and L.A.

												It's a good game but not a great one. I don't know you folks but I find it boring to do the same sh*t over and over again and in these days, a lot of gamers whine about this issue. I'm not saying this game makes you do same thing over and over again. Cases differ from each other in many aspects but basicly they are all the same to me.

The game is actually based on gathering evidence and reading peoples faces correctly. But it's not enough, you have to bring up the right evidence in order to push the guy you are interviewing.

												L.A Noire is a gritty crime drama set in the 40's of Los Angeles, where the player plays the role of Cole Phelps, Detective of the LAPD. The game sees you play 4 desks which are traffic, murder, vice and arson. The gunfights are seldom(ish) but are very fun and realistic. The game also has call-outs that may occour at any time whilst you are driving. Moreover, the game also offers landmarks that you discover by driving around the streets of LA. You can also collect vehicles, and this will earn you (approximately) 3 achievements on Steam, Xbox or PS3. A lot of people complain about having hardware problems, but the only problem I've ever experienced is the Checking for DLC problem. It is capped at 30 FPS, but that is to make sure every detail is in sync. In conclusion, this game receives a 9/10. I would score a 10/10 but the problems affect a large scale of people. However, it is nothing Google can fix. Definitely should buy.			"

												I can't recommend the game as I didn't enjoy it enough to finish it, I quit after 5 hours.The PC port isn't great, it's hard locked at 30fps (Widescreen Fixer allows 60fps), it's visually poor until you start fiddling with Nvidia Inspector, I added 16x AF, better AA, 2K DSR and more and then it became fine to look at but the game just ultimately bored me. I was expecting a more story driven game ala Life is Strange but L.A Noire is more of a GTA/Life Is Strange hybrid and I didn't enjoy it. In my 5 hours I basically did the same thing over and over just on different cases, there's no real overarching story so you feel absolutely no connection to any of the characters and I think that's what really killed it for me.

He's a great guy imooverall great game, storyline, physics, everything you name it Rockstar, You're the best, the FPS limit just ruined it allGame tested with Intel Core i5, GeForce 840M 4GB, 12GB RAM. ¬Happy hunting.¬  A.Valon			"

												""It was a dark day, the sun was shining blightly and i was at home, as always. But suddenly a sale appeared on steam store, i checked it. It was a sale of some company, called ""Rockstar"". ""-Hey, i heard somewhere that name. Oh right those guys made that buggy, glitchy GTA 4"" So, what do I think about this game? WelGameplay wise- It's really freaking cool, but because of the terrible port the game sometimes was laggy and the experience sucked. But, those graaaphincs maaan. Yes, graphics are indeed gud. Those facial expression are well made.Music is something Indiana Jones-esk combined with mafia 2. Basically your typical detective.I would suggest buying this game on a console, because it's just less buggy, but i'm sure you can fix everything with mOADS these days.(P.S: Most noticeable thing is your mouse at the menu, it just lags sometimes)Cars weren't bad looking AND i've had fun shooting from the guns. Shotgun especially.So in conclusion: If you want an L.A detective with great voiceact, tons of plot twist and even sometimes clever jokes with laggy mouse at the menu.Then this game was made for you, but i still recommend getting it on console\Oh and DLC's are top-notchI reccomend buying them.

I was expecting a more story driven game ala Life is Strange but L.A Noire is more of a GTA/Life Is Strange hybrid and I didn't enjoy it.

You deal with a lot of crime action and investigating. After half way through the game you start to get bored of doing the same thing over and over. The ending (I will not spoil it) WAS ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL. Omg one of the worst endings ever I spent 30 hours on this game and ended up being dissapointed...

												This game is really what you make of it.  If you use the crutches in game options it's a fairly straight forward game with movie quality characters and story.  If you turn the crutches off, you'll ride the highs and lows of being a police detective in the 1940's, so much so that after a bad case you're gonna want to go on a bender and slug your wife.  Don't do it though.I used the crutches playing the tutorial cases and it seemed fairly easy getting all the clues with little music tones and hints where they are and the music stops you've found them all in an area, then it was a little challenging during interrogations trying to find the right approach and use the right evidence when catching them in lies.Then I discovered how to turn EZ mode off.  Go to game options and change ""Clue Music"" to ON so there's no music indicator for when you've found all the clues, and turn ""Clue Hints"" to off so there are no hints to where clues are.Once you take EZ mode off, the game is really fulfilling as the successes become oh so sweet, and the failures are absolute facepalm.  Without 100% certainty of finding all the clues, it gets REALLY frustrating as suspects lie to your face but you don't have the evidence to nail them, and the facial animations are so lifelike that you'll seriously want to backhand people as they roll their eyes and smirk during questioning.  Great game, well worth the money, and I'm only halfway through it.  (Warning: my play time doesn't reflect how long the game actually takes to beat because I've had to spend alot of time on the pause screen.)			"

												This is a game for those who are in love with the film noir genre. The game is not spectacular as a game, having many shortcommings, but for for those Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe fan, it's exactly the detective work dose they need. The game has spectacular graphics, not to mention the face animations, which are not really animated as much as they are motion captured. The city map is huge and it realistically copies Los Angeles of the 40's. The drivable cars are also awesome and there are about 95 cars in the game to collect, which is awesome. The bad part is  that the city doesn't present many activities and those which exist are rather repetitive, though always entertaining. (Spoilers from here on) The cases are very entertaing and each one represents the exact amount of noir a person needs for a day, in the sense that each case lasts about 1-1,5 hours which is about a noir movie so that's a good thing. Also the noir fans will recognize many references to noir movies( either in main cases or sidequests). Now the bad parts. The cases are entertaining at first and in the end. I don't know why they left the middle ones, more exatcly the ones in Homicide to be so repetitive, except the last one. And also in these cases, many times i observed that i got the wrong guy and it was clearly obvious, yet i couldn't do anythong about it because the game is very liniar. I knew that a guy or another wasn't guilty but i couldn't  change mi options and the acussed ones didn't cooperate even when the game obliged me to book them, although they were inocent. Then, when Cole is kicked out by his wife, i didn't feel anything because we never see her or his kids before it's convenient for the intrigue.          Another big problem is the fact that the character you play like the last 3 or 4 cases is more likeble and more a noir hero than the character with which you played 3 quarters of the game. Also you invest time and interest in Cole Phelps, the main character, just so you can play the final mission with another character, which is an insult for me as a gamer.          Also the game's core mechanics are more or less rubbish, that is until you get acustomed with them. What i'm refering to are the interogation mechanics. They are flawed in the sense that at first they are unclear and many times i picked the wrong answer because, the game made What the character was about to say unclear. An improvement would have been if in interogations next to the captions of truth, lie, and doubth, the dialog of my character for each choice would be shown(like in mass effect, for example).         My final verdict would be an 8-8.3 for this game, and i clearly recomended for everyone, not only noir fans, because it's badass in spite of its flaws and a type of game that i would like to see and play again in the future, with the condition that it's perfectioned. It manages to create and convey an atmosphere so authenthic that you will either stop and ask yourself if you are watching a noir movie or you will take a brake to fill your glass with scotch and light a new cigarette. The only major question to ask yourself before buying this game must be, "" Can i and do i  like playing slow moving games that concentrate on story and revolutionary motion capture and lying detection techniques rather than non-stop action and a multitude of sidequests and activities?""     P.S. If you want to buy the game buy the complete edition, it's the only one that's really worth it because you have about 8 more cases that in the simple edition and  those cases make the experience more complete.

												It's a BAD pc port, as its capped at 30FPS, and it has texture popins and other oddities. If its really cheap though, buy it. Otherwise, skip it. It has a solid story and its for those guys who wanna be detectives and find ALL the clues, but if you want a sandbox game, then please go get something else!			"

Pros:The performances by the actors are really good.Los Angeles is huge and beautiful (for the graphics of the time), and its really hard to tell the repetitive use of various buildings.The game elements themselves are varied being a combination of puzzler (clue finding and determining truth in POI questioning), third-person cover shooter, and (less common) foot chases, car chases, tailing a suspect unseen, and (rarely) unique mini-games involving evidence reconstruction. All of this is broken up into chunks that can be played a case or two at a time.Cons:The car-driving mechanic of the game is clunky and handles poorly. It's easy with barely any key pressure to send your vehicle careening to either side, making even simple turns at intersections overly difficult. It greatly increases the likelihood of crashing into something, particularly during critical game sequences involving chases (of which there are many).The cover mechanism is clunky as well, particularly when you have to break cover and run.Major Criticism:The story structure and length. The game is big and ambitious, and really deserved to work. Driving around 1947 Los Angeles you can see where Rockstar is headed with open world settings, though the game doesn't quite fall into that category because most of the city is cosmetic. Fortunately enough does work to recommend the game, but it comes with some heavy caveats.First, the length. While you can't claim you aren't getting your money's worth, you have to work your way every case, 21 + 5 DLC (they aren't optional either if you bought the extended edition). This isn't counting all the street crime cases (40 total) which are small but add up quickly. Rumor has it that Team Bondi had two other desks (Burglary and Fraud) that didn't make it into the game because Rockstar said it was already long enough.The length immediately sets up a problem with pacing for the main narrative comprised of two non-overlapping arcs, one that encompasses the entire homicide desk (the middle third of the game) and the other that covers the vice and arson desks (the final third). The problem is that the Patrol plus Traffic desks (first third) already take a long time to get through, and by then the witness-questioning game element that is repeated in every case has already lost its novelty and become relatively easy to get a high score.And that's a shame because Homicide is where the story begins to get interesting, even though the Vice/Arson arc is the better story. Furthermore, the split arc means the majority of major characters aren't even introduced until you reach Vice/Arson. And the Arson desk is really more focused on resolving the final arc than investigating arson cases. What this all amounts to is that the story design should have been geared to be much tighter (combine Patrol and Traffic) with elements that tied into both arcs, and each desk having maybe 3-4 cases that drove the story with the others cases being more like side quests. Try as they might, the street crime cases are too small to be full side quests.SPOILERSThe two arcs themselves are also a bit flawed in execution. The Homicide desk cases focus exclusively on women being murdered, and revolves around the very well-known and unresolved case of the Black Dahlia. The problem is that you can figure out well ahead of time there can be no resolution since it's unsolved in real life. What's disappointing is that you do solve the case, but in the last two minutes you get a very lame and un-original excuse for why you can't go public with the truth. Everyone is sworn to secrecy and no one seems outraged about it.The Arson/Vice story, while very engaging suffers also from bad story-telling moments. The first is that super boy scout Cole Phelps has an affair with Elsa Lichtmann. It feels completely forced and is mostly unexplained, serving only to set up his transition to Arson and the introduction of Jack Kelso. This feels utterly weird because after 35+ hours working your way through the game, you end up playing another character you barely know during the last few cases before the credits roll.Rating: 7/10A flawed gem. This one is a time commitment as game progression is completely linear and no desk case, including DLC, is optional. "

												Ok LA Noire is hand down one of the grestest games of all time for me...Rockstar games once again put me in connection to the character which is really hard to do in the game and you see while later..You play as Cole Phelps. a once LAPD Patrol officer and throughout the story you become Promoted through the ranks and even demoted.. (I Wont spoil what happens to you to make you get demoted!)Every mission is diffrent every mission as new characters.. preety stupid to mention but it defiantly is noticable...The cases that are also provided are very very detailed..so as of before i said you get promoted through the story you take part inPatrolTrafficHomicideViceArson All very very good storylines homicide being the best in my opinion..Aswell you get access to another character called Jack Kelso a once friend of Cole Phelps.Im leaving th rest with you. Please please please buy this game its not one to miss. 10/10 Would charge suspects for petty crimes for no reason again.			"

												Just as the famous Quentin Tarantino followed his critically acclaimed, violent, bloody, thrill ride that was Pulp Fiction with a elequent, genius, and masterful Jackie Brown, Rockstar Games follows up their bloody masterpiece of Grand Theft Auto with the detailed, astonishing world of a noire style Los Angeles. You are the hot shot Det. Cole Phelps of the LAPD, and nothing is going to come in between you and the scumbags and criminals of L.A. Analyze the slightest facial ticks, pour over every inch of the crime scene, because that one clue, that one hint, that one detail will mean putting the bad guy away for life, or letting him continue to roam the booming and crime infested streets of your city.

												Pros:- Detective work and action scenes; good combo- Well laid out mysteries, things fit in- Very deep interaction with the events, even the slightest move can change it all- Dem faces and face tech- Atmosphere is engrossing and relievingCons:- Suffers from the controls of other Rockstar games; controller-specced- Choices you're given seem to ""embelish"" what they mean, 'doubt' means 'bluff'- Can feel a bit of a snore at times, you kinda wish the game would just get on with itOverall: 7.0This is like Pheonix Wright with a realistic edge on it, getting into the feel of a detective and working out all of the cases makes you feel accomplished and stunned with everything happening, but beyond that, there's nothing hidden behind the game, it's just that. The city and all of it's buildings, landmarks, inhabitants, criminals and suspects, all feel very appropiate and well designed. My personal peeve is that the story is too much ""Harry Potter"", why couldn't it just be about a detective, working with a bunch of different cases?			"

												A great slice-of-the-40's game that delivers something much different than the usual Rockstar fare of bullying schoolchildren, slicing up people in ultraviolent torture porn, and lighting hookers on fire. LA Noire is an interesting detective game with a unique gameplay feature in that when interrogating suspects, you can actually judge their intent and guilt by watching their facial expressions. While the motion-captured faces can see incredibly unnatural at times (a common complaint about the game), once you get over it, you can enjoy the great voice acting and writing, and really get into it.

												L.A Noire feels very much like an old Film Noire flick (this is strenghtened further by the option to play the whole game in black and white). It's quite a unique and gripping exprerience. The story is the game's strongest part and it is one of the best plots i have seen in a long time. However, the story feels like a strong, but closed exprerience, meaning that the game has little replayability.To put it shortly, great story, good graphics and animation and believable characters.There are some problems, but in my opinion they rarely detract enjoyment from the game. None the less to be honest i feel that i should note them down, so read on if you like a little nitpicking.The driving mechanic can be annoying during chases, though hardly horrible. There isn't a whole lot to do apart from following the missions. While the story characters are nicely designed, the random ones aren't.Just to finish the review on a positive note, the game has a huge amount of celebrity look-alikes, and it can be a lot of fun to try and figure out where you know a face from. There are also a lot of tips of the hat to classic movies, which i also apprecieated. "

												This game consists in a repetitive series of miniepisodes where you have a crime, you go to the crime location to look for clues, you interrogate the witnesses (the game has great facial animation so you can see if they are lying), solve the crime, get to the criminal, he will run away, chase, you catch him. Repeat this a dozens of time for every ""episode"" in a big but really generic city.			"

												To be perfectly honest, this is one of the best games I have played in some time. The gameplay is fun, both the shootouts, the car chases, the clue finding and the interrogations, though a couple of the sequences drag out a bit. The story also is interesting, however it might not be the most unique or original out there. On the characters, not all of them are what you'd call completely three dimensional, but most of the central ones are very interesting and memorable.  But when it all comes together, it just works beautifully. The characters and how they interact as the story progresses, the cases you solve and the bad guys you gun down, the whole thing feels like playing through a really good crime novel or series or something. If that sounds even remotely interesting, I would highly recommend you to get your hands on this masterpiece.			"

												Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: MediumBudget: Worth it. Lenght: At least a few days. L. A. Noire is one of the best police games out there. I'd love to see a modern game use some of the same ideas that were used for making this game a great ""detective"" game. The cases in L. A. Noire can be solved in slightly different ways, resulting in slightly different consequences through out the game, and the mechanics of the game function almost flawlessly. Combat, chases, interrogations, looking for evidence and just driving around in classic GTA 4 style (the game uses the same engine) is all entertaining enough on it's own to warrant a 5/10 rating. The game also has a great story, albeit very tragic (hence the title), and can at times feel like it's almost mocking how crazy Los Angeles is/was (no offense, it's just a very different city) in best GTA style, but it feels very serious. The characters in the game, and especially the motion capture that was used to get their facial expressions just right makes dialogues truly amazing.			"

												set in the late 40's with post war heroes, LA Noire is a fun crime drama.  What makes this game enjoyable is the excellent stories and reading facial expressions of your suspects and witnesses.  What i don't like is some of the action scenes.  Gun fight dynamics are ok, but when they start making the character balance on beams etc it seems out of place for this game.

												The story has some weak points, and I'm not sure if it totally resolves. But I had a ton of fun looking for clues and running around the incredibly-detailed setting. Busting bad guys in the act was pretty fun too. YOUR FACE IS A LIAR'S FACE. I CAN TELL BECAUSE YOU'RE SMILING AT ME.Highlights: ZOOM INTO EVERY CLUE. PLAY WITH CORPSES WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF TAINTING THE EVIDENCE (DNA SHMEE-NA). GRISLY CASES, GOOFY CASES, MOB CASES, HOORAY!Low...lights: About four interchangeable components to most cases: the car chase*, the shoot-out, the drive-around-and-investigate, and the interrogation. The latter two were fun because CLUES, SCOOBY! The former two get tiring, especially because the physics in this game somehow register many things as unbreakable, even when rammed by a 2-ton Chrysler. I'm looking at you, WOODEN FENCE.* Not to be used as a driving simulator.			"

												Calling this game ""GTA for good guys' doesn't do it justice or an honest review. Sure, it's a classic Rock Star engine - but it's also more. What's been done with mo-cap for the actor's faces and body language is something I found myself hoping doesn't end up just be a one and done gimmick. It really helped that feeling of immersion along into a classic film noir experience filled with faithful reproduction of 1940s LA geography, classic cars, star struck hopefuls and the human collateral damage that inhabit The City of Angels. It took me more than one false start to give this the shot it ultimately deserved, in no small part due to the unnecessary social framework tossed on top of the game that has since been made optional (I speak of the social club here). In the end that was my biggest problem with the game and I wish I hadn't let it get in the way as long as I let it. Fans of sandbox games, detective novels or classic film noir entries should definitely get their hands on this game - it would be hard to be disappointed!			"

Pros:The performances by the actors are really good.Los Angeles is huge and beautiful (for the graphics of the time), and its really hard to tell the repetitive use of various buildings.The game elements themselves are varied being a combination of puzzler (clue finding and determining truth in POI questioning), third-person cover shooter, and (less common) foot chases, car chases, tailing a suspect unseen, and (rarely) unique mini-games involving evidence reconstruction. All of this is broken up into chunks that can be played a case or two at a time.Cons:The car-driving mechanic of the game is clunky and handles poorly. It's easy with barely any key pressure to send your vehicle careening to either side, making even simple turns at intersections overly difficult. It greatly increases the likelihood of crashing into something, particularly during critical game sequences involving chases (of which there are many).The cover mechanism is clunky as well, particularly when you have to break cover and run.Major Criticism:The story structure and length. The game is big and ambitious, and really deserved to work. Driving around 1947 Los Angeles you can see where Rockstar is headed with open world settings, though the game doesn't quite fall into that category because most of the city is cosmetic. Fortunately enough does work to recommend the game, but it comes with some heavy caveats.First, the length. While you can't claim you aren't getting your money's worth, you have to work your way every case, 21 + 5 DLC (they aren't optional either if you bought the extended edition). This isn't counting all the street crime cases (40 total) which are small but add up quickly. Rumor has it that Team Bondi had two other desks (Burglary and Fraud) that didn't make it into the game because Rockstar said it was already long enough.The length immediately sets up a problem with pacing for the main narrative comprised of two non-overlapping arcs, one that encompasses the entire homicide desk (the middle third of the game) and the other that covers the vice and arson desks (the final third). The problem is that the Patrol plus Traffic desks (first third) already take a long time to get through, and by then the witness-questioning game element that is repeated in every case has already lost its novelty and become relatively easy to get a high score.And that's a shame because Homicide is where the story begins to get interesting, even though the Vice/Arson arc is the better story. Furthermore, the split arc means the majority of major characters aren't even introduced until you reach Vice/Arson. And the Arson desk is really more focused on resolving the final arc than investigating arson cases. What this all amounts to is that the story design should have been geared to be much tighter (combine Patrol and Traffic) with elements that tied into both arcs, and each desk having maybe 3-4 cases that drove the story with the others cases being more like side quests. Try as they might, the street crime cases are too small to be full side quests.SPOILERSThe two arcs themselves are also a bit flawed in execution. The Homicide desk cases focus exclusively on women being murdered, and revolves around the very well-known and unresolved case of the Black Dahlia. The problem is that you can figure out well ahead of time there can be no resolution since it's unsolved in real life. What's disappointing is that you do solve the case, but in the last two minutes you get a very lame and un-original excuse for why you can't go public with the truth. Everyone is sworn to secrecy and no one seems outraged about it.The Arson/Vice story, while very engaging suffers also from bad story-telling moments. The first is that super boy scout Cole Phelps has an affair with Elsa Lichtmann. It feels completely forced and is mostly unexplained, serving only to set up his transition to Arson and the introduction of Jack Kelso. This feels utterly weird because after 35+ hours working your way through the game, you end up playing another character you barely know during the last few cases before the credits roll.Rating: 7/10A flawed gem. This one is a time commitment as game progression is completely linear and no desk case, including DLC, is optional. "

												I really enjoyed this game.  I had a blast driving my cop car around town, siren wailing, and watching vehicles and people dodge out of the way.  I definitely dig the investigation aspect that was presented more so than twitch-action gaming.  It's more casual with a little action along the way to keep things diverse.  Yes, there are issues with the interrogation process that don't quite make sense but the whole things is still enjoyable and I love the noire setting.  I doubt I would've paid the full price for it originally but it is worthwhile picking it up on Steam for cheap.			"

												I bought this because it was on sale the other day and since I rented it from Blockbuster (when they were still around), I never got to finish this on my Xbox or play any of the DLC. This is a really good game minus the controls, driving and movement. The story is what makes this game playable because you wanna know what happens. I love mystery and figuring out what happened, so if you like solving puzzles, crimes and what not, this is the game for you.			"

												A great storyline and historically truly accurate. If you like Noire films or detective/mystery novels this is the game for you! It has quite a few really big (real life) crime stories of L.A. If you like the freedom to shoot or kill anyone - this probably not the game for you (which was the case for my brother and a few friends). I enjoyed it, though. I purchased in the Holiday Steam sale of 2012 and honestly I wouldn't have otherwise gotten it. I don't think its worth more than $10 at this point, though.			"

												As a game? Awesome!! I love games set in a 40's-50's era. The music, the clothes.. Everything about it is just awesome (apart from everyone smoking in your face)...But as a game on pc? Please listen to me here.. You really should have a nice PC to play this without issues. And I seriously mean ABOVE AVERAGE. No fricken joke. Im far passed the recommended min req (3.4ghz quad core, 16gigs ram, and a 4GB GTX 860m). And the game STRUGGLES to hold its 30fps cap. Poor optimization means for the most part, the game runs OK (solid 30), but then randomly can drop to 19fps for no reason. These frame rate drops appear in various locations on the map, and quite often when looking directly at a suspect's house when entering... In traffic, 19fps makes the game really un-enjoyable.. Reason? Crappy optimization for PC.So my suggestion? Get the game on console (Xbox360/PS3) OR if you only have a PC, wait for a sale and pick it up for $5. If you pay full price ($20 base or $30 complete) - You *MAY* feel cheated. The only reason i thumbs down is because Rockstar could have done a better job porting over.. or at least continued to patch it. "

												Impressive tech combined with an interesting story and solid gameplay.Its similiar to the point and click police games of the past but in real time instead. The main thing here is the story where action segments are really just a way to break up the investigations and keep the game from being monotanous. The shooting, driving, and open world are really more of a secondary aspect where the investigations are the main thing you do in the game. The action isn't anything new or hugely interesting but the shooting and driving are solid enough and fun enough to not become annoying especially when broken up in between investigating. What you do alot of is talk to people and figure out if they are lying or telling the truth essentially. This can be very hard and in some contexts I found that the game didn't make logical sense in what I was allowed to use as evidence of a lie in a conversation. Usually though it is logical and there is alot of help mechanics in the game ranging from intuition points that literally remove wrong answers or show you what the community has choosen statistically, to suspects using questions to tell the player what evidence would be applicable in a given situation. Its really fun to actually do but can be extremely frustrating at points.The story is also very good. Very gritty and unfortunately realistic. I don't want to spoil anything but just know that the story and cases are very intertwined and can be hard to connect the dots at first. The story goes places and is diffrent and not always predictable. I really like it... even if I don't always like what happens.The setting is lovely. This is when the USA was at its epitome in most ways.  Its lovely to see all the classic cars (which are actual Ford or Chevy vehicles) and buildings aswell as clothes and everything in this game fits in the time period as far as I can tell.The big downside is that this PC version is very messed up. Its very glitchy at times and loads much slower on the fly than I remember the PS3 version. Having things pop in very close to you is pretty common aswell as having sound cues not work right or animations of characters faces wig the heck out in scary ways. I encountered nothing that broke my game but it was very hard to know if I found all the clues in a given area because I felt the majority of the time the audio cue that tells you that you found the cues, it just wouldn't play and when it did it seemed incorrect to me. Rockstar gave up on the PC very long ago but this game is still solid enough to enjoy on PC.The facial animation tech is amazing, its a real shame they didn't go full GTA on this game and expand it as much as a GTA game. You can't fly planes or shoot people out of a combat sequence but there are some street crimes for you to answer the call to. Outside the story though unless you want to do street crime missions or collect useless items/find historic buildings theres nothing really to do. I don't have as much an issue with this as some would because I enjoy experiencing a place or era that would be impossible otherwise. One of the biggest complains I have had is that they didn't adopt the physics engine of GTA4 into this game, so you have much more in terms of canned animations and boring physics compared to GTA4. Looking at the Rockstar Games releases after GTA4 it seems they gave up on Euphoria physics which really does make the games worse as that physics model is still fun to toy with in GTA4 to this day.This is one of my favorite games, there just isn't alot of real time police games especially ones with this level of writing and actual care put into them. The ambient chatter of people is at times hilarous and at others extremely helpfull. Not often do I find a game story that I actually care about. The only complaints could be the PC port being not great and the actual real time action combat are a pretty baseline but are solid			"

												I enjoyed this game immensely!  If you enjoy crime dramas or just want to experience a game world similar to the movie 'LA Confidential', then this game delivers!The best feature of this game is the acting and motion capture.  If you watch a 'making of' video, then you'll see the incredible tech they put in place to capture actors face reactions and performances as part of the characters in the game.  This makes the game highly immersive and helps to deliver many interesting stories (crime cases).In some ways, sovling crimes is like playing an interactive story more than a game.  However, I found it a really enjoyable and entertaining experiece!  You do feel involved and in control, so it's not a QTE experience.The game does borrow heavily from the Grand Theft Auto style of open world play.  I was not a big fan of this style of open world play.  You can discover mini-cases or bust robberies in progress as you drive around the city, but none of these are very compelling or story driven.  Thankfully, this part of the game is completely optional.  In fact, even driving is optional as you can have your partner drive you straight to the scene of the crime!I simply loved this game, and hope so much that Rockstar does a sequel in the future!			"

												Pros:- Detective work and action scenes; good combo- Well laid out mysteries, things fit in- Very deep interaction with the events, even the slightest move can change it all- Dem faces and face tech- Atmosphere is engrossing and relievingCons:- Suffers from the controls of other Rockstar games; controller-specced- Choices you're given seem to ""embelish"" what they mean, 'doubt' means 'bluff'- Can feel a bit of a snore at times, you kinda wish the game would just get on with itOverall: 7.0This is like Pheonix Wright with a realistic edge on it, getting into the feel of a detective and working out all of the cases makes you feel accomplished and stunned with everything happening, but beyond that, there's nothing hidden behind the game, it's just that. The city and all of it's buildings, landmarks, inhabitants, criminals and suspects, all feel very appropiate and well designed. My personal peeve is that the story is too much ""Harry Potter"", why couldn't it just be about a detective, working with a bunch of different cases?			"

												Personally, my favorite game of all time.  Played it first on Xbox 360 and replayed it several times.  The dialogue and script is perfectly written.  It contains everything a good detective story requires and more.  Although it does not seem as seemless and smooth on PC (people seem to be complaining about the PC port), it is still worth playing, and playing again.  The best part is that half the time it feels like you're watching a movie or mini-series rather than actually playing a game.			"

I love the atmosphere, I love the music, I love the cases, I love the facial gestures,I freaking LOVE this game. This is a unique, one of a kind, and one of the best games I have ever played. You are the law in this game, you brought bad guys to justice and make streets of L.A. safe . But there are always crime to be dealt with and punishment to be given. Rockstar made one of the best games that will always stay in my heart and that I will never forget. One of a kind. It really brought a tear to my eye after I finished everything in the game and that I won't be able to play it again like I did for the first time and that it's over. I played and put a lot of hours into this game on PS3 that I can't possibly imagine. Rating is ∞/10 . Rockstar you really did a masterpiece here.			"

												This game is amazing, I have played it on all platforms, Ps3, Xbox 360, and PC. I bought it evey time. The ps3 was a family console, so I swapped it out for the 360 version to play in my own enviroment. As soon as it went on sale on steam i bought it, because i have a xbone, and don't play the 360 much anymore. This is a very innovative game. Screw non stop action, this game truly turns you into a hard broiled detective.			"

												L.A. Noire is built around giving players the ability to, as the name perfectly implies, unleash the Force. This is a version of the Force that really hasn't been seen anywhere before, with over-the-top uses of things like Force Push. When you go to push a stormtrooper away from you, he won't just fall over, he'll fly. You can Force Grip soldiers and toss them into oncoming TIE fighters, stab someone with a nicely tossed lightsaber that happens to be electrified for extra coolness, or use a good old bit of Force Repulse to shove a group of soldiers away from you and off the side of a suspended bridge (which will also result in the bridge buckling from the blast).When you first take control of Vader's secret apprentice, he's already pretty powerful with Force Push and Force Grip in his repertoire. But by the time you reach the end of the game, he's incredibly powerful. Stormtroopers that previously took a few swipes of a lightsaber to down now hit the floor in one swoop, and your Force powers will recharge quickly for repeated use. Being able to Force Push one guy off a ledge, electrify the guy next to him, slice down a third trooper and then Force Repulse all of their bodies off your standing within a couple seconds is flat-out awesome.

												The storytelling is OK, seems typical for the genre. The way they handled the graphics is very interesting and I'd like to see more of it in games. Searching for clues and trying to questions suspects seemed difficult in a way that wasn't intended. The gun fights were surprisingly ok, considering I usually absolutely loathe action sequences like that.However I think this game is a massive failure in one key aspect: I do not like the main character. I do not relate to them. I do not want to know more about them.You can have a successful game like that, but not with the way they told this story. The way the plot is handled, you are meant to think the main character is a Good Guy, wholesome and likeable. Then, as the story goes on, you discover - gasp! He might not be so good! A typical plotline that works just fine. But, from the very beginning, he is exactly the sort of person I hate.He doesn't interfere or hardly even comment when his coworkers mention despicable things. When someone is doing something immoral, his first response is to walk away and ignore it. Very ""I'll have no part of this"" - not a hero type, but an everyday type. Only this isn't a slice of life; we don't get to see the mundane aspects of his life, so we don't relate to him as an everyday type either. He's boring.Yeah. No.			"

L.A. Noire: The Game That Should Have Been A MovieThis is the type of game that features excellent acting, story, writing, and dialogue, but is missing the most important element of any video game: good gameplay. Slogging through each and every case in L.A. Noire felt like an absolute chore, and the thing that kept me going was my desire to view the story. This is one of the few games where I was more interested in the cutscenes than the actual game itself.My primary issue with L.A. Noire was that everything felt very forced. I started playing under the impression that I would be filling the role of a detective and be forced to think and make choices with every seemingly minute detail possibly being important. That is simply not what happens. The game does not let you come to your own conclusions and it does not let you be the detective. Rather, everything has been decided in advance and you are simply shuffled along through the story. For every action you take, every choice you make, there is a right one and a wrong one. A good example of this would be accusing the wrong man. Let's say that, after reviewing the evidence, you come to the conclusion that person X is guilty. So you accuse person X. If person Y was the right choice, then your boss will give you a scolding about how you've destroyed the whole case. This makes little sense. It gives the impression that throughout the whole case, your boss already knows who is truly guilty.This becomes even more of a problem as cases start to get more and more complicated. In one instance during the game, I knew a certain character was guilty. Let's call him Bob. The evidence, combined with a gut-feeling, gave me the impression that Bob was my guy. Unfortunately, the game did not want me to pick Bob. The only 'right' choice I could make was to accuse the other guy (call him Steve). So I went against my own judgement and picked Steve. Later on, I learned that, lo and behold, Steve was innocent the whole time. Instead of letting me accuse the guilty man, the game forced me to accuse the innocent one just so that later on my 'mistake' could play a role in the plot.That is the biggest issue with L.A. Noire. The story is fantastic, but it is very force-fed and you are not allowed to deviate from it all. This raises the question of why L.A. Noire needed to be a video game to begin with. I would much rather have been allowed to simply press play and watch it, instead of having to work my way through its gameplay. I felt like an actor; like I was being made to follow a script.Another issue of concern I will speak to briefly is the control. Having to rotate pieces of evidence instead of simply picking them up is tedious and unnecessary. I found myself constantly frustrated by having to painstakingly rotate an object to the exact correct angle before the game counts it as being seen. The cover and fighting mechanics also could have benefited from some polishing. Many times I died simply because the player character downright refused to follow my commands.To conclude, L.A. Noire has an excellent story to tell, and characters with plenty of depth that are all uniquely interesting. Unfortunately, it is plagued by hand-holding and terrible gameplay. L.A. Noire is an excellent example of why games should be games, and movies should be movies.			"

												Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: MediumBudget: Worth it. Lenght: At least a few days. L. A. Noire is one of the best police games out there. I'd love to see a modern game use some of the same ideas that were used for making this game a great ""detective"" game. The cases in L. A. Noire can be solved in slightly different ways, resulting in slightly different consequences through out the game, and the mechanics of the game function almost flawlessly. Combat, chases, interrogations, looking for evidence and just driving around in classic GTA 4 style (the game uses the same engine) is all entertaining enough on it's own to warrant a 5/10 rating. The game also has a great story, albeit very tragic (hence the title), and can at times feel like it's almost mocking how crazy Los Angeles is/was (no offense, it's just a very different city) in best GTA style, but it feels very serious. The characters in the game, and especially the motion capture that was used to get their facial expressions just right makes dialogues truly amazing.			"

												Hesitant non-recommendation. More neutral if that was a thing on Steam.This game is pretty fun early on. Figuring out people's tells and searching for clues to use against them keeps cases moving in an organic direction. Each case is roughly 45-60 minutes long which is perfect for short stints. Unfortunately, the game starts to feel pretty tedious about midway through. You'll notice a cycle of find clues, talk to guy, find more clues, talk to next guy, talk to another guy, put bad guy away. Throw in some car chases and shootouts and I've described every LA Noire case progression. And that brings us to the biggest negative. You are a detective and yet there is VERY LITTLE DEDUCTION IN LA NOIRE. Seriously. You can't lose a case - you just get different ranks. But it's not because you as the player discovered anything. It's because you picked up clues that obviously lead to the next point in the case. And holy crap do you find a lot of matchboxes to lead you to the next point in the case.The overall story doesn't even really get going until halfway through. But by then the game has already worn out its welcome. This game needed to be 10 hours, not 20+ hours. Even though the individual cases in the DLC are solid, I'd avoid them because it makes an already too long game even longer. There is fun to be had in LA Noire, but don't buy this detective game expecting to deduce anything like Sherlock Holmes. You're really just a human lie detector that wins no matter what at the end of the day anyway.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Over the past few years I've tried to play it to completion but am just never able to. This is mostly due to the repetitive cycle of - drive to crime scene, find evidence, leave crime scene, interrogate loved ones of the victim (don't get it twisted some of the dialog choices have you screaming at them), make wild accusation (at one point during an interview with a suspect I outright called them a pedophile with no real evidence other than a book I found with some boy names in it), then accuse the wrong person and then move on to the next case and repeat the cycle all over. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of things to like about this game. The hat physics alone are pretty neat, and the face capturing is pretty cool, even though I dont think it works like they want to it. Its not a bad game, I just feel like it gets boring really quickly.			"

												First of all if you are expecting a gta, or an action game, just stay away! I couldn't even finish this game! The gameplay was so boring! Always the same, nothing new, dull interrogation... Nice voice acting though. The story is good, as far as I went, I almost finished it. It has nice plot-twists, in fact the story is the only thing that kept me playing from a certain point... Besides that i would advise you to stay away from it.6.5/10			"

												Tried my best, but couldn't bring myself to finish the game.Yes there are great qualities about this game that the majority have pointed out, and while I agree most of them, here are my reasons on why I gave up:1) Repetitive. There's a chase scene in nearly every case. And while I could tolerate vehicle chases, running after suspects on foot when they have like a 20 second tackle immunity (through subtle speed boosts) got really boring and I dreaded such scenes.2) Even with the innovative facial expresions that this game touts it was frustrating at times deciding between a doubt and a lie, a choice with 2 very different results.3) Long downtime. Call me impatient but I don't really want to have to listen to the conversation again and not being able to skip just because I backed out of an accusation, or having to drive from one end of the city to the other for a clue, only to realise that I have to essentially drive back again. In fact, the scene where I decided to throw in the towel was at a warehouse on the first case as Ad. Vice. I was operating a crane that took its sweet time lowering and lifting boxes and then moving them to a different position so as to not block the path of the objective. "

												To be perfectly honest, this is one of the best games I have played in some time. The gameplay is fun, both the shootouts, the car chases, the clue finding and the interrogations, though a couple of the sequences drag out a bit. The story also is interesting, however it might not be the most unique or original out there. On the characters, not all of them are what you'd call completely three dimensional, but most of the central ones are very interesting and memorable.  But when it all comes together, it just works beautifully. The characters and how they interact as the story progresses, the cases you solve and the bad guys you gun down, the whole thing feels like playing through a really good crime novel or series or something. If that sounds even remotely interesting, I would highly recommend you to get your hands on this masterpiece.			"

												********** SETUP: ********** CPU: i5 3570k Ivy BridgeGPU: 650 Ti GTXRAM: 8 GBInput Preference: USB Xbox 360 Controller********** PROS: **********- Majority of the reviews I've seen on here bash the game for dirt poor performance, so I went in expecting the worst. Shocklingly enough, the game runs smoothly on my machine with absolutely no issues, whatsoever. Perhaps the people having problems have older machines or out of date drivers. I didn't need to mess with the command line or anything to get it to work. These issues could have been resolved through patches.- Game is fun to play, even though it gets a tad bit repetitive. - Facial features are AMAZING. Even better than today's games. This game has aged well.- Smooth animations and transitions; chases are seemless.- Has the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game.- Excellent graphical fidelity and sound.- It has a black and white option where it applies a filter to make it look like you're watching an old movie. It's actually pretty cool, even though I'd never use it, so it's a wasted feature for me... but it's there.- Menu is intuitive and easy to use. All appropriate features are there, including the option of turning off mouse acceleration, which is always nice, as it puts off a lot of people.- Consumer-friendly price for content: I got this game for under $9 a while back including all of the DLC.- I'm not sure how historically accurate the controls for the cars are, but vehicle controls are decent and driving doesn't feel frustrating.- Character movement is authentic/realistic.- The game allows you to fast travel ANYWHERE via your partner.- There are 7 things to do in this game: 1) Do the main missions. 2) Do the short side missions that pop up when you're on your way to the main mission. 3) Collecting cars (95 total). 4) There are many landmarks scattered throughout the city that you can find. As you are driving through the city and pass by a landmark, it gives you the option of pressing a button to record it. That's it. 5) There are various newspapers (13 total) found throughout the city. You can only collect these during the main missions. It is not possible to collect them in free roam, which is kinda dumb. 6) Finding hidden badges. 7) Finding film reels.********** CONS: **********- No manual save. I'm used to games providing both or just manual. Having only auto saves makes it so you can't start the game where you'd normally like. I like to reload saves to do things I normally wouldn't do.- Cutscenes aren't skippable. Meaning if you mess up a few times, you need to rewatch them. - The game is fullscreen while cutscenes are widescreen. I get that the devs were trying to give the game a movie-like feel to it, but it ends up being distracting/annoying and odd.- Intros (starting up the game) are not skippable so you have to wait a minute or so for the game to load (game's file system is not standard so I couldn't find the intros to rename them to make them not appear. Google was not helpful). This might seem like a minor issue, but it is greatly annoying, especially including the time it takes for the game to unneccessarily check for DLC content, which it shouldn't check for in each session.- Even though it's an open world game, it does not feel like it because there aren't any reasons to explore the city. If you are driving towards a mission marker, you'll ocassionally get these ""crime in progress"" missions (can choose to accept/deny) where you stop what you're doing to drive over to apprehend/kill criminals. These are nice and varied, but they aren't enough to help carry the game (not that long, usually 2-3 minutes) outside of the primary missions.- This is more of an interactive movie than an actual detective game. I felt like I was just being led from point A to point B. A few cases require you to use your brain, but the game is pretty straightforward, otherwise.- The world doesn't feel alive. NPCs have the same facial and aesthetic quality as the main characters, but they don't do anything unique in the environment. If you bump into them, they'll say things, but their mouths don't move. The most interaction you'll get from them is if you run into another NPC's car. It's cool because they'll do the whole ragdoll animation and look injured.- You will encounter chase sequences of various kinds. I just wish that the chases on foot were better. For example, if I'm chasing someone with a gun, I would like to shoot them in the leg to incapacitate and arrest them. You can fire warning shots, but sometimes it doesn't work so you'd think it'd make sense to shoot their foot. But if you do this, the criminal dies, which is dumb.- This game needs a difficulty setting. You can tinker around in the settings to turn off hints and such, but certain aspects like the combat aren't challenging at all. You get infinite ammo, enemies can't aim, and your character can soak up an outrageous amount of bullets. Granted, the emphasis on a game like this shouldn't be on combat, but considering there are a lot of combat-type sequences, it gets frustrating to the point where these sequences become pointless.- Double DRM (Rockstar Social Club + Steam). Seriously? At least it's better than GTA IV's triple DRM. Rockstar claims that the game can run by turning Steam off, but the game wouldn't launch when I did that. Most of people's launch problems are from these DRM related issues. Just be glad you don't have to deal with GFWL, in addition. - For me, it's not fun to drive, which sucks because driving is an important aspect of this game. The novelty of driving through 1940s L.A. wears off fairly quickly. Luckily, Rockstar anticipated this and included a fast travel option for your partner to drive you to your location. But when you do that, there's not too much left in the game, as you'll be blazing through the campaign in no time.- The game is not challenging. You can completely fail every case and you'll still progress and get the same ending to the game. The lack of branching based on progression (like Mass Effect) is very disappointing and further diminishes replay value.- I didn't enjoy a lot of the side activites (street crimes were good). Most of these feel like padding, to be quite honest.- Lack of mission variety. Pretty much every case is solved the same way. The mission  where you are tracking down the serial killer is INCREDIBLE and had me hooked because it was something different and fresh. It's easily the best mission in the game. The game started getting good after the the 7-8 hour mark.- This is one of those games that I don't see myself ever replaying. What would be the point? You already know who's guilty and who isn't. It would be like retaking an exam when you already know all of the answers. When you replay the missions, you already know how characters/suspects are going to behave. You could try to get a better rating, but that's not something I'd want to do.********** SHOULD YOU BUY IT?: **********While production value and graphical quality are tremendous, they shouldn't decide whether a game is worth playing/owning or not, but there really isn't a lot to do to extend the life of this game. Yeah, you can argue that it has a lot of outside activities, but I would argue that collectibles don't count, as I consider them to be annoying padding. There's no multiplayer and, as far as I know, no plans for additional DLC. The campaign is fun, but not one I'd play again and the side missions aren't interesting, aside from a few street crimes you encounter, but those can be finished rather quickly. With everything that I said, I still would recommend buying the game with all the DLC on a sale, rather than the vanilla game, itself. Despite all the negative things I had to say, there's no denying the fun that I had. Go and get it! "

												A really great game, but did I really have to give a negatively review only for the hope to get a patch for the launch problems of this game? Did Rockstar not care? Did Steam not care? So why? Because the community done a workaround for them?I will change my review when they fixed the launch issues officially. This unique game deserved it.If you don't care to do some registry edits manually, buy it. But for many people this will be too difficult.			"

												This game consists in a repetitive series of miniepisodes where you have a crime, you go to the crime location to look for clues, you interrogate the witnesses (the game has great facial animation so you can see if they are lying), solve the crime, get to the criminal, he will run away, chase, you catch him. Repeat this a dozens of time for every ""episode"" in a big but really generic city.			"

L.A. Noire: The Game That Should Have Been A MovieThis is the type of game that features excellent acting, story, writing, and dialogue, but is missing the most important element of any video game: good gameplay. Slogging through each and every case in L.A. Noire felt like an absolute chore, and the thing that kept me going was my desire to view the story. This is one of the few games where I was more interested in the cutscenes than the actual game itself.My primary issue with L.A. Noire was that everything felt very forced. I started playing under the impression that I would be filling the role of a detective and be forced to think and make choices with every seemingly minute detail possibly being important. That is simply not what happens. The game does not let you come to your own conclusions and it does not let you be the detective. Rather, everything has been decided in advance and you are simply shuffled along through the story. For every action you take, every choice you make, there is a right one and a wrong one. A good example of this would be accusing the wrong man. Let's say that, after reviewing the evidence, you come to the conclusion that person X is guilty. So you accuse person X. If person Y was the right choice, then your boss will give you a scolding about how you've destroyed the whole case. This makes little sense. It gives the impression that throughout the whole case, your boss already knows who is truly guilty.This becomes even more of a problem as cases start to get more and more complicated. In one instance during the game, I knew a certain character was guilty. Let's call him Bob. The evidence, combined with a gut-feeling, gave me the impression that Bob was my guy. Unfortunately, the game did not want me to pick Bob. The only 'right' choice I could make was to accuse the other guy (call him Steve). So I went against my own judgement and picked Steve. Later on, I learned that, lo and behold, Steve was innocent the whole time. Instead of letting me accuse the guilty man, the game forced me to accuse the innocent one just so that later on my 'mistake' could play a role in the plot.That is the biggest issue with L.A. Noire. The story is fantastic, but it is very force-fed and you are not allowed to deviate from it all. This raises the question of why L.A. Noire needed to be a video game to begin with. I would much rather have been allowed to simply press play and watch it, instead of having to work my way through its gameplay. I felt like an actor; like I was being made to follow a script.Another issue of concern I will speak to briefly is the control. Having to rotate pieces of evidence instead of simply picking them up is tedious and unnecessary. I found myself constantly frustrated by having to painstakingly rotate an object to the exact correct angle before the game counts it as being seen. The cover and fighting mechanics also could have benefited from some polishing. Many times I died simply because the player character downright refused to follow my commands.To conclude, L.A. Noire has an excellent story to tell, and characters with plenty of depth that are all uniquely interesting. Unfortunately, it is plagued by hand-holding and terrible gameplay. L.A. Noire is an excellent example of why games should be games, and movies should be movies.			"

												Personally, my favorite game of all time.  Played it first on Xbox 360 and replayed it several times.  The dialogue and script is perfectly written.  It contains everything a good detective story requires and more.  Although it does not seem as seemless and smooth on PC (people seem to be complaining about the PC port), it is still worth playing, and playing again.  The best part is that half the time it feels like you're watching a movie or mini-series rather than actually playing a game.			"

												If you're like me and just love those games that make you feel clever then get this! Searching for clues, questioning witnesses and suspects and deciding yourself whether they are telling the truth or not, choosing the right paths otherwise the case turns out bad; it's so involving! Just my type of game, and if you like mystery or even point & click adventures (which this is not but it is a similar kind of experience) then get this, without questioning (if you'll pardon the pun).Still, if you're a GTA fan and are just getting this because you think it may be similar then don't bother. It's not a run around, shoot everything, steal cars and have chases kinda game, but still amazing nevertheless!			"

												An ambitious game probably too ambitious for it's own good. There's no real rhyme or reason to the interogations at times. turning the game into a multiple choice test you didn't study for. The world, though it feels alive, is lackluster visually, the cars handle acceptable, and the gunplay can be fun at times but is usually boring. On the positive, the game has a great setting and is quite lengthy; adding in the DLC there is a lot of game to go around. The facial animation works wonderfully, but can leave the player baffled and frustrated without a ""baseline"" to go by.All in all, a severe disappointment that does have some enjoyment to be found. But, it's most definitely not worth more than $20.			"

												(Minor spoilers) This game is awful. Interrogations make no sense. People with no reason to lie regularly withhold information, all you really have to go on is facial expressions. And it's so stupidly easy to interpret them how the game wants, there is zero intrigue. Interviewee looks at the ground or eyes dart back and forth? Even if it happens only once and you believe the statement, doubt what he's saying.  Which leads to my next complaint - Half the time, the truth and doubt options are completely arbitrary, whatever you choose, your guy yells at and or calls the interviewee a liar, prompting the interviewee to complete the statement that you chose to believe or doubt before it was really even finished. And you would think that any and all information in a case would be available to present to suspects etc. But no. For example, while questioning a man about the last time he saw his wife, there is no way to pick at his statement about things getting ""out of hand"" before he left, despite the fact that a neighbor has told you that she saw a black eye on the wife after the fight. But at other times, you're expected to doubt a 15 year old girl who just found out her mother died, when she tells you she never really payed attention to the jewerely her mother wore. You have no reason at all to doubt this-you just met the girl and all you know is that the mother has had jewerly forcibly removed from her body and there's no trace of it in the home. And if you do choose the right answer, and doubt, she'll go on to tell you exactly what her mother wears in what is essentialy worded as the second half of her statement, as if your prodding jogged her memory. If you select truth, you suffer the wrong answer penalty and the girl doesn't tell you about her mom's jewerly. So often a characters tone will be totally out of context. You snap at just about anyone for anything. Half the time you select truth, you still call the person out for lying and or withholding something. The overarching story and my respect for Phelps as a character is ruined by moments like the one in a flashback to WWII in which he's shown defending the Japanese attack on pearl harbor: 'What would we do if another country cut off gas to run OUR cars?' Which is just stupid, considering the oil embargo was a result of Japan's imperialism. A game about solving mysteries face to face is devoid of logic and natural human reactions.			"

												L.A. Noire was one of the best games I have ever played, and that's why I am writing this review. Along with a tremendous and accruate representation of the 1940's Los Angeles, it has a wonderful and suspensful story. The graphics are on par for its time, and the gameplay is well done, although there is better. I would like to note, that I have not actually spent 100+ hours on this game, I just left it open (whoops) and it has about a 20 hour campaign, thats not including all of the street crimes and side ""missions"" to do in the game. It's a game I thoroughly enjoyed and I would recommend that everyone buy it with the DLC pack.8/10EDIT:I have returned to this game after about 1 year of not playing it, and something is really bothering me. I am just now realizing that this game is locked to 30 FPS. That is a shame. It drags performance down and really brings the game quality down. This disapointment has brought my rating down to an 8. This is still a great game, still worth buying, but the engine is a disapointment.			"

												Ok, so L.A. Noire, you probably heard of it. It's that game with the best facial animations, it uses MotionScan technology. It's the game's most prominent feature. L.A.Noire will take you through career of Cole Phelps, ex marine, who now works at LAPD. This means there is driving in what was meant to be near perfect recreation of LA (I can't judge this since I was never to LA, not to mention LA of 1947), shooting and investigation, which is the main focus of the game, involved. During your investigations you will be searching for clues, which may or may not be of further use to you but they all add to your rating that is given to you at the end of each case, and interview suspects & witnesses. This is where MotionScan comes to play, you will have to read expressions of a interviewed person to figure out whether he/she is lying, telling the truth or simply withholding something.Storywise it is decent, there are some decisions which are odd and questionable. Some of the cases just feel wrong if you look on them on their own, but I don't want to potentionaly spoil anything so I won't go into details. The game is linear so even tho you may know from where the wind blows you are still forced to do thing you may not like in order to progress. Other than the main cases there are some street crimes, which mainly involves shooting, and few collectibles. Overall feel is good, I enjoyed my time I spent as LAPD investigator.Only problem I had with the game, other than plot of certain cases, was low FPS I experienced at first. According to forums Multi-threading and DX9 were to blame so I changed these options in launcher.And at last, don't expect GTA experience from this game.			"

												L.A. Noire is simply special. Its innovative way of story-telling is quite remarkable, such that it surpasses the plot of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which in my opinion, has one of the best plot in gaming history. The cases you deal with in this game will grasp hold of your attention and will make you sit on the edge of your seat. The graphics for the faces are truly remarkable and you will need to utilise it, if you want to progress through the game. This game surely deserves to be held in high esteem with the Grand Theft Auto series. Absolutely magic!			"

												I remember when this game first came out, and it's been one of my favorite games ever since.  It's not for everyone, no doubt about that.  If you're a big Rockstar fan for the violence this game is probably not for you.  You wont be meeting up with hookers, shooting down choppers, or seeing how many pedestrians you can run over before your car explodes.  In LA Noire you play a cop in (you guessed it) LA during the 1940s.  Your primary goal is solving crimes through clues and interogations, then putting the peices together to figure out who the criminal is.  Sounds easy, it's not really (in my opinion).  You can easily miss a clue or get a question wrong that will ruin your case.  Finished cases can be replayed which is nice, giving this game a decent amount of replay value (but not a ton).Graphics - 7/10 - they are good but compared to new games they can't hold up obviously, no fault on the games side.Sound - 10/10 - personally I love the old timey music they play, it sets the tone perfectly, the game would be flawed without it.Controls - 7/10 - I highly recommend a controller.  Finding clues can be tough.  Hardest thing is driving in this game, other drivers just hate to get out of your way, and accidents hurt your overall score.Story - 9/10 - It's basically a big mystery game, with just enough twists and turns.  I'm sure the story is not 100% accurate history wise, but a fair amount of stuff comes from real life situations.  Old LA landmarks, the black dhalia murders, the spruce goose, and many more I'm sure.  It just helps tie the story together so well, you really feel like it's the 40's when you're playing this game.Overall - 8/10 - Decent replay factor as it's unlikely you'll beat more then a mission or two and get everything 100% correct.  The DLC also helps in regards to replay.  After playing this game for too long, I find myself so enthralled that I feel like a detective, sometimes figuring out where I last left my beer (usually I drank it)!I hope you find my review helpful!!!  At this time LA Noire w/ DLC sells for $30, a little high in my opinion, I waited for a sale, but I'm both cheap and patient.			"

It contains everything a good detective story requires and more.  Although it does not seem as seemless and smooth on PC (people seem to be complaining about the PC port), it is still worth playing, and playing again.

												With all the slow burning ambiance of a point and click you'd be forgiven for thinking LA Noire wasnt a good game but you would be wrong. I wouldnt say this game would appeal to every gamer but those that like diversity will like LA noire.Set in the 1940s you play out the saga of a police officer rising through the ranks while busting chumps. You get a nice variety of crime to handle although the main theme and premise to the whole game is out and out deceit. These well scripted lies lend to the games points system and although not essential to completeing the game itself, certainly enriches the experience and feel of what the creator intended for us.As good as LA Noire maybe its not all sweetness and light though, like yet again we get a large playground with very little in it even with the DLCs, the car chases/driving feel early years GTA, Woody from toystory has nothing on our characters motor skills and the gun battles are no mafia 2 moment i can tell you. The good news is however, these arent bad enough to be deal breakers.So get out their officers, handle the crime and bag the perps ASAP, LAs counting on you son.			"

												Great game, though it didn't port well to the PC.  A series of small glitches add up.  Frame rate lags, moments where Cole Phelps gets immobilized, unpredictable and imprecise driving controls (in a game where car damage brings down your score), poor menu controls (switching between mouse & keyboard), un-skippable cutscenes (for when you are re-trying a crime scene for the nth time).  It amounts to a bunch of issues that should have been resolved with a few decent beta-testers, but it seems the developers simply pushed it to get to the PC too fast.  The game is sometimes unclear on how to succeed: in interrogations, the subject gives a statement that cannot be true or false, so asking whether he's lying or not is aggravating.

Some problems with uncanny valley effects, but I won't blame the developers for that.  I'd give it an 8.5 (higher but for glitches).			"

												Ok, so L.A. Noire, you probably heard of it. It's that game with the best facial animations, it uses MotionScan technology. It's the game's most prominent feature. L.A.Noire will take you through career of Cole Phelps, ex marine, who now works at LAPD. This means there is driving in what was meant to be near perfect recreation of LA (I can't judge this since I was never to LA, not to mention LA of 1947), shooting and investigation, which is the main focus of the game, involved. During your investigations you will be searching for clues, which may or may not be of further use to you but they all add to your rating that is given to you at the end of each case, and interview suspects & witnesses. This is where MotionScan comes to play, you will have to read expressions of a interviewed person to figure out whether he/she is lying, telling the truth or simply withholding something.Storywise it is decent, there are some decisions which are odd and questionable. Some of the cases just feel wrong if you look on them on their own, but I don't want to potentionaly spoil anything so I won't go into details. The game is linear so even tho you may know from where the wind blows you are still forced to do thing you may not like in order to progress. Other than the main cases there are some street crimes, which mainly involves shooting, and few collectibles. Overall feel is good, I enjoyed my time I spent as LAPD investigator.Only problem I had with the game, other than plot of certain cases, was low FPS I experienced at first. According to forums Multi-threading and DX9 were to blame so I changed these options in launcher.And at last, don't expect GTA experience from this game.			"

												Great game, though it didn't port well to the PC.  A series of small glitches add up.  Frame rate lags, moments where Cole Phelps gets immobilized, unpredictable and imprecise driving controls (in a game where car damage brings down your score), poor menu controls (switching between mouse & keyboard), un-skippable cutscenes (for when you are re-trying a crime scene for the nth time).  It amounts to a bunch of issues that should have been resolved with a few decent beta-testers, but it seems the developers simply pushed it to get to the PC too fast.  The game is sometimes unclear on how to succeed: in interrogations, the subject gives a statement that cannot be true or false, so asking whether he's lying or not is aggravating.

If you've always wanted to play as a detective and invistigate crimes, this is the definitive game of the detective genre. The music is amazing, the story is amazing, and even for being as old as it is they game still looks great. The only downside is the developers went bankrupt and there is a low chance of another. I would HIGHLY recomend this game to anyone, it is a must play.			"

												Probably one of the best detective games i have ever played. The game can be chunky at times, although I didnt expirience that (heard it from other people). The body language is incredible and extreamly accurate. 1 problem that I have though is the fact that when I run Phelps doesnt jump over the obstacle, instead he just continues running into the object. Apart from that, I belive that this is a great game. If you have the opportunity to get it discounted, I think that you should instantly get it.			"

												A bit mixed. The setting and production are really good and my opinion is that it's worth it (at 2017 sale prices) for these aspects alone.However, a lot of the crime-solving gameplay feels a bit limiting and arbitrary. There's a few examples where missions become unwinnable (with a good score) depending on the order you look round the crime-scenes, since doing them in the wrong order means you don't have the evidence to ask the right questions. There's also no indication in the game of which is the right order. The interogation scenes also feel a bit arbitrary at times - it varies from interogation to interogation what counts a relevant evidence (as opposed to unsuccessful wild conjecture) and at times you need to present evidence that's quite different to the topic being discussed.After all that the cases tend to basically solve themselves, however well you do, and there's no freedom to do your own digging if you're beginning to have suspicions about the identify of a serial killer (say) that your character hasn't yet caught up with.After all that moan, I did basically enjoy it, but it's probably best done in smallish chunks so it doesn't become too easy to see the formula.

												Sorry, but no. The story is well written and the unique facial expressions of most of the characters are really great, but as a game this is simply not interesting. It would have been ok for a short game but L.A. Noire just seems to go on and on forever and you really cannot do anything (well except for driving around town, yay...). You cannot miss important evidence as the game simply won't go on and in the end it doesn't really matter if you get the interview questions right. Despite the great looks and all thought they put into the story (if not into the characters...), the game for me felt like a sham. The technical problems I got halfway through didn't help either, but they may not be the game's fault, I still don't know for sure.			"

												I should start with the disclaimer that I'm a fan of open-world games in general and Rockstar games in particular. LA Noire was developed by a non-Rockstar studio, Team Bondi, and Rockstar entered relatively late in the development process. I presume they invested funds and technical support to keep the project afloat, but that's only speculation on my part. What isn't speculation is that it was a vast, ambitious project of the sort Rockstar likes, and the results were amazing.It's like playing two seasons of a period crime drama. Including the DLC there are over twenty missions (not including the four five-to-fifteen-minute training missions) and each is thirty to ninety (or more) minutes long, depending on how much rubbernecking you do. The overarching story is engrossing, and replaying it reveals nuances and foreshadowing that weren't obvious the first time around.Strengths: Well-researched recreation of 1947 Los Angeles (though only some, albeit large, sections of it), and 1947 cars, with some concessions made to the ""print the legend"" philosophy (e.g., the Intolerance movie set was actually struck decades before 1947). Cutting-edge facial capture technology and a top-drawer cast of hundreds -- I've actually recognized actors in live-action TV just from seeing their avatars in LA Noire. Dozens of intriguing cases that piece together a complex overarching story.Weaknesses: I like the overall story, but a lot of folks don't like it as much as I do, and you play as Cole Phelps (Badge 1247, as you will learn, and learn, and learn) who's a strait-laced kind of guy and not necessarily easy to warm up to. The open world is huge but somewhat underutilized; though there are a full forty action-packed side missions, replayable in free roam mode, and cool collectibles like concept/luxury cars and film reels named after classic noir movies, just walking around rarely feels as ""alive"" as GTA or Red Dead Redemption. As for interrogation: careful observation will serve you well, as the makers intended, but there will be times when you will mess up and won't know why. For some missions, replaying to get the best rating will probably require you to look up a walkthrough.LA Noire has a somewhat different feel and slower pace than Rockstar's other hits, especially GTA, but it evinces the same love of insanely detailed setting, memorable characters, and snappy dialogue. And if you've ever wanted to immerse yourself in the year 1947, there's really no other game in town.			"

												A bit mixed. The setting and production are really good and my opinion is that it's worth it (at 2017 sale prices) for these aspects alone.However, a lot of the crime-solving gameplay feels a bit limiting and arbitrary. There's a few examples where missions become unwinnable (with a good score) depending on the order you look round the crime-scenes, since doing them in the wrong order means you don't have the evidence to ask the right questions. There's also no indication in the game of which is the right order. The interogation scenes also feel a bit arbitrary at times - it varies from interogation to interogation what counts a relevant evidence (as opposed to unsuccessful wild conjecture) and at times you need to present evidence that's quite different to the topic being discussed.After all that the cases tend to basically solve themselves, however well you do, and there's no freedom to do your own digging if you're beginning to have suspicions about the identify of a serial killer (say) that your character hasn't yet caught up with.After all that moan, I did basically enjoy it, but it's probably best done in smallish chunks so it doesn't become too easy to see the formula.

												Excellent game, it isn't for the folk who play online shooters like cod and such. This game is something completely different. It takes patience, I completed the game after almost 40 hours completing all the cases and dlc missions. The game takes a hefty chunk of your time, but it's worth it believe me, the story is like a hollywood thriller from the 60's, there is quite a few action and the story is intriquing and  exciting aswell. The interrogation methods and techniques are revolutionary aswell as the almost lifelike faces of the main characters. It feels like a rockstar game but it isn't, it's so much more, it's like a combination of mafia and gta game, which is a game I wished someone would make for a very long time ever since I was a kid a team bondi certainly delivered.10/10			"

												Personally I play on Black and White mode with UI prompts disabled. Harder but more fun in my opinion.This is a game for people who play for the story and don't get put off by having to think seriously.While it is open world outside of objectives there doesn't seem to be much to do besides finding cars and doing side missions that randomly pop up. You mostly travel while in a police chase. Traveling to locations is entirely optional since you can get in the passenger seat and ask your partner to drive.Choices matter in this quite a lot from how you judge what people say in response to your questioning to what leads you pick up. Sometimes you will end up arresting someone without having checked all your leads because they appear to be guilty. Reading your report at the end of each case scores you on how you performed and even adds comments on how you could have done better. I've a feeling that my judgement has led a few innocent people behind bars.			"

												L.A. Noire is built around giving players the ability to, as the name perfectly implies, unleash the Force. This is a version of the Force that really hasn't been seen anywhere before, with over-the-top uses of things like Force Push. When you go to push a stormtrooper away from you, he won't just fall over, he'll fly. You can Force Grip soldiers and toss them into oncoming TIE fighters, stab someone with a nicely tossed lightsaber that happens to be electrified for extra coolness, or use a good old bit of Force Repulse to shove a group of soldiers away from you and off the side of a suspended bridge (which will also result in the bridge buckling from the blast).When you first take control of Vader's secret apprentice, he's already pretty powerful with Force Push and Force Grip in his repertoire. But by the time you reach the end of the game, he's incredibly powerful. Stormtroopers that previously took a few swipes of a lightsaber to down now hit the floor in one swoop, and your Force powers will recharge quickly for repeated use. Being able to Force Push one guy off a ledge, electrify the guy next to him, slice down a third trooper and then Force Repulse all of their bodies off your standing within a couple seconds is flat-out awesome.

												Okay, the environment is gorgeous, but really, I expect Rockstar to be making much more fun and entertaining games than this. They make a massive city but other than driving around from case to case, there's nothing to do in it. The path is linear so you can't deviate from the case you're on; there's nothing going on but the case you're on or the occasional street crime. Why not allow a path to become a bad cop? And I never really accepted the clue and fact building of the cases as realistic. Either the criminals are seriously stupid, or Rockstar don't think much of the minds of their customers.In Rockstar standards, this game is seriously poor.			"

There is little feedback for interogation though, so you get things wrong and never find out what the right answer was.  Some of the clues don't coorespond intuitively to the questioning, and you mostly feel lost even though you can clearly see someone is lying.  I'm not even sure questioning people successfully changed the outcome of the missions.  I got better at the game as time went along, but it felt repetitive and took a long time to beat. The story took some weird turns and the end was awkwardly abrupt.  I'm glad I played it but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												LA Noire is extremely repetetive and has no replay value. It is interesting the first fiew missions but after a while you realise that every mission is basicly the same, the only difference is that the clues becomes more difficult to find and the face expressions becomes less and less obvious if they are lying or not. LA Noire is a game where you find clues and sit and judge people based on evidence. The driving in the game is nothing interesting because the city you are in contains nothing outside of your primary missions. There is no cloth shops, no random events on the streets, no nothing. The freedom is extremely limited. It may look like a GTA game but it is not. The city is staged with cutscenes and linear paths everywhere. A car chase leads the exact same path every time because of how staged it is.			"

												PC version has error with no fix that seems available. Do not purchase. You can play the game through several cases and the gameplay is great until a clue in LIPSTIC stops you from being able to continue. No feedback is available from ROCKSTAR or steam. Not enough play to be worth the money.			"

												HiI have had this game for a long while and have decided to post a review.I have ran this game on many different builds from a cheap athlon X4 & GTX 650 720p build, an i5 4460 & i7 4790K GTX 970 1080p build then on my current Skylake Hexacore i7 6800K GTx 1080 1440p Gsync build.No matter what i play it on or how much i try and tweak the ini file the game runs like crud, the game is capped at 30fps... and they have made it very hard for anyone to get in and unlock the frames and i have not found anyone who has been successful.This game ran fine on xbox 360 way back when i had one of those babies but on pc it runs like crud.Can not recommend, runs better on console. Bad pc port sadly.			"

												Two things make this game suck.The first is that the game forces you to be an idiot. You have to go through something like 6-8 murder cases which are quite obviously the responsibility of a serial killer, but your thick jackass of a main character is too ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to figure this out no matter how much you yell at the back of his stupid head. The second problem is that (partially because Cole is such a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot) the game refuses to let you win. You gather evidence, find clues and search for the truth... only to have the bad guys rub their hands together, make a few backroom deals and ♥♥♥♥ you over. You would think this is building towards an ultimate confrontation, but instead at the end you just sort of die and lose. Yeah. ♥♥♥♥. A few cases are worthwhile, but the silly grimdark angle the story holds to coupled with  American patriotic nonsense sour it. Overall: I wish this game were a person so I could punch it in the ♥♥♥♥ing mouth.			"

												Completed this game before on a console, and quite like the content, though typical Rockstar style missions often ended in frustration when the AI went wonky. In this case though, the worst part is the bugs. First half hour in, I've already had 3 game breaking bugs, and a number of other annoyances. I can't advise purchasing this, as it's essentially unplayable for any length of time. Examples: Scene music fails to fade out, leading me to believe there are more clues when there are not (verified by walkthrough); character constantly saying ""You drive, I need to look at the case notes"" and opening note book whilst attempting to walk to building across the road; character will not jump over a fence during the jumping over a fence tutorial (no joke), making this impassable. This is just a subset. It's a shame really, as I was looking forward to playing this on a decent machine where I could aim prooperly - the shoot outs were always the worst bits when using a controller...			"

												Just an incredible waste of money. The game does not work, no matter what I do. I tried various fixes, none of them worked, the game just runs at a smooth 15 FPS. My PC can display GTA V at 50 FPS, yet it seems too bad to make L.A. Noire an enjoyable experience. Which is quite understandable, since this game is known to be more greedy on the hardware than Crysis 3, Shadow of Mordor and Metro: Last Light together. Or it could be that Rockstar just ♥♥♥♥ed up again and made another poor port from the console peasants. With that being said, the game actually is great. I already played it on PS3 (say what!) and enjoyed the hell out of it. However, the only way to play it on PC is to have a GeForce Titan X coupled with an Intel i7 5960x processor, cooled by two giant ice blocks fit into a case the size of a boat motor. Or you just play it on consoles, because there it actually runs on 30 FPS. If you want to throw your money out the window, buy it, but if you are looking for a great (and playable) game, I suggest you save your 10€ and spend it on a game actually worth the money. Or, you get it for consoles. But who plays on them anyway?			"

												Do not play this game expecting a GTA+Mafia hybrid.Though it is closer to Mafia than it is to GTA, it still stands on its own.Now I wanted to recommend this game, I really did, but there are more things wrong than there are good, which tips my scale towards not recommended.@Pros:+Provides a great social commentary on 1940s Los Angeles, I believe it very well captures the good and the bad about people's mentality of that time.+Great map design, even the map captures 1940s very well.+Great attention to details, basically everything in this game describes 1940s very accurately, details like traffic lights, cigars, cars, news papers, music, clothes, guns and much more.+Facial expressions recorded from real actors, giving realistic expressions, making the ""Lie"", ""Doubt"" or ""Truth"" choice system be based on people's facial expressions, as much as it is based on facts you've collected.+The game does not hold back, they didn't cheap out for the PG rating, it is very dark in nature, and does not make an attempt in giving you false hope or flowery\holding-hands endings to the cases, from beginning to end it is very dark and realistic, just how you'd expect from a homicide investigation and chasing a serial killer, dead bodies, children burnt to a crisp and naked bodies of dead and r@ped women, kinda reminds me of the movie Se7en actually, it is SO dark in fact, it might be borderline depressing for some people.I find this quote from Chris Stuckmann's Sicario review describes the darkness of this game well: "" https://youtu.be/DmnrlJifm3Y?t=2m45s "" -->from 2:45 to 3:03@Cons:-The gameplay gets very repetitive very fast.-The story is too linear.-Disappointing ending.-You can't explore the map after finishing the game, you'll have to load the save before the final mission and play from there.-The game is god damn dark (see my Pros above)-The game feels like it was left in the middle of development, side tasks that lead to nowhere and subplots that don't take you anywhere.In short, if you think you can handle the dark story and imagery of this game, and you're looking for a story driven game rather than a GTA-like game, maybe grab L.A. Noire on a sale.Otherwise I generally do not recommend it.			"

												The idea of this game is fantastic, but the execution is terrible.  While Rockstar games did an excellent job of creating a beautiful historic setting, I often felt disengaged from what was going on aside from typical ""go here and shoot this"" mechanics.  Perhaps they felt intimidated by straying too far from their typical core audience and felt they had to make a hand-holding cop simulator.  I kept playing in hopes that it would get better, but after the novelty of the setting wore off it had the same mind-numbingly tedious gameplay that most MMORPG’s are notorious for.  Don’t waste your time on this.			"

												I tried to like this game, and it is somewhat intriguing at first, but its novelty wears off really fast.The often mentioned facial expressions aren't all that great, much less do they help in the interrogations. Which are kind of boring and seem random at times. The ""acting"" may be great ""for a computer game"" (and I wouldn't even agree to that), but it's still crappy overall and somewhat in uncanny valley.There is a certain open-world element to the game, but you have to wonder why exactly. You need to get from A to B and get to collect sightseeing places on the way, as well as some - again random - mini side missions. After a while, the driving around is just a waste of time; much less fun than I had in, say, Mafia.The cases themselves are somewhat nicely written, but they drag on and on because the on-site investigation is a point-and-click minigame at heart, which results in walking around every corner of houses and picking up the most irrelevant items to avoid missing any clue. Not to mention the often atrocious camera (hello console port) which often hinders you doing stuff you don't really want to be doing anyway.It's just boring overall.			"

												What is this game?Is an open world, detective game set in LA in the year 1947. You are an ex commander of the second World War who became a policeman, you get to start ranking up as you solve cases.The Pros:The game is fantastic, it got great atmosfere, great facial animation due to unique facial capture technology, a world that feels alive, great attention to detail, haves collectibles and unlockables, interesting stories, good character development, spot on controls and interesting mechanics.The Flaws:The game can be sometimes very slow and can get boring if played for long, also most of the choices you make dont really affect the outcome of the story, just the dialoge and your overral score in the mission, also awefully long loading times interrut the flow of the game.Port Especific Flaws:The port is terrible, there is a 30fps cap, the game runs slowly even in capable computers and this was never patched, the only way of fixing is adding some commands to the option menu on the launcher. THIS IS WHY I DONT RECOMEND BUYING THIS VERSION, GET THE PS3 VERSION FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCEConclusion:The game is a bit flawed but is definetly a unique and amaizng eexperience you should try.Score: 9/10 Amazing Game			"

												This game is only hardly good at its main mechanics and that is it! Yes it's interesting. However after a while the way the whole truth / doubt / lie system works reveals its jurky flow. Almost every time all of suddent Cole gets angry and threatens to take a suspect to the police or do something else. The interviews don't feel natural more like bump and get up.  The suspects aren't partucularly good at hiding facts. That's just laughable how everyone gives away if he lies. I get it it's a game but come on! The rest is an unbeliavably empty sandbox with midly entertaining crime side missions and car thefts as a cop!  What?! haha There's zero interaction outside of the designated investigation zones and the story objects. You can't do anything even punch a guy or shoot. Borrowing a car or run people over that's as far as it gets. You can even talk to anyone in the police station randomly or anywhere for tha matter. You might hear a line or short conversaion but usually everyone's quiet. Bizzare. The whole city is just a waste of resources cos all you can do is drive around it.Gender neutral language in the 40s??? Fucкing devs, nodody spoke this way back then. Ever intellegent man (not a fucкing person!) still doesn't.""then the suspect probably left. They must've ...."" Not they, you dimwits but HE!

I just finished the game and I feel like I would be insulting rockstar by no recommending this game right after playing. This story is ♥♥♥♥ing unreal. It twists and turns and keeps on the edge thoughout the whole game. Wow, a story (and ending) that totally blew my mind. Top 5 for story. Im not even going to write anything else about how good this game is. If you dont like it, take me off your friends list. GAME OF THE YEAR			"

												Look don't get me wrong there is a good and clever game in here, it's just not for everyone and I happen to be one of the minority who just didn't like it.  To be honest I found the interrogating mechanic to be just too hit and miss at times to really get me immersed in a rather tedious and disjointed story at times.  When the interrogations go wrong they degenerate into Cole Phelps starting to shout at the witness/suspect like a petulant child.  Maybe it gets better but after 13 hours I just couldn't be bothered anymore.  Just drags too much at times with some of the dialogue being rather painful.  Ultimately I just found it boring and depressing.  Probably should have stuck with it longer but lost interest.			"

You play hide n' seek to find random bits of evidence, but all the logical sense that you can put together never matters, because even though you're only put in a situation where you have to guess Truth, Doubt or Lie 600 times in a row, you get them invariably wrong no matter what evidence you collect or tells that the game's devs read SO POORLY that a professional poker player would be left scratching his head to a bloody pulp.Each and every developer responsible for this travesty of a game should take turns striking each other in the face for letting loose this jaw-droppingly pitiful game.  I guess, in the rare case, you're an individual who enjoys being told ""Wrong, wrong, wrong, incorrect, incorrect, incorrect"" a couple thousand times, then this game'll be right up your alley.One of the few games that dutifully earned a 0/100 from me; and that takes more than a modicum of effort at wanting to be one of the worst games in the history of gaming.

												LA Noir, my first game on PC. I have never played a game like LA Noir before. It is unique unlike any other game i have yet come across. You play as Detective Cole Phelps for 90 percent of the game and Jack Kelso the other 10. You go around the streets of LA solving cases, asking people questions about information they may or may not know and getting into a little bit of combat here and there. Trust me this is a lot of fun and an enjoyable game for the first 10 hours, but a 22+ hour game not so much. What im trying to say is that the game is WAY too long. Rockstar the game developers of lA Noir have had a history of very long games such as GTA, Red Dead Redemption etc. I constantly said to my self 'when is this game going to end'? The combat in the game is great and a lot of fun, but the only problem is that there is hardly any and when there is it only last for like 2 minutes. A game like this should have beeeen of maximum of 12 hours andif they had added more cobat i would have given this game a higher score.      Overall LA Noir is a descent game in my opinion and I would recommend it to anyone into an open world game with solving cases, figuring out codes etc.      7.2/10      Pros -Good cobat (When there is some)     Cons -Too long       -Great voice acting                                    -Vehicle chases  "

												In my opinion, L.A. Noire is easily the best game that Rockstar has released on any platform. The story is absolutely amazing as it brings every detail to light and comes full circle by the end of the game. You play as a detective in Los Angeles after the close of World War II. As you attempt to solve murder, narcotics and various other cases, the game requires you to critically think as you progress through each case. Each investigation requires you to inverview possible suspects and decide whether they are telling the truth or lying. At the same time, there are numerous instances where gun play is an important part of the game as well.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, or any previous sandbox game by Rockstar.

												the first couple of hours are pretty nice; your a rookie cop solving crimes with a different gameplay than the usual mechanics. the problem is that those mechanics are rather simple and completly identical for the rest of the game. if your saying you aint here for the mechanics but for the story, well thats no better. the first chapter as mentioned your a rookie cop, and you actually do something worthwhile, but when your at the end of the game, and see what you actually acomplished youll be shown that the rest of your entire career was a waste of time, i personally found the end rather depressing			"

												Look don't get me wrong there is a good and clever game in here, it's just not for everyone and I happen to be one of the minority who just didn't like it.  To be honest I found the interrogating mechanic to be just too hit and miss at times to really get me immersed in a rather tedious and disjointed story at times.  When the interrogations go wrong they degenerate into Cole Phelps starting to shout at the witness/suspect like a petulant child.  Maybe it gets better but after 13 hours I just couldn't be bothered anymore.  Just drags too much at times with some of the dialogue being rather painful.  Ultimately I just found it boring and depressing.  Probably should have stuck with it longer but lost interest.			"

												This game is just sooooooo slow and uninteresting.  I would not recommend unless you really just enjoy slower paced games.

												I was looking forward to playing this game. Being a detective, solving crimes in 40's L.A., but it turned out to be a very repetitive game, with no consequences at all if you drive like a madman, or hardly any when your interrogation goes wrong. The story is long winded, there's no logic involved in the story telling and the ending was abrupt. In my opinion they should have made it episodic, with shorter more interesting stories, no driving (you can skip the driving in this game) and a more interesting city. This is what goes wrong when you make things too big and set your aims too high.i liked some aspects of the game, very good voice acting, nice graphics, it's fun for a moment smashing your car into anything and get away with it (nobody cares). I also liked the partners and the moment you play as kelso. But overall, very disappointing for the price.			"

												 Another masterpiece from Rockstar games, L.A Noire takes us back to 20th century where you play as Cole Phelps a former war hero who fought against Japan and now is a LAPD detective whose job to solve various crimes from murders to affairs and so on. The job of detective is hard as nail, you will need to be precise there when you search for clues and interview your suspects and finally if it needed accuse them in committing crime. Brawling, gunfights, tailing suspects everything is here.  Apart from solving 21 cases to complete main part of the game and enjoying great storyline, fear not there is much to do here.T here are a lot of side missions like finding film reels, completing other crimes, searching hidden vehicles and finally looking for places of interest. Not to mention that this complete edition has all dlcs and they are 4 new cases, and new outfits to wear. So don’t waste your time, go in store and buy this brilliant game and get on solving cases.

The story is played in Los Angeles after WW II, the player put ourselves into the skin of Cole Phelps, former war hero, now crime fighter. There are numerous cases to be solved. During them we must looking for clues, evidences;interwiev and interrogate witnesses and suspects. Some cases are real, but most of them are fictional. Mimicry and feelings on characters' face are incredibly realistic thanks to Motion Capture. Phelps is improving during the game by getting XP points. Many collectibles are hidden in LA.

												I managed to grab this on some sale at steam or other, but it did actually shine out amongst the other games as you actually get to play as a detective, in what-seems to be a GTA game (from Rockstar, so what do you expect?)Starting out the game, its a standard GTA-like story driven game. The ""sand-box"", or ""free"" style of gameplay however, is very lacking in comparison however. The game follows the career of a Detective, some ""bad♥♥♥♥♥quot; veteran from WW2 and his hijinx. It would be reasonable to say that this is a cross between an adventure game and a very small part action. - That said, there is also an ""interrogation"" mini-game to find clues or whatever.Whilst on the cover it seems to sound pretty damn cool, it is actually let-down by a number of issues. Firstly, them damn graphics. I mean, they'd be quite good... if it was released by the same time San Andreas came out. But by the release, them flickery shadows, and jaggy edges - you can see that they must have been cutting a few corners. Dated.Secondly- the ""motto"" of Rockstar, so far, (if you looked at GTA, or even Red Dead)- would be SAND BOX. This game is VERY linear. there are ""street crime"" events that happen in the city, but you'll be doing the same thing for each - Chase, shoot, suspect dead, repeat. To progress the story line, you had to go around interrogating people. you get 3 options ""TRUE"" , ""FALSE"", or ""DOUBT"". - there were many-a-time I had meant things in a certain way and the detective goes nuts for no reason-poopie! That said. > you could actually ask mostly wrong questions for all your suspects- then STILL manage to continue the story. - as punishment, solve street crimes- then carry on the story. pagnnhn!Conclusion > I actually had a good time for the first hour or two. I mean, the story isn't bad, but it's vastly inferior to anything that GTA gave out. Graphics? They're OK. Game-play? Not too good- not going to touch this for a LONG time. Instead of a detective game like I wanted, it was more like a Japanese style graphic novel where you just watch.As a Graphic novel, Im gonna give this a 7, but cos its in the ""Games"" section, ... 5? but... I did actually want to know what happened... so.. 6? yah...- I think its time I dug out that copy of ""Blade Runner"" again, now THAT was detective work!			"

It uses brand new technology to capture the faces of the actors, and puts it into the game which produces some unique graphics. The only problems that I have with this game are the bugs (some silly ones like getting stuck behind boxes and you can't jump) and the driving (cars feel weightless).			"

												While I found this title to be an extraordinary expierence on the Xbox 360, it just feels wierd on the PC. None the less, the game was damn good and put up many challenges with a buffet of choices on how to approach every situation. It gets creepy as hell though, after watching how realistic people's faces are when they talk.My Rating: 7.5/10			"

												I’m going to start this review out by saying that I was somewhat on the fence before my purchase of L.A. Noire.  I’m a fan of Rockstar and the majority of their games, but there was something about this game that had me a little anxious.  Now that I’ve played it, here’s what I think.This is, no doubt, a detective game.  There’s no ♥♥♥♥♥footing around that fact.  Most of your time will be spent doing one of three things.  Running down escaping felons, performing interrogations where you have to judge the honesty of the witness/accused, and searching for clues.  That pretty much sums up the game.  Oh, and there’s driving.I want to focus for a moment on the interrogations.  The faces of the characters in L.A. Noire have been very highly detailed.  It’s these details, as well as the way the individual sounds and acts, that give you clues if they’re telling you the truth when they answer your questions.  If you suspect they’re lying, it’s up to you to then link one of the clues to the lie.  You succeed, you catch them in the lie.  You fail, you lose the ability to use that question again.  This is probably the most difficult part of the game, and I failed miserably on my first 8 tries at the “tutorial” interrogation (which loops until you get it right).While I found the interrogation aspect of the game to be a rather successful way of immersion into the role of a detective it seemed the rest of the game somewhat broke that immersion.  It was almost like playing two games that really weren’t meant to be played together.  On one hand you had the GTA style game play that we all know, and on the other hand this extremely high level of story-based investigative detail.  I found myself wanting to “GTA” the hell out of this game whenever I was driving around or trying to stop an escaping felon, but this game punishes you for doing so.  Everything that was fun in GTA is basically prohibited from the “GTA” side of this game, thus making that entire portion of this game very boring.Talking about the GTA aspects of this game, I found the driving to be very awkward.  This game is supposed to be replicating cars from the 40’s but they certainly don’t act like cars from the 40’s.  The most unbelievable aspect of these cars is how tight they can turn.  I mean, you can be flying along and the dam things will almost turn on a dime.  The same can’t be said for stopping.  I know early cars were heavy, but these things stop worse than an overloaded big-rig.  I highly doubt any car, from any time period, would slide an entire block on pavement when you slam on the brakes.All in all this game felt like a rollercoaster.  Whenever you were talking to a witness or searching for clues you were almost on the edge of your seat with anticipation and enjoyment, but when you were playing “GTA” you were so restricted from having fun that you ended up bored to hell just waiting for it to be over.So what’s the verdict?  Do I regret my purchase?  Well… No, because I got it on sale for 80% off.  Would I buy it at full price?  Again, No.  The game has a lot of positives but some aspects of it are so boring that you have trouble staying interested in the game as a whole.  Sorry Rockstar, I just can’t recommend it.			"

												I really wanted this game for ages, however it was a major disappointment.Its rare that I never finish a game even if it is mediocre but this managed to stop me with ease.The interrogation and detective mechanics swing from too easy to just plain stupid in order to introduce some form of difficulty.  So I just lost all interest in the game.			"

												Normally, I love detective games. I love poking suspects for evidence, finding chinks in their lies, and exposing them. This game has that... sort of. I played through a little bit of first few missions- and from what I played... I didn't like this one at all. It has the things I like in a mystery game, but you are playing by  the game's preset of rules. What do I mean by this? If you don't do something in the exact certain order, you fail. If you don't ask question A before question B before question C, the game penalizes you for asking the question that it 'says' you have to do first. This is bullcrap! Don't penalize me for asking about the murder weapon before I ask about the scene! This restricts things too much, and I just don't have the patience to give this game when I have to restart over and over again because I'm not jumping through its hoops.			"

												Trying to be more then a detective game and failing at it.The driving in the game is so bad that you leave it to your partner for most of the game. When being forced to drive for a chasing you have no change of getting the suspect, because the game keeps the vehicle ahead of yours, until a point where you are allow to capture it, via the means the developer had in mind when creating the scene. The investigation part of the game is always via the same procedure (especially when examining corpses) and lacks variance between cases. How to be a investigator in LA noire: walk around, hear a sound, click to look, pickup a possible clue and back to start.Fighting contols are awkward, but sticking to raise hands (keep right mouse button pressed) and then attacking (left mouse button) turns it into easy mode.And if you hate the so called quicktime movie games, then avoid this one at all costs.

But it's such a poor port of a game that I can't recommend this game to anyone. It's locked at 30 fps, due to the motion capture of the actors. It makes me nautious playing it.

												This is a great game and all, I really was waiting so I can grab it and play it, looked awesome... well, it is but not quite on the pc. This is a horrible console port that has plenty of malfunctions on the PC as I've seen in plenty of sites out there, the one that bugs me the most is the 30 fps cap, and commands on the launcher don't work, so it's useless.I know people can stand 30 fps but the reason for a gaming computer is that games run faster, better looking, and quality over a console, and in this case you can't appreciate that. I don't recommend getting this game for PC, unless you want to search for a fix. If you own a console of any kind, try this one out though, I still think it is a great game.			"

												This quickly turns into a 'find the pixel' game. Where you go around trying to find the piece of evidence thats so minute you need a guide to find. Then when you take a suspect in for questioning, youre supposed to read his expressions and pick a tactic to counter. Instead, they just randomize the expressions and it turns into a rock-paper-scissors guess. The car chases usually end with either you or the suspect as a fine mist across the road since no one wears seat belts. Then additionally enemies can see and shoot you through walls.			"

												Not even close game of the year material.This game is one of the worst that Rockstar has done in my opinion. First of all, there is no f--u-c-k-i-n-g challenge in this game. Whats the point, it's not even fun. The game holds your hand throughout the whole f--u-c-k-i-n-g game. When you get questions wrong it doesn't even f--u-ck-in-g matter because IT DOESN'T PENALIZE YOU. Sure you get a low rating at the end of the mission, but who gives a f--u-c-k? I still get to see the unoriginal story line lmfao. At the end of all this, they focused to much on the damn facial movements, wich 90% of the women in this game look the same, they ran out of money for more women lmfao. Should of focused more on gameplay. Wich there barely is any. I find myself driving for 1/2 the time I am playing this game, you can't even run over people correctly, s-h-i-t-s b-u-l-ls-h-i-t. Sure there are the side missions when the p-u-s-s-y police need help, BUT 90% OF THE SIDE MISSIONS ARE THE SAME. It's either kill these bad guys who are robbing us, chase this guy who did something bad then have a fist fight, or have a f--u-c-k-i-n-g car chase. LIKE WHAT THE F--U-C-K MAN. I have already beaten the game, so I KNOW what I am talking about. OVERHYPED piece of s--h-i-t, just because it's a Rockstar published game everyone is all over its smelly balls. YOU CAN'T EVEN JUMP IN THIS GAME LMFAO WHAT IS THIS GEARS OF WAR? Sure the map looks big at first, but you will find yourself seeing the same places all the time. I can go on all day BRB ima take a s--h-i-t.			"

												L.A. Noire is a game developed by Team Bondi, an offshoot of Rockstar at the time it was made. People were up in arms about some of the conditions at the now shuttered studio in Australia. The head of development has responded to some of these claims. It doesn't seem that indifferent from much of the AAA landscape today. We'll  just review the product here. Overall, the questionable management and terrible working conditions still produced one hell of a game about the 1940s Los Angeles era.What you need to know is that on PC the game has been tremendously upgraded in the image quality department. 4K native is offered, but your best bet is 1080p with 4xSGSSAA through Nvidia Inspector, making this unique game a completely different experience compared to the PS3 version. This cannot be overstated.In other regards, we don't have the upgraded audio from PS3. The shadows are better than the Xbox 360, but not as precise as the PS3. That might be a good thing as shadows in that game tended to be too sharp. Texture filtering bests both consoles. Overall, the cleanliness of the image is by far the most important aspect to enjoying and being immersed in the city.As for controls: Going back to the PS3 version on the DS3 pad is exponentially worse than something like a DS4 and Input Mapper on PC. These two major changes make the PS3 version all but unplayable in retrospect. I actually went back to that version to compare, and the only thing I liked a tad more was the audio fidelity, though, it's not all that much better and most will not notice. The controls were abysmal in every way.For the game, of course, we have vintage L.A. modeled with exquisite outer detail. The indoor locations are lacking outside of the story mode, and there isn't a lot to do in the city overall, but with the DLC there are plenty of story missions to investigate, and the varied nature of the game puts you in plenty of different parts of old time Los Angeles. Travelling by car is pretty fairly smooth, and finding all the different makes and models is actually worthwhile now that the graphics have proper AA and detail.The action and movement is mediocre to okay. You won't be regarding this as the most fluid of shooting games, but what's there is serviceable if a little routine at times. Side missions are fairly bare bones. Collectibles are hard as hell to find in this sprawling map. The investigations to me are very fun, and I actually think they still hold up today. I know some people criticize the lack of knowing what to do in certain situations, but I still think this game comes closest to being one of the only immersive detective-style games out there.The Lie-Doubt-Truth mechanic works because it's honestly quit fun roaming for clues, and the art direction inside the various homes and building you enter is fairly top notch stuff even by modern standards. Being in 1940s L.A. is just kind of fun when it comes down to it. If this is not your type of setting, and you expect super high quality action, I would probably skip this game.The audio and voicework is quite good for the most part. Animations in the faces hold up because of the work they put into it, though, that does hamper the port at only 30FPS. There is a widescreen fixer for 60FPS, but I personally choose to have SGSSAA over the extra 30FPS, which can look a bit wonky at times. It is a lot smoother with that fix, so it is there if you need it.Most of what you get out of this game depends on if you like the setting. The stories and characters are for sure a cut above the average game, and some of them are very well done. But it comes back down to if you like this period and if you have the PC to play it right. An OC'd 970 and 2500K should do the job. I am currently using a 1070 and it runs perfectly at 30FPS with SGSSAA at 4x.So it's worth it just to see the detail of the city and the 1940s. The artists here pull it all off with great abandon. So much detail was drawn into this city, and yes it is a shame there is not more to do. Sometimes development hell gets the best of you. Still, the stories are interesting enough and the locations all now look so much more lovely than they ever did on the consoles. Travel around and chill out with L.A. Noire's gritty take on vintage crime and you'll have a fun experience for 30 hours or so.Posted January 26.			"

												This game purports to put you in the shoes of a detective but it doesnt.  The questions you can asks are mostly random. The evidence is inconsistent. There is little logic in all this messy interrogations. The main gamebreaking point of this game is that you are not guessing who is the culprit based on the evidence available but what developers thought the correct evidence is for the selected question. And they are so often wrong that I wont even bother to give examples. Google it  if in doubt.  Those broken interrogation mechanics are not apparent outright but the more you play the more annoying it becomes so the only satisfying thing in this game becomes driving and knocking off pedestrians. Perfect autistic fun.			"

												This is a tough one. I'm sure when it was released in 2011 it was ground-breaking but it has not aged well. The story is the strong point, and while it's not the most suprising of endings, it is consistent and the way individual cases mesh with the main storyline is impressive. Having said that the rest of the game is a clunky mess. The driving is awkward and not fun, in fact you are penalised by doing it as having your partner drive removes the risk of crash-damage affecting your score. The shooting is unsatisfying, the clue hunting boring and the interviews, which are a key part of the game, are often ambiguous and just don't work very well. I enjoyed the story but the rest of the game was one big grind so unfortunately, even though I picked it up in  a sale, I can't recommend it. There are better places to spend your money.			"

												Dont buy it. Its old, forgotten and obsolete. Not even for nostalgic reasons. Its not worth it. I dont understand how some many people give this probably ""back in the days"" wonderful game a positive review in todays rightfully expectated standards of gaming experience. And I am not considering the silly socialclub binding as a negative aspect of the game. Because it doesnt matter at all. I just look at the game and say no, no and you guessed right - no.Gameplay - Sorry but menu, setting and narrative is defenitly outdated. Once a striking new gameplay idea - today its just not elaborate enough to please anybody and keep you going for more then 1 hour. Btw the story isnt the thing you will remember aw. And the render sequences are outworen at its best - let me make it clear - they are technically so under any average that you prefer to skip them. Sorry they are outright♥♥♥♥♥♥ And i use this bad word only one time in this review.Graphics in the openworld over all are just not any longer pleasing in 2017 - Its just looking outright bad, They are boring and look like made of cardboard. Yes this is the right comparison for me. They make you sleepy and you think - mb i should go to bed today a little bit earlier. Even if its 11 o'clock am - and you had just drank a big mug of coffee while you watched the intro. They actually depressed my so much that i thought the unthinkable. Why was i so keen on the game when I was used to play my video game entertainment exclusivly on my PS 2? Was the PS 2 so bad?Motion Capturing Animations - Way over estimated. Check YT - the textures look slushy and arent a ""reason to buy"" anymoreAnd here is the last point - and yes this kills any immersion for me while playing the game. 30 fps with - framedrops. Thats so disappointing - and i really take R* in charge for that. I mean even when im lacking of admiration for the game this doesnt mean that I wouldnt appriciate it if they would care more about their older software. This game earned a better port - yes it does - not for me but for any other person that would enjoy this mb in its retrospectivish and very special way ""master piece of its time"". Cheers fellows - my final verdict4/10 by 2017 and its currenct price tag of 5 $Save your money and dont fool yourselfs by nostalgia and greed. Buy something new - you will have more fun in the long run.			"

												L.A. Noire is a great example of how the industry's views on game design has changed over the last 10 years. Whilst before the emphasis would have been on  engaging gameplay, it's become a trend for developers to try and engage their players through flashy cinematics instead. The result is you have the player eating a sandwich of sorts with cinematics on either side and a bit of gameplay inbetween. Whilst this design can work with certain games, I think Team Bondi took it too far in the other direction. L.A. Noire feels as if it would more comfortable as a TV series than a game. I know many people joke about Heavy Rain being a movie, but Heavy Rain ""solved"" the problem of having an engaging storyline without interupting gametime by making the entire game into a cutscene. Conversely, L.A. Noire has you doing minor tasks in order to start the next cutscene, in which you have no control over whatsoever. The story is dull and drawn out and none of the gameplay is particularly engaging.			"

												I would choose a mixed review if it was possible.Setting: nailedMusic: nailedFace Tech: creepy (especially on children), but nailedGameplay: awfulStory: ranged from good to mediocre to terribleStory's Achilles heel is the Homicide desk. A desk which one would think be the most engaging and interesting is the most boring and repetitive. It contributes literally nothing to the overarching plot and causes it to grind to a screeching halt. Removing the Homicide desk would significantly improve the overall pacing and quality of the game. Most people who leave the game unfinished will do so during Homicide or just after completing it. Also, don't forget the romance subplot later in the game which comes out of the left field.As for the gameplay. What they were going for was basically Phoenix Wright, but they couldn't pull it off - quite often forces you to jump to conclusions and focuses too much on facial animations instead of deduction. In addition, splitting the game up into cases just didn't help the story at all. What could have been a coherent and compelling film noir was made confusing and ultimately unsatisfying.			"

												It's a PS3 port. Expect to have issue with resolution, frame rate, or it might not work at all.If you are expecting a GTA style world, turn away. It's a fairly simple map designed to provide some simple entertainment for getting you from point A to B, and to give some room for foot and car chases that are not at all as intense as they are in the GTA games. The shooting moments are so simple and short that they seem completely unnecessary.The main mechanic of the game is both it's strongest and weakest point. The itoregation process is innovative and interesting. At the same time it often leaves you feeling out of control. As your character often phrases things horribly and not at all as you expected, leaving you to deal with the outcome. In a way you don't just have to figure out what the suspect is thinking, but you have to figure out what your own character is thinking too. It can be tedious, for example (no spoilers): In the middle of the game you investigate several murders, one after another. From the very beginning your character suspects they are all committed by the same person. The victims all have a similar profile and died under similar circumstances. Which means you play through multiple scenarios that are very alike, it gets boring. Despite his suspicions you go through the motions of investigating and arresting other men, even though both your character and you suspect that these men are innocent. The game forces you to do it though, making it feel very guided and that your choices make no difference.			"

												Ok this game was fun, I really like the facial expression and all elements of gameplay; chase, interviews, gun fights, fist fights...  I really don't like the fact that you can't skip cinematics and cases are long to redo when you need to complete everything for 5 stars. Some achievements are ridiculous, like collecting 50 film reels hidden in parts of the city you never go, I found a total of 3 by myself then having to look at a damn guide to get the location for the remaining reels. There is also an achievement to drive 95 different types of cars... Damn OCD...But the worse thing is probably having to buy the DLC to get 100% achievements, with that summer sale monster deal on that GTA V, really Rockstar???

But this was not how it ended up, as soon as i got on the game (running at maxed out, 1080p) it ran at 30fps locked and was clearly upscaled textures from 720p(console textures) :( And for a rockstar game leaving out gta 5 that came afterwards this is really leaving a mark in there pc ports being (excuse me) absaloute♥♥♥♥♥♥ overall 4/10			"

												This is my first review. So don´t judge me.L.A.Noire is a good game, has good graphics and a good gameplay. But the game is extremely long, and hard some times. If you wanna be a detective like Batman in Arkham games, you should stick with those games, because this is game is dedicated to the hardcores who want to investigate everything and make five stars in each case, a thing that I just did in one mission. So this is my review, I hope it helped you choose if you are going to buy this game or just rent it.			"

												No way to run the game on windows 8 x64.  Went through all sorts of troubleshooting through forums and forums of the related issue, and I just gave up; It's not worth the headache.  Some others play with no problem, but numerous others cannot even get pass the game launcher/Social Club.  It really is ""Hit and Miss"".  Purchase at your own risk.  I do not recommend buying LA Noire for the PC.  Stick with the console people.			"

												I've been playing the PC version. I wanted to like this game. I REALLY, REALLY wanted to like this game, given my familiarity with the time period and cultural references.  And the game excells at these. BUT, after many man hours, I note excessive dificulty for simple game tasks (driving in particular) and the lack of save points DURING investigations, (If I wanted to play a driving game with poorly implemented controls I'd be playing Mario Cart.)  I'm spending more time making the game interface work than enjoying the setting.  Time to give up and ether play something else or go watch The Naked City or Detective Story again.			"

												The game's fun, yes it is. It is fun when you play it for the first 2 hours because you get to experience this new game,new concept, new game mechanic and face expressions of characters that most games dont have but then it gets really boring when you continue playing it, you have to walk alot in the game which makes it more boring and sometimes the levels were so easy, so easy that you can complete the game in just 2 HOURS and then the rest you can just go back to the missions and do them all again to get all stars but it's not worth it. This game's plot is bad and even the FPS is bad that i had to play on medium settings. There's nothing else you can do in the game and there are limitations, the game was not enough, the cars were all the same, and you cannot even pull out a gun in public and the characters were not really good. Rockstar is supposed to make games where you can do anything that you want with few limitations but in L.A. Noire you cant even do anything besides doing the missions and the missions were repititive! Clues, talk to a guy, talk to a guy, clues, talk to a guy, chase, shoot, clues, solve, solve end of mission then repeat. The cutscenes were also a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because they're unskippable and they're very long! There are alot of things in this game that I didnt like and what I saw on the gameplay videos on Youtube were really it, they just showed the game intirely and it's my fault for expecting too much of this game. The graphics were really great though but the whole game in my opinion is not even good.			"

												First of all: what I wanted from this game was a good detective story, not a GTA-like game nor a shooter.The only real positive I can think of is the facial animation, which is really something to behold. As for the negatives:- The noire atmosphere is terribly hamfisted. It feels like they just watched a bunch of noire movies and took note of all the tropes they could use. The narration is really jarring and uninspired too.- This game is poinltessly open world, and as a result everything looks ugly.- Too many shootouts. You're a detective, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SWAT.- The logic in the interrogations is all over the place. It constantly switches between demanding you to spot absolute truths (what the witness said is what happened) and relative truths (what the witness said is wrong, but he/she couldn't know), so you never know if the contradictions you just spotted are something you should point out or just irrelevant mistakes. At some points the game forces you to choose between two alternatives that you know are both wrong, and then you are even treated like an idiot because of the ""mistake"" you had to make.- Despite all of this the game still finds ways to push you forward even when you made blatant mistakes instead of having you fail and repeat. This makes the whole game feel completely pointless.Overall I can't find redeeming qualities in this game; I'd rather play most other adventure games.			"

Posted: March 13, 2014
												My rating: 6/10It's such a shame to see a game that does so many things right essentially ruined by getting so many things wrong.  I finally finished the game after starting it over 1 year ago - I started playing but quickly got so frustrated with its faults that I gave up on it and moved on to other things.  I really hate wasting money, though, so unless a game is abysmally bad (like, say, Assassin's Creed 1), I will generally force myself through to completion just to feel like I got my money's worth.  The thing about LA Noire is that it isn't abysmally bad, in fact there are a lot of things about the game that are outstanding, and I really wanted to like the game and finish it; it's just that the bad parts of the game are so bad that it took me a year before I could dredge it up again.  To clarify, let's first look at the things the game does right:Pros- Top-notch acting from every character, particularly the many well-known faces who populate the game- Amazingly impressive motion capture of the characters' faces- Great attention to detail regarding the world of 1940's LA - the look and feel were spot-on- Outstanding soundtrack- The devs realizing how horrible the ""action"" sequences were and providing the opportunity to skip themAll these things were done so well that it would normally be easy to overlook a few faults and love the game.  The graphics weren't exactly photorealistic, but the motion capture was so great that when coupled with the excellent camera work and soundtrack, the game felt more like an interactive movie than many other games I've played.  Unfortunately the game doesn't suffer from a few faults, and those faults are hardly minor:Cons- First and foremost, the ""interrogation"" system - it's horrible, it doesn't work, and it's incredibly frustrating.  This is obviously a problem because it's the primary point of the game - to gather evidence, then interrogate suspects and ferret out the guilty.  It's really the main reason why I quit the game the first time around, because half the time it's a complete guessing game.  You basically have a list of pre-generated questions, and based on the suspect's answer you have to determine whether they're telling the truth or lying, and if they're lying you have to decide if you doubt their answer - meaning you know they're lying but can't prove it - or whether they're actually lying - meaning you have evidence to prove their lie.  Seems simple enough, right?  If only.  There are supposed to be visual queues to when they're lying or not - if they stare straight at you confidently and calmly, they're supposed to be telling the truth.  If they fidget, smirk, blink excessively, or refuse to look you in the eye, then they're supposed to be lying.  This works great until the game devs decide to break their own rules, as happened to me several times when a suspect was staring straight ahead and not fidgeting at all, but it turned out they were lying.  It happened the other direction, as well - not very often, but just a few times was enough to constantly make me second-guess myself.  Then there were the times when a suspect was clearly lying and I had to pick out the precise piece of evidence the devs were looking for, which wasn't necessarily the most obvious piece of evidence I had.  A good case in point was the pregnant girlfriend of a car thief I was searching for.  I asked her if she knew what her boyfriend had been up to, and she clearly lied to me.  Now I had a piece of evidence - a diplomatic flag, taken from the stolen car, sticking out of a coffee mug that was sitting 5 feet away from the girlfriend, so I accused her of lying and pointed out the flag.  Nope! Despite evidence of the theft being mere feet away from her and her obvious lying, the devs had decided the correct answer should be ""doubt"", so that's what I had to choose in order to get it correct.  There are countless examples of this in the game, many being even more egregious than this, so that every interrogation question ended up making me feel like that college kid at the beginning of Ghostbusters sitting across from Bill Murray, who had his hand on the electric shock button, just waiting for the kid to answer wrong.  No interrogation in the game was a fun, sensible or even consistent experience.Even worse was how pointless the interrogations ended up being, given the sheer number of innocent people Cole put away.  Seriously, this guy really was the worst detective ever.- The driving - very few games get driving right, and this game isn't one of them.  It wouldn't have been a problem if the game didn't require so much of it, or at least didn't punish you for any damage you inflict while trying to get around.  Kudos, though, to the devs recognizing this and allowing you to skip most driving sequences and just fast travel to your destination.- The shooting - not the worst part of the game, but the cover system is terribly implemented, and the shooting itself is just boring and uninspired.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of it.- The story - it started out well enough, if a little too much like LA Confidential (which clearly inspired many of the game's elements and characters), but by the end made almost no sense at all, and ended with you gunning down innocent MPs and burning dozens of fellow LA police officers alive.  Though it was fun to watch the story unfold, it ultimately ended in a totally confusing and unsatisfying way.Overall, the game simply isn't nearly worth full price, or even a moderate discount.  It's probably good enough at 75% or 80%, if you're a big fan of James Ellroy or movies like LA Confidential, but if not then you'll probably do best to stay away. "

												I really wish I never bought LA Noire. At least I could have played some other game from my backlog... what can I say. It's even hard to call it a game. It's one of the worst case of interactive movie I've ever experienced: I wanted to give it a chance since I'm a big fan the LA's quartet... but this thing has nothing to do with the atmosphere and the setting of Ellroy's masterpieces. Most of all, the main story does not make any kind of sense. What about the ""game""? It's so uninteresting I've even fallen asleep while playing. Investigation is boring and repetitive, Gunplay and driving are atrocious. You just pass from stupid cutscene to stupid cutscene waiting for the game to tell you what you are supposed to do, you are stripped of any kind of meaningful initiative and freedom, except during the interrogation when you are supposed to guess what the dev's wanted you to do while choosing between the ""doubt"" or ""lie"" option if the suspect start acting like he's going to make a big fart...Thanks god it's over.

												I played 10 mins to just crash.Then relaunched the game to get an immediate crash.I then fixed the crash to get another crash everytime I shot a gun.I fixed the gun crash.After a third launch I couldn't get past the L.A. Noire Endless Syncronizing Bug.I tried about 20 fixes to try and fix it and no luck.And after all that I somehow have 4 hours clocked ""In-game"".Possibly the worst experience i've ever had with a game. Thanks Rockstar for giving me a game that is ""Broken"".Now I'm off to go hang myself. "

												Boring and pointless driving sections with odd physics and ""interrogation"" sections where you basically get to Dragons Lair your way through the dialog or get told to start over. I'm sure there is a great game in here for someone, but I'm not sure who. I've got no idea why the Metacritic rating is so high on this one, I guess some people just like torturing themselves.			"

												> Man says he has nothing to do with murder.> I say he's lying.> The game tells me to select a peice of evidence.> I select the gun that he owns that was found at the crime scene.> Wrong evidence, interrogation failed.> I want to try again, since I felt that was unfair so I hit the restart option.> I lose a half hour of progress.> ♥♥♥♥ it.Edit Feb 16: Kept playing through the first two cases. The interrogation system really does suck. Very frustrating. It tells you that you're wrong without giving you a way to fix it, which just feels bad. There doesn't seem to be any descernable difference between doubt and lie. Even when I figured out what was happening before the dtectives, I still couldn't piece together which arbitrary peice of evidence the game wanted me to pick.Also the acting in the interogations is baffling. From odd pursed lips that are supposed to indicate lying, to the uncomfortably unwavering eye contact that indicates truth. I feel bad for some of these actors, because the format and direction of this game forces them to turn in some really awful performances.Aaron Staton is good as Cole, despite Cole being insane. He jumps from boy scout to a screaming lunatic from line to line, and his partner isn't any better.The story of this game probably would be okay, I might go watch a let's play. The flash backs are interesting, and I assume that Kelso guy is going to pop back up in present day. Probably turned out to be a serial killer or something crazy like that. Joker to Cole's Batman.

												Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success. Corruption is rampant, the drug trade is exploding, and murder rates are at an all-time high. In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten core. Using groundbreaking new animation technology that captures every nuance of an actor's facial performance in astonishing detail, L.A. Noire is a violent crime thriller that blends breathtaking action with true detective work to deliver an unprecedented interactive experience. Search for clues, chase down suspects and interrogate witnesses as you struggle to find the truth in a city where everyone has something to hide.			"

												Story and characters are alright but there are quite a few things that make this game uplayable. The firs and by far most common that you will find is the fact that it is capped at 30 fps. Wich is bad but after a bit you will get used to it. Another annoyance is the characters faces of all things. They are extremly high definition and extremly expressive allowing the player to use the truth/lie system effectively. With that said however the rest of textures are decent resolution meaning that the faces do not fit with how the rest of the game looks. And the final thing this is the one that absolutly killed it - and the thing that made me request a refund - is pop in textures, not just pop in textures but sometimes textures and terrain meshes that will simply not show up. Meaning that you are just driving around in an empty abyss until about a minute later the game pops those textures and meshes back in and you are now stuck in a lamp post. This happens far far to frequently to be somthing that a reasonable person could overlook. And by the way my rig is no slouch it should have no problems what so ever of this kind. Like I said the game is fantastic (at least the bits I played) but on pc I cannot recomend it at all.			"

												Runs pretty well. Good old Cluedo-cop PC Game with pretty fair graphics. But you have to sign into Rockstar Games to play; and if you have lost your old e-mail (as I have done previously), you lose the game (as I have done previously); probably.The Great thing about games like this is they are more advanced in Controls than games like Metal Gear Solid 5. Because MGS5 is incompetently coded, in that if you are disabled (have missing fingers on your left-hand and/or you are left-haned and use the Number-Keypad for all Shooter-type games), then you are bang out of luck, and KONAMI and Steam do not give a flying fk wether you can actually play the thing or not. The Forums order you to buy a Steam/controller but they refuse to ask KONAMI to cripple all Right-handed keyboard use: and are thus hypocrites.But Rockstar and the Assassin`s Creed series (and others) do allow you to re-map for such scanarios as great game companies have done for 20-years (but recent rat-coders fail to implement).So, a thumbs up for L.A. Noir.			"

												L.A. Noire...- punishes players with no save/load feature. I don't care if you want the story to flow and me to live with my mistakes, go to hell. Have saving and loading so I don't need to exit out of the game and reload it to access an auto-save.- is a big, open world in a linear game with nothing to do in the world outside of the intermittent, drive-out-of-the-way Street Crime segment- the music is good, but the horn is pretty much required if you want to get through the open world quickly (and you do, because there's nothing to do in it). Still, even then, pedestrians and drivers sometimes like to just stop instead of getting out of your way when you have the horn on. Sometimes I think I killed more people with the horn on than off.- the story driven dialogue is top notch, but all additional in-game voice acting for NPCs and such is so dull and typicalI'll give L.A. Noire credit, its story idea and music and setting are all great, but this did not need to be an open world game. I grew bored with it after about 10 hours. I got tired of driving through the town, got tired of getting punished for driving poorly in a game with a poor driving engine, and got tired of not being able to save and load. I would highly recommend this game if it were just a little less horrendously tedious.			"
