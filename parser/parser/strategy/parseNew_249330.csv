This game is too emotional for meThis game is cute and cruel at the same time. All the reviews about those cruel and ridiculous events are all true.A tower defense game where you are a landlord, taking care of monsters... or so I thought.You have an absolute power over the occupants. My first playthrough I read every details of the game. The jobs my occupants have. Their satisfactory meter. I always check how they feel and what they want, trying my best to fulfill all of their wishes. There is an option to evict them, but I don't intend to use it at all. Later on, my cheepy is the first one to find his lover. And the first one to have a child/chick. I am so happy for them. I max out their satisfaction. And try my best not to increase the rent too high. To my ignorance, this is not how you play the game. This is not sims! It's a tower defense game! You need money to upgrade your 'fort'. But my progress is really slow because I care too much about them. Those cheepies are extremely poor as they have low-income works. As time goes on, I accidentally kill the cheepy's lover. I fast-foward the time but I was too careless. For that, a cheepy lost his wife... and the child/chick lost his mother. Killed by those filthy humans that try to attack the building. I feel so bad about this. The early feeling of happiness has gone in the blink of an eye. Sorrow creeps into my heart. To make things worse, the father-cheepy and the daugter-cheepy didn't say anything. But at least, I wanted them to complain, to at least blame me for I have done. They did none of that... as though they understand what was at stake. Perhaps, they think that I am already kind enough to give them shelters against those dangerous humans. It could have been worse. The enemies only get much stronger with each quest.I was quite shocked by the incident so I paused the game for a while. Something must be done in order to fight against those vicious humans.After much deliberation, I, the kindly landlord, evicted those remaining cheepies... They both pack things and leave obediently. They are both crying, yet firm and understanding. They know I need to make rooms for the stronger monsters.Father and daughter.... now homeless... without wife or mother... Both of them... Hobos lolThe situation alleviates for a while. Stronger monsters now occupy the tragic-filled room of those cheepies. Completely unaware of the sacrifices I have to make.Despite all this, the lesson I have learnt is not 'sacrifice have to be made' but rather 'Guilt can comsume the sanity of a man'. Unwilling to bear the emotional pain much longer, I seek the easy way out. Knowing only cowards would choose such a path. But at the time, believe it or not, I do not care. I just want to end the pain. Therefore, I committed suicide... (Or what one might call 'uninstalling the game')One </3 heart out of One ❤3/5 Would get stupidly emotional again.			"

												Let me tell you about Popan.Popan was the first baby ever born in my apartments. She was a Cheepy so I didn't have high expectations. Popan was probably 3 days old when her parents died in an unfortunate ambush on my complex. I had a ton of other tenants, so I didn't see the harm in waiting for her to grow up. Somehow, she never became in debt. This ♥♥♥♥ing baby was paying the rent. She grew up to be a total badass. She would single-handedly wipe out entire waves of enemies without breaking a sweat.Popan is obviously popular and well-known throughout the land, she easily finds herself a guy to shack up with. He's weak and dim-witted; a farmer named Peecone that watches tv 90% of the time that he's home. It doesn't slow Popan down though, she easily slays the first main quest adventurer all by herself while all the other tenants are at work. She returns immediately and has victory ""pillow-talking"" and immediately has the child they have been trying so hard to have. A girl named Chaan, that is impossibly strong as well. Popan and Chaan were ♥♥♥♥ing ruthless, the perfect mother-daughter duo. Then Peecone stops paying rent, or so I assume, as I thought the world of those two divas but not so highly of farmer Peecone. I keep lowering the rent hoping they'll stay, I evict Peecone hoping it will fix the problem. It helps! They are back in the green in no time and happily tending their garden and watching tv together. Then it all goes down hill again. Popan robs the cradle with her next man, the neighbor boy, Pyo, not much older than her daughter moves in. Things get tense. Chaan was the one that wanted the damn Love Balloon and yet her mother was the one to snatch up a mate. Chaan is unemployed but barely comes home. Popan and Pyo are having pillowtalk near constantly. Twice I found Chaan begrudgingly lifting weights while the two love birds pillowtalk all night, draining the life out of her having to deal with it.Then tragedy struck. Being the only one home at the time of the ambush, Pyo the live-in boyfriend was struck down. Despite her envy, Chaan became increasingly more withdrawn, very rarely going out for fun or even job interviews. Popan also began getting increasingly more gloomy and soon they were once again behind on rent, once again because of a guy. In fear of losing my glorious lady warriors, I lowered the rent as much as I could stand but their grief had drained not only their livelihood, but also apparently their bank accounts because the two ♥♥♥♥♥es ran out on me in the middle of the night.11/10 would collect rent from orphan babies again			"

Simple and fun; Unholy Heights puts a new twist on the Tower Defense genre. Play as an apartment manager (The Devil) and experience what's it like to manage an apartment complex full of monsters. I had a lot of fun building up my apartment. As my tenement grew, more monsters moved in, each with different stats, jobs, likes, and dislikes. I had to keep my tenants happy by fulfilling their special needs and buying them furniture. In return, they defend the apartment from invading adventurers and heroes.Everything in this game has character; from the funny text descriptions of monsters and furniture to the cutesy 2D art design. Tenants will go about their day, some will go to work, others will hang around in their apartment; some monsters don't get along with others. I found myself chuckling often to the various activities of my tenants. Also, the soundtrack is super catchy and light-hearted, which fits the game perfectly.There's something satisfying about watching your tenants grow; you might feel a peculiar attachment. They can get job promotions, fall in love, and eventually make babies! There's nothing like unleashing a family of Cheepies on an unsuspecting hero.Unholy Heights is a very casual game; fun and enjoyable, easily worth the price of purchase. It definitely merits our attention.			"

												This is not a genre I tend to enjoy... I'd say tower defence (which is not a perfect description of the game, but it is fairly close) is one of my least enjoyed genres. Unholy Heights is something special though.Unholy Heights gets me far more invested in the morality of my actions than pretty much any other game. In a game like Fable which toutes its morality focused gameplay, I will just shrug off the ultimatums. ""Will you let most of the kingdom die?!"" Yeah; they were all carbon copies of each other anyway. ""Will you let your beloved get killed by the evil guy?!"" Yeah... her hair is kinda weird.But this game...I have some families that I accidently let the parents die, and now the child doesn't have enough money to pay the rent, but I feel so bad that I let her keep her room for free as a means of apologizing for her loss.And another family which has been falling behind on rent, but I don't want to kick them out because they just had a kid.And another family that keeps telling me to change the wallpaper back and forth and they're great at defending the place but I just can't stand their implied bickering, so I send them out as soon as there's an assault with the hopes that one of them will perish and I can finally either leave the room with smutty wall paper or plain wall paper...

												I don't have much to say, I had an army of water people, they were ""Pillow talking"" in my apartments, made some babies, babies grew up and helped fight off evil humans.Then I found out that most of these ♥♥♥♥s were unemployed, so I evicted each and every one.More monsters came, and more people behind on rent, so I sent them to their deaths. I now run an apartment complex that houses demons.They pay, they kill, ♥♥♥♥ all else.Being Satan the landlord is kind of fun.Standard Game RatingStory: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 (Tower Defense and Evicting Tenets Sim)Presentation: 10/10 (Game looks good, like really good, I love the art style even if it's pretty simple.)Soundtrack: 9/10 (it fit, it was cute)Replayability: 8/10 (would come back to it late one night if I feel like playing a tower defense kind of game.)

												Welcome to Unholy Heights, a cutesy 2D tower defense game with a lot of personality and charm. You are the devil that has just purchased a tenement. Just one tenement, there are no scenarios or anything, just this one tenement in the game. As time goes by, creatures will stop by to visit your apartment building, then they'll want to rent a room assuming you have free rooms. If you take them in, they'll take up residence.This diverse array of creatures will then go about life. They'll head to work, sleep, eat, fall in love, have babies. You really have no control over what they do. The real game comes into play when at the end of the day and night cycle when a hero comes to your apartment to rob it and or kill your creatures. So what do you do to defend your building? Click on your doors to knock on them and they'll come out to fight. The only catch is will they might be at work and not in the apartment. Eventually, the creatures will come back from work and be able to fight if not start fighting when they bump into someone.Each enemy has one of three types of attacks: melee, mid range and long range. Your foes will have the same style of attacks. Its a nice system and since each creature lives in a different room, you can wait for the enemies to get to the center of your building, then call the first and last apartment to pinch them where they can't run away. They can also do the same to you of course. If one of your creatures gets weak, simply click them again and they'll run away to their room, to your devil headquarters or away from the building.These daily attacks are more and less a grind. They won't give you much gold. Instead your tenants will give you daily gold in rent. If you want the most gold, you'll take on quests by clicking the sign on your screen. These quests result in larger enemy amounts in usually 3 waves. These 3 waves take place in short amount of times, so make sure your creatures are healthy. Each of these quests has a star / difficulty rating and bonus gold for completing it. Some quests are mandatory in red, and others are optional, but the optional quests seem more like steps to the red quests.If an enemy gets to the top of your building, they steal gold and try to get away with it. If an enemy makes it out alive, you'll fail the quest and can do it again. It is a very forgiving system that keeps you in the game with no real way to lose. You'll always have creatures wanting to move in if you have an empty building.So what do you do with all of this gold? When you're not being attacked, you can click on a room and see the inhabitants of the room, along with everything in the room. The tenants will want specific things like CD Players, fans, playing cards, plants and so on. You'll need to buy them things and by doing so, your creatures will be able to gain defense, attack and so on.You'll also be tasked with keeping your residents happy, which really seems easy enough. Every type of creature has different needs to become happy. Such as skeletons need to defeat enemies, one type needs to live amongst plants or it'll get sick and other creatures become happy or sad based on the overall joy of the tenement. Some of your creatures will become sad if there are creatures they hate living in the building. The bestiary shows everything.You can raise or lower the rent, and creatures each have jobs, so if they can't meet the rent, they can fall behind. Then it is your choice, do you evict them? Lower their rent? Or just make rent free to keep the good creatures you've worked into deadly killers. When new creatures arrive you can see their job so you know if they're some deadbeat cigarette butt collector or just unemployed in general. That doesn't stop paying tenants from falling in love with unemployed creatures that do nothing.Eventually, you'll be able to add more floors to your tenement, along with unlocking more types of creatures and objects for their homes. Not just that, but you'll see the creatures fall in love and later have babies. What does this all mean for you? When there are 2 creatures living together, that's just more attackers for you. Their babies will grow into adults and be able to fight as well. Creatures can only fall in love and breed with creatures of the same species. There are consumable items such as balloons that will help a resident find love, and erotic cakes that will help a couple make a baby. Of course there are less funny consumable items like health potions as well. Your creatures will gain health when they eat, so you don't really need to micromanage anything.In all, this is a really quirky, one of a kind game that I can highly recommend. The only down side is there seems to be a lot of grinding before you can get through the quests. The game does a great job of explaining things especially compared to other sim games. The game also seems underpriced, but if they had different scenarios, I could understand them having a higher price. The game has the right amount of depth to keep me interested, without overwhelming me.			"

												          This game is fun. That's about the best word for it I suppose. The story is something else, you're the devil, and one day you decide to buy an apartment building to help fund your evil schemes and whatever. This game is sort of an apartmen managment sim mixed with a tower defense, you have to get monsters to move in and take care of their needs, while choosing which ones you send to fight the human menace!           The graphics are nothing to write home about, but I like the simplicity and think they add to the charm of the game, it's kind of like a Deviantart chibi fanartist's wet dream.  The music is also pretty cool, all the tunes (except the boss music) kind of remind me of the Animal Crossing soundtrack, simple and sweet.          The monsters in the game are all unique, they have stats, wants, and even jobs. It's definitely nerve racking to have to fight a boss when your main tanks are out on their paper routes. The monsters types are all unique as well, the Helmcheepies are melee monsters, but when they attack they shoot a projectile that passes through enemies. And the Zombies have a life-leech ability to keep them fighting.          Overall, if you want to buy this game, do. It's four dollars and has plenty of stuff for both casual and hardcore gamers, along with replay value that won't wear off until your third playthrough. If you want to buy it, happy apartment managing!			"

Unholy Heights - Short ReviewUnholy Heights is a quirky mixture of tower defense and apartment sim that I really enjoyed playing. The music fits in well with the art style of the game, both giving a calm and relaxing vibe, however it is anything but calm. If you haven't played a tower defense game before, Unholy Heights might be challenging for you, especially if you want to play a certain way (no deaths, no evictions, etc), but if you play tower defense games you should feel right at home. The game lasts around 5 hours or so, but if you want to see everything it'll take a bit longer; around 2-3 playthroughs to see all the different monsters and get 100%. If you're interested in this game and got $4 to spare ($2 during sales!), then you should definitely check this game out.Pros:► Simplistic, yet fun gameplay► Humorous descriptions for items and characters► Cutsey graphics► Music is calm and catchy► Cheap price for the amount of time you'll get out of the game (5 hours or so)Cons:► Options limited, and changing your resolution may glitch the game► Requires grinding, a lot if you want to get certain achievementsHit / Miss:► Music might get repetative after playing for long periods of time for some people (repeats)► Certain monsters don't like living with others, so it'll take at least 2 playthroughs to see all the different monstersPersonal Rating:Avoid at all costsPick up during a saleWorth PlayingMust Play "

												What a really nice game.I'm a fan of the tower defense genre, but sometimes it tends to get a little boring with those games. Sure build your tower, level up, stock better weapons to defend agains stronger enemies... la di da.Only a few games in that genre manage to really stand out and - congratulations to Unholy Heights - this is one of them.It's not you classic tower defense game, but it still fits the genre somehow, weird but true.In the game you're the landlord of a motel where instead of towers your defenses are your inhabitants, but there's an other twist. Towers don't just walk out on you or get scared, your renters do.It's really annoying when you've leveld up your renter and once he has a family he decides to run out on you, 'cause he's afraid of the villagers who attack the motel. It's really, really, really annoying, but also such fun, since it keeps you on your toes.A lot of tower defense game still follow the old set-it-and-forget-it principle, so you spend most of an attack just watching the masterpiece you've build do all the work, with little interaction required from you. Unholy Heights is different, if you just lean back an expect your renters to defend the motel without you, you'll pretty soon run out of money (villagesr not only kill your monsters, but also steal your money once they've reached the upper level of the motel) and renters.I'd totally recommend this to any fan of tower defense games, since it's something new and not the same-old-same-old, plus it's also a game for people who don't acutally like tower defense games; those kind of people won't even know they're playing a TD ;-)			"

			Hello Ability Powered gamers! We are checking out Unholy Heights as requested by Red! Short plays as Satan... I have always said she's mean haven't I?		

Options are in game are pretty scarce.  The game starts in windowed mode and has borderless edges.  There is an option for Fullscreen.  There’s no Subtitles or Colorblind Mode in the options.  There’s also no voice acting so subtitles are unneeded.  Colorblind mode would help as some quests are color coded according to tutorial.Game play is very.point and click and I really couldn’t make it playable with onscreen keyboard.  With a standard keyboard it IS playable using the hotkeys above!  No keyboard is necessary however for mouse only gamers.  You can speed up gameplay during the long slow periods and have the game automatically slow back down when events occur.  The game can be paused or saved at anytime so fatigue shouldn’t be a concern.If you can play point & click games and have always wanted to be Satan running an apartment, this game is for you.  The tenants themselves are so adorable it’s worth checking out.			"

An apartment management tower-defense game about your resident monsters against humans. While the idea of being a landlord is enticing the tower-defense part can get incredibly tedious & repetitious since there's not a whole lot of strategy to use here from beginning to end.The idea of the tower-defense is just to stop humans from stealing your money and if they get away with it you only lose your highly expendable tenant should they have died defending the money taken so there's no real fail state. You try and stop the humans by knocking on the room doors of the monsters of your choosing and IF they're home (which most usually are) they'll do their tower-defense thing and help kill the intruders. As you get further into the game you're able to invite specific higher tier monsters depending on what monster race you've been appealing to or otherwise. To get further into the game & earn faster money though you've got to go do quests from a quest board. While every quest grants you money there are quests that unlock new monsters for you to be able to have in your apartment, quests that unlock a new piece of furniture you can buy for your tenants, and main quests that finally allow you to expand your apartment one floor at a time. The downside to this though is that every quest from side to important are essentially all the same ""stop the humans"" only with varying wave numbers and a few human types with soon to be higher stats. Whatever strategy you had against weaker humans you can do the exact same thing against the stronger humans with stronger monsters in somewhat bigger numbers because the monsters you get aren't entirely different either aside from the stats when it comes to being useful in defending.The landlord simulator part is at least more intriguing. The job is primarily housing interested monsters of your choosing and appealing to their tastes by adding or improving things in their apartment, sometimes specifically when needed as some monsters prefer having certain items in the room depending on their race and/or job. It's a bit more taxing to house monsters when you have a certain race that's disliked by another race living in the same structure. You can still appeal to both but getting them to all be satisfied in their living quarters would take much longer.There's a maximum of 3 vacancies per room where each vacancy specifically houses one tenant, that tenant's lover, and those two's child. So long as one tenant in a room is satisfied and alive they'll eventually find a lover and conceive a child who will also grow up for you to take money from. If the child dies another child will be conceived by the parents. If a parent dies the other parent will find another lover. If both parents die then the grown-up spawn will eventually find a lover of their own and eventually conceive their own child. I'm not sure what happens if both parents die while the child remains a child. As all the tenants in one room are old enough they usually find jobs of their own which is supposed to be a good incentive for raising their rent.The room upgrading is incredibly bare & simple which leads to a few questionable things. For example upgrading a two-door fridge apparently grants the room a BBQ set and upgrading that gets it a built-in kitchen. You can buy a tenant a game console and/or a PC tower for their room but I find it a bit odd that you're not exactly buying it for them but for the room itself, and you don't even have to buy them a television for the consoles as far as I've seen.Depending on how fancy a room is and what the current tenant's job is you can adjust rent to their's and your pleasing. Certain monsters though are less likely to even want to pay rent even if you set it to an incredible low. You can evict them for being deadbeats, wait a bit longer to see if they come up with the money, or wait for them to run away from paying you.The game itself sounds better off as an idle-game somewhat but unfortunately alt + tabbing even when the game's a small window pauses the entire thing. It was pretty nice trying to be a landlord for monsters but with how tediously bland progress is I can't entirely like the game even for its cheap price.			"

												Having never played any tower defense or micromanagement games, this is an amazing introduction to the genre. It's fun and witty. This is actually one of the most addictive games I've ever played. Pros:You actually get attached to your characters and feel like the best landlord in the world even though you're Satan and your plans are actually to raise an army to destroy civilization. It makes you reflect on how you judge people in real life: You're not going to let an unemployed, cigarette butt collecting cheep cheep bird rent your property without some sort of social assistance. The demons and monsters have kids, get promotions, etc.ConsIf I was a real landlord, I wouldn't be giving into the creatures' unrealistic expectations. ie: Giving them a 3D TV. This is actually some of the most fun I've had on my PC in the past month, Highly reccommended.			"

												So Unholy Heights is a strange yet addictive amalgamation of RPG, time management, tower defense strategy game. You manage a building full of monster tenants who also fight heroes that try to rob you. It reminds me of one of those Kairosoft mobile games only with fighting. While this game does have that casual flavor as you are trying to make a profit and of course keep your monsters happy they work, get sick, fall in love and make babies. But if you want to spice things up you can always play one of the many quests to fight heroes and gain cash to spend money upgrading your apartments.With each upgrade you attract a a higher breed of monster tenant all with different streengths and weaknesses. Housing placement also plays a factor as not all monsters get along and if you have two neighbors next to each other that don't get along one might end up leaving or skipping out on the rent if they can't pay.I found this game to be charming. Everything from the cute cartoonish graphics to the strange melody. For the price it's well worth the time I spent playing. "

												Well, it is only $4. Keep your expectation in check, and you'll be surprised. I gave it a try and soon I dumped an entire afternoon into it. The goal is to fend off a series of invaders and ""grow"" your monster occupants while doing so. Despite the casual friendly vibe, its a heavily micro'ed type of gameplay. Losing a monster can be devastating to your lineup early on.I admittedly never branched off much into another style once I found monsters I liked and what worked, but there are many different ways to play. Certain monsters are incompatible with each other, so its worth another play-through to experiment with the ""Free Battle"" and different strategies.Good challenge, very cheap, recommended.			"

												So the Devil quit his job as Lord Of All Evil to build an apartment building for monsters, and as its landlord you have to manage the tenants and get them to defend the building against overeager heroes. If that premise sounds Japanese as ♥♥♥♥ to you, then you're right on the money because the monsters are adorable, the heroes are Dragon Questy, and there are erotic cakes. And under all the weirdness and design quirks, there's a pretty good game.Unholy Heights is a mash-up of management sim and tower defense that's way, way heavier on the management part. You start with four apartments that monsters can apply to live in, and you have full control over the rent and furnishings. That means you can fill it with all sorts of beds, appliances, plants, PCs, board games, exercise gear, and other junk. Your tenants will often request specific things like a desk to study on or smutty wallpaper to stare at, but you can (and should) also furnish empty apartments a specific way to attract certain monsters. From the outset only a handful will want to take a room in your building, but with a little work you can catch the eye of powerful demons, elementals, beasts, and elder beings.Apartments start as single residences, but your tenants can meet and bring home a spouse, and have a child. You can also add second and third floors after completing certain quests, ultimately giving you 12 apartments of up to 3 monsters each. Monsters have jobs that they'll leave part of the day for (unless they work from home), hobbies they'll indulge, and all sorts of weird statuses throughout like ""staring at the wall"" and ""having a wet dream"". They can get sick, they can be evicted, they can lose their jobs and not make rent, and on and on and on. The depth of the sim component honestly approaches something like Tropico with how fleshed-out each resident is.All of this contributes to the tower defense portion as well, but not always in good ways. Heroes will come to your building in an effort to get to the Devil's office on the roof and steal your money. This can happen randomly, but usually it's triggered by taking a quest. Quests have all sorts of justifications and reward you with money, new monsters, new furnishings, or the ability to expand the building, but they all play out roughly the same. Heroes appear from the right side of the screen and wind their way up towards the Devil's office. You can knock on the doors of your residents to get them out and fighting the good guys. Monsters can be melee, ranged, or magical, with different resistances and speeds to track. They also get bonuses from being content, favorable weather, and so on.It's a smart and entertaining combination that's only held back by a few gripes. If the heroes reach your office, they steal a bunch of your money and you fail the quest. Quests can be several waves long, so failing on the boss can be pretty discouraging. Losing monsters in battle can be a pretty stiff setback, since you generally don't have time to replace them between waves. You also don't really know what you're getting into until you see the heroes in action, so it's really easy to screw yourself by unknowingly taking a quest you can't win yet.The absolute worst, though, is getting attacked while your monsters are out. Remember how I said they have jobs and hobbies? Well, when they're out, they're out. And once you start a quest, you don't get to pick when the waves come. So if your key melee tank is waiting tables when the heroes show up, you're screwed. I had one building where every single monster worked the night shift, which made quests almost impossible to complete. I've learned to work around it, and now I have a group with several housewives and home-workers, but it's a big issue you have to look out for.All that said, I've having a lot of fun with my kooky monsters. I don't even care for tower defense games that much, but the management side is engrossing and the combat doesn't get too in the way of my enjoyment. The learning curve is a little steeper than it should be thanks to some questionable design, but once you get past that it's an adorable little package.			"

												I'm shocked to see how addictive this little game is considering it's price tag. Sure it has a few flaws, but the fact that I spent 8 hours of play time in 1 sitting kind of says a lot about how good this game is. It's regular price is only $4 and it goes on sale for like half that on occasion.The difficulty curve seems to be well balanced in a way that it's constant and kind of time oriented (meaning the less patient you are, the more difficult it'll be). The game seems to be very stable, no crashes or even a hint of a glitch anywhere yet. The game is widescreen only and at low resolution, though it looks fine for what it is and it plays fine on my 4:3 monitor too.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an enjoyable time consuming game.

												What did you honestly expect? Let's get the good stuff out of the way. It has some fun music, but it kinda gets old when there's only one track playing all throughout the game. It's got a delightful aesthetic. It's also fun in short bursts, and is a fun, simple game.Now...It's a tad too simple. And the combat relies on your creatures actually being there, which sometimes they are not, and you're just screwed. And it doesn't even tell you in anyway that they are out or not unless you look into the rooms, which is incredibly inconvenient. Not to mention I think it's impossible when an attack is happening. So, click away and hope they are there. There is a bit of micro managing you can do whilst in combat, but not incredibly so. You can't go full Star Craft, kiting your foes to death without taking any damage. Also, the pacing just seems a bit off. I'm not sure what it is about it. Could be the health regen is incredibly slow, basically meaning you just have to sit there waiting before taking quests...doing nothing... I'm not too sureIt is fun. I certainly don't hate the game, and I don't....neccesarily regret the purchase, but this would be MUCH more at home on a mobile device where you don't have to sit through it for long periods of time.

SummaryWell satan since you screwed up, you are being demoted to manager of a hotel in the middle of the desert congratulations! Your hotel is called Unholy Heights, in which keeping the residents happy and defending against heros who dare to trespass is top priority. Heros will attempt to sneak in and steal your gold, to counter them you will use the monsters who reside in your hotel. You’re residence is perfectly safe as long as they reside in the room and don’t come out to face the heros. Resources will deplete as a result, though there is no way to game over.  Mechanics+ Hotel Room placement matters+ Monsters give clear indicators of needs+ Monsters have families/jobsSeparating enemies by using the positions of hotel rooms is a good way to separate their forces and prevent tanks from protecting the glass-cannon type enemies. The monsters have a numerous weaknesses and strengths depending on how you use them, for example a long-range caster can be good for taking hits from magical spells with enough vitality since they have more magic resistance than your knights. Monsters will get a bonus to their stats depending on their mood. Clicking on their rooms will provide you feedback on how to improve their residence. The amount you can tax them depends on the value of the room itself. The higher the room value the more you can tax without them feeling like they are getting ripped off. Once you hit a certain point you will notice that the monsters cannot afford the hotel with the job occupations they have, so you will either have to lower it, until they can get a promotion or find more prominent monsters. Monsters can find lovers, and eventually make babies. Which also factors into how much they can afford apartment wise. So lowering it a bit after they make a baby until he becomes an adult and can hold a job is a recommended idea. Babies generally have superior stats to their parents so wanting to breed over and over again is recommended. Gym equipment and combat both help increase the stats of your monsters. Increasing their happiness by fulfilling their needs and increasing the value of the apartments also lead to bonuses highlighted in blue that will give you big advantages. VisualsThe quests are arranged in 3 colors, red for main quest, green for unlocking monsters, and yellow for unlocking furniture. Only one quest will ever be red at any given time since its a single main quest, with various side quests you can accomplish. There are repeatable quests per hotel floor stage so you don’t have to worry about hitting a wall.			"

Unholy Heights is a strange, strange little game. It seems to take itself fairly seriously, although there was obviously alot lost in translation when converting to English.Myself, the white devil with the hitler 'stash, lured potential tenants with 'pervy' wallpaper, cigarette butts, and cheap rent, among other things. This is a tower defense game mixed with clan micromanagement. You run a block of apartments and the tenants are your 'towers'. I will vote this a 'yes' but will curb-stomp it as well.Pros:+There is a difficult learning curve (although good tutorials) that keeps you coming back for more like 'I gotta try to get that second layer!'+Unintended humor through very bizarre descriptions of things+Beware that there are lots of adult themes despite its kiddie cover - horse people mating, chickens having wet dreams, and demi-gods examining pelvisesCons:-Menus are fairly horrible - the hotbar is pretty dumb - things could be much better optimized as far as mouse and keyboard setup-Elevator music is generic-Although the art all matches up, we are mixing demons with baby chicks and humans and demi-gods-You have two screen resolution options - bad, and worseIts cheap and we laughed at alot of it. Get it on sale if this looks like your kind of thang. "

												Cute flash game but has very shallow game mechanics and little replay value. Monsters are cute and presentation is acceptably straightforward. The strategy system is very arbitrary and cumbersome. Controlling your monsters in battle can be frustratingly tough because of the lack of any overlap, identical health bars for friendly and enemy, lack of hotkeys/hotgroups, stupid/unpredictable AI behavior, and no strategy interface to coordinate your forces or do anything complex. Upgrading apartments manually takes forever and often is counterintuitive because monsters will demand things they don't actually want or need and frequently when you satisfy requirements and make a really nice apartment the monster you just spent a lot of money pleasing will stop paying rent because now he can't afford it. These kinds of unnatural hurdles are everywhere in this game. Unique nouns in the game generally reference internet games and meme culture, as seems to be the popular tactic of late for flash games where the author doesn't want to do any creative work.Overall Unholy Heights is not really worth spending money on unless it is VERY cheap and you've got nothing better to do than explore simple flash games. This one is charming at times, with an interesting premise, it just isn't very good.			"

												I can't really describe why I don't like this game. At first I was intrigued and was having a small amount of fun but as the game progressed I just lost more and more interest. I felt like you have to maintain the monster's wants to much and they're still never happy no matter how much you spend and how low you make their rent. Not to mention if one dies then you have a room full of stuff that the next monster could not even need or like so you're trying to figure out if you need to sell it or what. What. It was very frustrating, but if you can overlook that unlike me then that should irrelevant. Also it seemed like you had to evict monsters or get them killed so you could start making money and room for the stronger monsters, which I don't like because eviction is a♥♥♥♥♥♥move and killing them is more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥move. That's just my personal opinion though.Oh, and you'll have to grind a bit to get more money from rent but it's not to bad since the game has an increase speed option. Figured I'd throw that in for people who just hate grinding.Lastly, I could see some people liking this game but I don't think it's good other than it's adorable monsters.			"

												If you tell people about a game where you play as satan, they’ll probably think of torturing innocent souls, razing cities, fighting against god… You know, wreaking havoc on an untold scale. That could work, but it probably wouldn’t be nearly as fun as what Unholy Heights’ developers thought of.""The Devil’s spent his savings on a place in the projects!"" is the line that opens the game. Satan now owns an apartment building, and has to bring monsters in as tenants to not only get some cash, but also to protect the place from foolish adventurers looking to slay him. Priorities, see, after all those folks are dead, and we’ve some money in the bank, then we’ll talk about that havoc, and about world domination.You have a side view of the building. Whenever you’re attacked, the adventurer party will climb floor by floor, attempting to reach The Devil’s room, and you have to call on his tenants to prevent that from happening. When you're not under attack, you’ll need to recruit more tenants and keep them happy, so they’ll fight better and pay more rent. Of course, you aren’t above evicting them if they fail at either of those things.It’s very engaging, not only because of the gameplay, but the cute cartoon-ish presentation keeps you attached to each monster as they form their families and advance in their careers. It’s hard not to like them, or not feel slightly saddened when they die or leave. But, back to mechanics, the engagement also owes a lot to the surprising amount of depth to the game.Higher tier monsters have to be unlocked, and each has its own demands for that to happen, demands which aren’t always simple to meet. As you unlock those monsters, you’ll also need to mind the room allocation for battle: some monsters can tank more hits while others work better shooting from afar. To say nothing of the stat growth mechanics.Still, you can learn most of it in a few hours, without worry. It is truly a gem of an indie game, bringing together management, tower defense and real-time strategy, and still remaining quite accessible. You will need to read guides if you go for 100% completion, but whether or not you decide to, Unholy Heights still offers incredible value for its low asking price of four dollars.			"

Then you need to send your minions out to protect you!  It gets pretty difficult later on, so you have to make your minions mate to have stronger children.

It is quite a slow game with some waiting around, depending on your approach to the questline. I found the uniqueness of the game making it a worthy purchase and for a price of mere 2£, I can most definitely recommend it. Here's a video fo me playing it for a little bit:

												PSA: Fighting next to the stairs is almost always a bad idea. RIP; Everyone who was home from work during that last adventurer raid. But seriously, tactics are a huge part of this game. If you're dying a lot, pay attention to resistences. If the adventuers you're going up against are mostly mages, then make sure that a monster with high magic resist is leading the charge. Make use of pincher manuevers and save empty slots in your apartments for healing items so that you can get your heavy hitters back in the fight quickly. Don't forget to adjust your rent according to how upgraded your apartments are. If your favorite monster is falling behind on his rent, set it to $0 until he manages to catch up again. Don't let him build up a huge debt or he'll just skip town without paying and then you'll lose both the money and the monster. If you have deadbeat monsters who frequently fail to pay their rent but are essential to your defense then just resign yourself to not collecting any income from them. It's not worth the risk in the long run and your other monsters should more than make up the difference as long as you're frequently doing quests.			"

												Unholy Heights is a cute little management sim, coupled with defending your building from attackers.Keeping residents happy is simple enough, give them what they want and don't charge them too much for the room. Getting the residents to actually pay you is tougher, you have to balance not doing quests to give them time for work with doing quests for the big rewards. Sometimes even that won't lead them to pay you as particular monsters are just bad with money. Residents find partners and can have babies with increased stats, making balancing the items in the room a bit more challenging, but still simple enough.The combat is simple too, enemies come, you knock on the doors to call residents to fight. But they can't pass each other in the halls, so the order and timing of the door knocks is important. A good time waster that will eat away the day.			"

												A delightful experience which seems designed for those who typically dislike tower defense games, like myself. While battles are certainly an entrenched element of the game, there is also an engaging sim management scenario spreading gleeful cheer to every Devil-infested corner of your complex. Monsters come to join your army, following the tantalizing odors of rotting flesh and cheap rent. Centaurs, demons, fish-people, and anthromorphic chickens are just some of the entertaining cast; over yonder succubi are speedily mating, and that pig-man may actually be Jack the Ripper. After you get the tenants to settling in your economic housing opportunity, they start insisting on upgrades to their rooms, which is a marvelous opportunity to oblige and raise their rent. Money pours in, some tenants fall on hard times and are unable to pay, while others sneak off in the night to avoid their debts. It's all humorously presented, and the random enemies and quests you can send your nefarious, penny-penching residents on is just icing on the cake. Battles are usually relatively easy, with only a handful needing retrys. All in all, Unholy Heights shouldn't be missed by those who adore catering to sims. Yes, hidden beneath the huggable chicken coating is a light, kinda tower defense game, but don't let that scare you off. This little gem is absolutely worth playing.			"

												Fun game!Addictive and a little challenging, this unique spin on a tower defense game/apartment management game will keep you entertained for hours. The tenants are all very quirky and quite endearing; getting to hear them ‘pillow-talk’ is also hilarious. The game itself is pretty straightforward (the how-to-play section is very helpful if you get stuck), but in mid-late gameplay it can start getting a little muddled when it comes to choosing tenants. For example, if you choose to have demi-humans in your apartment, it would not be wise to put demons in there as well (they hate each other). Though this doesn’t deeply affect your game, it does kind of suck if you like having a variety of monsters living in your apartment. Compared to some more traditional tower defense games, your tenants are the ones on the battle field and are likely to die. It’s important to keep an eye on them if there is a battle going on and get them to retreat if the opponent is too strong. One strategy I found helpful when fighting enemy casters was to turtle: attack (ranged), retreat into room (before unit gets hit), and attack again, etc. You do develop a bit of a play-style the more you play. Don’t forget to raise the satisfaction of your tenants as well, the bonuses are super helpful.			"

Attract monsters to live in your apartment block, keep them happy through apartment upgrades, breed them to be stronger, and defend your (and their) home against the constant stream of hero hopefuls who are after you and your treasure.Lots of lovely detail absolutely makes this - monsters will be away from home at different times depending on their job, different types of monsters do or don't get on with each other, apartment upgrades can increase chances of a monster getting a better job (which means you can charge them more rent) or a partner (with whom they can have kids which grow up to be stronger than their parents and may flee the apartment if their parents 'engage in pillow-talk'), and lots of other little things that give the little folks lots of personality. Highly recommended especially for the low price.			"

												Welcome to hell!  You are the Devil who has decided to try his hand at running an apartment building.  And catering to these monsters is no easy task.  There are monsters who love to say they are broke and skip out on rent.  You have monsters who can't stand another race of monsters and become increasingly dissatisfied with their living conditions if they stick around.  Some monsters just won't quit asking for upgrades to their apartment... like The Devil is made of money.  On top of all those picky renters, there are pesky groups that try to take down the apartment building and The Devil himself.  How dare they try to destroy the ruler of real estate hell!  Thankfully your renters feel the same way and will fight off incoming enemies, while you continue to strengthen your apartment empire.  You get to watch your renters find mates, have kids, and if they live long enough, you get to see them strike out on their own.  I have to say this is probably the cutest tower defense game, and it was pretty fun to play!  While the strategy genre is not something I am wonderful at, it was fun enough to play at a casual level.  Definitely worth picking up, whether it is full price or if you catch it on a sale.			"

												10/10 Would let a succubus read erotic fiction in my apartment again.No, but seriously, game is fun and has a spooky cute element to it with all the little monsters that live in your apartments. Pretty much you keep them happy by putting things they want in their apartments(game systems, furniture, AC, etc) and then they get stronger the happier they are. Then you(satan) use them to fight off anyone who tries to attack your base. Fun cute game. :)			"

Recommended: This is definitely an example of a game where the art direction and that design will just brush some people the wrong way, being very ""twee"" in that strange sort of Japanese way, but if that doesn't bother you, what you'll find is a fairly well-designed and moderately-deep tower defense game.Full review is available here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												Game's a lot of fun. Doesn't really seem like it, but it really is. Within 10 minutes of booting it up all my housemates had purchased it and were playing it alongside me. There are moments that make me rage uncontrollably, like the end boss and hunting for the few achievements in the game that aren't just handed to you at some point (because they are ridiculously time consuming) but it's such a small factor that the cutsy and casual side of the game outweighs in a big way. 10/10 would play again.

												Unholy Heights is a building management game where you own an apartment complex and choose which monsters you allow to become tenants.  To progress thru the game, you initiate quests which cause heroes to invade your apartment.  You then click your tenants (if they are actually at home) to make them attack.  There are many room upgrades to purchase -- some grant status buffs while others are there as demands by your tenants.  Overall it is kinda boring and I only recommend if on sale and if you enjoy simple, casual games.PROS+ Charming graphics and characters+ Lots of upgrades for your rooms+ Stable and functional+ Steam AchievementsCONS- Somewhat shallow, linear, and repetitive- Sounds and music are forgettable- Feels like an iPad game- Kinda boring			"

												It was fun at the beginning, a cutsey tycoon mixed with a very light touch of strategy, however it really loses its appeal as time goes on, as you get more and more tennants, it gets harder and harder to order them the way you want to, especially when you have multiples tennants in the same room. The encounters start to lose their sheen, just clicking on doors and clicking on them again when trying to reorder them or when their health runs low. The tycoon part also gets eroded, after a point, all that you do is bump up prices and, if you want to, buy them the random items they request.			"

												8-29-2014Pros: Easy controls.Easy gameplay but hard to master. Tests how to micromanage each tenant and their room just to make them happy and ready for battle.Many different monsters with different features and abilities. Its repetitive but addicting. Cons:Addicting but repetitive so yeah it can get tedious. I wish you can personally assign room for the new tenants instead of them picking a random room. I wish that there's a feature to refund all the purchased items in a room whenever a monster gets killed to avoid confusion on which to buy and not to buy for the new tenants because they're expensive and hard to track. At some point of the game, not all monsters will visit the housing i mean i've been waiting for certain monsters to drop by and take that room because i need them to defend the place a lot better so that random generator dose not seem to work very well.So the reason why i stil recommend this game is because despite of its imperfections the mechanic still works and probably by luck you will be able to win boss battles so that means patience is also the key to win this game. Specially when you wait for a tenant to get a partner then wait more until they make a baby then finally wait another for the last time till their kid grows old enough to fight for you... However its also a hit or miss because if that big family got too much debt for not paying the rent then you might lose them in the end so the game is basically a hit or miss chance. Never the less its still fun and addicting anyways and the price justifies its quality.UPDATE: 8-30-2014I tried it again and i was a bit tolerant on late payers and it goes to show that most of them are willing to pay up overtime but one fled the room... lol its still amazing to see how this game behaves. :))			"

												This game is a unique twist in your everyday Tower Defense genre.What is the game about?So basically you need to hire Tennants in your building to whom you can ask for help (if they are at home when the enemy attacks) when the enemy tries to loot your gold.  You need to choose different type of quests which determines which and how many enemies will come to attack your base. Depending on the difficulty of the quest and some repuation points, different types of TENNANTS can be given the limited rooms you have in your building, which can be upgraded.  Is it FUN?Hell yes, it's fun. But it's a bit KIDDISH. The challenge isn't much, it's rather SLOW PACED, which is great if you want to relax and have a little fun for some time.  Tower Defense Mechanics: 7/10;Ease of gameplay: 9/10;Enjoyment: 8/10;Enjoyment per dollar: 10/10; I got this game for $0.33 from the humble bundle, and for this PRICE the game is just too good.The game is locked at 1280x720, but I could still play it easily on 1080p FULLSCREEN.

												One of the best japanese indie titles out there. The idea of playing as an owner of an apartment complex for monsters who is also Satan is so strange, yet so compelling as a twist on the dungeon defence genre. Watch and get emotional as your spooky residents from the japanese folklore get married, get kids, die defending you while their kids work on a late night shift to pay bills.Wonderful videogame.			"

												First the story.You're the devil who spent his life savings on his dream apartement. you then let monsters/demons/chickens rent your rooms so you can expand your apartement and such. while you do that adventurers come to your apartement to steal your money and you can use the monsters renting your rooms to fight them so they can't steal your hard earned money!!! not only do the monsters pay rent and defend your apartement against adventurers who want to wipe you out, they also fall in love, have jobs, get children and even skipping out on their rent!Genre.Tower defense/Apartment management simThe soundtrack.One of the awesomest things in this game is definitely is the soundtrack it's catchy as HELL.it's actually one of my favourite games. i really like the art and simplicity. and eventhough it looks very easy some enemies are pretty hard!i definitely recommend this game and it's worth picking up for this price.

												For a game with such a simple premise, it sure is addicting!  It's amazing just how many details you have to keep track of when managing an apartment for the Devil!  And while the idea sounds simple, it's actually quite challenging.  While you may have to employ a bit of strategy in choosing which monsters you're going to take in as renters, there's still a lot of randomness involved.  Many successes or failures may reside on the luck of the draw.  For instance, there have been times when my apartment was attacked while all of my monster tenants were out either shopping or at work.  But it's that sort of randomness that gives the game a lot of replayability.All in all, this is an excellent little game that could very well keep you entertained for hours to come.  I know I still have quite a few hours of enjoyment left in it.  It's well worth the few bucks you might pay for it and it's an utter steal if you can get it on sale.			"

												This is really a Great game for a cheap price! It's very much worth buying!Unholy Heights puts together Tower defense and Hotel management simulation in one game. As the The Devil, attract customers (monsters in the game) and manage your hotel. Decorate your rooms with items that'll make your customers happy and content. The happier your customers, the stronger they get. At some point of the game, you'll be battling adventurers using the residents of your hotel. Be it a demon, undead, werewolves,it's up to you what combination you'll take. Each type of monsters have their own attitude towards items in the room and their neighbors so it'll be a challenge to balance all them. I won't spoil much, the rest of the awesome things in this game is up to you to discover!My Personal Highlights for the game:+ Has many events and interactions to discover.+ The genre is unique and new. (Tower Defense/Management/Strategy)+ Many monsters to unlock and to use.+ The game is cheap. (bought it when it went on sale)+ Has a great variety of missions. (Rarely redundant)+ Has good art and gameplay+ Highly Addictive gameI highly recommend it to anyone who loves tower defense and management simulations. :D			"

												After playing Unholy Heights numerous times since I've purchased it, I've decided to edit my original review to make it clearer as to why I love this game so much.GameplayOkay, so it's not your ordinary tower defense game, but a management sim too. Basically, the devil decided to run his own apartment complex, and in order to protect himself he persuades the residents to fight for him. Each resident has varying stats, along with different fighting styles (melee, ranged, & magic), so having a variety of monsters is ideal. Simply knock on the door of the resident that you want to fight, and they'll go kill as many adventurers as they can handle without a second thought. The apartment management might be a little difficult in the beginning, due to the lack of rooms you start out with - just 4. If you want another level, you'll have to save up enough money to begin construction, and it can get pretty expensive. This is where planning what monsters you have is important because you'll need them to defend until you can afford to build another floor and house more monsters. Oh, and always remember to keep your residents happy :)The ResidentsAs I mentioned above, it's important to ensure the happiness of your residents. Happy monsters = increased popularity for the devil, and they won't run off because they hate you. Keeping your residents happy is simple, mainly because they'll tell you what they want and you just satisfy their request. Most of the time, they'll ask for better furniture, etc., but it might get a little tricky if you have two monster types that hate each other and they want you to give the other the boot. Definitely check out the beastiary if you're unsure of any monsters that might clash. Rent is also an important thing to consider; always give them a price that they're happy with. If, for whatever reason, they can't afford to pay rent, lower it a bit until they pay off their debt. An unhappy resident will leave if they are unsatisfied or in debt for too long.Daily LifeAside from fighting and asking you for everything under the sun, they're just regular monsters trying to live their lives. They have jobs, go to school, find love, and make babies. Oh, and of course you'll know every single thing they do throughout their day, ranging from things like 'engaging in pillowtalk' or 'reading erotic fanfiction' to normal chores.

But regardless, humans don't like monsters and they're all like ""rawr kill dem monsters hurrr"" and that's sad. So you knock on the monster-tenants' doors to let them know that humans are invading and therefore must die. Also, the tenants are pretty demanding sometimes and want various things. Unholy Heights is a light-hearted affair and it costs next to nothing! So buy it RIGHT NOW!			"

												I got this on sale for $2 and I'd definitely say it was worth that much for all the hours I've gotten out of it. It's something I'd recommend as a casual game as it is the perfect blend of idly decorating rooms for cute little monsters and then panicking as you're overcome by waves of attacking heroes. You can drop in and out of quests at any time.Other things to do is trying to breed stronger creatures to keep upping your stats, getting them to move in with others to make the best trio you can, which is both frustrating and rewarding.And there's some achievements you probably need to play the game through at least twice to be able to get, which gives it replay value....Plus the wallpapers you get are really nice?

The happier you make them the stronger they will become.  Being a good landlord is key.  There are quests that require you to have your tenants fight off invading guilds.  The game is not too challenging as long as you keep all your tenants happy.  Soundtrack is great as well.

												This looks like a cheap sheet freemium tablet games but you has the patience of spending 2 hours into this game, you will see the depth of it. There are interesting things to do and a lot of things do happen. You get to manage these residents among which random events take place, altough I do not like the tower defence part of the game- a bit redundant really. The management side of the game is really neat and fun to play because of the ""random"" events. Of course, they are mostly discoverable but hidden rules/agorithms but the initial novelty is still refreshing. For example, some of your tenants fall in love with each other and decide to move in together so they will withdraw one of the rooms. Some demons hate or hated by other species- they do not get along. But you get to manage this. If they decide to live together instead of two seperate rooms, you should raise the rent. All in all, if you get it in a dirt cheap bundle, it is totally worthwhile.			"

Shallow Tower Defense GameplayYou're The Devil and you've got adorable monsters for tenants who battle to Japanese pop. This game is an explosion of cuteness and is okay for people looking for a casual tower defense. It's not the most exciting because the mechanics are simple and not varying enough. It's a simpler version of The Sims where you cater to your tenant's needs by buying things they want, different monsters have different needs, personalities, and traits and monsters run away if they can't afford rent after a while. You can use tenants as fodder or build an army to protect your castle. A little bit of strategy there.My only gripe with it is that I wish you could make threats and force your tenants to find work. Otherwise, you can conquer the world...with cuteness!5/10			"

												I've played quite a few flash games that involved hotel management, and Unholy Heights does a good job of incorporating new mechanics to a classic genre.If you like hotel simulators, monster themes, defense-based gameplay, and fairly casual pacing, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are nice - the detail in the characters is decent, and any upgrades you purchase for each room is never shown. The music and sounds are okay, nothing too special, although I personally like to mute the sounds in favor of my own. The tutorial is quick and very helpful at showing you how every mechanic works. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, and it is easy to understand everything about the game with one or two short playthroughs. The pacing for the game is completely up to the player, as you can continue grinding until you wish to increase the difficulty (by purchasing the next floor for your apartment).In the game, you play as the Devil, acting landlord of the Unholy Heights apartments. You can accept different monsters as tenants, and these units are called upon whenever you are attacked by adventurers. The monster types you can add as tenants increases as you progress through the game and build more floors (this also increases the overall difficulty). Each monster has different desires, and purchasing their requests (room upgrades, like better computers, fridges, etc) will result in a satisfaction boost. This is useful because you can then increase the rent a little without incurring a penalty. At high levels of satisfaction, monsters will have bonuses to their abilities.During battles, you can knock on doors to ask tenants to fight for you (this is an interesting mechanic, because monsters at work will be unavailable, however, monsters that are unemployed are also less likely to pay rent on time). Your monsters will fight in a line, so clicking on a monster who is about to die will allow them to retreat (and bring the next monster in line to the front). You can purchase one-time consumables (like health potions) that are used during battle and when a monster returns to his/her room. If you fail to kill an adventurer, he/she will take a percentage of your money - and escape with it if you are unable to kill them by the time they exit the screen. Saving often is encouraged, since you can have your entire tenant list destroyed if you make a mistake and/or do not plan accordingly.Monsters can also meet mates (usually if they are employed and have better rooms), adding another person to your defense cue. Eventually, the couple can reproduce, earning you a third monster for a single room. Being able to keep families alive and happy is a great way to increase both your revenue and defense rating.By default, adventures will appear fairly infrequently, however, you can access missions for gold rewards - a difficulty rating and brief description gives you an idea of what to expect. In order to build the next floor for your apartment, you must defeat a boss mission and have enough gold (quite expensive, so grinding is recommended).Overall, the game is a nice, casual time filler. If you are interested in hotel management and/or defense games, definitely give this game a try (or at least take a look at the demo).Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

Sometimes.When I first played I couldn't bring myself to stop and go play something else. I was dead-set on breeding the strongest of monsters to conquer everything! Unfortunately doing the same thing over and over can get seriously mind numbing, so now I can only tolerate the game for about 15 minutes a sitting at the most. There isn't a real challenge to this game except for the occasional overly hard quest that you can still beat with minor patience. Still, it's a cute little game that won't forever be a blemish on your library.			"

												its kinda like if you took tamadachi , pokemon and a tower defence game and mixed them all together which sounds wierd but this game is awsome basicly what you do is you take tennants who pay you for their room and protect you from humans, the money you get from your tennants is typacly used to improve their and other rooms in your appartment building, the happier your tennants are the more their willing to pay [if they can], from time to time humans will come by to attack because you either took a quest or they just felt like it you will then send out a few tennants to kill the human but some times the human will kill your tennant so you have to know when to tell your people to run away and if a human makes it to the top floor to your charectors room they will steal a large sum of money which sucks♥♥♥♥♥but you will have the chance to take it back as they make their way back out of your appartment building. this a fun and exstremely addictive game and i highly recommend it, and if you do buy it make sure to be nice to the abyssals or fish people they are very strong and very reliable when it comes to rent despite the game saying they are poor also they ♥♥♥♥ like rabbits so they can quickly fill up large portions of your appartments makeing you very well protected and with a nice steady revanue stream			"

After two hours of playing I was still grinding away with a single-floor apartment building, so making progress (building more floors and raising more monster tenants) might turn out to be a bit of a timesink (suggesting it'd be an even better mobile game), but at least it's enjoyable and full of adorable artwork and catchy music found only in Japanese games of this type.

												This initially seemed like an interesting concept, but it got old quickly.  Even at max speed, too much of play time is spent just sitting around waiting for things to happen, and it soon becomes clear that the best way to increase your fighting strength is to spend even more time sitting around waiting for things to happen.

												its kinda like if you took tamadachi , pokemon and a tower defence game and mixed them all together which sounds wierd but this game is awsome basicly what you do is you take tennants who pay you for their room and protect you from humans, the money you get from your tennants is typacly used to improve their and other rooms in your appartment building, the happier your tennants are the more their willing to pay [if they can], from time to time humans will come by to attack because you either took a quest or they just felt like it you will then send out a few tennants to kill the human but some times the human will kill your tennant so you have to know when to tell your people to run away and if a human makes it to the top floor to your charectors room they will steal a large sum of money which sucks♥♥♥♥♥but you will have the chance to take it back as they make their way back out of your appartment building. this a fun and exstremely addictive game and i highly recommend it, and if you do buy it make sure to be nice to the abyssals or fish people they are very strong and very reliable when it comes to rent despite the game saying they are poor also they ♥♥♥♥ like rabbits so they can quickly fill up large portions of your appartments makeing you very well protected and with a nice steady revanue stream			"

												Once upon a time,there's a peaceful apartment in Unholy Height where demons love each other and have a family.Suddenly the legendary hero coming to your apartment to kill residence in an apartment.All demon including demon kids fighting against the legendary hero and intense battle happen*not really,the legendary hero too OP,dont open the door when he come,he dont have a key to enter a room haha.The Cheepy parents both dead and leaving its kid *thank you legendary hero,u are the best.The Cheepy kid dont have money to pay a rent,so the Devil(that's me!) let that cheepy kid to stay for free *after that i envict him because why not?.So the moral of the story demon also have feeling and emotion and now i hate human because of this game.Well  back to the review,This is the underrated game that i ever play in steam,great concept of tower defense game.Demon can have it's own partner to make a baby including skeleton! *dont ask me how they make kid,it's beyond my power.They also add a little management to makes this game more fun where u can place a furniture and ur tenants need to pay a rent.And watch out for tenants who ran away because they wont pay the rent and debt.Simple yet fun game,worth to play.

												At first I wasn't sure what to expect from this game. Without reading any reviews I leapt into Unholy Heights and, surprisingly, I was impressed.The game has a combination of 2D tower defense and management concepts. You rent out rooms to certain species of demons as you gradually gain popularity among them and, as a result, get stronger demons to defend the apartments. Watching the demons live out their lives can put a smile on your face. Because of this feature it helps the player to connect and relate to their tenants. The missions themselves are relaitvely simple, usually involving the tenants protection you from humans.If you have some spare change in your wallet, Unholy Heights is a worthwhile investment with several hours worth of gameplay with adorable and collectible monsters.

												Tower defense style games are extremely hit or miss for me and this one was a big miss. I found that the game wasn't keeping me actively engaged in play and I wasn't having much fun. The genre mashup with apartment sim/manager didn't bring the game together for me and I often found myself just sitting and watching, only there isn't a whole lot to watch.It might be something I'd enjoy on the go with a phone or tablet, but it wasn't engaging enough to want to sit down and play it at home.

												In my quest for world domination:- I managed the racial tensions of a pack of ♥♥♥♥♥y monsters.- Bought expensive furniture.- Watched the tenants turn my building into Melrose Place.- Had multiple flower elementals with the job of ""bondage master""...before they were promoted to ""pimp"".- Lost most of my tenants to a boss fight waaaaaay harder than previous missions.  This made other tenants very happy.If this emotional roller coaster sounds like your kind of game, head on over to Unholy Heights today!

			Here it is, folks. My very first Let's Play. Unholy Heights is a simple game that mixes Apartment Management and Tower Defense. Pretty cheap on Steam if it looks interesting. Behold the words of the Devil!

												I'm not usually one for tower defense, but this game was addictive. I found myself playing it for hours, and I liked the fact you were renting out the aparetments. It brought a whole 'nother element to the game than just battling, and I spent a lot more time balancing rents and getting monsters to breed than actually figting. Though it's really simple at first, you have to take a much more strategetic aproach as it goes on if you want to win, and I spent at least an hour and a half setting up my complex for the final battle. Actually figuring out the strategy is a bit hit and miss, and learning how to do things like getting people out of rent-debt is something you have to figure out on your own, but I enjoyed that. Did I mention it's adorable? It's really, really adorable. If this seems like a game you would like, but you're not sure, it's definetly worth a shot.			"

While appearing deceptively simple, this game actually has a lot of depth.It's endless, not really a sandbox, but it just keeps going on as long as you play.Replayability. There are so many types of monster tennants you can have.The graphics are silky smooth 2D, and go great with the soundtracks that play.The game overall just looks great.The only con I could find is a few small annoyances related to text in the game, which could be polished up a little bit, but do the job well enough.In summary, I say if you have four bucks, get this game now.

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  A hero came by as the three deadbeats from room 303 tried to run away without paying rent. I just let them die. The hero was a prick and decided the carnage was not over, he killed a couple and their young child. I shed a tear. They were skeletons, don't ask me know how they reproduced.Protip: Never let hobos live in your apartment complex. Español:  Un héroe daba un paseo por mi apartamento en medio de la noche mientras 3 residentes intentaban huir sin pagar la renta, no hice nada para salvarlos y me entretuvo ver su dolorosa muerte, acto seguido el héroe asesino a una pareja y a su pequeño hijo eran esqueletos, así que no tengo la más mínima idea de cómo le hicieron para tener hijos.En resumen, nunca le alquiles un cuarto a un mendigo.

												A very adorable game and in my taste it has pretty good game music.I would say that anyone should buy it either on sale or when it is full price.Because,it is definetly worth it's four dollar price to get.This game is basically a tower defense game,but instead of towers you use the forces of the underworld as your towers and they pay you rent.I would rate this game a 3/4 out of 5 ,because while it is my personal favorite out of it's genre I don't like tower defense games to much.

												Unholy Heights is a fun, casual . . . apartment-combat-simulator? Well, it's got some bits of micromanagement and a tad bit of combat mechanics. I'll go into much better detail below.TLDR here and at the bottom for convience \/TLDR; Overall, Unholy Heights is a fun micromanagement game with moderately deep but easy to understand combat mechanics (RTS), quirky (and sometimes adult) humor, and cute simplistic graphics. Despite a small language barrier, with a small amount of time the game is easily understood. Later parts of the game can get a bit grindy, so it's better suited for small bouts of play for some casual fun.-----------------------------------------------------Just as a forewarning, the original developers' first language is not English. While the game is understandable and funny at times, this will be prevelant throughout the game. Some descriptions for items won't make sense. Explanations for important parts of the game are sometimes vague. I had to figure out a LOT by myself, and you will too since the Wiki (the only one I could find) is unfinished and doesn't shed much more light than the game. Luckily, it's not too hard but you will be scratching your head at first.-----------------------------------------------------In Unholy Heights, you are . . . well, Satan himself. And you run apartments. Ironically, you hardly ever see yourself in this game apart from the beginning and a picture when you hover over your manager room. Immediately, you get monsters that want to move in. Just move in all the cute little monsters and you'll be fine, right?Well, sorta. Other than taking care of these monsters, you have to fight off pesky humans that wander into your land. While the combat is a HUGE part of the game, it's fairly simple. Cilck on a door to bring out the monster you want to fight. If they're there, they'll come out. Of course, each monster has their own attributes to contribute to the fight (Range, attack type, and physical and magical defense).Some monsters have 'perks' with different positives, the most common with ""Stronger at -insert day/night/weather"". While this sounds like it makes battles more interesting, you can't predict the weather or when the humans arrive so relying on this will screw you over. Improving your 'strategy' (when and where you release your monsters when you have attackers) is what you'll be doing most of the time in concerns to combat. Once you have a solid one down, it's just boosting up your monsters to match the enemies and hoping the ones you need are there when you need them.This is where the apartment bits come into play. To get stronger monsters, you have to improve their apartments and make them happy. The happier they are, the stronger they get. Other than the obviously stronger higher tier monsters (unlocked through raising your interest/respect/like for the Devil and through completing 'Quests'), you can get stronger monsters through a couple having a baby. Randomly, one of your monsters will get a lover, and after a random number of 'Pillowtalks' they'll have a baby. When the baby grows up, they'll have significantly stonger stats then their parents.""Reputation"" with certain monster factions/races will play a part in what monsters you can use, house, and unlock. Some can't stand each other. Others worry about how well your treating your residents, while others focus on how often your resident die/how long they live. This means you may have to sacrifice one for the other, since their requirements will be the opposite of another. Once one faction hates you, don't expect to see them again unless you do something huge to get them to like you again. Once a faction likes you and you complete the quest, you unlock new and stronger tiers that have a new set of attributes and likes and dislikes on their apartment. It's very satisfying to unlock these new creatures able to use them and just brings new life to the game after you've played for a long while.However, getting the stronger monsters to match the quests you have available can take some time. The difficulty increase is moderately steep, so even if you have a solid strategy you'll be grinding small random encouters to make money, waiting for rent to be paid, satisfy your monsters, and hopefully have them have babies. It's all random, so you'll be sitting there with the highest speed on waiting for things to happen. Hopefully you have a second monitor to watch things on; the game 'pauses' when you alt tab in both Fullscreen and Windowed mode. Luckily, watching your residents as they go about their life can be pretty entertaining, but even then you should probably take a break from this game every once and awhile to not get burned out on it.-----------------------------------------------------TLDR; Overall, Unholy Heights is a fun micromanagement game with moderately deep but easy to understand combat mechanics (RTS), quirky (and sometimes adult) humor, and cute simplistic graphics. Despite a small language barrier, with a small amount of time the game is easily understood. Later parts of the game can get a bit grindy, so it's better suited for small bouts of play for some casual fun.			"

The gameplay is incredibly easy to learn but difficult to master and it's very lighthearted while also being surprisingly deep. The game is fun, addictive and perfect for playing when you should be doing other things....Like writing a research report....Anyway, I highly recommend it and if I'd known how much fun I'd have with it I probably would have payed double it's current price at least.

While this is quite a simple idea for a game, it'll keep you wanting to play as you slowly get more items for your tenents, attract new and stronger monsters, and the brainstorming for figuring out problems like why one of your people got sick or the different strategies to keep the monsters fighting and defeating the guys that attack the hotel while keeping them all alive.This was well worth the money. :D			"

												Unholy Heights is an adorable game that is exactly as the tags state: Strategy and Tower Defense. You rent out rooms to different monsters who each have their own unique set of fighting traits and in return they protect your building (and your money). You have to keep your monsters happy by buying furniture and other things to put in their rooms to raise their satisfaction, and as the satisfaction rises you can raise the rent. You build your tower by completing missions and saving up the rent money you collect from the monsters staying in your building, and the bigger your tower gets, the more monsters you can rent to.Pros:- Super addicting if you're into that kinda game- Really adorable- Different array of monsters and each has their own attack/defense stats so you don't constantly get repeats- Overall a fun casual gameCons:- The only thing I can see that would be a con is that it's really time consuming. It takes up a lot of time to save up money especially if your monsters aren't very victorious.The con isn't really that big of a deal so I'd give this game a 9 and a half outta ten. Ten outta ten if you have a lot of spare time on your hands.			"

The whole premice to me seems crazy, the controls and how to play the game is simple enough.  move monsters in to your building so you can collect rend to make the place bigger and better,  and have the monsters there to defend you from the oncoming horde of humans who want you dead (no suprise you are the devil) Its fun for a short while then gets very repetative.  I would only recommend this game as a time filler, if i was reviewing this as a mobile game i would say it is a must have as its great in small doses but in the pc market when they are so much better games to put time in to it really falls short.

												I love this game because it's quite addicting, and it sometimes keeps you busy for a while like watching a tenant fall in love, have a baby, and even fight for the hotel (I think). I have made mistakes where I carelessly have a tenant or two be killed in battle but if I remember to save before the battle, I can restart and fix the problem, and yes I know that might be known as cheating.8/10reason it's an 8 is the fact that species of monsters can't fall in love with different races like skeleton X zombie and such. would love that but it's still a good game.

												More than likely I got my hopes up as to how fun this game would be or how much I would enjoy the premise.  At the end of the day I didn't like Unholy Heights and I don't think anyone is missing out by overlooking it.The most unfortunate thing anyone can ever say of entertainment is that it's dull, bland and boring, which summarizes Unholy Heights pretty well.  Hell, I wouldn't even go so far as to say it's a game.  At best it plays out like a cell phone game.  The idea is that you're running an apartment complex for monsters and that idea seemed cool but there really isn't anything to it.  Monsters stop by and if they decide they want to stay, they will ask to move in, at which point you may either accept them or do nothing and just wait.  Eventually you'll fill up your apartment and start taking on 'quests,' where adventurers attack your apartment complex.  In order to defend against the attack you must knock on the doors of your tenants so that they come out and fight for you.  You have no control over combat, and each monster is either a ranged or melee attacker.What kills this game more than anything is the amount of waiting it requires.  There isn't gameplay, you just sit and wait for events to happen and then they do and that's it.  The amount of waiting is also fairly ridiculous if you're not using the speed up button.  Between each wave of a quest, you wait about a full minute or two for the next to begin.  That just isn't necessary.The only 'growth' that your tenants receive is iffy at best.  Sometimes they'll find a mate and that person will move in with them, doubling the effective strength of each house (due to having two monsters).  Wait even longer and these monsters might have a child, furthering their effectiveness.  Beyond that, they work jobs -- so they're not always around for combat when you need them -- and pay rent.  Well, sometimes they pay rent.  Sometimes they just stop paying rent and then ditch in the middle of the night.  If that happens, or the tenant dies, you need to refill the room.  The trouble with this is when you lose people during a quest it severely cripples your ability to finish it, as you are unlikely to replinish your ranks much during the downtime.  You can raise the rent on the apartment or get the tenants better stuff, which allows you to raise their rent a little bit more.  Other than that, the only direct control you have on the game is sending out units to combat or returning them to their apartment during combat.The premise of housing an apartment complex for monsters sounded interesting but there isn't any gameplay to speak of and I felt very much like I was wasting my time.  As cool as the mechanics may sound, they don't hold up in any way due to a lack of control.  Further, the ♥♥♥♥ing waiting, man.. that's just all the game is.  Don't bother with this one.			"

												A fun management game with demons and cute chibi sprites. load it up on a rainy day or when you ragequit dota and just have some cute fun.That said, the lack of personalization for the tenants and the lack of depth in tenent management makes the gameplay start to become stale after 1-2 hours in. As it functions right now, the tenants you put into apartments do nothing but spout things they want so that they might love their apartment. If you place tenants of ""opposite"" moralities, they refuse to become happy because they hate that tenant so much. This kind of relationship system is what this game needs more. More reasons to finagle with the fine print, more reason to really dig in deep and find out that makes each monster happy. Unholy Heights does not do this, and as a result, you will quickly find the best way to play within 2-3 hours in. Overall though, a good package as the base gameplay of putting tenants into apartments of best suit and keeping everyone in the green satisfies the minor urge to micromanage a building. Highly reccomend if on sale and you have a spare 2-5 dollars in your wallet.			"

												I had no expectations coming into this, and after sinking roughly 10 hours in just two days, I can safely say this was quite the pleasant surprise.I'm generally not a fan of tower defense games, but this was an unusual, interesting setup with the tower in question being an apartment complex and the means of it being protected is through your monster tenants. To keep things simpler, the game focuses on a single shot of the apartments instead of there being a big map that forces you to shift your camera around or multiple screens you have to cycle through constantly.It can be a bit of a grind as you progress through the game as you have to spend a lot of time waiting for your cash supply to increase and monsters of certain types and genders to stop by and rent a room or hook up with an incumbent tenant if you want to actually beat the game, but it is highly addictive and has a surprising amount of depth as the types of monsters, where each monster lives in your complex, and when you decide to send out a monster to protect your building can be the difference between success and failure.

												This game may seem very girly, but it's not.It's about Satan (you) running a hotel and using the tennets to fight humans that want to kill Satan. Mostly for his teasure. As you progress, the humans become powerful. The residents (monsters) have needs and requirements to live in the hotel. Each race is different, if you show a perference for the race you'll unlock more of it and powerful versions of it. Overall this game is adorable and perverted. Worth playing.			"

			A cheerful mix of tower defense and hotel management, 'Unholy Heights' starts off on the right foot but stumbles along the way.		

A cheerful mix of tower defense and hotel management, 'Unholy Heights' starts off on the right foot but stumbles along the way.  As the Devil, there should be a focus on the details but that's ultimately the undoing of this otherwise charming game.Quests difficulty is inflated due to the uncertainty when attacks will happen versus the times of day that your monster residents will be at home.  Monsters are also unclear on what exactly they want before moving in requiring a lot of expensive guesswork on a limited budget.  Thankfully there is no lose state and players can build back up after any misstep but doing so requires a lot of waiting around with nothing to do.			"

												A really addictive time-sink of a game. It's a stategy, but also a creature management game. You play as the Devil who has set up a apartment block for monsters of all types. They live, eat and sleep in their homes, but when heroes come to loot the area, you get these neighbors to come out and beat down those troublesome heroes.Every extention cannot be built until you have the appropriate money and do the right mission. All missions are activated through a board where you battle waves of heroes and recieve loot which is generally money, but can also been new peices of furnature to unlock.All the monsters have their own tastes for what they'd like in furniture and what you can buy for them to heal them, improve stats and even make it possible for them to find a mate and start a family.  Weather can alter things as certain creatures like Elementals, for example, enjoy the rain if they're water-dependent elementals.I've had a lot of fun with this game and it's well worth a look for any strategy lover looking for a time-sink.

												This game may seem very girly, but it's not.It's about Satan (you) running a hotel and using the tennets to fight humans that want to kill Satan. Mostly for his teasure. As you progress, the humans become powerful. The residents (monsters) have needs and requirements to live in the hotel. Each race is different, if you show a perference for the race you'll unlock more of it and powerful versions of it. Overall this game is adorable and perverted. Worth playing.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Unholy Heights 

			Views: 3		

			A cheerful mix of tower defense and hotel management, 'Unholy Heights' starts off on the right foot but stumbles along the way.		

A cheerful mix of tower defense and hotel management, 'Unholy Heights' starts off on the right foot but stumbles along the way.  As the Devil, there should be a focus on the details but that's ultimately the undoing of this otherwise charming game.Quests difficulty is inflated due to the uncertainty when attacks will happen versus the times of day that your monster residents will be at home.  Monsters are also unclear on what exactly they want before moving in requiring a lot of expensive guesswork on a limited budget.  Thankfully there is no lose state and players can build back up after any misstep but doing so requires a lot of waiting around with nothing to do.			"

												I really want to like Unholy Heights, I just don't. Between the tedious gameplay, lack of control, and disdain for story, it just ends up being an unenjoyable game.You're the devil, you run an apartment building, you use your tenants to ward off invaders. Your tenants pay rent, but it's a pittance. The only way to get a decent amount of money is to take on quests. Doing a quest is the difference between making 10-15g for a set of enemies and 400g for often the same enemies, but because you clicked the quest on the quest board, they're now worth more. But the quests are really short, so you have to go into the quest board and click quests over and over again to earn gold.Then there's the rent. If your tenants fall behind in their rent, they'll leave. Sometimes this means your strongest monster goes away, so there's not much incentive to charge decent rent, particularly given how long it can take you to fill an apartment up to full capacity. A full capacity apartment is preferable because it's more monsters to fight off enemies, If a full-capacity apartment falls behind on rent, you risk having to go back to a single occupant and waiting for it to get back to full occupancy. So you basically end up charging your tenants almost nothing -- and sometimes nothing! -- just to get them to stay in the building.The game also forces your first tenant to be a low value character. If you want the achievement, you won't evict him, despite the fact he's pretty worthless.Then there's the storytelling. All the monsters have names, jobs, and living in your apartment building, they build families. Don't get attached, though! Because the game doesn't care about telling stories. I watched the parents of a child be killed because of me, leaving me with a room occupied by an orphan, who immediately fell behind in rent, and then had to run away. (I didn't get the rent turned down to ""free"" quickly enough.) Just, tragic. I get that you're supposed to be playing as the devil, but you're also supposed to be appeasing your monsters to make them happy. It's such a disconnect.Next, the giant uptick in difficulty when you add a second floor to the building. The game isn't joking when it says to save before you do it. In the Starbound beta, there is a similar thing that happens when you build an item that summons the first boss. It drives people up the wall because you're running around making progress and suddenly this boss appears without warning and it's harder to beat than you could have ever expected, so the first few times, you just die and often times lose some elabroate structure you built in the process.Unholy Heights does this. But the thing is, the only reason it's like that in Starbound is because that game is in beta! It's not fully worked out yet! Unholy Heights is a finished game that does this to you. It's just not well-balanced to allow for the casual gameplay it uses.And that's another thing -- the game is clearly styled as something casual, you have very little control over combat aspects, but then you have things like the first big boss, which seems to want to make the game into a vicious timing strategy monster. It's inconsistent.The graphics aren't bad, but they aren't great.All in all, not a game I'd really recommend to people. It's too hard for casual gamers, and too casual for hardcore gamers. And so tedious and repetitive!			"

												The game is simple, and fun to play. Only thinking of the different combinations of tenement I was able to obtain throughout the game made my interest to play this game increased even more. However, it is important to remember that as any strategy game, the opponent will grow stronger too. Additionally, I founded silly what kind of job these monsters had when I started to play it.Anyway, if you enjoy playing simple games or see your place grow up as you level up...I think, this is the game for you. Enjoy it. P.S. Who said that the devil lord couldn't have his own business?  "

												Much has been said about this game, so I will make it brief...This is not a bad game... and it's very cheap (you can get it for 2-3 max).And there is nothing else to say: you pay for some hours (5-10... I don't think more) of honest entertainment, not more.I prefer a ""simple""game sold for his real value, than a casual game that cost 8 and last for 30 minutes...So, a 7, for the good value for money.

												With any game, I look for three things before I can give my recommendation.1. Does the game look good?2. Is the game too hard for me to play?3. When I shut the game down is that the last time?Sadly I can't give my recommendation to this game. Though it's an original concept with cute graphics, the gameplay does ths one in.Visually the game looks good, with a one screen premise and tons of cute 8-bit style characters. The pics on the store page give you an idea of the style, but therein lies the frustration.Difficulty-wise, this game is too hard to be a casual management sim and lacks a controls scheme in order to be a good button masher. I've tried TWENTY different times with different strategies to get to one expansion on the apartment building and I honestly don't think at this point that it can be done, No combination of monsters will beat the first boss unless I'm just impatient and not letting it run on its own for a few days in order to build up my monsters, all of whom seem to be unemployed and missing rent payments. Very frustrating when you just want to see what the game has to offer at early levels and can't get past the first stage.Replay value is a toss up. Like I said, I've given this one plenty of chances and I'm either too dumb to figure it out based on the instructions given or the game just isn't coded to be friendly to a new player (which is a problem a lot of games have these days). For me to go back for more, a developer has to make me feel as though I'm successful in the early part of the game so that I'll fight when it gets tough.Nice try and worth a look in the bargain bin, but at full price give it a pass unless the developers come back with some gameplay fixes or some serious content.

												There's a line between difficultly fun and plain frustraiting. Unfortunately, Unholy Heights ended up crossing it for me.I like games with a decent amount of mental challenge, and I'm not unwilling to wait for things to finally become rewarding. Unholy Heights, to my perception, doesn't seem to have any sort of even token rewarding system for continued play. Everything you put into it is more likely to disappear then fold into something bigger.			"

Brief synopsis: Extremely cute game. You're the Devil. The Devil is a landlord of an apartment complex. Monsters and Demons are your tenants. Fight off the guilds and the heroes  and build your complex to the skies!Proper review: Story: The story in this game can't really be called a story. Instead, I'd call it a ""plot"". You've got the devil who has decided to open an apartment complex in ""The projects"". You start off with a delapidated, one story building with 4 apartments. Monsters and demons of various types and abilities move in. Soon, local adventurers hear about this and decide they need to rid the world of the evil there. Defeating these adventurers gives you money to improve your apartments as well as unlocking different and stronger monsters.Graphics: The graphics are simple, yet charming. The game itself only has one setting - The Devil's apartment building. One would think that this would get boring after awhile, but it oddly doesn't. I think that's because things are constantly changing. Sometimes it's nice and sunny, other times it's raining. There's also a day and night cycle. These changes happen quickly enough so that you don't get bored, but not too quickly. Also, there are speed up time buttons which also help. Music/Sounds: The music is fairly decent and upbeat. The best song, in my opinion, is the one which plays during the end ""credits"" (which are well worth watching). The sound effects do get tiresome and annoying after awhile, but it's easily overlooked. Length: It took me about 24 hours to complete the game, though I tend to play games slowly as a personal preference. Others have finished the game in around 7-8 hours. Even if you only get 6 hours out of the game, it's still worth the asking price.Replayability: After beating the game, a ""Free Battle Mode"" is unlocked in the options menu which makes the game somewhat replayable. There are also achievements which you probably won't be able to get during your first playthrough which helps add to the replayability of the game (assuming you like achievements). Overall, if you like more ""casual"" games or are looking for a game which you can play in short increments and come back to later, this is definitely a game which you might like. My advice: Try the demo and if you like it, buy it! :)			"

												A fun casual sort of tower defense game but with a unique premise. You play as the Devil who decides to become a landlord one day, when in truth, you're planning to conquer the world. How? By tricking monsters as your tenants annd turning them into your personal army of soldiers of course. It's pretty silly. And that's as far as the story goes. There are various monster types and tiers, each with different tastes, wants and needs. Fulfill what they want and their satisfaction goes up and their stats are boosted too. Eventually your monsters grow more powerful and fight more powerful enemies. Typical game structure you'd expect.But this isnt just a tower defense game. What makes the game special really, is the ""Sims"" aspect of it. After all, the monsters arent staying to fight, they need to make a living too. You can keep informed on a plethora of small things like what each monster is doing, see how they're doing, where are they, their jobs, occupation and their activities. Monsters can also sleep, eat, play, even find partners, make love and bear babies. Don't bother thinking on how monsters like skeletons are even capable of reproducing, they just do. On the more important aspect of gameplay, Unholy Heights does disappoint me slightly with how the game turned out. Controls are a little frustrating to deal with, such as when trying to select a specific monster. Combat isn't so refined and in fact, feels unfair given how the only control you have over the monsters is to retreat or attack.  The 2D platform also gives rise to limitations and cheap exploits, like cornering an enemy and glitching the AI to be indecisive on which direction to attack. Many things are also based on luck and coincidence and this is where things can sometimes get a little frustrating. You could wait for countless hours and still not have some of your monsters refusing to give birth. The monsters freely entering and exiting the house whenever they like is another thing that sucks. Get into a battle but your useful monsters just happen to be away? You're deadmeat. About to get into battle but your useful monsters decide to leave the house half-way in? You're deadmeat. Or what annoys me the mos: when some of your weaker monsters suddenly return back home during a battle. Sometimes they're stacked in a row stretching so far away, you cant even see them on the screen. If they meet a more powerful enemy head-on, you're helplessly screwed.In Unholy Heights. everything runs down to what matters most: Money. Money is generated primarily from rent income, but this makes for easy exploiting. Get a stable income and just wait in-game without doing anything for hours and you'll find yourself rich automatically, although this will put you at odds with a few monster types.All in all, regardless of a few problems... most of which I'm probably just nitpicking at, this game is actually pretty darn great. It doesn't exactly feel fun but like any decent casual game, it can definitely be addicting to play. Almost too addicting for me. Perhaps it's the simplicity of the game, or how you can just lay back and do nothing while watching your monsters live their lifes, have sex everyday and make babies.			"

												A unique take on tower defense.  Each type pf monster has different abilities and they become stronger by keeping them happy.  You can also breed them for offspring with higher stats. Some monsters don't get along with each other so you will probably find yourself playing through the first time without even seeing them all. This leads to replayability as you can try out different combinations. Cute graphics and a sense of humor round this out into a game well worth the $4 price tag.  "

												This game is honestly a bargain. Though tower defence has never been my preferred choice, this game balances it well. The management style is simple, but that's all it needs to be - pick a couple of specialty races, cater to them, and keep the money flowing. There isn't a great deal of depth, but Unholy Heights provides the vindictive satisfaction akin to Roller Coaster Tycoon series, ie ""No one complains about my apartment complex; to the front line battling witches with you!"". My only real complaint is the early stage of game is quite tedious, but that problem goes away when you unlock better units and furniture. If it's on sale and you want 10-20 hours of fun, snatch this one up.			"

												Unholy Heights is a tower defense type game with a unique twist. Apparently you are the devil who is managing an expanding apartment. Human thieves, wizards, martial artists and other wannabe heroes will charge towards your apartment to try and steal your money. How heroic.Apparently your apartment is well-known among cute monsters and demons from around, since they will come to your apartment looking to move in. Some more picky than others.Once they move in you can ask them to fight off human invaders whenever they attack.Dealing with these tenant however can be demanding, depending on the amount of rent you charge per room they may be satisfied or not. They also ask you for furniture and equipment all the time. Apparently these demons, while having jobs, are incapable of buying any furniture themselves, so they just complain to you. Maybe they are just too lazy to move that stuff in.A lot of the furniture they require can be quite unusual, but considering that these aren’t your nice grandmas next door, that is to be expected.To pay for these outrages furniture requests you will have to wait for the tenants to pay rent every day or do quests, which involves groups of humans attacking your apartment.Some tenants will stop paying rent over time for various reasons and if their debt gets too big they might also flee in the dead of night.The game shows you what kind of jobs your tenants have whenever you hover over one, and also shows you what they are doing right now. Since you don’t actually see your tenant doing their jobs (they just leave the apartment), the game designers got clever with the amount and variety of the jobs the tenants can have. The same is true for the activity they are currently engaged in, since you only know they are in their room and you cannot actually see what going on. So you can have a snail creature which has a job as an ice cream truck driver and likes to read up on magic spells in his free time.Potential tenants come and look at free apartments all the time, so there is no danger of running out, however tenants grow stronger over time depending on satisfaction.Families can grow over time too: A apartment shopping person may choose to live with another bachelor tenant and over time these couple may have a child. There are also items that accelerate this progress. This can be important because you only have a fixed amount of rooms but with couple or even families you can double and even triple the amount of tenants fighting for you.There are many different types of tenants and if you treat each group well, stronger tenants of those groups will come to look at your apartment.The controlsceme is easy to use, you can only use the mouse or use the keyboard for some short cuts like speeding up the game and slowing it down.After a short while of learning the interface it works fine, even some of the elements can be slight unintuitive. The graphics are very appealing. Each monster race has cute looking artwork of it walking, waiting, fighting and what have you.The only thing I could really criticize about this game is the auditory side of it. There are hardly any interesting sounds. Seeing as there are all these different kinds of monster, demons, devils, humans and whatnot you would expect some cute sounds to go along with it. However many sounds are reused and the sound really never changes throughout the game. The music is playing the whole game as well, however it is comfortable enough.			"

												If you don't like any of the tags then don't play this game.Otherwise, this game is great. Instead of just watching your tenants ""grow"" each day, you get the satisfaction of actually seeing that growth first hand.This game is pretty casual, as any competant gamer would not lose from a random invasion, and harder invasions are self-triggered through quests. But has enough ""challenges"" to keep the hardcores busy.			"

												Strangely enticing. It has somewhat of an Animal Crossing feel to it, where the overall look and feel of the game is cutesy, and mentally engaging. You play as the Devil, and you've somehow gone and blown all your money. So what does the ruler of the underworld gotta do to make a load of money? Naturally, it's become a landlord. Before long, you'll have monsters moving into your four apartment block, and you'll have to tend to their furniture needs whilst fighting off various 'good guy' types that come to try and thwart your money-making plan. Eventually, things start getting a tad busy - you begin to have multiple floors in your block, and tougher invaders will start showing up. I found myself truly exploring my devilish side when this started happening - monsters that live in your apartments have the capacity to skip out on the rent you set for them, and I thought 'well, if they're not paying up I'll just send them into battle first. And they won't get the furniture they ask for.'. Not before long, you've got lavish rooms that act as bait for 'cannon fodder' monsters - ones that don't seem to do well. From then on, you're in between taking up various challenges from the quest board, and maintaining your monster's satisfaction, since they will gain power based on how happy they are. The concept sounds simple enough, but beleive me Petit Depotto certainly did not skimp out on any detail of this game. Monsters can attract mates, engage in...er..'pillowtalk', have kids, go to work, do the housework, go for a walk, play outside...it's a very clever comedic factor when you click on a room and see one of your monsters are 'reading an erotic fanfiction' or 'sexually harrassing a pop star', and injects a very 'slice of life' feeling into the game: you see these monsters have lives, and fight, and love - you're the Devil, doing his everyday administration. The whole concept is a very cute, 'a day in the life of' thing, and is bound to put a smile on your face when you play it.  The music alone leaves me grinning at the monitor like an idiot. Overall, this is creativity in indie gaming to the maximum - a solid, novel twist on the tower defence type game and beautiful to experience. The art is like it's straight out of a picture book and envelopes the player with warmth, but when the going gets tough, you gotta be prepared to flex your brain muscles. If you're a fan of action-micromanagement games like Plants vs. Zombies and Recettear, then this is for you.			"

												Can't really say much about this sadly. It's an interesting cute concept with good application. Difficulty ramps up fast but doesn't feel unfair (though monsters you tell to retreat will sometime spontaneously gain minds of their own), though that said your residents will often run off to do other things (work, hit the mall, goof off) which can make quests very very difficult to time since your enemies will come whenever they damn well please whether your friends are there or not.Ultimately the game's long and drones on past the point where the idea remains novel. It's a cute little game, but far from extraordinary and too difficult to be a casual enjoyment. But it isn't bad either. Game's still well put together for as much as that's worth, soundtrack is peppy and carefree as is the humor and there are a bunch of different species of tenant which welcome different play styles from the ""protect your customers"" to ""going through tenants like tissue paper"" and both can work out well. If you enjoy Sim like games, with a slight RTS tower defense twist, you might enjoy this game. Can't say much else.			"

It's challengeing and fun to play , the monsters are cute, and i like reading what they are up to on their status even if sometimes they do odd things in their homes lol. I had to start another game after i got the hang of it but the second game progress is going well. Learned from my mistakes i made in the first round. There are plenty of save spots which is nice too in case you need to save before you do a mission that has three rounds and your monsters go off and go to work on the third round and your sitting there with no help fighting at all. I learned to start rounds when they come home at night time or after the sun goes down. Game is fun and i enjoy playing it, i can multitask while i play too like that.			"

There's also an interesting element to their apartment furnishings driving their xp gains.

												You grow attached to some of the monsters that move in. You take care of them, buy them furniture, watch them fall in love, see their family grow. Then when the mother and father die in combat, you raise their child up to live a cold, harsh life of war and death, as their friends and lovers die. Its only life they know. The only life they can know.It's pretty fun.			"

												This is one of my favorite tower defense games I've played in a long time.I bought this game with little knowledge about it after being taken away by the artwork. Now, I find this to be probably the best buy I've ever made on steam. For a game you could play for hours on end, It's a total steal to buy it for 4 bucks not on sale.~~~~~10/10Would play as Satan being a hotel manager again.			"

												Dear ♥♥♥♥ this game is all sorts of cute! Worth every cent! I mean it. Every. Last. Cent! You are The Devil and for some reason you decide that you want to buy an apartment complex. So you do so and demon creatures eventually see your ad on the message board and either want to move in or don't. The ones that move in want certain things to keep them happy and will fight for you if ever your apartment complex comes under attack. Sometimes in order to get a certain type to move in, you have to deck out an apartment with things they love while other times you have to kick them out when they decide to stop paying rent. I know it sounds tedious but it's really not. It's simple, fun, and the battle music is kawaii desu! Yes I just went Otaku right there. You listen to that battle theme and tell me it's anything but. :P All in all, this game has a mega thumbs up from me. Play it, love it, rinse and repeat!			"

												Not a bad little game, not at all. It's well worth the price and has plenty of (admittedly grind-y) content.You start off with a little run down apartment building which can house five tenants and their potential families. You are landlord Satan (can you blame me for the pun), and it's your goal to upgrade the building, bleed your tenants as dry as you can, and eventually conquer the world. But that takes both money AND reliable tenants. By reliable, I mean they must not only pay rent on time, but also be capable of defending the complex from human would-be-heroes. Combat is very much tower-defense if instead of ""towers vs. advancing units"" it was just ""units vs. units."" Each potential tenant has different abilities: the centaur is an archer, the skeleton is a melee, there's a snail with a house for a shell that launches rockets (don't ask)... What's more, to unlock more units you have to please the various factions each unit belongs to. The undead like repeated victories in combat, demons like it when you send people to their pointless, cannon-fodder deaths, chimera appreciate it when you make sure everyone's happy... Some of these factions conflict in what they like, too, meaning you're going to have to pick which faction to hedge your bets on.Though the name pool for your tenants is surprisingly limited (I saw a lot of repeats), you'll find yourself getting pretty attached to some of the families in your apartments. Couples can have children, and children can grow up to be adult monsters as well. Your single tenant can potentially grow into a family of three of the same unit. As a plus, the more working adults are within the family, the higher rent they can pay, plus the easier it is for them to work their way out of debt, meaning you usually won't have to evict them.The only cons of this game from what I've played of it are the grinding (can take a long time to grind up needed gold so you can invest in good apartments/expand them) and how easily it is early on to be susceptible to full wipes. If you've just started the game and are getting frustrated, my advice is 1) do the water witch quest after upgrading the apartment for the first time, 2) make sure to net a couple demihumans, they pay higher rents, and 3) don't feel pressured to take quests you're not ready for. This game is a slow burner, and if you try to rush through it it burns you in return.In the end, this game is simple enough for a time waster yet complex enough to be enjoyable. It's well worth full price, and if it ever goes on sale for less, that's a steal. I definitely recommend it to anyone, unless you're just really, really impatient, in which case this game might not be for you.			"

												A fun, quirky, semi-casual game that combines a sort of tower defense mechanic with a simple apartment management simulation.

												This is a tough one. The game itself is pretty solid for what I assume it's trying to be. But the obvious problems are the lack of depth and unless you spend a signifigant amount of time amassing money, the difficulty curve. However the price tag on this is minimal, so if you got the patience required and want something quick, silly and cute to play for a while, this one might do the trick.			"

												This game is amazing. It is an appartment simulator combined with a sort of RPG. You can have many species of unholy creatures, such as undead, Elementals, ETC. And different races of them as well. You can fight humans to get gold, do quests to get gold, raise their rent to get gold, get gold (if you know what i mean). Its very fun, but the only part that kind of annoys me is the constant need for extremely expensive things. Lets just say you have 8 appartments filled with 2 monsters each. Most of them want pretty expensive things, so if you dont get them soon, their satisfaction will go down and want something else, but besides that, its awesome. Plus, this game is 4$ i mean, doesnt get any better. 9/10 Would be 10/10 if it wasnt for that satisfaction thing.			"

												Super simple, super fun. If you're into management games, and strategy, pick it up. Some issues with the saved games disappearing though, and...I had a pretty big issue with not being able to get any of the demi-human class at all aside from the first one, since I played a lot of demons early on, and even with hours and hours of effort specifically trying to get even ANY of the demi-humans, I was still unable to get them, which was really disappointing, and considering the most powerful class in the game is a demi-human, it was a bummer. I think it's a bug with the ratings system, but nobody ever made an effort to fix or patch it. Still, an enjoyable game. Hopefully someone fixes the bug.			"

It's one of those games that doesn't seem like much at first, but if you're like me and easily drawn in by simple mechanics that are easy to master in concept, but challenging to execute in a real time environment? You'll love it. You'll spend a lot of time fast forwarding, and you'll get frustrated at first when the various heroes attack your apartment building and kill off some of your favorite tenants, but all in all? A very worthwhile gaming experience. I'd rate it 7/10.			"

But the world hates you and thats why you get attacked all the time. So you use your monsters to defend you building. After that it's time for them to pay the rent ;DIn the beginning it might seem too simple, but as the game goes on, it will get funnier over time. (especially when you read, what your monsters are doing all the time...) It takes a lot of strategy to defend the building against your enemies in the end.People who play tower defenses a lot might like this game.My tip for this game: try to get all the achievements ;D			"

												I'm mostly someone who doesn't like cutesy games, but Unholy Heights oozes charm and has an imaginative premise (you are literally a landlord from Hell). It's a fairly relaxing game to play: you just manage your tenement, doing home improvements to keep present tenants happy and selecting new tenants that will be able to help defend the housing complex from interlopers. Gameplay isn't deep by any means, but it's entertaining and the goings-on of your tenants are a fun element.			"

												A fun casual sort of tower defense game but with a unique premise. You play as the Devil who decides to become a landlord one day, when in truth, you're planning to conquer the world. How? By tricking monsters as your tenants annd turning them into your personal army of soldiers of course. It's pretty silly. And that's as far as the story goes. There are various monster types and tiers, each with different tastes, wants and needs. Fulfill what they want and their satisfaction goes up and their stats are boosted too. Eventually your monsters grow more powerful and fight more powerful enemies. Typical game structure you'd expect.But this isnt just a tower defense game. What makes the game special really, is the ""Sims"" aspect of it. After all, the monsters arent staying to fight, they need to make a living too. You can keep informed on a plethora of small things like what each monster is doing, see how they're doing, where are they, their jobs, occupation and their activities. Monsters can also sleep, eat, play, even find partners, make love and bear babies. Don't bother thinking on how monsters like skeletons are even capable of reproducing, they just do. On the more important aspect of gameplay, Unholy Heights does disappoint me slightly with how the game turned out. Controls are a little frustrating to deal with, such as when trying to select a specific monster. Combat isn't so refined and in fact, feels unfair given how the only control you have over the monsters is to retreat or attack.  The 2D platform also gives rise to limitations and cheap exploits, like cornering an enemy and glitching the AI to be indecisive on which direction to attack. Many things are also based on luck and coincidence and this is where things can sometimes get a little frustrating. You could wait for countless hours and still not have some of your monsters refusing to give birth. The monsters freely entering and exiting the house whenever they like is another thing that sucks. Get into a battle but your useful monsters just happen to be away? You're deadmeat. About to get into battle but your useful monsters decide to leave the house half-way in? You're deadmeat. Or what annoys me the mos: when some of your weaker monsters suddenly return back home during a battle. Sometimes they're stacked in a row stretching so far away, you cant even see them on the screen. If they meet a more powerful enemy head-on, you're helplessly screwed.In Unholy Heights. everything runs down to what matters most: Money. Money is generated primarily from rent income, but this makes for easy exploiting. Get a stable income and just wait in-game without doing anything for hours and you'll find yourself rich automatically, although this will put you at odds with a few monster types.All in all, regardless of a few problems... most of which I'm probably just nitpicking at, this game is actually pretty darn great. It doesn't exactly feel fun but like any decent casual game, it can definitely be addicting to play. Almost too addicting for me. Perhaps it's the simplicity of the game, or how you can just lay back and do nothing while watching your monsters live their lifes, have sex everyday and make babies.			"

												A unique take on tower defense.  Each type pf monster has different abilities and they become stronger by keeping them happy.  You can also breed them for offspring with higher stats. Some monsters don't get along with each other so you will probably find yourself playing through the first time without even seeing them all. This leads to replayability as you can try out different combinations. Cute graphics and a sense of humor round this out into a game well worth the $4 price tag.  "

												This is nice.It's a 2-d tower-defence/apartment management game, where you're renting out apartments to fantasy monsters. The gameplay consists of waves coming after you and trying to take your stuff, to which you respond by knocking on the doors of your tenants to get them to fight for you. As you do. The Art is nice and cute, the music keeps you in the moment without being grating, and the gameplay loop is so satisfying it's hard to put the game down once you start. The variety of monsters is another high point. There are your basic elementals, monsters and skeletons, but also Succubi, furries, antropomorphic animals and even the Great Old Ones themselves. Also chicks (of the chiken variety). You'll have to play through the game multiple times to see all of the monsters though, which raises the replay value. The game is just chock full of charm, from the quirky music to your tenant's various jobs and relationships. Your tenants can even fall in love and have kids! (d'aww)It's not the longest game in the world, with a regular playthrough clocking in at well under 10 hours, but as I mentioned there's a fair bit of replay value. It's not an unforgettable experience, but it's a nice, relaxing bit of fun that also scratches a certain kind of itch for cute, but also surprisingly difficult. Recommended for casual and hardcore gamers alike.			"

												This is a tough one. The game itself is pretty solid for what I assume it's trying to be. But the obvious problems are the lack of depth and unless you spend a signifigant amount of time amassing money, the difficulty curve. However the price tag on this is minimal, so if you got the patience required and want something quick, silly and cute to play for a while, this one might do the trick.			"

												This game is amazing. It is an appartment simulator combined with a sort of RPG. You can have many species of unholy creatures, such as undead, Elementals, ETC. And different races of them as well. You can fight humans to get gold, do quests to get gold, raise their rent to get gold, get gold (if you know what i mean). Its very fun, but the only part that kind of annoys me is the constant need for extremely expensive things. Lets just say you have 8 appartments filled with 2 monsters each. Most of them want pretty expensive things, so if you dont get them soon, their satisfaction will go down and want something else, but besides that, its awesome. Plus, this game is 4$ i mean, doesnt get any better. 9/10 Would be 10/10 if it wasnt for that satisfaction thing.			"

												Super simple, super fun. If you're into management games, and strategy, pick it up. Some issues with the saved games disappearing though, and...I had a pretty big issue with not being able to get any of the demi-human class at all aside from the first one, since I played a lot of demons early on, and even with hours and hours of effort specifically trying to get even ANY of the demi-humans, I was still unable to get them, which was really disappointing, and considering the most powerful class in the game is a demi-human, it was a bummer. I think it's a bug with the ratings system, but nobody ever made an effort to fix or patch it. Still, an enjoyable game. Hopefully someone fixes the bug.			"

You have to make the room fit the person who lives in it and decide the amount of rent. You can also help them to make a family!

You'll love it.

They have their own little stories that get formed as you play the game, in which they get married, have children, and sometimes die. Or if you need to raise the demons' opinion of you, they probably die a lot. Anyways, the gameplay is casual and fun to interact with and the major appeal to me is just watching little monsters going about their daily lives while heroes try to beat down your door.			"

DO you want to defend your home, apartment building, against attack humans? Do you like awesome music? If you answered yes to any of these questions then this game is for you! One thing on the negative side, you can start too feel that you have a pretty good tennant army and think you can hold your own through any quest. You'll soon find out that each quest is different and requires different tennants, so be prepared to for some real strategy. Also, the theme song should be available for enjoyment outside of the game ;-)			"

												This game is adorable. A fusion of monster-breeding / tower defence, the cutesy graphics and quirky soundtrack add a touch of whimsy to the game. You basically spend your time managing your growing apartment, earning income to see to the needs of your population of tenants. Each race of tenants has their own demands and even ongoing racial rivalries that will require you to pick and choose who or what you want to stay and adds a touch of replayability. As much as I enjoy the game though, it plays very much like a semi-idle game as some events like breeding, getting a house-mate and even a tenant you want are so random that you sometimes find yourself leaving the game running for hours. This would be okay if the game could run in the background while you do other things like surf or do your homework, but it does not. The feature of the game auto-pausing when the window is not active might ordinarily be a good thing, but in this case it only makes gameplay a little tedious since you become a prisoner of the window. All in all, it makes for an interesting way to burn a few hours, but not if you like multitasking on your computer.			"

												Well, this game is not as simple as it may look like.You have this little monsters, which are moving into your building. But the world hates you and thats why you get attacked all the time. So you use your monsters to defend you building. After that it's time for them to pay the rent ;DIn the beginning it might seem too simple, but as the game goes on, it will get funnier over time. (especially when you read, what your monsters are doing all the time...) It takes a lot of strategy to defend the building against your enemies in the end.People who play tower defenses a lot might like this game.My tip for this game: try to get all the achievements ;D			"

												WARNING: POSSIBLE TIME WARP DETECTED - 5 MINUTES GOING INTO 5 HOURSRight! now the capital letters have your attention. This game is really a weird concept but it works so well. It is sort of a reverse identification game. You play as the bad guys but the bad guys are not bad in a conventional sense they are just a bunch of monsters who want somewhere to live and to have jobs while heroes keep coming to kill them. It is tough being a monster...The game interface is really simple there is not a right lot to click to be honest but there does not need to be the game is a lot about micromanaging aspects of the apartment combined with time managing battles with heroes; when to retreat back in front of the apartment TV and when to go fight.I am really glad I bought this game as it is certainly worth its $4 price tag and I would (despite its simplicity) still have felt satisfied at double the price.Hand on heart I would really recommend this.

												A silly game with a silly premise. A good timewaster for the sales price (1 $), otherwise skip it. Maybe I’m easily amused, but I’ve playing this for a few hours straight now, trying to coax skeleton samurais to pop out a child, and trying to help my demon get laid and have her boyfriend move in with her. That and constantly trying to meet their selfish desires for ever more extravagant furnishing and entertainment systems in order to try and raise the rent some more. The most frustrating thing so far is chasing down delinquent rent payers and try to help them get jobs, or better jobs so I can raise the rents even higher haha.			"

												I started with the demo, but I quickly fell in love with it and bought the full game. It's a really cute game that reminds me of a mix between Tomodachi Life and a tower defense game. All of your tenants are cute monsters that you need to please so they'll fight for you. It's kind of a simple game, but not in a bad way. It's really charming and addicting. I'd definitely recommend this it to anyone that wants a cute, addictive game.			"

This is to running an apartment complex as Harvest Moon was to farming.Can not reccomend more highly.

												This game is adorable. A fusion of monster-breeding / tower defence, the cutesy graphics and quirky soundtrack add a touch of whimsy to the game. You basically spend your time managing your growing apartment, earning income to see to the needs of your population of tenants. Each race of tenants has their own demands and even ongoing racial rivalries that will require you to pick and choose who or what you want to stay and adds a touch of replayability. As much as I enjoy the game though, it plays very much like a semi-idle game as some events like breeding, getting a house-mate and even a tenant you want are so random that you sometimes find yourself leaving the game running for hours. This would be okay if the game could run in the background while you do other things like surf or do your homework, but it does not. The feature of the game auto-pausing when the window is not active might ordinarily be a good thing, but in this case it only makes gameplay a little tedious since you become a prisoner of the window. All in all, it makes for an interesting way to burn a few hours, but not if you like multitasking on your computer.			"

												Grindy as hell, you spent most of your time speeding the game at 3x to get more units and happiness.The 'upgrades' for each room was outright gimmicky. Making tenants happy wasn't an issue at all. Similarly, same thing with the money - You could outright spend a few turns gouging all your tenants of all their cash. Even at the end because I didn't want my tenants to 'run' away, I simply set all the rent to like some horribly low number. Boring game.It felt like every 'important' quest that had to be finished, you would just throw all your guys at the enemy... and when it's all said and done rehire everyone and wait until everyone made babies.Nutshell:Cute graphics and the beginning of the game was ok/fun. Later on was total crap. Glad I finished it. I would not recommend it due to it's grindy and mindless nature.5/10.			"

												Very cute and yet incredibly realistic in many aspects. Think of it this way: If you were a landlord, housing real monsters and treated them as most landlords do, this game would tell the story well. However the question lies: How nice are you to your tenants? That's what really makes the game interesting, and thinking of it that way, I have learned many things from this game:-That Male Succubi are not Incubi but Dickgirl Succubi. 100% capable of having children.-Skeletons are somehow able to reproduce...-That Fishy Ones originally gave birth to the Pul-PymesyScreenshot:

												Unholy Heights is a mix of tiny tower and arena battler.  Pitting your tenants against invading heroes.  It's gameplay is horribly simple, click tenants to move in, click to send them to fight, buy room upgrades, buy hotel upgrades to get more tenants.  It's got a cute charm to it though even with it's simplicity.  It's probably even priced a ltitle high at it's default 4.99 price point, but, for 50% off or more, it's a good buy and will provide you with an adequate amount of entertainment for the cost.			"

												Grade: C+  A rogue-like Tower Defense game with some RPG elements.  The story itself is not very interseting. The monster upgrades are kinda boring... It was nice playing with the tenants and getting what you want, but once you reach end-game there are very few things to look forward to. And the ending is a bit anti-climatic.  The saving grace that kept me from not recommending this game is the monster. They are... lovable... and that's why it's even more heart breaking to see some of them ""dying"" or ""lost"" in the end.  The ending is somewhat randomly generated, and who does what has not much to do with their combat ability or job or how long their family has been in the game without death/eviction. I saw some of my favorite and most powerful tenants died... sigh. All the effort to make everything nice just so the game can slap your face because it can.			"

												As a strategy, tower defense, management simulation, this game is pretty hollow and missing out more options to flesh out the game.  There are better games of this style on Kongregate or Newgrounds.  That said, if you get Unholy Heights on sale, it's worth playing because there is just enough 'je ne sais quois' to keep you entertained for a few hours.  Something about nurturing young love for a couple of monsters; helping them along when they can't pay the rent; and the satisfaction of having multiple generations sacrifice their parents for you.  It's almost as fun as growing Duncan gholas in axlotl tanks and having them die too many times to count.7/10 Would force generations of monsters to sacrifice life and limb to the dark lord again.

												This game is only $4!Within the first day of owning this game, I played it about 12 hours straight through just learning how everything works.  If you watch the trailer, you can instantly see how adorable this game is, although the trailer doesn't exactly show how perverted your tenants are going to be.This game is an independant release from Japan, that got translated and ported over through steam.  It plays out like a silly tower defense game, as well as an apartment and romance simulator at the same time.  The happier your tenants are, the stronger their stats will be for you to fight through waves of enemies.  Battles in this game takes a unique twist as you can knock on your tenants doors to summon them to fight, which you can use to micro them to stop the people invading your apartment without getting everyone killed.Unholy Heights actually has endless replayability as there are actually leaderboards in this game to challenge others in fastest game completion time.  The game only progresses when you go through the main storyline missions, and since there's repeatable quests, you can actually prolong any part of the game if you just want to breed monsters or customize rooms since you collect rent money.The rent system is kind of dumb though, as a lot of the monsters will inexplicably run out of money, no matter if they are unemployed or have a job as a CEO.  You don't get THAT much money from rent, even at end game, but it does build up over time, and it does give a different method of earning money if the current quests are too difficult for you.Either way, this game is a steal at $4 from its humor, graphics, music, and gameplay, and I reccomend everyone try it out if they want something cute and fun to play for a few hours! :3			"

												Unholy Heights is a simple tower defense game. It focuses on you, as the devil, renting out apartment spaces to other monsters that just want to live a normal life but are constantly attacked by people. The art design really caught my attention when I decided to play this game. However, that alone was not able to sustain my interest.-Lack of customization. It'd be great if you could change the aesthetic look of the apartment to your liking. It'd also be great if you can look into each individual room and arrange the furniture. Instead, we're stuck looking at the outside view of the apartment.-Monsters grow stronger only if they are satisfied with their room. There should be more options available than this.-Battles are random encounters with unsatisfying rewards.-If you're being attacked and some tenants aren't there because they're at work or school, then it makes it more difficult for you. Without a lot of depth in monster growth and gameplay, it's frustrating.-There needs to be a time system in game. I don't know when my tenants leave or when they come back. It would help greatly in planning when to do quests. -Progress is random. You don't know when your tenant will get a spouse or a raise at work. Sometimes, it took long for me, sometimes it only took me a few minutes.-Quests are very boring. There aren't any unique quests other than defeating enemies. -There's no way to heal your tenants. When you get couples, they spend so much time doing ""pillow talking"" and it reduces their health. With this occurring randomly, it's difficult to plan out random encounters or doing quests.-The siren is loud, annoying and unnecessary.-Realistically, the more time you put into the game, the more successful you will be. Most of the game is random and there's no strategy to it like other tower defense games.I'm disappointed because I expected a lot from this game. There was so much potential that was not utilized. If you enjoy casual gaming, then this is definitely a game for you. If you want a game that has depth in gameplay, I suggest looking somewhere else.			"

												It begins fun but seriously outstays it's welcome. Why?You build up, but the game doesn't change. Managing the rent of 4 tenants every 2 minutes is fine, even 8 tenants I can live with. But then it's 12... then 16.You will realise eventually that tenant X deals best with hero Y which gives you an edge next time you fight. But you can't just shift people homes so you're stuck with the initial order. Well, you can move but it's very costly since the tenants don't take the goods with them and you can't transfer the goods manually so you'll have monster X unhappy until you sell all monster Y's goods then rebuy their own and vice versa.Now with the above in mind, the heroes become VERY strong which makes battles difficult. They'd be manageable if there was a pause button, but you can't pause it to micromanage so while you're dealing with heroes on one level, your monsters are returning home (effectively flanking the heroes) and dying because you're focussing on the front monsters not dying.You can't ""level up"" the tenants either, the weather can affect their stats as can living near a creature they hate I believe, but not being able to level up makes the game much more difficult too.I paid $4 for it and I'd say that is about the right price point for what I got out. I would give it 5/10. If the game stopped after three floors and added a pause button it could even push up to 6 or 7/10.			"

Eventually booted into safe mode to get rid of it. Steam refused to give me a refund despite requesting it ten minutes after purchase because by the time they got to my request, I had been ""playing"" for six hours. So, uh, yeah, I don't recommend purchasing this game, at least from here.			"

I'm not sure if there is any actual way to heal them between battles, as whatever life regeneration they autonomously engage in takes about nineteen hours.What little jolliness this game could have had wholly evaporated when, after the first boss, an invincible knight suddenly appeared and one-shot all my inhabitants (with a piercing AoE attack) without taking any damage.Not worth it for the $2 sale price.

												Surprisingly fun tower defense game with a different twist, you rent to tennants and they fight for you, get killed, fall in love (two in one room), have a child (three in one room), and pay you rent (more for upgrades).  At first it was a little odd, then I really got into it.  It is definitely a casual style, and you can control the pace mostly, and can save and load as much as you want.  The mouse controls work really well.  I ended up playing it for 4 hours on the first day. [4/5]Runs great on my Windows 10, Alianware Alpha, no crashes or technical issues.  I run it on a 1080p TV, and I use the full screen mode in options.  Note that the highest resolution option (default, and less than 1080p) cuts off some of the screen when in full screen mode, so you just bump it down a notch, set to full screen, and it stretches to fill the entire screen.

 Unholy Heights  is a very casual game, but then I've come to realize how serious it was when my baby Pip was born... Everything changed from there and I've done my best to protect him and his Cheepy family. I am proud to say that my boy Pip is well grown and now stronger than his parents. Aside from that, this game is a very interactive ""tower defense"" kind of game.  Tower  as in tenants, meaning the monsters living within the rooms. Every monster is different in its own way including their attack, defense, satisfaction, as well as emotions. They all have different names, but sometimes you'll stumble upon a few with same names. From my own experience,  once you build the second floor, it becomes pretty hard. So think about what preperations are needed to be made before moving on to the next quest to expand your building.

												Surprisingly fun tower defense game with a different twist, you rent to tennants and they fight for you, get killed, fall in love (two in one room), have a child (three in one room), and pay you rent (more for upgrades).  At first it was a little odd, then I really got into it.  It is definitely a casual style, and you can control the pace mostly, and can save and load as much as you want.  The mouse controls work really well.  I ended up playing it for 4 hours on the first day. [4/5]Runs great on my Windows 10, Alianware Alpha, no crashes or technical issues.  I run it on a 1080p TV, and I use the full screen mode in options.  Note that the highest resolution option (default, and less than 1080p) cuts off some of the screen when in full screen mode, so you just bump it down a notch, set to full screen, and it stretches to fill the entire screen.

												As simple as it is, it's a fun game. Very few mechanics, but still allow for enough choice to make interesting. The room furniture is a bit repetitive and boring - just spend money to give them what they want. I'd improve it by adding more bonus-giving furniture so you could specialize apartments for specific styles and not just give them what they ask for to keep them happy.			"

												imagine a tower defense game where all of your towers only fire when they feel like it, or all of your towers just leave right before every battle leaving you defenseless... well imagine no more, that horrible concept already exists, and its called unholy heights. this game attempts to combine time management with tower defense, and fails miserably at both. i know that it looks like a bit of fun in the preview vids, and for the price of only one dollar it seems like a good by right?.. WRONG! spending that dollar on a McChiken sandwich and then enduring the diarrhea that followed would be better time management. i spent a dollar on this game.. and i feel absolutely robbed.. i made sure to add these devs and all their games past and future to my ""never buy or support"" list. well.. back to the forest.. you know.. a game that works.. and is good.

In order to make money and expand your apartment, you take quests in which heroes will invade you. You then send out your guys in your chosen order like a 2d defence game to best utilize the strengths and weaknesses of your demons. If that interests you then this game is definitely worth it.			"

												Unholy heights is a tower defense game where you manage an apartment of monsters. Your monsters must defeat the human forces that pass by.To defeat humans you must rent apartments to monsters. The monsters will help you defeat the humans and pay the bills. There is a large variety of monsters both in design and power. The best monsters also have the worse drawbacks. To beat the game you must know when to use each monster.You must occasionally buy items for monsters to make them happy. A happy monster is a stronger monster. Each type of monster has different needs. Fortunately the monsters tell you what they need and you just have to buy those items to make them happy. Some items are generic and may be useful for special purposes, like increasing the number of monsters, replenish health or cure diseases.It is a fun, addictive and original tower defense game. Recommended to pass time.Pros: - Very adictive. - Graphics and music make you happy. - Good selection of monsters with varied powers, drawbacks and needs. - Good selection of items. - Good selection of enemies.Cons: - Could have better graphics. - No Unholy Heights 2?

												This game is ****ing sad as hell.  One night, my friends and i decided to take turns managing this little apartment complex every in game day.  We went through a rollercoaster of emotions watching out favorite tenants die, and grow through life.  We budgeted eachother to spend on his favorite tenant, and always were trying to find new monsters to live in our house.  Things took a turn for the worse around the 3rd quest.  The witches tore through our defenses, but we hung on.  Every wave that we survived made us cheer aloud.  We hung on for such a long time until the final wave came, and slaughtered all of our tenants.  This game is definitely worth the money, and even more worth it on sale.			"

												This game is amazing.On my first game, I ended up creating an entire floor of chimerae (Wolfguys, to be exact), and I rushed through missions. However, when I expanded my hotel, and the ""Legendary Hero"" came rampaging through, I sent out all of my wolfmen to fight him. They died pretty quick. I got upset and restarted the game. This time, I realised Wolfguys sucked, they had a good attack stat, but horrible defense, making them extremley weak. So instead of making the same mistake, I went with Abyssals. All of my little fish dudes (And Dudets) won so much, they became my main monter for defense. However, when I came near the later quests moving towards my third expansion, they lost their power. I was losing fishies left and right, one house lost their baby, another their father. I desperately sent them on a ""new monster"" mission, hoping for someone to replace them. To my surprise, I found just what I needed. I had found the Boneymusha. A type of undead monster I had saved my fishies! I moved my remaining abyssals to the second floor, and got 5 Boneymushas for my first floor. I gave them some time to find partners and train, then I sent them on their first quest. THEY DOMINATED. With their overall balanced stats, they dealed large amounts of damage while taking only little amounts of it themselves. and so here I am right now, on the third floor, still using Boneymushas. Let's see how much longer they can last.With my little story done, lets actually review the game.Gameplay: The gameplay is basically like it states, a hotelmanagement and towerdefense game. You need to manage your hotel to get monsters to rent your rooms, which leads to the part where the monsters renting your rooms can also be called on to beat up some stupid adventurers attempting to steal money from the Devil (The owner of the establishment, aka the player.) This cycle continues, with you being able to recruit more monsters depending on how much they like you, which is determined by a few factors I won't explain. In retaliation to your stronger monsters, quests will become increasingly harder, with better adventurers and better bosses. I'm not quite sure when (or if) the story ends, as I haven't actually found that point yet.Replayability: To me, this game is quite fun. From personal experience, I've replayed this game 2 times. you can see it as a tiny bit of trial and error, because if you do choose to restart the game, you most likeley know taht one monster is more effective than the other, and will yield better results. This also applies to the fact if you're like me, and you restart because all of your monsters die, you know which battles you should and should not fight (Rest in peace, wolfies).Conclusion: This game is very unique, i've never actually seen anything else like it. I think what led me to buy it was it mixed 2 of my favorite game genres ever- TowerDefense and Management games. This game feels very nice to play, with it's calm music, and creative situations. The game can be a bit challenging at times, when you can't get your monsters to pay rent, or your main fighting force is no longer able to destroy as well as it used to, but you get through. You find new monsters, evict those pesky deadbeats for better monsters, and you kill those heroes!8.8/10			"

You'll find yourself growing attached to the monsters you move in, guiding their lives through furniture purchases, cheering when they find a mate, celebrating when they have children, feeling horrible when you accidentally let one of the family members die....It really is a rollercoaster of feelings with this little game.

												Unholy Heights is a surprisingly addicting game. You start with nothing, and you must not only attract tenants to gain money, you must also balance the various monsters based on their usefulness to you and to each other. There is a lot of complexity for what appears to be a simple game. You will play for hours and hours, go away for a while, and then find yourself pulled back by new ideas for different tenant combinations.  "

 A great game, but its life simulation features are somewhat stronger than its tower defense ones  Probably one of the only games like it, as there are no apartment managment/tower defense games I know. Finding the new monsters and discovering how they fight, plus playing Barbie landlord was fun. It has some replay value, although not a lot because you can only befriend about 5 out of 7 species per playthrough. This game tries to have some depth to the combat, having some species be stronger in certain weather conditions and the positioning of the rooms, but falls short because all the strategy could be avoided with grinding. Grinding comes in the form of having your tenants find lovers and make powerful babies. This is achieved by waiting for things to happen. Waiting for your monsters to heal, waiting for your tenants to find a lover, waiting for them to have a baby, waiting for the baby to grow up and start its own family... Zzzzz... If this game ever has an update or gets a sequel(which is unlikely, but i hope it happens), I believe they need to make a few changes: Having monsters heal faster, more enemies appearing in the idle time when you're on no quests, reputation for abysaals easier to improve, and having consumables be more effective. Basically, more things need to happen, and faster.  Sometimes it feels like one of those clicker games   where you just keep tapping until you save enough for upgrades. I know that this is also an apartment managing game, but even then that part of the game feels slow and uneventful. Also some things need to be explained better. The item explanations are vague and I only know of about 4 of them proven to be useful. This game tries to accomplish 2 very different things at the same time. It does do a decent job, but both the tower defense and the simulation part both come off as shallow. Sometimes this game felt a little  too  much like a simulation game and not enough like a tower defense one. A good chunk of the game is waiting for your monsters to heal and create relationships while only occasionally fighting off enemies.Although I criticized Unholy Heights a lot,  I still a blast with it.  This game is hilarious. It shows you what the monsters are doing at the time, their jobs, how they feel, and what they think of you. All species even have their own catchphrases. My favorite is the one-eyed devil's catchphrase: ""wink"". Breeding takes a while, but once you get good enough stats on your monsters, you feel like a badass because  you can defeat the main boss of the game super early with a little Cheepy.  I highly recommend Unholy Heights to anyone looking for funny little sim game with some combat.EDIT: formattingAlso, I just found a crappy f2p mobile app made by the same person based off of this game if you're interested.
