												DO NOT buy this game. It is a multi-player game that claims to have a solo campaign. The solo campaign are challenges like an extended tutorial. So what is this game? A turn based strategy like a complex game of chess with a board where you either destroy crystals or the other players to win the match.Why is multiplayer bad? Because it is turn based, you finish your turn and then wait for the other person to complete their turn. How long does that take? Could be one minute, or it could be hours or days. In fact there is an achievement if you take 24 hours to make a turn. Rewarding someone for wasting someone else's time is never a good thing. To compensate for this, you can play a lot of games at once. Like chess via mail. I was so bored playing this game that I literally opened up another game to play it as I waited for people to perform their turns and get back to me.When you start a match, you select from one of your owned factions. You start with humans and TF2 factions when you own the game. Then if you want the other races like Elves, Dwarves, Shaolin and Tribes, its $5 each. Each faction has its own characters that play differently.			"

												With a ridiculous amount of hours on record this is the most addictive game in my library.  It is NOT pay to win as another reviewer has written. Strategy is key to victory here, not cash.  If you think this game is pay to win then you obviously haven't put in the patience required to learn each team's strengths and weaknesses and adjust your strategy accordingly.  There are additional teams that one CAN purchase if they wish, it doesn't matter if you choose not to though, as all of the teams (although quite unique) are exceptionally well balanced.The game can be a bit buggy.. eg. Sometimes you're greeted with a blank board and it's neccessary to refresh the game state before the pieces appear.  This is probably one of the unfortunate side effects of being a cross-platform game.  The strategy involved is on par with chess, perhaps not as rich as some players would like (It's no Magic The Gathering). Some people complain that players are not forced to move within a time limit. I happen to like this feature of the game as I can leave the game minimized while I am working and take my turn when I am ready. In spite of it's minor short comings, Hero Academy succeeds in providing interesting and engaging turn-based strategy game play, which if you're a fan of such games you know there are far too few of them on the market.

												Hero Academy is a great idea, and was really fun at first. I played a solid 10 hours on release and had a pretty good time battling with my friends.Even if you aren't playing with your friends, the internet multiplayer option allows for quick and seamless matchmaking, meaning you can play as and when you want.However, a few specificities of the game kind of ruin it. By default, the opening ""move allowance"" is set to be unfair against the person who creates the game, meaning that very very option (unless manually de-selected) your opponent (or you) will have a +3 or -3 move advantage, which very much affects the late stages of the game when every move counts.This, for me, tilted the tables. I no longer felt I was playing a game, I felt I was inadvertantly cheating. Since then, I haven't played anymore.A good game, but tweaking required for it to be fair. But, if you tweak your settings, you need to rely on your opponent doing so as well (which, by the way, they wont).Nilesy			"

												Now don't get me wrong here, this game is fine.  It's just different from what I expected.When I bought this game I was expecting some cool things like missions, custom games, and multiplayer.  Heck, maybe a couple different game modes.  Instead, I opened the game and the first thing I get is a tutorial shoved in my face that explains everything I could have figured out in two seconds.  Then it gives me a multiplayer option and a customization option.  Of course, I want to see what I can customize.Originally, you can change your avatar and not much else.  Everything else is DLC.  Actually, everything in GENERAL is DLC.  You want to change your team color? DLC!  You want to play the other three team options?  DLC!  You want to play the mission mode I was ever so hoping for?  DLC!  You want to play the other game modes?  Well there arent any other game modes but if there was that would probably be DLC as well.  So after I realize that I can't play mission mode, I sigh and try to play multiplayer.  Since I enjoy TF2 quite a bit, I decide to go with that team instead of the other one that I have.Well I start playing for like 30 minutes or so and I'm enjoying it.  There is a door at the bottom left with a turn number counting down.  I thought that was the amount of turns you had left before the game ended.  Nope.  It's how many turns you have left before you can surrender.  That's when I realize how LONG these games are.  They are like, really, really long.  Like, REALLY long.  Also, the learning curve is freaking gigantic.  90 minutes in I still don't know what in the heck half of my characters do.  And it seems like the teams you can buy are EXTREMELY overpowered.  I swarmed the guy with soldiers, demos a scout and a medic and in one turn one of his characters walked up and killed 3 of the 5.  It took me 3 turns to kill the character that did the deed.  But in the end, if you have the attention span of a goldfish like me and don't like having to buy DLC to get everything that the game promised I really don't recommend this.  Although if you like games like this, have patience and don't care about money, this game is for you.Oh and one more thing: This game is an iPhone port and feels like an iPhone port.  Fair warning.

												This is not a bad game in its own merits but has some issues. One it's that it feels clunky and slow which is not what one should expect for a mobile game port to PC. Some friends and I have ran into some issues submiting turns. Also it's grossly overpriced compared to the mobile version in which you can get almost all of the same content for half the price. There's not really a single player, only a handful of challenges and the only good way to learn the game is playing online. I did not like the strategy based on 5 actions, instead of every unit getting it's own turn but that's just a matter of taste.			"

Multiple teams/maps/powers and vanity items to select from, Highly recommended if you have people to play against. At the time of this review the game has a low population so random match making is rough, however it's not impossible. Try it out and play me @ WarHybrid			"

												[De-Recommendatoin] Why buy this for 5 dollars... When you can get this on the iOS for free? Aside from challenge mode which are really a small handful of puzzles, you can't play this game alone. You have to versus someone else with it. If you can find a friend you'd love to play or don't mind the ""Find Opponent"" button and all the downtime that comes with it between waiting turns and want the TF2 stuff, then by all means, go get it. There is no 'real' single player. Also, the DLC is essentially buying a new Faction of characters. All the locked content will cost you $15 dollars together. $5 + $15 = $20. That's a scary equation. The gameplay is a dumbed down strategy game similar to Advance Wars or Fire Emblem.Signing up to this game requires an account from Robot Entertainment. So if you have an existing account from them, use the ""Existing Account"" option to redeem your... er..TF2 stuff.The gameplay itself isalright. It's a good 2-pack gift. Just don't buy it alone.			"

Intro & SummaryA quick paced, fast-thinking strategic board game, Hero Academy can be a bit of a mixed bag due to poor marketing/DLC practices, but because of its unique nature and cheap price, it's still a diamond in the rough.HighlightsDeep strategy and competitive leaderboards are available, but it's also very accessible to casual players. It's very solid and concise on the whole.* Options to Start games with your Steam friends, Twitter Friends/Followers and more are very useful and notifications of your game progress work well* Great looking assets and themes, though marketing these as DLC is going too far* Good TutorialMistakesThere's a real problem with the time it can take to play a match, since the fast pace is sometimes half of the fun in Hero Academy. It plays like chess via traditional mail, in that you can wait hours or even days for your opponent to return a move (there's even an achievement to take 24 hours+ to take a turn), which isn't in itself a bad thing because it helps keep it casual enough that you can have 10+ games open at the same time and not have to worry about committing to each, but it would've been so simple to add options to set time-limits and game-closing options to enforce quicker games, which many people want from a game like this.The DLC offers extra teams with avatars, and some include items for TF2 and while the extra content is fairly good, it's still a jarring way to use DLC for most people, especially when it affects people who are not willing to buy the DLC negatively, essentially creating a pay-to-win feel, albeit not entirely in your face.* Selling cosmetics and styling as DLC is fine, but selling teams which affect global gameplay leaves a sour taste for most* No options to play only faster paced games* Annoying Robot Entertainment DRMRecommendationsPriced at between £5.59/7.99€/$7.99 and £12.99/16.99€/$16.99 at the time of review. The nature of this game makes it one of the most replayable games around, and you'll likely continually find yourself coming back to old games.However, it's also available on iOS, and feels a lot more casual on there due to the more immediate nature of PC gamers. It's also much cheaper on mobile and so is probably the better option for many.The DLC offers extra teams with avatars, and some include items for TF2. While the extra content is fairly good and adds a lot if you know your playstyle, it's still a jarring way to use DLC for most people, especially when it affects people who are not willing to buy the DLC negatively, essentially creating a pay-to-win feel.You will probably never use some of the Teams, so if you've never played before, buy the base game only and find out which paid teams you like, if any.

												Great little turn based strategy game.  Supports cross-platform multiplayer so you can play from your PC against people using iPads or smartphones.  The (default) Council team is a great, all around team and when you add in the Steam exclusive TF2 team, you're set to give anyone a run for their money.  The pace is as fast or as slow as you want it to be; you can play multiple games against many different players or just focus soley on one game.  The additional teams add variety to strategy and gameplay and the challenge pack adds tons of single player puzzles with varying difficulties.  Hero Academy really does offer endless hours of play for very little upfront cost.  The Gold Pack is a great deal especially during a Steam sale.  You also get some TF2 hats that are team themed if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												It's a great turn based game, however i can't really recommend it as a casual buy.Don't be fooled, there is no single player mode in this game, except for some little challenges that you do by your own, while waiting for other's turns (that's why those are made for);This game, as you may have figured out, works by turns: you and your random-online opponent do some unit movements or actions within a set amount of possible moves, submit your turn, and wait for the other's one, and vice versa, till someone win the game by destroying his/her opponent's crystals or units.That's it, a simple game, that i like as it is. But, you know, playing with random online people at this kind of game can sometimes ruin your fun... Infact, you won't know WHEN your opponent is going to make their next move, while you had done yours minutes ago (as for me, i tend to play with people that make their turns in a very long period of time, it means they do they move and straight close the game), bringing to the conclusion to find another opponent, hoping that in the while your previous opponent will reply, or that you may find at least a more responsive one.Just this kind of gameplay may ruin the fun of the game, without the freedom to play this as much as you want to, and i would like to play this game more often than ""a single move for each opponent, then swap to other games because i'm done here"".tl;dr: If you want to play this turn-based game, buy it only if you have a friend to play with.

												This game is awesome as hell. I don't regret the investment. Challenging and strategic, fun yet frustrating :DToo bad the people I play with are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and make a move in 2 hours. Like, every one of them takes about 30min-2h to make a move. I think i managed to finish only 2-3 games and surrendered the others because of this.			"

												This game is fun and you can learn right off the bat of the basics of the game, no need for unfair latnacy and most of the people I faced are mostly mobile phone users. You play the game with a lot of players making choices before ending their turn giving you plenty of time to face other oppenets at the same time while waiting for them to make a move which can make the game extremly active worldwide. As of for the support team, they are very active as of 2015 and seem to be hardly busy at times when you are trying to contact them. When I requested an email and in-game nickname change, they respounded very fast til the end of my needs were over.Great game, fun with or without friends, and highly active all times. Though DLC's are kinda demanding prices for a excellent mobile port.8/10I got this game because it had the Team Fortress 2 gang! MONEY WELL SPENT!			"

												I lose at this game all day, I think I've won three games ever, but I keep playing it. Being that it has an iOS version there is always competition, like the words with friends system of matchmaking. Look at this as digital chess with 5 moves per turn, it's a pain to get used to and I've lost games in a move out of nowhere. I'll play this with anyone willing to buy it just to get better, I think I have 1 achievement and for a completionist that is the worst. So I'll waste countless hours with you. Good♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Backed on Kickstarter because it sounded cool and I've backed over 40 games, but this is one of my least favorite of all of them. It plays like a one dollar mobile game, and not even a great one at that. Win some, and lose some, apparently. I thoroughly do not recommend you waste your time with this game. Go play XCOM, Fire Emblem, Valkyria Chronicles, or Advance Wars.			"

												More addictive that I would like to admit. I'm getting feelings like in the 90's when I played Battlechess, which is caused by the fact that simple game mechanics are brought to life using very nice and funny animations. Best played in background while doing something other on the computer, as the turns don't have time limit (like e.g. correspondence chess). Also exists for iOS so it's a solid poop game, too. I suspect that the game (or at least the Linux version, or at least parts of it) is written in JavaScript witch thrills me as a JS developer. The iOS version is most likely in Cocos2d which has a JS port, and a jQuery license is listed among licenses. Achievements don't work on Linux, but besides that I can't find any negatives.Recommended :)			"

												I really like Robot Entertainment, they are extremely hard working. While making the Orcs Must Die sequel, they were also putting the great game on Steam. Although it would be more wallet-friendly to purchase the iOS version. Hero Academy is a turn-based strategy game with asynchronous multiplayer. Steam version gets the very fun Team Fortress 2 team. The asynchronous multiplayer does slow the game to a crawl, but the game itself is designed to play multiple games concurrently. Consider iOS, but expect the same quality with the TF2 team perk.			"

												This game is a $5 version of the free version on iOS. But you do get more avatars and the Team Fortress team that doesn't come on the iOS. That's basically what you pay for when you buy this because the free iOS version is the same game without the avatars and team. The game is pretty fun, but I don't enjoy asynchronous game on the computer, but they work much better on a phone because I can drop in, do my move, and come back at any time because of the convienence of a phone. I don't really play this much on my computer, so yeah, if you're gonna buy this, try it out first on iOS. Sorry, Androiders, I don't think they have it on your phone.			"

												8/10It's a darn fine game, with 6 (and counting) teams to fight in a turn-based grid game. The battles are amazing, and it's like chess except much more advanced. If you're waiting for someone to do their turn, go do some challenges. But battles with players can take days, and it can be very tiresome to do a single battle for days. And if you buy the regular game only, it only gives you one team, and you have to either buy the other 5 teams seperately or by buying The Gold Pack.			"

												Like many other people, I agree it would be great with single-player (besides the Challenges), and the Multiplayer is slow, but it is like that for any game that has a fairly low player base, but when you get a game going, it is worth it, very enjoyable and simple. This game very much follows what many other stratergy games follow: ""Easy to play, hard to master.""			"

												This isn't the only cross-platform (PC, iOS, Android) asynchronous turn-based tactical game but it great one and continues to both enterain and challenge me after move than 500 hours of play (I've spent more time via Android than via Steam)The range of arenas, factions, faction units and special powers are more than enough to provide a depth of tactical options and challenges and when this is combined with human opponents - really the only way to play in my opinion - the longevity is indefinite.I don't pay attention to the online leaderboards or achievements at all, I just find the core game extremely enjoyable. Each turn takes about a minute, less if there is an obvious set of moves to make, more if you have many options to choose from. Some of the frequent choices (dilemnas!) are - > Will you focus on winning by killing all opposing units or by killing crystals . . . and will you pursue a crystal damage lead in order to compel your opponent to make an aggressive move that may over-expose them?> Do you risk applying power-ups to an unit in the early stages of the match, when your opponent still has specials which will enable them to gain a safe-kill?> Do you hold back on your own specials or make use of them to gain an early game advantage?> After downing a unit when your opponent has no healers on the board (which can ressurrect) do you stomp the downed unit or take the risk that they will have a healing option in their hand?> Do you concede balance of power on the board in order to quickly cycle through your deck in order to hopefully draw into your hand a key unit for your intended tactics?There are many more!This is a fantastic ""easy to learn"" and ""difficult to master"" game,			"

Games can last for hours and hours and it saves peoples turns so that if you either lost connection or have to leave for say work or something, the last player's submitted move is saved for when you wish to return to the game.A lot of fun with a lot of tactics in it.

												Not worth it. This game was fun for 15 minutes, i'll give it that, but overall is one of the worst games I own. It says it will give you a hat for tf2, but I didn't get anything. Aside from that, the most annoying thing about this game is that if you want to play a multiplayer match, expect waiting about 5-10 minutes and even up to an hour or two for your opponent to take his turn. The dev team for this game are money ♥♥♥♥♥s. This game is priced about right, don't get me wrong, but if you wanted to buy another 'team' it costs WAY more then you would imagine. This game is not fun. it is a good idea for a game but it was not executed well. Imagine this game as a shoot'n'slash version of chess where you get 5 moves in one turn, but have to wait 5 mins.-2 hrs.+ for your opponent to take his/her turn. Please don't waste your money on this game. For the same price, you could get 2-3 hats on tf2 and buy a REAL chess board game.			"

												I think this game is really fun! I hear complaints about slow games, because it was originally developed for mobile devices; but if you get passed that(and there are some steam groups for faster games), it's a blast. I just treat it like a slow moving game I come back to and every now and then you get a few good plays back to back before you or your opponent quit playing again.It's like some weird version of chess that just comes out fun. I like the TF2 team exclusive to steam players too.The price of the game is a little much IMO, especially as it's free to IOS users(with one team to play), the DLC is also over priced in my opinion, but I got this on sale for 0.99 and should've gotten the extra teams too, but I didn't(wasn't thinking and kinda broke). So if you find this on sale, I say get it. Otherwise realize what you're paying for before you buy.			"

Great art style and periodically updated! As a matter of fact, it's a great game to play while your doing something else entirely!Quick Tip: Don't wait for your opponent to make a move, just play 9 other matches with others so you aren't frustrated with waiting for just 1 player! Now you'll be frustrated less... or more, it really depends on how you look at it hahaha			"

												I think this games is better suited for Ios and Android which is where it came from. Its hard to really get into it when you want to sit down and play it for more than 10 minutes. They should have added some kind of campaign for the PC release. The other paid classes seem to be unbalanced with the original free class as well. You wont run into very many people with those classes but if you do you might as well quit. Its good enough to log on for 10 minutes a day to do the next step in your matches but thats about it.			"

												So... I thought this would be a game of training up your heros and sending them on missions. Unfortunately, it's basically a simplified game of chess. And it's multiplayer only. So not only is there no character development, but you make a move and then wait twenty minutes for your oponent to make his. Oh, and this is a direct port of an iOS micro-transaction game. So while the game only costs five bucks, you only get the most basic squad, and you can't even change your squads color without buying a ""DLC."" ♥♥♥♥ing rubbish.Truth be told, the game's not awful. It's just sort of blah. There's very little to it, and all the above negatives. I certainly won't be buying any of the ""DLC"" (which aren't DLC so much as micro-trans), and I probably won't be playing it much. Sorry Dave, this one looks like a bust.			"

												I think this games is better suited for Ios and Android which is where it came from. Its hard to really get into it when you want to sit down and play it for more than 10 minutes. They should have added some kind of campaign for the PC release. The other paid classes seem to be unbalanced with the original free class as well. You wont run into very many people with those classes but if you do you might as well quit. Its good enough to log on for 10 minutes a day to do the next step in your matches but thats about it.			"

												A fun and addictive turn-based strategy game that is easy to learn, but takes some serious thinking to master. I particularly like that you can have several games going at once, which alleviates some of the tedium of waiting for your opponents to make a move (the challenge DLC also gives you something to do between turns). You should know that the asynchronous nature of the multiplayer means that it could be a full day or even longer before you see the other player's turn (think chess-by-email for comparison), so the actual games could take a while, but the nice thing about the design of the game is that you can play it in short bursts. I also really like that the multiplayer is cross platform against IOS and Android, so the game has a decently sized playerbase. What's even better is that all of your games and DLC transfer over, so a game you've started on PC can be continued on Android, for example. Another great thing is that at least some of the achievements seem to transfer over, as I won a game on android, then when I logged onto Steam, the achievement for winning a game unlocked. Also, the game has an icon in the system tray that alerts you that it is your turn if you leave the game running in the background, which is a fantastic idea. My only gripe is that there is no local multiplayer, as this game seemes like it would be well suited for that.			"

												This game eats a surprising amount of my time. It's a sort of an asychronous turn-based battle deck chess game. 6 different teams available (though you have to buy most of them: go for the Gold Pack), each with with their strengths and weaknesses. It's one of those easy to learn, difficult to master sort of games, with a lot of room for strategy and tactics. Sometimes luck can play a part with the way you and your opponent draw units and items into your hand, but it doesn't feel insurmountable to me. You can start as many games as you want, with friends or strangers, and you'll see a wide variety of skill levels. Give it a try!			"

												Do not get this game.It is fun until the one issue that this game happens and it destroys it forever!The one issue this game has is that this game allows your opponent infinite time to take their turns.  This leads to rage quitting and the limit of 30 games max at the same time locks up your whole queue if you don't conceed to the rage quitters.  I am not normally this competitive, I just hate it when things like this ruin the game all together when it is such a great game besides that fact.  The devlopers will never fix this problem.  I have been waiting 3 years for them to do so and never even heard a peep out of them.  If they do I will gladly start playing this again in a heart beat.  Until then I would never recommend this game.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot ( play this for years on iPhone ). This game was fun but then they stopped adding teams or doing any thing to it for that matter. I'll give this a positive review for the hours of fun i used to have on this game but unless they add more to the game i dont think ill be playing this too much more.Here is idea for a team I made long ago.Team Name - "" Pirates ""Team Bonus - "" Pillage "" - Does 10% more damage to enemy crystals always, walk speed increased by 1 if own crystals health is above 75%Fighter - "" Buccaneer "" (x3) - Can avoid 1 long range enemy attack during each of enemies turnStarting StatsPower : 200 ( Physical )Health : 1000Armor : 10%Magic Resist : 10%Range : 1Walk Speed : 2Shooter - "" Corsair "" (x3) - Does 10% more damage to enemy super unit, if this unit stomps enemy super unit then this units power permanently increased by 50Starting StatsPower : 150 ( Magical )Health : 800Armor : 10%Magic Resist : 10%Range : 3Walk Speed : 3Caster - "" First Mate "" (x3) - Effects target and chains in one directionStarting StatsPower : 100 ( Magical )Health : 800Armor : 20%Magic Resist : 0%Range : 2Walk Speed : 3Support - "" Bosun "" (x3) - Can heal a knocked out ally to 50% if adjacent to the knocked out unit else heals to 100, Can mobilize the power of a premium square by setting a blocker on it while adjacent to the square ( basically she can lay a blocker that has little health down on a premium square and it will stay there until that unit uses it else where, that unit is knocked out, or when an enemy steps on that premium square )Starting StatsPower : 100 ( Physical )Health : 800Armor : 0%Magic Resist : 20%Range : 1Walk Speed : 3Super Unit - "" Captain "" (x1) - At a range of 2 this unit can throw a smoke bomb adding an enemy debuff decreasing all units hit walk speed by 1, This units power is cut in half when at a rangeStarting StatsPower : 250 ( Magical )Health : 1000Armor : 20%Magic Resist : 20%Range : 2Walk Speed : 2Spell - "" Flying Dutchman's Crew "" (x3) - Summons a ghost to haunt a enemy unit making them immobile for for one turn also doing 100 magic damage.Gear: Weapon - "" Runemetal "" (x3) - Permanently increases an ally's power by 50%Gear: Armor - "" Dragonscale "" (x3) - Adds 20% defense and 10% max healthGear: Aux - "" Shining Helm "" (x3) - Adds 20% magic resist and 10% max healthConsumable - "" Rum "" (x3) - Heals unit for 500 and all surrounding units for 200Buff - "" Parrot (x3) "" - For one turn the unit with this equipped can take no damage but also can not move during the next turn, disappears after end of enemy turn ( can still attack )			"

												This is one of those deceptively simple games that is easy to pick up and tinker with but can really hook you with its hidden strategy.  I like to say that this game is like chess, but nerdier.  I play this primarily on my phone and it has been the only game that I've consistently played for years.  Although the community surrounding this game is not as strong as it used to be, and it doesn't sound like it's going to be updated again, if you put in a little effort to discover a few basic strategies for your team I think you'll be pleasantly hooked.

												For such a simple game, it's kind of a glitchy mess...About half the time, when I start up the game, it doesn't log me in, claiming it can't connect to Robot Ent.'s servers, and I'll have to close the game and start it up again. Sometimes a few times in a row.Sometimes, after I make all my moves, I hit submit, and it tells me something like 'Failed to submit turn, please check your connection' (It's definitely not -my- connection). After this happens, no matter how many times I hit submit, it keeps returning the same error. If I click on another match, when I go back to the one with the error, about 1/2 of the time it makes me enter the move again, and sometimes still won't accept the turn submission. And sometimes, when I click on an existing match, the game board will be completely blank as if no one has started the game. If I don't recognize the name of the opponent, if I make my turn's moves and hit submit, it will return the error yet again. If I do recognize it, I know that I have to either go play another match, or restart the game. Sometimes this doesn't fix it. When the game works, it's actually very fun, but these errors happen EVERY COUPLE OF TURNS. Extremely disappointing for a game I've heard so much about and was looking forward to playing. "

												This could be a really great game, but is hindered by some pretty huge balance issues which will never be fixed because it's now abandonware. The company released a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥balance patch around a year ago, and has basically ignored the game since, leaving one team in particular (the last team to be released) in essentially a broken status.While the game *can* be fun, and has some significant strategic depth, there are so many ""luck"" factors and poor balance decisions that the game can hardly be considered ""complete"" in such unbalanced shape, and as stated before, it doesn't look like the glaring problems will ever be fixed.

												This game is one of the best stragerty games I have ever known of. I started off playing this game mobile edition then it announced it was coming to steam and I felt like ""^_^"" since i was so excited about it. Anyways, its a great game. Need more information? Its a online 2d game where you pick a team (you start off with 2 and buy the others) and then your opponent picks one. You summon units to either destroy your enemys crystals, or kill all of their units. Its a turnbased game however, yet this can be useful for if you dont feel like playing a full match and just doing parts of it in more then a day.I reccomend this game to anyone who loves stragety games or online games in general.

												Fairly addicting turn based strategy game.  Each player has a deck of units and abilites based on what race they choose, and 5 action points per turn.  Unit cards can be spawned onto one of two spots on the player's side of the map.  Abilities can be activated on anything that is eligible to recieve the effect.  The object is to destroy either the enemy team, or their two crystals which generally spawn fairly close to the unit spawn tiles.  Each race has different funtions, the Orcs seem to excell at causing large ammounts of damage with combat units but don't have many damaging ability cards, whereas the Team Fortress team relies on using support units to buff the damage dealing units.  All in all the base game at $5 is well worth it, the DLC expansion races seem a little high in price to me, but once they drop to 50% off I'll definitely be grabbing them.			"

The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You can't close it and when you do the battle continues on from where you had left it..Everytime. It's really annoying.I may not know what good features the game might have but that's my opinion....It is not worth that much money for a game like this.			"

What is weakness in the start of the game can turn out to be an advantage. You may not get a healer for a while but it just mean you won't lose your healer in an attack.Very well balanced game. You can buy other teams but all teams are winnable with the right strategy.			"

http://wwagas.blogspot.com.au/Robot Entertainment has delivered many an hours' worth of fun in the form of Orcs Must Die and its sequel, so i had some very high hopes for this title.Hero Academy is an asymmetrical turn based strategy game featuring colourful cartoon style sprites battling each other for dominance of the board. You select the team you wish you use, each featuring their own characters, spells and synergies and then off you go. Board is selected randomly as is your opponent, though you can select from your friends list.Once play commences, each round gives you 5 action points with which to either place a unit, move a unit, attack with a unit, or cast a spell. Units and spells are randomly generated at the beginning of each turn to fill up to a selection of 6 items. Then you submit your turn and await the opponents manoeuvres in return.You can aim to either wipe the board clear of opponents, or try to take out any crystals the opponent has on the board.You can run more than one game at once which is great, and the game will notify you when a turn is ready to play your next round. so you can play this as a quick distraction game with two games running and login once a day or so, or you can start 20 games at once if you want a non stop session.I'm pretty crap at it so far. I quite like it. It's easy to pick up how to play and nothing feels very unfair even given the random nature of the  but i haven't invested the time yet to have developed the skill set to be a worthy opponent. At any rate, I was a bit sold given the pedigree of the developer. I really like their style of art and the animations, they also have a talent for making tight gameplay, apparently across different game types.So far ive had no major dramas, except the occasional server connection issue. I have an odd codec issue on my box when i play but im pretty certain that's gonna be me and my clunky nerdbox more than a game issue.I scored Hero Academy in a Humble Bundle so the price was super sweet, it normally retails on Steam for about 5 bucks (with only two teams) which is well worth it. You can also get a two pack at a discount, to bring along a friend.However, the addon teams are each almost as much as the game itself which actually seems pretty steep. Even though they offer a wholly different experience to each other team, its hard to appreciate the high cost.			"

												Primarily multiplayer game (no unlocks, no campaign, no vs AI; only single player is a collection of win-this-turn puzzles). Requires you to register an account with them beyond steam. I wish I could give half a thumbs up- this game will only be good as long as the servers last and people play it. Replayability is meh- multiplayer is fun for a while but not worth going back to. A game better suited to small devices you can bring to the bathroom for a quick fix. Should also mention that games usually take place over several days unless you play with friends (because you have to both be online at the same time or else turns take a while). You end up starting a bunch of matches and then completing them whenever you two have the time to take turns.			"

												I freakin hate this game.  It's a flash based game which you play with iOS gamers, which means the community is softcore.  You can expect to play a couple of not very fun turns before your trash opponent loses interest and wanders off.  If you start wining forget about it.  Worse you can't set up any turn rules to force the oponent to play.  I've finished play by mail campaigns faster than I got through my first battle in this game.  The only positive is that the gameplay is tedious enough that you won't care when your opponent quits part way through.			"

												A portable yet suprisingly deep game, Hero academy is addicting for about the first 2 weeks. It gives off an Advanced Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Fire Emblem vibe since its a turn-based strategy game similar to chess but in its own twist. All about the gameplay with absolutely no story, this game has some replayability to it...but only if you're willing to pay the extra few dollars for the extra teams. The original team is free but the rest cost about $3, which is ridiculous when that's about the cost for the entire game. It's nice to play when you are totally bored out of your mind at work since you can play this on your phone or ipad, but other than that, why would you play this game at home when you have better quality games on your computer? This game gets a reccomendation from me if you have an iphone or an ipad but as I said before, this game gets pretty boring after the first 2 weeks.			"

The game is a lot of fun, although the teams aren't perfectly balanced.The developers seem to have abandoned ship though, I don't even remember the last time there was an update.

												I love this game, Its not really a game you sit down and play, Its more of a game you leave running in the background while you work / do other things, as you only really play for 10 seconds every few hours, unless you get an opponent on at around the same time as you.Its quite like a weird game of chess, except you place your pieces on the board and have 5 moves, each per turn.With 6 playable races, and 6+ pieces per race it has a huge mix of pieces.  The ""king"" (crystal) is a 1 or 2 unmoving pieces on the board with a large amount of health, but most players protect their crystals and games are won and lost when a player looses all 20 of there pieces.Each faction also has a healer, that can bring pieces back, so there are additional tactical elements, ""stomping"" downed pieces, and protecting healers with higher heath or less valuable (pawns) units. While there are some training missions Its all Player Vs Player, and as such you get a mix of Skilled and UnskilledI run about 10+ games so I always have some moves to play when I open up the game.Some players Make there move instantly (takes about 30 seconds to update) some play a move every few hours/daysYou can replay players and setup multiple games with playersThis game is also an APP on Mobile devices, and you can share your account across them.

												Buyer beware - PVP online only.A fun little strategy game.  It's fairly simplistic but enjoyable.  It's online player verus player only, with no skirmish mode, and I hate that.  Buying it on steam gives you access to two teams, the humans and the Team Fortress 2 team, but there are three others.  Just pray you don't get matched against someone who's paid to unlock the dark elves, you'll lose.That's part of the problem with the game, the racial abilities for some teams are radically overpowered.  Teamfortress2 team has the ability to gain an extra move every time they 'kill' a unit by stomping.  Since each round has 5 moves, adding a 6th is pretty huge.   But the dark elves ability to heal EVERY TIME THEY DO DAMAGE is ridiculously overpowered.  I have played over 30 games so far and I haven't been able to beat the dark elves even once. For $5, if you like strategy games like this, it's definitly fun.  Maybe if you buy the 2 pack and play with a friend, it would be better.			"

												Overall a mediocre port of a mobile game - graphics look good but the UI is touchscreen based and not optimised for PC.Main problems are:1) IAP - seriously, pay more for more challenges?2) No AI - couple decently designed challenges, but can't play against computer (in the challenges, you only move and the computer never moves)3) impossible to finish normal game - problem with PC is that it is virtually impossible to finish a game as nobody wants to play in a decent manner, and people seem to stop making moves when they are losingIf on a super duper sale (like sub $1), maybe ok for an hour of two for playing the challenges, after that, destined to be deleted and never to be replayed.

												This is sort of like chess but with multiple moves per turn, factions that play very differently from one another, and CCG-style luck-based drawing of pieces/items to play.Ok, so not very much like chess. This is probably quite a bit more fun. The luck factor can be quite frustrating at times, causing you to lose a close match when you draw the wrong ""cards"" several times in a row; on the other hand, when your luck is bad and your opponent is strong and you *still* manage to win through sneakiness and misdirection, well, that's a victory to savour.Anyway, been enjoying this a great deal. One of the things this game does right is that your opponent doesn't get to be cheap and refuse to play his turn: you win automatically if the other guy does not play his turn for 7 (or 14) days.(One minor annoyance: I can't seem to find my win/loss% stats anywhere. There's a leaderboard showing us how many games we have won, but that's about it. A table of our greatest rivals (the people we've lost the most times to and/or played the most number of games against) would be nice too.)Bottomline: This is a *really* good 1-on-1 turn-based strategy game. Highly recommended!			"

http://wwagas.blogspot.com.au/Robot Entertainment has delivered many an hours' worth of fun in the form of Orcs Must Die and its sequel, so i had some very high hopes for this title.Hero Academy is an asymmetrical turn based strategy game featuring colourful cartoon style sprites battling each other for dominance of the board. You select the team you wish you use, each featuring their own characters, spells and synergies and then off you go. Board is selected randomly as is your opponent, though you can select from your friends list.Once play commences, each round gives you 5 action points with which to either place a unit, move a unit, attack with a unit, or cast a spell. Units and spells are randomly generated at the beginning of each turn to fill up to a selection of 6 items. Then you submit your turn and await the opponents manoeuvres in return.You can aim to either wipe the board clear of opponents, or try to take out any crystals the opponent has on the board.You can run more than one game at once which is great, and the game will notify you when a turn is ready to play your next round. so you can play this as a quick distraction game with two games running and login once a day or so, or you can start 20 games at once if you want a non stop session.I'm pretty crap at it so far. I quite like it. It's easy to pick up how to play and nothing feels very unfair even given the random nature of the  but i haven't invested the time yet to have developed the skill set to be a worthy opponent. At any rate, I was a bit sold given the pedigree of the developer. I really like their style of art and the animations, they also have a talent for making tight gameplay, apparently across different game types.So far ive had no major dramas, except the occasional server connection issue. I have an odd codec issue on my box when i play but im pretty certain that's gonna be me and my clunky nerdbox more than a game issue.I scored Hero Academy in a Humble Bundle so the price was super sweet, it normally retails on Steam for about 5 bucks (with only two teams) which is well worth it. You can also get a two pack at a discount, to bring along a friend.However, the addon teams are each almost as much as the game itself which actually seems pretty steep. Even though they offer a wholly different experience to each other team, its hard to appreciate the high cost.			"

												It's a pretty fun game with nice looking style. At first you think nobody to play but then people starts to come 1 on another. Try this game its not free but cheap, probably you are wasting money other things anyway "

												I wasn't expecting much, but this game is quite fun! The variety and seamless design left me pleasantly surprised — plus you can play your turns anytime from a phone quite easily. Snack-sized gaming done right.			"

												Do NOT buy this game.  It is just like the ""good ol days"" of Yahoo chess.  You get close to winning?  Your oppoent stops taking turns and the game NEVER ends.  In fact your opponet gets an achievment for taking 24 hours to take  a turn.  Waste of money.			"

												Buyer beware - PVP online only.A fun little strategy game.  It's fairly simplistic but enjoyable.  It's online player verus player only, with no skirmish mode, and I hate that.  Buying it on steam gives you access to two teams, the humans and the Team Fortress 2 team, but there are three others.  Just pray you don't get matched against someone who's paid to unlock the dark elves, you'll lose.That's part of the problem with the game, the racial abilities for some teams are radically overpowered.  Teamfortress2 team has the ability to gain an extra move every time they 'kill' a unit by stomping.  Since each round has 5 moves, adding a 6th is pretty huge.   But the dark elves ability to heal EVERY TIME THEY DO DAMAGE is ridiculously overpowered.  I have played over 30 games so far and I haven't been able to beat the dark elves even once. For $5, if you like strategy games like this, it's definitly fun.  Maybe if you buy the 2 pack and play with a friend, it would be better.			"

												I have no idea why I played so much of this, but it is/was fairly good fun if you enjoy chess style games. Balance is crazy bad once you start facing the paid amries en mass, but playing against balanced (free) foes this is a pretty reasonable strategy game you can play in the background.			"

												This game came to me when i bought the hat pack in TF2 like 2 years ago when i first became p2p..I decided to write a review about this. And what i'm going to say:PLEASE DON'T BUY THAT PIECE OF CRAP.When it first came to me i was like ''Oooh, maybe it could be a nice game?'' But no...seriously..this game is nonsense. The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You can't close it and when you do the battle continues on from where you had left it..Everytime. It's really annoying.I may not know what good features the game might have but that's my opinion....It is not worth that much money for a game like this.			"

												So much wasted potential, couldve been a fun turn based game. I feel like this was meant for a phone, because you send moves and wait for the other player to get back to you, which most of the time is really slow.

The game itself is a fun, strategy-drawn game that you can use as a pass time while watching TV or eating peanuts. Also if your in to TF2 Each DLC Pack has a TF2 Hat and the Game comes with one to! So overall the games great.Creativity? ☑️Gameplay? ☑️Friggin' Peanuts? ☑️+ "
