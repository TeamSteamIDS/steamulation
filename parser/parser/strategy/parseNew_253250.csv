Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game pre-EA release, and I can honestly say it is one of the most enjoyable casual games I have ever played. It has a perfect balance between city building, RPG elements and crafting, and gives you a rewarding feeling of progression. Each citizen has their own stats and skills that can be improved and you get a real sense of a village community developing. I'll just summerise the rest into simple pros and cons:PRO- Fantastic mix of city-building/RPG- Simple yet very pretty graphics- frequent updates and very good developer communication- A slow yet steady rate of progressionCON- villager professions not yet finished so feel abit lacking in variety- a few bugs here and there- can be hard at times as death of a skilled citizen can set you back for a whileI would strongly recommend giving this game a go and looking at the future plans for this game on the developers website, exciting things planned!

								To me, the 25$ was a bit steep for something that you could technically ""accomplish"" within 2 hours. I mean if you're into expanding and creating towns and furnishing the houses with the prettiest of flowers, you'll love it, but if you're like me with just striving to hit the top of the research chain/skill tree, it's a bit easy. I'd say you could compare this a little bit to Banished in some several yet different ways.Pros:-Easy to learn-Visually nice-Can design your own buildings-Nice mix of city builder/management-Some slightly unique concepts-Is playable in it's current state-Slow progression, but actually being updatedCons:-Bugs, lots of 'em.-Crashing is frequent (Until you update your drivers)-Occasionally slightly broken UI (F5 to fix)-Not fully complete job tree (yet)-Weird inventory viewing systemAll in all, I would reccomend this game. I did find it enjoyable for the 2 hours I played, but until more is added, I'll just wait patiently. Maybe a price drop would be nice as well.			"

								A note on the negative comments: I've read through the negs on the reviews and in 99% of cases, the problem is easily resolved if you check the forums on the stonehearth webpage. Usually the problems are solved with a reboot of the game due to errors while the game engine is still in developement. I have almost 900 hours on this game. Already for more fun than most AAA titles with far better replayability. Obviously it's an alpha so there are bugs but I've never seen a company so dedicated to getting the bugs squished as quickly as possible. I really can't give this game a high enough rating and it just continues to get better with every release. It is already well worth the money and it's a game that every member of the family can play.Edit: apparently my review was suspiciously positive and didn't contain enough...something. So, for the people who are suspicious of positive reviews (seriously?) Here's your version:""Ths gam r grate. I ply this game lots and lots. Yay! It's the mostest fun you can hav when not eeting crayons and likking windows"" Yes...I'm looking at you in the comments.....better?			"

Early Access Review
								I have played Stonehearth for 341 hours and have enjoyed playing through the developing stages. The game is becoming more polished and seems to be headed in a positive direction. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys a sandbox building and crafting games where they can design towns and villages with a little bit of hostile goblins thrown in to the mix.I do not recommend this yet for someone that is expecting a finished polished product or get upset when an error message pops up.The Good- I find the game extremely fun to play with the ability to design your own houses and structures.  - The pace of the game is relaxing and the music is very soothing. - The Heathing are amusing as they try to carry out your commands- There are more creatures to worry about now as Giant Zombie, Stone Golems, Eants, and what looks like a mutant alligator roam the land. Undead Villages complete with crazed necromancers pop up and flood the night with undead critters.- The ability to create Mods will mean continued content. I hope that this also continues to develop end game content.- Weekly twitch feed keep you updated on developments and lets you give feed back to the developers.The Bad- There are still errors when trying to build structures, and it takes a while to learn what works and what does not. It seems the building logic really wants you to lay down your design in a certain way. I watched a twitch feed were the designer was working on this to allow the engine to be more flexible.- The Hearthling become idler as your town, village, Kingdom expands. I am unsure if this is caused by distance, memory issues or pathing (although sometime it’s because I ran out of wood). The developers have work hard and these issues have improved greatly since I started playing it. (I still have to chop my own wood of course)- The end game is not there yet.  There is a basic scenario evolving Blood thirsty goblins which ends after 4 or 5 encounters.  Following that you only have to fend off random creatures once or twice a day.    I will continue to play and follow this game as it develops. "

Early Access Review
								In its current state, I have to recommend this game!Couple of points at the end explain the overall rating.Pros: - Cute Artstyle - AI 90% of the time is perfect - Can build almost anything you want to - Hard mode actually adds survival challenge to this otherwise peaceful town builder - Constantly being developed/improved - Indepth profession system with RPG style progression - Happy to just watch my villagers do their thing!Cons: - AI doesn't work 10% of the time - Buildings you designate to build sometime never get finished (Look at bottom of post) - Combat AI is dodgey. I have to tell them to Defend a location, to get them to attack monstersNotes:The reason it is a yes is solely based upon the ability to use the Command Console (CTRL + SHIFT + C).This allows you to Instantly Build buildings your villagers refuse to build, and you can destroy buildings already created.Without these two commands (IB & Destroy), I would have raged quit this game years ago.I'd say 50% of custom buildings never get finished if they are semi-complicated. Sometimes the villagers, when you tell them to place items, never actually place it and you're stuck with the ghost icon.But with 'Destroy', you get rid of it, and with 'IB' you can sort the building issues out!You even have a Teleport command if your villagers get stuck!Hopefully they will remove the need for the console, but until then I have to give this a 8/10 IF you use the Console.Without the Console, it'd only be a 5/10.

								This is my very first review for any game, I just feel compelled to do it! My first impression of Stonehearth after watching their video wasn't good. This is my very first uh I don't know what to call it, 2D-pixel voxel game? Anyway, I was a bit turned off by it. I've always avoided minecraft for that reason. Also, the price of $24.99 for this type of game seemed a bit too much for me. Anyway, I spent a couple of weeks thinking about it, watched their intro video at least 4 times and finally caved and bought the game the other night. Stonehearth has been such a delight to play. I thoroughly enjoy the job/class and advancement systems. I love the cuteness that is the game, even the boxy critters and animals are adorable. Building your own homes can be quite a challenge, which adds to the fun for me. I also love being able to use a building template the game provides and customize it to my own preference if I'm too lazy to create my own. I love renaming my citizens! I love that I can assign them to their own beds! I love that the cook helps my farmer harvest the fields :D As you can see, I enjoy a lot of the little features in Stonehearth which is why I felt compelled to make this review and share my experience with others. If you enjoy survival/strategy city-builders with cute pets and citizens + job/class advancements, then I highly suggest this game to you. Imo, this is one of those games that's worth the price tag. I love what the developers have done with the game so far and I'm happy to support this early access title.			"

								Dude. DUDE. Look at this.It's an Early Access game... and they're WORKING ON IT.I've been playing Stonehearth on and off for a while, the interest spikes obviously coinciding with updates, and I am glad to say this game does not have potential. It has promise. Because a promise is something you actually follow through on.Like everyone else is saying, it is by no means complete. Think about it: it's a sandbox game and they only just put the zombies and water in. How complete is that to you?But it all works, more or less. More THAN less. There are peculiarities, certainly - when I tell you tiny voxel people to pick berries, I mean I want you to TAKE those berries back to town - but it doesn't hiccup too often. And there have been some interesting hiccups. The biggest one, which involved two separate timers ingame and their misbehavior, the devs actually detailed in a blog post.Which brings me to the dev team, Radiant. These people talk with their community, and their community talks back. And they communicate often. Weekly - or so,♥♥♥♥♥♥happens - posts keep everyone appraised of what's going on with/in to the game, which is always nice to see. And I've seen some♥♥♥♥♥♥ man... I purchased Cube World.Now, I want to draw attention to something that I think is important. Stonehearth is currently in Alpha 10 - every time there's a large content update, they bump that number up by one. And it's only just now on Early Access, despite it going up on Steam early so Kickstarter patrons would have an easier time of it.That means they waited until they had a significant amount of content in the game before going Early Access.Seriously, Radiant. Y'all're beautiful.If you like boxy sandboxes and RTS-type games, give this one a whirl. I think you'll like it.			"

Early Access Review
Welcome, to the Hearth!Heya guys, and gals, and welcome to my little review on Stonehearth, a lovable Early-Access title brought to you from the developers at Radient Entertainment, an indie-game studio based in Los Altos, California.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Initially when I first stumbled upon Stonehearth, it was after the dark ages seen from similar titles, notebly the game Castle Story from Sauropod Studios. An early access game as well, and with a similar feel initially, the game suffered quickly due to lack of development and the $30.00 price tag on a -usually- broken and unsatisfying experience. Coming to Stonehearth, I was a bit relictant to try a new title under the Early Access title and with the same feel.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So let's get into it, what is Stonehearth all about?Stonehearth is a meshed combination of a City Builder but with a mix of RPG and Adventure elements. Your journey begins as one of the two (current) races available to play (four are planned so far in total). Starting out, you and your handful of citizens (Hearthlings) are tasked with constructing your very own ""city on a hill"", a home in the wilderness of one of two (current) biomes.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Races and FactionsThere, at this time, is only a single race playable in the game which of course, are the humans. However, the humans are split into two factions (currently) with a third planned in the future. The human factions that are known about now are:The AscendencyOriginally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""Earnest and hardworking, loyal and well-rounded. Citizens of the Ascendency chop, build, and farm, confident that the known world is theirs to inhabit.""The Ascendency are the basic human faction, based off of Eastern European countries they are home to the temperate biome and start their crafting tree around the Carpenter, a specialist who uses wood resources to create works from tools and weapons, to building components and decorations. They don't do well in the desert however, due to their heavy dependance on wood resources.Raya's ChildrenOriginally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""The scattered people of the mountains learned early that to survive, they needed each other - and preferable as many others as they could reach. Now, though the members of their trading cities and traveling caravans pride themselves on ascetic disciplin, visitors find them generous hosts with access to goods from all over the world.""The second released human faction, named the Raya's Children, are designed from a more Middle Eastern resemblance. Living a life in the vast deserts in the world, they have learned to cope with the lack of wood and traditional building materials found elsewhere. Instead of a Carpenter, they begin with a Potter, an artisan skilled in crafting bricks of clay and stone to form efficient housing solutions.Th Northmen's Alliance (NOT RELEASED)Originally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""Brave and handy, the men and women of the north live for the sight of a new dawn over unexplored territory. Armed with compass and hatchet, they form strings of small, defensible settlements and pride themselves in their tenacious adaptability.""The third faction planned for the human race are the Northmen's Alliance. Based on the Vikings from northern Europe and the surrounding tundras, they are a hardworking collection of natural-born explorers and fighters. They are home to the tundra biome, and additional details for them have yet to be released.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GameplayThe game begins with the main menu, as every game should. Upon stating up a new game you are presented with the choices you shall make, the biome you choose to inhabit, people you choose to play as, and the difficulty to which you would like to play as. It is a simple process, freshened up from a traditional selection screen by being presented to you in the form of a story book, with the choices you make appearing to fill the blanks of the story.Once past, you are sent into the Expedition Roster, a list of several Hearthlings which you will start with. Each Hearthling comes with a randomly rolled attribute set spread across three categories.Mind - Useful for those who will become your fine artisans and crafters, Mind stats help these Hearthlings advance in their career as well as gives a boost to their ability to craft Fine items, creations which are adorned with supreme craftsmanship.Body - Granting bonus stats to boost Hearthling health and movement speed, a high Body stat is excellent for Footmen and combat specialists, but also those who will greatly benefit from the passive speed boost, ie. Farmers and Trappers.Spirit - A key for those going into combat, Spirit attribute points grant a boost to Hearthling courage and morale. High Spirited combat specialists will stand firm in combat, even after sustaining injuries.If you happen to have unfavorable traits, you can try again for as many times as you like with the 'Roll new citizens' button, regenerating all seven Hearthlings. Once finished, on the right side you are greeted by a list of various items for purchase, and a small budget of initial gold for you to purchase things or take along with you on your journey.With your citizens ready to depart and your expedition supplies tied down and stowed for your adventure, it finally comes time to select your site to begin! With reach game of Stonehearth, the maps are randomly generated using seeds, viewable at the bottom of the screen. You can reroll maps for as many times as you wish, alike the Expedtion Roster. To note with your location as you move your cursor over the map, the highlighted box around your cursor represents the actual in-game map, which although seems small compared to the world map, offers plenty of space for your city's development and then some. On the right side, you will also see three major variables which change on the area you select.Trees and Plants - This is pretty self-explanetory on the fact that this value shows how many plants and trees are located in the settlement region you have highlighted.Wildlife - This factor represents the amount of creatures found in the highlighted region, useful for your trappers who will need animals in order to efficiently trap and harvest them.Minerals - This final factor represents the amount of ores, stone deposits, and the etc. which are readily located in the highlighted region. You can always however, mine for ore in a region with little to no Mineral rating, it just takes some time.Once you have your region selected and good to go, you can embark on your journey!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Review PartA simple, yet equally complex game, Stonehearth is a game easily loveable by Adventure, RPG, City-builder, and Strategy fans. Built in a voxel art style with a friendly and cute feel to it, it is aesthetically pleasing and especially for those who run the game on higher graphics settings. Keep in mind that there are faults of course, various quirks and bugs are present as you can expect with an Early-Access title, however the weekly Development Team reports and progressing updates are great! There are currently a collection of simple quests and side-missions to keep you interested along with a developing story in the works. Overall I again, highly recommend this title, and encourage you to try it out!Thanks for reading, happy building!- Kyoko			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a great game. It's a merge of Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft; The former for it's 'base-building' and management aspects, the latter for it's voxel graphics. TL;DR Pros/Cons list: + Good replay value + Looks great + Large amount of craftable items and professions + Building Designer + Villagers level up and unlock skills + Frequently updated - Rather buggy, villagers tend to get confused very often and so on - Combat is slow and iffy at times - Game will often break if you don't save often to avoid doing things that break it - Some 'texture' issues - Few pre-built structures - Lack of game customisation (monster spawn rates, villagers, etc)In Stonehearth, your goal (if any) is rather simple: to build a thriving medieval village/city, and take care of the various needs of your villagers (known has hearthlings) along the way.You don't have direct control over your villagers like an RTS; you give them orders to perform and they'll find a way to do it (most of the time) themselves.As you progress in-game, and your villagers level up, you'll slowly unlock more proffessions for them to practice, and thus more furniture, decoration, tools and weapons for them to use.You will not, however, unlock new buildings, as the game only has 5 (I believe) pre-built ones. The rest is up to you to build, using the game's Building Designer feature, which works more or less the same as 'The Sims' Build Mode, with a tab bit less freedom.Hearthlings tend to have issues when building; I have had to help them off of roofs, demolish a building because they couldn't build scaffolding or because they just go on strike and won't build anything at all.Be sure to leave at least a block of space around a building when planning it out; your hearthlings won't be able to build the scaffolding if not.Decoration-wise, there are tons to choose from, ranging from beds, to flower pots or braziers. Each crafting profession has some form of decoration. My villages have gotten prettier and prettier over time as I've discovered new crafts.The game's replay value is rather high, as attempting to create a functional village in different environments can be a challenge at times (on top of a mountain, for example ^^).The game is also rather buggy in it's current state; several times I have had to start a new game because I placed a path over another and the villagers refused to build anything else, or because I was planning a custom building and none of my orders would work anymore.Many blocks/items sometimes overlay eachother as well, causing flickering textures which can get rather irritating at times.I've also had issues where my one fighter hearthling has gotten themselves stuck in an infinite loop of 'Attack Golbing Chieftan > Run away from Goblin Chieftan'. Seeing as there is no direct control over the villagers, I can't do anything to get them to stop, and just have to wait for something to hopefully kill them.All in all, Stonehearth is a great game to own if you're into the genre and I highly recommend it.The frequent updates make it a great game to come back to from time to time.If I were to rate it out of 10 like everyone else seems to, I'd have to give it the following: 7/10.For an Early Acces game, it has a good amount of content, looks good, is fun to play, but the bugs it has in it's current state sometimes ruin the experience.

								I have followed and been trying this game out since the beginning. I first got hooked when it was a concept from someone that seemed to have a passion for what he wanted to do and what he wanted to make.This game is the type of early Access that steam needs. More developers should actually follow this style. Here we have a guy that had his game available while in developement with it hardly being playable. We had the chance to see the game receive slow but steady streams of content flowing in and bug squashing. I used to not be able to get 5 minutes before everyone decided they wanted to sit around and do nothing. But unlike other developers, This guy actually kept at it. and unlike other developers. When the cash flowed in... they slowed down, He sped up. The closest relation i can give this developer style is like Dwarf Fortress. Not in terms of gameplay, but how he steadily adds content while fixing issues with the game. and any dwarf loving fan will know that it takes a while for each of the updates to come out.TL:DR - Developer set realistic goals to meet with limited resources. And keeps meeting them.			"

								Well, it's finally here... Steam Early Access! I couldn't be happier for Team Radiant! :)Disclaimer: I am an official fanboy, and hold this development studio in the highest esteem. But in my defense, I think this is perfectly justified given how open and transparent this team is with their fans and supporters.All that aside, what do I actually think about Stonehearth? I think it has the potential to be one of the most entertaining games we've seen in these combined genres in ages. There's a wealth of things that the team has already implemented (building!, classes, crafting, mining, combat) and a whole host of others in the works.With each new update the team trickles out improvements to the game's foundation (better performance, more stability) and introduces new mechanics and content as well for the community to test drive. You will be hard pressed to find another team that is as open with their backers as these folks, and its always rewarding to see topics discussed with the team in their bi-weekly stream actually implemented in the game.I think I'll leave this review for now, and revisit as each new major release is dropped (roughly every month to month and a half). If you are at all interested in the title, I highly encourage to drop by the Discourse and mingle with some other fans and backers. Watch a few LP series and see just what Stonehearth has to offer at this stage of development.I have a feeling you'll be glad you did! :)p.s. if you are interested in watching a town be rebuilt ... *several* times, look no further! :p

								It's an ant farm that you control. Virtual Villagers but infinitely better. Simply the best town sim I've played.Pros- Combat is fun to watch.- Art direction is beautiful.- You can design the buildings.- Skill/design curve is huge so it's always interesting to do something new.- Actually, everything is fun to watch.Cons- Sometimes workers task weird.- Very CPU(?) intensive. - A strong push by goblin armies can wipe you if you're new.- Haven't seen any water yet. Would like water.- Engineer takes way too much to level. Mason -> Blacksmith -> Engineer, way too much of an EXP grind.Protips- Build a wall early on- Always have a standing army.- I figured out the holy trinity of MMORPGS work with 1 knight, 3 footmen, and 1 cleric. I was able to take on anything with this.- Design your own buildings! Increase efficiency by putting ten beds in one house! Your Hearthlings will love you! ( Love not guaranteed. )- When starting, most people overdo the farm plots. Anything over 15x15 would be overkill until later on.- Use the 'maintain' option if you're building multiple buildings.- You can build walls via pasture enclosements or design building.Suggestions- Let us place objects from storage units into the world. I can't access my piles of stone / clay.- Make the market stalls have different merchants.Overall : 9.5/10. A little buggy, but one of the best games that you could buy for 25$. I'd value it at 35$ at most. Make sure you don't run this on an old computer or you could start freezing or crashing. I've had no problems with the game, great direction.SpecsWin 1016 GB DDR4 RAMIntel i5 6600Radeon RX 480			"

								(I have been following stonehearth since fall 2013, so I will admit that I am (more then) a little bit biased.)   Pros   The devlopers (I've found) are actualy involved in their community. Such as asking for feedback, also taking ideas from other people to help build the hints and tips section on their website.    Music is somthing which can make or break a game for me, and I have found that Raj Mann has created some very amaizing music for this game.    The graphics in this game are very light and happy, (This is the only game that I've found that makes goblins look cute while they steal your stuff.) Though at times I wish the hardened look of suriving on nothing but berries for days. But In the end I find it enjoyable  Cons  This is an early access game so their is lots of bugs and so the game is known to crash, but the devolpers are continually working on the bugs.   If you are still undicided look up their twich streams on tues and thus at 6:00 p.m pacific time.    sorry If I happen to have bad grammer			"

								I have been following the game since the kickstarter and it has gone from strength to strength. After a long process of developing the core systems and streamlining the game engine the game has come on quite rapidly. Appreciate at this stage that the game IS an alpha but also know that new content is being made rapidly at this stage. They have a team of full time staff working hard away 5 days a week to make sure this game reaches its fans so dont think that buying at this stage is a ""gamble"". You WILL get the finished product. The game its self is soo fun to play. A perfect blend of city management with sim life without a crazy amount of micro-management. The game also features very easy mod integration and is built using easy to understand languages. The team have published full documentation on getting started on modding too so if you want to get started, you can do so at any time. It's my recommendation that you buy this game now and try it for yourself. At this stage you will get a good feeling for the final product. For the price you will rarley find something that you will get the same amount of gameplay out of.			"

Afraid of all the freaking crap that you have to learn to play Dwarf Fortress?  Want to support a developer who is upfront about the struggle, needs the communities help, and is rewarding that community with continued work?  Well, this is the game.  This gives me hope that Steam Greenlight, Kickstarter, and indie gaming can make truly wonderful games that would of never seen the light a decade ago.			"

Early Access Review
								Before I begin, let me say this:  I understand Stonehearth is in Early Access.  I don't expect everything to work flawlessly. That having been said, the game needs a lot of work.I picked up Stonehearth based on a lot of Steam user reviews comparing it to Dwarf Fortress.  I like Dwarf Fortress, even though the game is notorious for its extremely obfuscated interface.  Stonehearth sacrifices a lot of DF's detailed simulation for a more accessible experience, which is fine with me.  However, as of March 2016, the current build is badly broken.  A few of the weird AI glitches I've seen include Hearthlings that join the settlement, but idle in one place permanently.  After accepting a new Hearthling (hereafter referred to as ""plebs""), I watched her stand on a hill for a week, regardless of any orders I issued.  She was eventually eaten by wolves.  Footmen, Stonehearth's 'soldier' class, will charge after enemies they have no chance of defeating, regardless of their current orders.  When they're reduced to 1/4 health, they flee for a few moments, then turn back and resume fighting.  I've lost at least four Footmen because of this behavior.  Mobs also have a tendency to spawn in weird locations, like at the end of a long tunnel with only one entrance.  I got a notification informing me that one of my plebs was mauled to death by wolves, at the end of a mining tunnel with a closed door at the entrance.  Either something's up with the spawning algorithm, or all dogs don't go to heaven.  I'm saying they're ghost dogs.  Way of the samurai.The building system is suprisingly robust.  The interface makes it easy to plot foundations, walls, upper floors, and roofs.  I actually designed some pretty handsome structures, and the process was fairly intuitive and straightforward.  However, once I actually placed my blueprint and ordered my plebs to build the structure, I ran into more AI issues.  On two separate occasions, my plebs stopped building before the structure was complete.  They'd build to around 3/4 completion, then idle, as though they had nothing to do.  Reloading the game did nothing.  Suspending all jobs, then re-assigning them did nothing.  I simply had a partially-finished shell of a building in the middle of my settlement.  I tried to remove it, but my plebs demolished about half of the building, then idled again.  My town looks like Detroit in 1996.  Shameful display.Despite all the AI issues, I still like the game.  The art style is charming, and the UI makes it easy to place buildings and command your plebs.  Once they iron out the issues with plebs abandoning construction halfway through, I think it's going to be a joy to play.  The interface handles walls and roofs very gracefully, and building blueprints for structures is a breeze.  I remember placing roofs in ""Towns,"" a similar town-building game, was a living nightmare.  Most importantly, while scanning the forums for solutions to my AI issues, I saw that the devs were very active, involved with, and respectful to their players.  That's a very good sign.  For the time being, I'm going to recommend this game.  I was excited enough about the premise that I didn't mind the $25 price tag, but if cost is an issue for you, I'd recommend holding off until they get a beta build up and running.  Bottom line:  despite some pretty rampant AI issues, the game shows a lot of promise.  As long as the devs stay active and listen to their player base, I think this is going to mature into a very enjoyable experience.[UPDATE 3/13/16]  All of my footmen got thwomped by a one-two combo of ghost dogs and giant zombies, so I decided to start a new settlement in sandbox mode.  So far, I've experienced none of the AI glitches I saw in 'normal' mode.  It seems that something about combat, or placing my settlement on defense mode, breaks the AI.  I'm hoping the devs fix this, because I enjoyed the challenge of defending against sporadic attacks from invaders and thieves.  For the time being, however, I'd recommend you play in sandbox mode.

								In StoneHearth, you begin the game on a randomly generated map similar to a Minecraft map. The gameplay is similar to a strategy game, as you do not control directly any character. You just give orders and expect them to be followed. You start with 7 Settlers, each having their own sets of strenghts & weaknesses. One may be thriving in handcrafting while another is suited for military missions. With these settlers, you'll build and develop a camp thanks to all the resources available. These resources are various, and it can be compared here with Terraria for instance.To grow, you'll focus on developing the skills of your settlers, assigning them jobs, and gathering as much resources as possible. But these objectives can be endangered by the presence of enemies at night: zombies, skeletons, goblins. You'll have to manage a small military force to protect yourself.The final objective of the game in its current state is more or less to build your 'perfect base', and survive long enough to do so.Similar games:- Stronghold- The SettlersCool features:- Daily events and Trade, to earn gold and buy resources you lack of- The Building design system, which is quite good and allow you to design your dream city/base- Progression system for settlersIn its current state, the game is good, and the potential is interesting. I recommand it if you enjoy this kind of game (Check the Settlers especially). "

As Daft Punk once said, ""buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it, mail - upgrade it"".Or at least, something like that. You get my point.So, Stonehearth (gosh, that's one unfortunate title *cough*Hearthstone*cough*) is a very promising *deep breath* early access city building, minecraftesque, RPG, strategy, survival, crafting game. Whew, that was long.You start by choosing the background of your hearthlings, their place to settle and the difficulty. Then, you take the role of the taskmaster as you have to guide your people. Craft, build, assign jobs, harvest, defend against hunger, goblins, golems etc. NOTE: As nightfalls come and go, be advised that mobs will become slowly, but surely, more difficult to face. The gameplay is all about choosing the best decision about your everyday actions and proper resource management (whether that's your hearthlings or your food). You have to direct your workers to crafting or collecting what you think you need mostly and prepare for the dangers that descend upon you every night. But what if you make the wrong choice? You don't have to worry about that, since the game has a perfect pace to give you the time to think carefully about your choices and correct those that turned up to be a disaster. One very unique aspect, which I enjoyed very much (I got up from my chair and clapped my hands when I saw it), is the ability to design unique houses for your hearthlings. True, you got the default building templates, but you can also choose the size, materials, style, decoration of each construction you plan to make and model it to your heart's desire. Kudos for that, it was an excellent idea from the developers and I don't think any other city building game has ever done that.On the downside, the game is still in Alpha. Be prepared for game-breaking bugs and it's a good idea to report them in order to help the devs improve the game as fast as possible.The hearthlings' AI is a bit clumsy at times too, so don't be surprised if your people simply ignore the goblins stealing their precious resources or taking years to clear a specific side of the forest you ordered them to cut down. Hopefully, it will be improved in future patches and builds.Personal suggestions towards the developers: I look forward to the addition of multiplayer, new biomes, new nations and better AI.Overall, if you are into this genre, give it a shot when you can afford it and you won't regret it. *wink*RATING:Gameplay: 7.5/10 (due to several bugs that can create a big mess)Presentation: 8/10Story: 8.5/10Unique Factor: Entertainment: 8.5/10OVERALL: 8.1/10 "

								I've been following this game for a long time, I actually missed the kickstarter by a few days.. and it is unfortunate because I really wanted to support them in a bigger way. This game means quite a bit to me it really got me back into gaming which I was very apathetic about all newer game titles. I've been in the testing phases of this game for a long time pretty much as soon as they allowed you to buy in from their website and I honestly have never regretted it. The game itself is quirky. There is a lot of stuff going on and bugs happen, but I can absolutely assure anyone who is put off by this that it will be fixed. In the older builds there were major funny, and breaking bugs.. which messed up the gameplay but the devise are always diligent to squash anything they can as promptly as possible. I can't recommend this game enough simply because it has such an amazing community. It already has modders, the devs are very active and as transparent as possible, biweekly dev streams where people in chat can actually influence the shape of the game, devs are very appreciative of their community and open to suggestions, and much more. The team definitely has a vision of where this game is going, and they are honestly working their asses off to achieve it.. And so far they are hitting the nail on the head every time. Their over all may not be exactly what I was wanting... But the modding scene well have us covered on that front. New builds come out every few weeks.. Sometimes they are buggy sometimes they are not. It all depends on what what changed or how much new content is thrown it. Fixes usually come within a few days but sometimes require a larger update to fix. I pretty much play this game for 5 or 10 hours every other weekend testing the new content, trying out new ideas, etc.. The content is steadily growing at decent rate. Overall for me this game scratches an itch I've had since finally abandoning dwarf fortress. I look forward to participating in this community for years to come.			"

								When I took a screenshot of Stonehearth, and shared it with my friend, the first thing he asked was ""Is that a Minecraft clone?"" Seriously, no. If you think a complex city building and management game is a clone of Minecraft, you need to really get a reality check, bud. Anyway, moving on to the actual review. First, you should know that I've been playing Stonehearth since the pre-alpha days, and that this review is for Alpha 10.5. I'm also basing this only on the content that is currently available, and not promised stuff due out later in development. Though, I'm personally looking forward to PvP combat, which is going to be a feature later on. SOUNDSound design is average, and everything you'd expect to be there, is there. You've got grunts, a catchy (if not a tad repetitive) soundtrack, and all the other standard musical cues you'd expect from a video game. -7/10GAMEPLAYYou've got the foundations of a pretty awesome city building game, though there's a clear lack of content as of this writing. The core city building aspect is most definitely there, and you're able to build custom structures, mine for resources, and even fight invading monsters. I've yet to actually figure out what happens if you lose all of your guys to a city invasion, and the enemies don't seem to do much other than invade, and rush you with numbers. But at the very least, it's the start of something major. You're also able to create squads to better fend off enemy invasion, and the city building animations are fascinating. I found myself building random structures just to see how my little minions (yes, that's what I call them) would construct it. -9/10FEATURESUnfortunately, the game is currently lacking in the feature department. While the actual gameplay is polished beyond what you'd expect for an Early Access game, it isn't without its faults. For starters, there is very little in the way of configuration. There's no graphic slider, or volume control. This is really just a core experience right now, and you know what? I'm oddly okay with that. This is just an alpha after all. Things will improve. -8/10CONCLUSION All in all, Stonehearth offers a very solid city building experience. Considering as how this is only just in alpha, Stonehearth feels like a finished product. It has polish, it has style. It's just an all around fun experience. Sure, there's a fair number of bugs, though none of them are game breaking, at least in my testing. This is an alpha, so a bug or two is expected. But the fact that Stonehearth plays and feels like a finished product? Well, that's just darn amazing. So yes, I recommend Stonehearth. Final rating? 8.5/10. (note: this review was for alpha version 10.5)			"

								This is the video game equivalent of a handful of vicodin and a glass of white wine.  It's very simple, calming and satisfying.  You just sit around in your little hot air balloon and yell at these little kids playing minecraft to destroy the earth and remake it in your image, and they just snap to it.  Just ""You, your job is crops.  You, you're in charge of all wood.  You, you make fox jerky,"" and away they go, farming, carving and toturing cute animals to death.  There's combat in this game, but it requires no thought.  Life in sedated management is good.			"

								tl;dr, add this to your watch list and wait for more content.One of few early access game that really 'done right' (Looking at you killing floor 2)Devs pushes content update the game frequently, roughly in 6 week cycle. Many numberous patch/'quick peek' are also updated in weekly basis. The devs publish news update instead of empty words (looking at you Tripwire Interactive).The thing is, right now the game lacks content, once you pass initial stage there's really little you can do. Besides the game is buggy, too. You will be met with some gamebreaking bug in hourly basis.At current state I can't really recommend it. But this game is really shaping up. Looking forward to it.

You Choose, your there, you quickly start building up your materials, then build some tools for your Hearthlings to use to craft many different items and entities.  i must say, this game fills smooth simplistic graphics, giving the game a relaxing and casual feel while still throwing in some combat to liven things up a bit.  Then and AMAZING sound track to really top it off.  at the time of this review i have about 150 hours on the game, and they are all well spent.  i would give this game 9/10   "

								Let's start with the bad points: - Bugs- Bugs- Bugs- Bugs - ∞ Endless bugs - Workers are too dumb to even build a wall or stairs - Menu sometimes just disappears; pro: funny to see your villagers getting slaughtered because you can't command your Warriors without it- You sit there, Pause the game and try to come up with an epic Building for about 1-2 hours. When you're done and proud of what you have done with 2 hours of your life and tell them nice workers to build it, they go there, look at it, set the first block and never ever ever ever ever ever touch it again. So there you're sitting and trying to get them to build it. But NOPE. They won't do it. Nice... I even played with the thought to report some bugs but... do the guys and girls who make this game, ever play it? - More BUGSSo why did I give a ""Thumbs Up""? - I got the game a long time ago, so when I played it the first time, it was not really buggy and fun to play- I like the idea of the game, to manage a little village with a little minecraft in it- Even if I know that nothing really changes in the game and it gets even more bugs every time I play it, I still play it once in a while for abt 1-2 hours just to rage quit- I don't believe in god, but I still believe that a day will come when this game will have lesser bugs - I like the design, artwork and the style of the game- They said there will be a Multiplayer some day, building epic villages with epic buildings with your epic friends with hopefully no epic bugsSOOOOOOOOO if this game has a -80% off, buy it. If not and you're not a sadist, don't buy it.  "

								I have played this game off and on for about 6 months and can honestly recommend the game. It is still in development, but the developers are extremely engaged and regularly release updates with bug fixes, new content, etc. The core of the game is solid and offers significant room for customization of the buildings within your town. At present, there are bugs, but this is expected. What is promising is that many of the bugs I have observed over the course of the past 6 months, have been taken care of. Do new bugs pop up when new content is released? Of course. However, they are typically resolved within a month, at most, of the new content's release.The game itself is primarily a city builder with random raids of goblins, undead, etc thrown in to keep the game play interesting and varied. The combat system is a bit wonky at present, but has been steadily improving over time which is a good indication of future improvements to come.Resource gathering has become rather staightforward and it is relatively easy to keep your villagers gathering what you want them to. It does require a bit of micromanagement as there is not a way to automate their gathering behavior at present (e.g. mine when copper is below 20 in storage, gather wood when inventory is below 15, etc). Once the resources are gathered, though, the tradesmen can be completely automated to maintain inventory levels of the items you wish to produce (e.g. set the Blacksmith to maintain 5 swords in inventory, etc)In sum, despite the bugs that I have experienced and room for future improvement, I would highly recommend this game. It has vast potential, a very active development team that is engaged with the community, and is generally enjoyable to play.			"

								I've been following this game since it's Kickstarter days and am very pleased with the progress it has made thusfar. Stonehearth is a sandboxish city builder, simulation game with added rpg like elements. Whether you just want to build your dream village, fight off incoming invaders, or dig the deepest mine, this game has it all. Designing buildings has never been easier and allows for many possibilties and custimizations and your hearthlings will automatically build what you design for them. The profession system gives you various choices to decide which directions you want your little town.Radiant Entertainment are some of the most community driven developers I have ever come across. They are constantly livestreaming the game development and intereacting with the community on the forums. As this game  has a tendency of having some (often hilarious) bugs here and there as any Alpha game does, the team is very quick at releasing patch versions to adress these kind of errors.Modding is another core component in this game. Being new to moding myself, it is amazing to see how easy it is to mod the game, even in this early state, and should get much easier as the game develops. There is already a nice variety of community made mods available on the stonehearth forums.All in all I definitly recomend this to anyone who loves city builders, rpgs and sandbox games.  If you are a hardcore Dwarf Fortress gamer, I suggest you give Stonehearth a try. With the progress Radiant has made so far, I am definitly excited to see what they have in store for multiplayer and the other features they want to add to this wonderful game!~Avairian			"

								Early Access Review: (Review might change over updates so be wary)When I first saw this game it's concepts and looks instantly reminded me of the game called Trove (no advertisment induced). The charming graphics and animations alone make this game so good but the real deal comes with building.The start:- You start the game by picking 2 races: The Raya and the Ascendancy. Both races differ a lot.- The Ascendancy starts off with the initial job Carpenter: The man who does miracles with wood. They are also the better farmers to play with.- The Raya start with the initial job potter: the mastermind of clay. But here's the catch. The carpenter can craft the wooden sword right away to promote a settler to a footman so you can fend off enemies early on while the potter cannot. So starting with the raya first is harder for newbies.After you picked your race you have to set the biome. There's one homeland for each race. Choosing the opposite homeland makes no real difference whatsoever. Both have wood and stone to start with. Only the wood/stone/clay ratio is different. Note that you can farm on both grassland and plains.After choosing the biome you get the chance to edit your starting people. You can rename them and reroll the entirety for random stats. Also you can but some starting items from you 150g pool.At the end but not least you only have to set your difficulty: Peaceful, Normal and Hard mode. I think I don't have to explain the differences here do I? ;DFinally you set your starting point on a RGN map you can (gladly) re-roll to get better chances of the ideal settling spot.The gameplay:The gameplay might seem a bit too much at first (and even I did not know anything at the start... like jon snow) and I was confused by a lot but after I experimented a bit around I got the grip of it.NOTE TO RADIANT: We need a tutorial asap! (Now bacvk to the review)The starting goal is simple: Harvest some ressources to build workstations for your carpenter/potter. After that get some crates/boxes/stockpiles to gather the harvested ressources. And now you got everything you need to build your own buildings.The graphics:- Trove and Minecraft had a baby and this is the result: 3D-blockapolypse and I love it.>> I am currently still testing things and such and I am pretty fatigued atm. I gonna update this review over the next days <<My verdict (for now): 7/10 Good game to pass time and cool off from stress.The game is early access but it's worth the money trust me. More worth than No man's sky :'DThe content is small but the creativity is endles (see screenshots and artwork).If you like to play block-games and minecraft and love the trove-artstyle than this game is your game.Sincerely, Khillian R.

								What it has so far is good. Solid core game aspects, and random generated Quests and Map. It still is missing quite a lot of the bulk stuff.What in my opinion they need to do is:Add more jobs.* (like 5-6 more) *note: I did read the roadmap content.Fix the combat system.* UI restrictions - Orders to Guard(and eat while guarding), Patrol routes, Sentry zones.Fix the lighting.* Make it so spans farther on fire braziers and other forms of light.Fix some of the sound skips.*More building material/items to craft.*More drops from mobs.* Also more rare items.Adding a more permanent way to buy/sell goods* Like sending caravans and stuff. Being able to use the gold for something.* Right now I have like 12k gold and nothing to spend it on.I recommend this game to anyone who likes building towns but not for those who build in like Minecraft. I like the sitting back and managing it waiting for the next attack or something to make me hop up from my chair, then overpowering them. I will not rate this game because it is still small compaired to other games. Also I don't very much like Early Access Games, but I still support them because I know how hard it is to build something... Hah, see what I did there?			"

								This game is very addictive. It has the micro-management of a city building sim, but it's not on such a grand scale. However, it's kind of better, you get to know your village/town pretty well and you start to remember the names of who does what job and what they look like. It's great to just expand and grow out and you have the incentive of gaining new villagers through daily reports as you increase your net worth. Increasing the size of your population provokes attacks by increasingly difficult enemies, so you have to manage forces in to bands and promote footmen to knights or bowmen etc. The military system is enjoyable in that it allows the game to merge in to a military sim/strategy genre as well. I'm glad to see this game is doing well and that the developer is supporting it.Note, one warning: Bugs... Although this game is in early access, so I'll cut it some slack. I'm having a few bugs, e.g. soldiers not listening to commands, multiple glitches in custom building system, hearthlings not collecting loot and the inability to remove certain structures half way through building them.

								I cant really recommend this game since its so far from finished. But i've had so much fun with it i cant give it a ""thumbs down"" either.Its a colony building game in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. You designate the little people to be farmers or blacksmiths or whatever, designate a building here and a building there and, whenever they get around to it, they'll build it & live in it. Some of the fun details are that while the game has prefab buildings, you dont have to use them, you can opt to design your own instead. And if you come up with a good design you can save it to use again later. Eventually you'll be able to share your designs & others can use them in their colonies, which will be cool, but its not in yet.Theres a lot thats not in yet, if you read the design goals, the devs have a LOT in mind for this game. I'll be amazed if they can do half of it. But they keep working on it very steadily. Ive been following it for a long while now & updates & new features have always come in on a regular basis. The devs are very connected to the player community & it shows. Its certainly not another one of those ""grab the money & run"" fly-by-nights we've seen so many times on early access. These guys are serious about wanting to make a good game.If you like to use early access games to observe the game development process, this is a great game for that right now.  If you want it to, the game is happy to show you the nuts & bolts of exactly whats going wrong inside the AI's little brain when it gets stuck on a lamp post or whatever. And if you post a bug report, the devs will almost certainly have a fix in the next patch.However if youre the type who gets upset when you find yourself beta testing a game you paid for, perhaps skip this one for now... but keep an eye open for it, if/when it goes gold its gonna be really good!

Yes it has bugs, (some quiet funny/EA) but it is very playable and will drain your hours away. The dev's are very communicative. Tom even streams every Tues and Thrusday with the community and listen to your input. Well all of Team Radiant listen to the community.  They have well rounded road map too.PRO- Great city-building/RPG- Fun world- 10x better then most building games (and its EA)- Frequent updates, good developer communication- Easy going graphics (especially on low end machines)- Steady progressionCON- Villager professions not alot of them yet (part of the progress)- A.I. frustrations- Bugs here and there- Playing on story mode (no real story yet) can be difficult- Drains Time :) Little about how the game worksYou start off picking your location. Get a handful of villager (random gen - could get all females/males) with campfire and banner.  Beginning by getting mats (wood and stone) placing your stockpile for them to place. You promote for a Carpentar and hunter to get food going. Need to keep those villagers fed. Then to the Farmer to mass the food production. As your handling this you have your workers building houses, from scatch (or blueprint), placing beds (for them to sleep) and other items of decor. If in story mode, the goblins with attempt to bribe you or get you raided. Here comes your first footman. As time goes and and your life has drained away you will have walls up with footman patrolling keeping those pesky goblins and undead in check. Your village will be growing, your workers mining and working, your craftman crafting and your village having life. Quite a site to see.If your not into building villages, You can always go to peacful mode and build what you want. (I got a mages tower built floating in the air) But you can build almost what you want. As long as the villagers can reach it and build it. Still must keep them fed and have a place to sleep. But not much there but imagination.			"

								An awesome game.  Too bad they've had an unfixed construction bug for over a year that makes it unplayable.  A big part of the game is building structures.  There is a bug in the game that causes your workers to abandon construction if certain events happen - such as an attack on your town that causes you to recall them to safe points.  Afterwards, there is no way to get them to resume construction - and also no way to remove the unfinished structure.  I really like this game, but it just doesn't work.  Searching on the web, I see that this bug has been present for over a year. Alpha or not, it should be fixed by now.			"

								I know there are some negative reviews about this game, but I feel people aren't giving this game its due. Please remember it's in Alpaha still. Considering that, it is still amazing. Much of the work has gone into The Ascendancy(SP?). You start with 7 hearthlings in your group to found your new home. To gain more you must meet set amounts in food, morale, and net worth. Each of these can be done easily enough. You generaly meet morale unless you just don't do anythng for your hearthlings, like building beds to sleep in or chairs and tables for them to eat at or growing them at food. Food can be attained right away from berry bushes until you can make a farmer's hoe to promote a hearthling to farmer to grow food yourself. And net worth comes from building things like a shared sleeping quarters, dining hall, roads, or designing your own buildings. On day ten you'll be approached by a royal herald who will give you a quest to become a township. If you complete this quest you get tier 2 building materials.This game has entertained me for almost 200 hours already. My friends and I have to take turns using my PC just to play Stonehearth. At this time No Man's Sky is coming in second place to this game. We enjoy this so much.Many of the featurs of this game are unique. I have never played a game that allows me to manage, but not micro-manage. I give general commanda and the hearthlings live them out. It's a simulation game for a village. You build the village/town, but the hearthlings do it in their own way. You also have footmen/knights/archers/clerics to defend you town. Their are craftsmen of all sorts. It's an intricate system.Please get in on the ground floor and watch this game grow. This game will be huge, and it will be such an amazing release one of these days. Trust me.			"

CURRENTLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR GENERAL GAMING. If you wish to help beta test this game, then I HIGHLY recommend it, because it has an incredible amount of potential and I want it to succeed and prosper. We need to help these devs do this by giving feedback and support.Completed my beta testing sessions on this game. Patience ran out (nothing personal...full time worker here lol). Here is the list of current bugs and frustrations I have run across.1. Excessive random encounters that make everything extremely difficult after around the 10th - 15th day. I just finished a session where, between game day 7 and 14, I was encountered by:-12 wolves-4 thieves-a goblin raiding party-4 zombies/skeletons (While I had 4 goblins raiding, thus citizens started dying left and right)-2 varnus things-a shiteload of those wood/stone gremlin thingsThis was on ""Normal"" mode, and in my opinion, this difficulty curve/cliff is a gamebreaker. It reduces the game from enjoyable cute fun, to frustration where I'm yelling at my screen ""Give me a god damned CHANCE!"" If the game is going to be enjoyable, I suggest deep, dynamic difficulty so players can modify the game to suit how they play. I'm a slow, meticulous gamer when it comes to games like these. I don't have time to ultra-micromanage everything, especially with very clunky unit management and controls. It's too difficult!2. Building anything is a hit-or-miss kind of experience. There are MANY bugs you'll encounter when trying to build anything larger than a small shack. Citizens giving up on buildings at random Not being able to delete walls at will. Only way to do this is the undo button, and that randomly stops working. So, essentially, if you build a wall that you don't like, or it's interfering with something, tough luck if it wasn't the most recent action you did. Frustrating. Not being able to build building parts in any order. Example: If you try to build too much of the interior before building the roof, you basically can't build a roof and your building is screwed. (See the above point) Custom walls seem to have a limited length. Doesn't make sense.3. Clunkiness of UI, and general controls.  A lot of menus, especially crafting menus, pull up tediously, and are delayed.  Moving troops around requires too many actions, which are also clunky. UI randomly disappears and even F5 doesn't bring it back up Too much clicking around!Everything else other than the above listed is going great. This game is one of my favourites ever, despite being incomplete, and I seriously hope the devs don't get lazy with it. That doesn't seem to be the case right now, because I'm constantly seeing bugfixes and updates. Support these guys! And one last request, when the game is released: Full mod support and API, so the community can grow the game, as well.Keep up the good work; I want to see this game surpass Minecraft in playability some day. I mean, imagine that...Going first-person and playing this game like you would minecraft, but you also have a dynamic town that NPCs build. You can go from first-person, to town management mode (Current setup). Isn't that something everyone has always wanted? Keep that one in mind. I'll return to testing at the Alpha 18 opt-in.			"

								One word: WOW! I love these types of games where you can manage a town/city and watch it grow it from the ground up. This game has limitless posibilities and it is a real time passer. My first two hours of game play was amazing and I was on the edge of my seat. There are a lot of issues that I have run into that I have posting about. One thing I would change about this game is the world size. I think it is too small and would really like to see an option to re-size worlds. I cant wait to see what this game has in store in the future.			"

								Years ago, I had an enjoyable but brief relationship with Dwarf Fortress.  I really appreciated the randomly generated world, scenarios, and the continuously evolving gameplay, but my small lizard brain couldn't accept the ascii graphics.  I tried some graphical mods, but ultimately, Dwarf Fortress and I went our separate ways.  (I'm sorry Dwarf Fortress, it wasn't the size of your plump helmet that was the problem, it was me.)You're probably like, ""Dude, stop talking about Dwarf Fortress. This is Stonehearth"", and you're right, I shouldn't bring up past relationships, but Stonehearth scratches the same itch that kept me interested in playing Dwarf Fortress, and it looks perfectly adorable on top of it all.  Stonehearth isn't as in depth as Dwarf Fortress, but it is most definitely a Dwarf Fortress-like.  If you're like me, and you enjoyed Dwarf Fortress, but maybe the graphics bothered you or maybe you're looking for Dwarf Fortress Lite, Stonehearth may be worth buying.Keep in mind that this is an early access game, gameplay mechanics could change, things will break, and are broken in the game.  Consider your purchase as an investment in an evolving product, and the dev team! "

								I was a little weary at first buying this game awhile back. While it took be awhile to learn to customize my own building. One of the best little village games I have! I love everything about this game, customizing the parts of your building, and building little workshops for my villagers. The Rayya's Children I played on the latest setting, its really cool with the potter and clay buildings. There are a few bugs in the game, like villagers getting stuck but they eventually get out and are fine. I used to have a bug with the UI disappearing, but it was fixed, so I'm happy about that.I hope they can add more decorations and random AI generated towns you can visit as well as enemy villages, I think that would be cool! Also have more animals, it'd be nice to make stables, pastures and a farm for different farm related animals! :) Other than that, its a great game you will most likely keep coming back to play!!			"

								Stonehearth is an amazing city-builder, simulation game. It mixes styles of god games, directing your hearthlings with building commands and designs, with RPG, leveling your hearthlings up as you go and even real-time fighting with attacks and defenses based on their weapons.It certainly has a long way to go; bugs abound, and feature-wise the game only lasts for around 30 game days before it's repetitive, but it has tons of potential from here, and based on how far it's come and the staff behind the game, I can say that the game will only be getting better from here.

								Stonehearth is one of those little games that make you feel like you're playing a SNES style RPG but in fact you're building the towns in said RPG and you get to see how the beginning was in said town. The goblin raids that went through your little village when you were nothing but a small team of builders trying to build up their first mess hall and houses for your people. How you were so helpless then and then near you complete your village and are happy with it you are very proud of it. The amount of time you spend and how much love and care you spent with each little villager with the classes and how you can see them work hard on any new structure you build from scratch. The game is beautiful for a voxel game with the cell shading and voxel enviroment. Now the game takes every block from the world. Terraforming is actually pretty pleasing in this game, instead of games in which terraforming is make or break, this game makes it realatively pleasing in which i never saw any ugly in doing so. If you have the money and are interested in buying this game, do so, you'll love it if you're into the micromanaging/ builder genre. I personally bought the game when it was $30 and was on a kickstarter. This was in Alpha 7, it was still buggy but they ironed it out and added much more content in the span of 3 months. Now, the game is still in Alpha, but neither the less I would buy it. It'll easily make you go a good 15 or so hours on your first town. Even if it's in Alpha, you still have a lot to do.			"

								In simple terms, the game is fun and worth it.All things considered, its an early access game, and we all know how those things can go. A quick pros vs. cons:PROS:- Good sound track- Challenging enemies- Easy to learn- Explorable land (treasures, enemy camps and farm animals can be found)- Many cool professions available for the citizens (each is unique and realistic)EXTRA (minor) PROS:- easy to loot- convenient tracker for citizens- fighters can be in their own seperate units (easy to navigate them)- can save and re-use building models (developer made buildings already available)- LADDERS* Can be extremely useful in debugging some builds and getting hearthlings unstuckCONS:- Lack of fighter categories (only 3 kinds + 1 kind of healer)- Several major bugs (Cizitens get stuck, buildings dont finish being built, scaffolding doesnt go away, CPU heavy when in windowed mode - Thankfully, they are not too frequent and are usually fixable with a quick restart)- Story is weak- No sign of actual friendly life visiting towns (besides dialogues)- Little motive to explore (if a friendly town was nearby to set up trade routes, id consider going FAR)With the cons, the game is still a solid 9/10 for how fun it is and for the price its offered at.As for the game itself, it is still being worked on and improved. As for now, the price point makes sense as there is still plenty of material to enjoy. I've played just over 30 hours and can definitely enjoy some more.			"

A Sandbox Strategy That DeliversStonehearth is a sandbox strategy game, set in a (light) fantasy setting, with town building, crafting, and a military campaign.What Is It Like?Take Dwarf Fortress. Tone down some of the rogue-like elements. Replace the esoteric production chains and mood  simulations with more accessible and managable alternatives. Add a charming 3D voxel art style with tons of character. Introduce some truly innovative mechanics, including the way hearthlings simulate building. Voila.Or, for readers that haven't had the privilege of learning how ""losing is fun"", we'll try a more popular game for comparison. Take Minecraft, pull it back to  a strategic level, give yourself hearthlings to manage, add in a bunch of depth with jobs and production chains, and smother it in buckets of charm. Welcome to Stonehearth.What Sets It Apart From Other Sandbox Strategies?Charming and effective 3D voxel art style.Deep production chains that don't dive off the deep end (ie: stocking a hospital in Dwarf Fortress).Promotes mixing form with function through a powerful and versatile building creator/editor.Engaging, visually appealing, and immersive construction simulation.Deep, yet accessible, statistics and job system with fun role-playing elements.Interactive military campaign that allows the player to engage in diplomacy or war.Intelligent user-interface design maintains accessibility even in areas of the game with more complex mechanics.The Bottom LineI am recommending Stonehearth not only because it is already a successful sandbox strategy game in its own right, with truly innovative mechanics and an on-point blend of strategic depth and accessible fun, but because the small team at Radiant Entertainment have proven their exceptionalism. Since backing Stonehearth on Kickstarter I have enjoyed weekly updates, steady content addition that is continuously polished, and interactivity with multiple team members on their community forums. These guys care about making a great game, and it truly shows.Stonehearth is a game that is worth your money and time right now, as of Update 10.x, and one that will only improve in value as those updates continue rolling in.

								This game sorely lacks key features like demolishing buildings which is very frustrating in a game where the genre is ""City building"" granted its more like town building but that is besides the point.I find that, whenever i build something in this game i got to be very careful in what i do, for as i mentioned before i can not demolish. the building or designing process itself is very finnicky, i have encountered times when it would make the blueprint of the building, but the settler or ""Hearthlings"" wont build it at all, sometimes they build everything but the roof, i also cannot build 2 things at the same time, they will abandon the one i started building first and work on the one i just made, never to return to the previous.There was some work around i found on their forum to fix some of this, but it's so stupid that i would even have to resolve to doing 10 things, step by step so i can remove a house, which by the way did not even work.I also frequently get error windows or command windows whichever it is, telling me of errors, duh, this game needs alot of attention to bugs but most of all the building aspect as of right now, cause building things is why i got this.Other things are, that it has a very... cute style, it's very appealing to the eye, eye would say, anda very relaxing soundtrack.I want to love this game, and i do, but not as much as i believe it deserves right now, i recommend this game, but i also recommend you wait with buying it, atleast untill they fix the buildings, unless you are impatient like me.Im gonna keep watching for progress and i believe, that when this game is more developed, it's going to be amazing.Also right quick, i know this is early access, but these are ""KEY"" features, something that needs to be there from the start, preferably. also i do not care to debate on these matters, either you keep it extremely civil, which is a very hard thing for the general internet to do, or swallow your words, use your bile somewhere else.

								After watching the development of this game for some time before it came to steam I decided to splash out and buy it. I love building and simulation games theres just something that appeal to me about creating my own little world and watching it grow.  I love The Settlers, Banished, The Sims and other games like that. This game ticks the boxes for me.Its a great game with lots of potential and while it may look like a minecraft clone it most certainly isn't.  Whilst it still has a lot of bugs, which is to be expected in Alpha, it is still quite playable.  I found the worst bug was when i had too many hearthlings and they all started to just stand there and do nothing although if I shut the game down and restarted it, it fixed it for a while.  A great Dev team is what makes it a gem too. They actually listen to their community and implement updates and bug fixes on a regular basis.I hope that they continue to update and finish the game as so many early access games seem to get abandoned and it would be a shame if that happened to this game.If you want to support a game in early access then I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

								The one thing I must stress for those of you who are interested in this game is this: it is for all intents and purposes in early access. I know many of you have played early access games, and some of which were fully fleshed out games with minor bug fixes needed. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES. As well as the numerous ui, ai and graphical errors there seems to be about 10 hours of expansive entertaining gameplay, after which you are left with a feeling of ""what else can I really do"". Now thats not to say that the devs have abandoned this game, in fact the situation is quite the opposite; there exists online a roadmap layed out of all the updates and new features they wish to add on. However as it currently stands I cannot recommend this game AS A STANDALONE TITLE. It doesn't have enough content to merit the $25 price tag, that doesn't mean you shouldn't purchase it: it means you shouldn't purchase it for what it currently is. If you buy this game it will be a game you have to revist it again and again in hopes that the devs actually deliver. So for right now I say wait, follow this title, add it to your wishlist etc. but don't purchase it yet.			"

Early Access Review
								Very fun to play, almost zen-like.  The hearthlings are entertaining to watch as they go about doing their jobs.  A large part of the game play revolves around constructing facilities for your hearthlings to use, whether it be fields of carrot farms, large apartment complexes, intricate tunnel mines, imposing castle walls or simple homes for a peaceful village.   There are numerous jobs your hearthlings can learn, a basic research-tree allows players to explore new promotions each time you play the game.  It's currently not possible, or at least not easy, to have every job unlocked the first time you play it, so you will inevitably be tempted to start new towns to get the other jobs and try out new urban planning ideas.  It's very easy to get incredibly absorbed into the minutia, and obsess over the aethetics of your town.  Part of the fun is looking at what other people have built and getting inspired to construct your own version of real-world cities and towns.  Anyone who has an interest in architecture and interior design will easily become transfixed as this game has nearly an infinite possibilities that's only limited by your imagination.While your doing all this, the game does follow a very basic script of events that you'll need to prepare yourself for.  Mostly being attacked by goblin raiders and stray wolves that are mostly random, but builds up to a massive and inevitable showdown with Oggo's army of Orcs.  My largest complaint is that the Normal mode doesn't feel balanced because of this inevitable fight with Oggo's Army.The first time it happens, it can be quite a shock, as you've spent 10+ hours being completely consumed by the cute visuals and light-hearted game play, only to see your entire village basically swarmed by a massive army of Orcs who then ruthlessly slaughter all of your hearthlings (beating them to death with clubs).  The game does feature a ""Peaceful"" mode, ensuring a completely violence-free experience, but which also then negates the need to promote hearthings for combat-related jobs (Footman, Archer, Knight, Herbalist, Cleric).  However, it is a nice option to have.I don't just ""like"" this game... I love it.  I find the whole thing very endearing to play and would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.			"

After a while all my citizens stop doing anything.I realize 4 of my people are stuck in the top floor of my new mansion.Realize I didn't add stairs or a way to get down.4 of my people starve to death.Rest of town gets depressed and stop working all togetherGoblin king asks for stuff. I decline.Goblin army attacks, my people start to defend then fall asleep on the ground.Entire town gets ransacked and people starve and die as I watch helplessly.10/10 would build mansion beast again.

								I want to review StoneHearth not Hearthstone StoneHearth now StoneHearth is a game that looks like Minecraft but plays completely different and is by far one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, let's start with the pros and move to the cons.Pro'sSo first off one of the best things about this game is the fact that you can sculpt and design your own civilization making this one of the best for role playing games yet one of the best Sim games.One of the coolest features of this game is that you can go ahead and build your own buildings from scratch and you can make your own Warriors and upgrade them using the crafting equipment you use you can fend off goblins and Invaders with your warriors and you can also trade with Traders and buy from Merchants that come to your town day and night.One of my favorite things to watch happen is my town progress and my citizens gain level's. You can even have people come to your town and reward you for killing off goblinsCon'sOne of the major issues with this game is the UI user interface it's extremely hard to work with, sometimes it glitches out and other times just completely shut's down and even makes you force shutdown the game.One of the things that also really irritates me is the constant lag that occurs that is unpreventable no matter how much you Tinker with the options internally and (externally, outside the game) you cannot fix the lag issues I personally have constant issues with completing buildings and helping my citizens survive from goblins invaders, because the lag is so horrendously bad.Now keep in mind this lag is so extremely hard to work around and it only starts when you progress into the game far enough. Errors will occur almost every single play-through and it really makes you wish that they had some sort of patch for people to work with instead they're going update by update.Thing's I want to see happenI wish that they would fix all performance issues and make it so your PC recognizes it as a game instead of a program.I want them to make an online multiplayer addition so you can play with AI or other players.I want them to make a campaign for story. Also add more action to the game so you can be full out assaulted and have to defend for like 5 minutes or longer.I want them to FIX something I did not mention above, which is when you ask a group of people to work on something new you can choose which citizens you wantr to work there so you have a spreadsheet. For example okay I want 3 citizens harvesting wood 7 citizens building a mansion and your guards to patrol in a certain pattern you choose.Also larger worlds, larger threats as you progress so it won't be a breeze to clear out 6 invaders with 1 guard(with a wooden sword)Other than that this game is FREAKING AWESOME. At it's current stage it's fantastic minus all the performance issues. 8.3/10			"

As a citybuilder/manegment game Stonehearth shows great promise and while it's a bit thin in its currect state (Alpha, so missing a lot of features/content) it's still pretty competent overall. Oddly, my favorite feature isn't the game itself, but the team behind it; Radiant. Those dudes have some of the best community outreach in the business and they are always putting out dev blog updates, keeping the content comming at a pretty good clip and letting you know what's on the horizon when they can't do that. It's cute, it's chirpy, it's got the foundation for a truly great town manager. I particularly love the ability to build custom buildings with relative ease, though style options are slightly limited, what with still being in development.There are a few Cons though; one, it's a slow game. Incredibly slow. Pace is apparently something on their list to work on, but as it is, I can only bear to play on fast and even then I feel like there should be a faster setting. There also aren't really any options for stockpile flow--the ability to have a particular stockpile pull from others, and it's one of the major things that's keeping Stonehearth from being truly great. This is also impacted by the speed (since your hearthlings have to walk AAAAALLL THE WAY to the stockpile, then ALLLL THE WAY back) which becomes more problematic as your town gets bigger. I imagine some of the problems I have will get resolved as the game works its way through Alpha, and I'll update this review as new things get added, problems arise, and good stuff crops up. If you're hard up for a city builder, I only see this one getting better over time. If you're a bit more skittish, that's fair; but keep at eye on this and I encourage you to give it a shot when it's more complete.			"

Early Access Review
								**As a forewarning, there are minor spoilers. There really isn't much of a storyline, but I go in depth as far as gameplay goes.**So I spent a good few hours on the game, getting a feel and really seeing what it has to offer. The fact that it is in alpha was a little worrysome, given how many games are labeled with early access and seem to die without much improvement or support. This game, so it seems, is different. It's a refreshing change, it's truly quite unique in multiple aspects ranging from gameplay to art and design. This game is most certainly sandbox in nature, but it actually carries a very strong similarity to Dwarf Fortress, and almost seems like a branched-off, reskinned version of it. I can only imagine the vast amount of direction and improvement this game has in store if only the developers remain diligent and active.To start.. As of the current build -524, you have the option of choosing a biome, starting location, and race. I haven't experimented heavily with these options; I've only had the pleasure of one play in which I haven't come all that far. That being said, once you choose your world, you then choose where in said world you will build your camp. Naturally, you'll want to choose an area with plenty of trees, wildlife, and minerals. Upon choosing, you're dumped off without much of a tutorial, which usually seems like an overwhelming experience, however.. This game is fairly straight foreward. After a few minutes, I quickly learned my way around the UI, the different tools, navigation, and issueing commands to my Hearthlings. Before long, the first raid on my settlement had taken progress. I immediately knew the general idea of what to do, click the large, red sword icon, right? It was as simple as that; my Hearthlings ran to a safe position as my assigned soldiers made short work of the beast. As of right now, the game doesn't seem to be too unforgiving. I am expecting that to change as I come further along and mine deeper into the ground.Graphically speaking, this game is very crisp and clean. There are a few annoyances which are more gameplay issues than graphics, but I'll get to those in a bit. The game has a bit of a minecraft appearance, but one with customer shaders and higher quality picture. Textures are almost non existant, but I can do without those, it simply works for this game. All in all, there isn't a whole lot of clutter, which can really turn into a big problem for games like this.In terms of bugs, this game definitely has its share, but it's to be expected. I feel confident that more and more bugs will be fixed as time continues, the support website seems very much alive with devs attempting to help those who experience issues. A few bugs I've personally come across include goblins exploding into sunlight instead of fighting my soldiers, a Hearthling that never wakes up from his sleep, and not being to change to a specific class despite having met all requirements. Obviously two of these can be considered game breaking, however I'm not letting it kill my opinion of this game. Save often is the best fix for most problems.As for one final in-depth review, this game is, as I mentioned, like a replica of Dward Fortress, though with FAR less features. I suspect this game is very heavily influenced by Dwarf Fortress. You have the ability to custom-build structures, or choose from a preset list. You can place said structures where ever they fit. You can alter the environment by taking down trees, creating mines, etc. As you create mines, it really opens up many different possibilities for construction ideas. Perhaps an underground fortress? All in all, in the short amount of time that I've played this game, I'm enjoying it a lot. If they can implement some more features or similarities from DF such as complex contraptions, many more monsters and biomes, etc, I'll be thrilled. Perhaps even a mode to take complete control of a single, hero-like individual to explore the lands, loot, plunder dungeons, and seek bounties, much like DF. I might be going a little far comparing the two, but regardless, the game can (hopefully) only improve from here.			"

								I enjoyed this game because of the peaceful gameplay and relaxation as well as the skeleton and orc attacks. The only problem or dislike I had about the game was the weird bugs that crashed the game and I lost so much progress. But finally it has gotten out of steamgreenlight so I have faith that it will become something much greater, and the bugs will disappear. But for now just remember to turn that auto save on and save every 5 minutes.			"

								One of the most committed teams to devlopment and interaction with the community, radiant have really lived up to their kickstarter pledges and have been making great progress, the potential of this game is tremendous, if you got some spare cash lying about, choose to invest in this team, its going to be a blast!  Alpha development doesnt have a huge amount of playability but each new release gives you an extra couple of hours of testing new additions to the engine, its a cute art style and feels quite rewarding when you accomplish something.

								I really want to like this game.  It's a lot of fun until you reach the point where your hearthlings will not finish building your buildings.  After an exhaustive search of the internet it seems to be a repetitive, long standing issue. It seems to be something that has been unaddressed for about a year.  It is very frustrating.Buy the game on sale or wait until full release.			"

								I have a lot of games in my steam library but this is the one I keep coming back to. This is the kind of game I can lose myself in, starting a play session, getting really focused on building and defending my town, and then I look at my clock and 6 hours have somehow gone by. The latest focus on combat and hardmode have brought a much more intense feeling to the game. Enemies can catch you offguard if you don't think about all angles you need to defend, and the new RPG classes have added a lot of depth to the combat side of the game. As far as developing your town/fort/city-whatever goes I becom a kid again, playing with lego.This is in alpha, so there are still a lot of glitches, missing features, and polish that is getting fixed/added. Building elaborate structures is usually very difficult especially getting the hearthlings to construct them. You can cheat structures in with console commands, but hopefully some day you won't ever need to use commands again and the little guys will be able to make anything you want.One of the best things about this game is it's devs. They are very community focused and they actually stream on twitch coding and art sessions three times a week. They aren't very active on the steam community hub, but on their own website's discourse they are very active.I really recommend this game even in it's current alpha state. Very enjoyable building game with some decent RTS RPG style gameplay.			"

								UPDATE AS OF 4/30/2016- This game has progressed quite a bit in the months since I purchased it. I find it easier to play with less bugs. I have looked forward to getting into it. Still see my recommendations below however I have been able to play well past 30 minutes with no bugs or crashes and reasons to restart. Follow this one for sure. This game is going to be awesome. I mean it is awesome now. I enjoyed playing it. I bought this because of reviews and a few videos I watched featuring gameplay and just maybe I received a lil christmas bonus work threw my way so why not I said. All the reviews and videos said that this is an alpha game, expect bugs, blah blah blah. I knew this going in but they talked it up so much I couldn't resist. That being said....This is an Alpha game and I have not been able to play past 30 minutes, so far, without a bug popping up to make me start over. LOL.Nothing that crashes the game but one of my little people with glitch, I placed a building too close to another and they just stop building, etc....All in all I like it, I'll play it some more, even with the bugs but if you didn't get a little holiday bonus money or it's not on sale, or you're just short on cash, I suggest waiting for a sale and whenver you find yourself with some extra $ you want to throw at something you've been following.Follow this game though. I just can't bring myself to thumb down although this is one of those occasions to which I wish they had a neutral thumb, if that's a thing, where I can infer that this game is fun, will be good, but just not developed enough where I'd recommend another buying it....unless you fall in the same category I did...steam sell, christmas bonus, just enough feedback I thought I'd give it a try.Have Fun			"

								First real review I've ever given on Steam so here goes.I've followed this game for more than 2 years now and would definitely recommend buying it if you are considering to do so.The game itself is not yet finished but has a quite a lot of content. The main reason I would recommend it however are the devs behind the game. They do weekly development streams and are very active on their forums. Its fantastic to see the game take shape and even have some ideas you had implemented in the game. Updates on this game are very frequent and I have no doubt that this game will become something great. You can't compare it to the game I first bought 2 years ago.But if you have a problem that it is not a fully finished game yet you might not want to buy it as it is somewhat buggy at times and not all custom made buildings will be build, aswell as some performance issues that arise at 25+ hearthlings.

								Stonehearth is a brilliant game considering that it is an early alpha. If you've ever play'd a game called 'RimWorld' It's much like that. Stonehearth is like a village management game, you gain a new civ every night [If you reach the days goal E.g. Enough wealth, Happiness & Food] This goal is meant to get harder as the game goes on, but it isn't really that hard to reach.Con's-The building in Stonehearth could use some improvements and I'm sure the developers will make this mechanic better. Once you place a building it cannot be removed.-You are not able to build easily inside E.g. In a cave/ Mountain.-When the goblins start to raid, it seems like they never stop coming night after night. They could use tuning down [Spawning less]Pro's-So far I have experienced very little lag, to fix this all I did was re-load the game.-There're soo many options for the civ's. For example you can appoint them different jobs such as Warrior, Cook, Farmer, Trapper... Each with a new set of uniform & tools.-Very attractive game. Although the graphics are not Arma 3 standard, it doesn't need to be - the games graphics suit the game, the blocks have near enough a plain texture and puts less strain on your PC. -When your village does get attacked, It's not like a few games out there, where you're entire village would get destroyed Age Of Empires, I'm looking at you here.I've stopped playing StoneHearth for now, not because It's a bad game but because I'm waiting for more items to be implemented into the game.

								This is a review for Alpha 16 This game is  REALLY GOOD Pros1- Addictive. This game if you can run it (i have an asus M32bf with a gtx 770 and i can run this at 80/130 frames) is really addictive since you can make a large sprawling city after about 2-3 hours of gameplay OR you can make like a mining civilization that lives in caves.2- Engaging. If you like micromanaging, if you like Donald Trump wall building, This game is for you3- Refreshing. Stonehearth is a game like no other, it combines City-building/Sandbox/Survival genres into this perfect storm of New-game feel.4- A E S T H E T I C, This game has GOOD pixel graphics, and because of this, it makes it very simple to pick up if you are used to Medium-Long learning curves to games.""Cons""Ok this game is in alpha, so what, if you are anything like me, a simple bug or two is not gonna bother me, but if you are annoyed by a villager not doing what you want, then buy this game later when it's a bit more stable.2- Pricey, if you don't have disposable income like me, don't bother yet, try and wait for a steam sale.Guys and Gals, this is who inspired me to buy this. (NOTE) This is hardmode gameplay but there is a normal mode and a peacefull sandbox mode.

								First Steam review here, so go easy on me please!I had been following Stonehearth since its Kickstarter campaign back in 2013, and I finally bit the bullet back in August.  Since then I have enjoyed (almost) every minute of gameplay.  As many reviewers have noted, this is really a niche game, and if you are into a slow-paced city building sim with some RPG and RTS stuff mixed in, this is the game for you.  For me, I love setting up my little town so that it is self-sustaining, and then sitting back and watching.  Seeing the little Hearthlings running around, farming, shepherding, and cooking, all the while getting hungry and eating, and eventually relaxing by the fire and sleeping, it is really quite pretty to see.  Let me detail some pros and cons as I see it:Pros:+Voxel Based graphical style+Custom Buidling Designer+City Building and strategy combined+Playable! (can't say this for all EA games)+Crafting system+Frequent Updates+Easy to learn+Game CommunityTo explain some of those, lets start with ""playable.""  You can install the game, launch it, and play away.  It works, and you can easily lose a couple of hours right off the bat.  Next, the custom building designer.  Is it perfect: no.  Can you make any building you can imagine: not yet.  But unless you are really trying to build an abstract, strange angled, multi-story building, chances are you can build it.  The crafting system is very nice, particularly the interaction between the crafters.  You start the game with a carpenter.  He/she can make basic furniture, building elements (like doors and windows), and a few other things.  He/she also makes some tools, like a farmers hoe to allow a farmer to be promoted, a mason's chisel for a stoneworker, a weaver's spindle, etc.  Once you promote another Hearthling to a new position, more crafting elements are unlocked.  For example, by him/herself, a carpenter can make a basic bed.  Promote a weaver, spin some thread, and a high leveled carpenter can make a fancy bed, with bonuses for the Hearthlings who sleep in it.The final pro I listed which I want to detail is the game community.  Stonehearth has a fairly active community over on their forums, and everyone there is kind and helpful.  Members on the forum do their best to help each other out, and support is quick.  When I first joined the forum, I was greeted by a moderator after my first post, and recived quick help when I had an issue.  That made me want to spend time there, and as I became more familiar in the game, I started to help people out myself.  The developers are very active on the forums too!  They will help with game issues like crashes, keep you updated on bug fixes, and join in the many discussions about the game and where it should go.  They also stream development sessions 3 times a week, where you get to see work on the game live!Cons:-Bugs, you will encounter bugs!-Crashing can happen-Saves are not always compatible between versions-Game is not feature complete-Can't build everything-Hardware intensiveTo explain the cons: the game has bugs.  If you were not expecting that, I suggest you review what Early Access is.  That being said, the developers are amazingly responsive to fixing them, especially if they are game breaking.  Patches are frequent (sometimes too frequent), and they can break save compatibility.  Fortunately, they have 2 branches of updates on Steam, so if you do not like frequent updates, you can stick to a ""stable"" branch, and not deal with the frequent develop releases.  Crashing can (and likely will at one point) happen.  Many times it is due to driver issues, but also due to anti-virus programs.  As the games AI is based in an embedded chrome browser, programs that add extensions to chrome can cause havoc.Final con, the game is not feature complete.  You cannot build every possible structure, there are many classes/professions that are not availible, and the game is not fully optimized.  I have played games where Stonehearth has used as much as 9 GB of RAM!  While the usage has dropped significantly in the latest patches, it is still not perfect, and honestly higher than I feel it should be.So, should you buy this game?  I will answer with a qualified Maybe.  If citybuilding, simulation, strategy games are your thing, then this is an awesome game.  If you want a say in how the game is developed, than take the plunge.  If you like being a part of an active community that is passionate about the game, then hop aboard.  However, if you want a bug-free, fully optimized, feature complete game, then this is not for you (yet).  The game is in alpha, features are in active development, but it isn't quite there yet.			"

								This has been one of the best games I've seen considering it's early access AND alpha. I play this all the time, and I really look forward to the updates. I highly suggest it to anybody who is bored, semi-bored, or not bored. Anybody. It entertains me from it's awesome combat sytem all the way to it's often hilarious item captions. You can fight goblins, zombies, stone golems, entlings, and more! Also, Stonehearth is heavily moddable. I specifically include that there are so many interesting mods out there to use. And although I've never made a Stonehearth mod, I'm sure with a little bit of understanding that its much easier than making mods for most other games. I recieved this game as a Chistmas gift in 2015 and I was so incredibly excited. I had every right to be. So to anyone reading reviews to determine if they want a cool, epic new game, Stonehearth is perfect.			"

								This is a very cute, carefree and soothing building/managing a town kinda game. Think about it as Banished in casual mode, your whole town won't be wiped out by a deadly plague or cruel nature, just simple attacks from goblins, so if you enjoy more building than surviving through series of rage, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game a lot more. You get to control these villagers called Heathlings, assign them classes, see them working it through and even advancing to other classes. (which are not complete yet since it's still an early access, many classes are still ???) You get to craft many furnitures, design your buildings, decorate it as well. (To add to this, the furnitures are also very cute♥) If you can look over the early access and horrid perfomance issue that they're continuously fixing, (I have to use the word horrid, I have to restart my PC everytime I'm done with this game and it lags like crazy after a few days ingame which is still a common issue atm.) it's a relaxing fun game nontheless.

								Wow! what can i say about this game, or more like what can't I say. I jumped into this game at alpha 2. Not as far back as others, but right around the begining and man have I loved the ride. This game is not a minecraft clone nor is it ""stealing"" hearthstones name. It is a wonderful sandbox city builder with rpg elements to it. The devs are amazing and stream every week allowing the community to be involved and have input into the game. Yes there are lot of bugs right now and yes its fustrating at times, but this is an early access game, this is still in development and its still amazing. My only regret is not finding about it sooner and because of that I didnt get to back the kickstarter, but i have been with the game since. The game is easy to pick up and hard to put down, it lets you be as creative as you can get and challenges you at times. The devs allow mods to be made so if there isn't something in the game you want, you can add it! Over all the game art is cute, the music is beautiful and the game has so much more to give!  IF YOU DO NOT LIKE: bugs, works in progress, unfinished games, more content to be added THEN DON'T GET IT AT THIS TIME!! no one is forcing you to buy it now, wait if you want until more things are in the game. DON'T buy it and then complaine about the bugs and problems... Its EARLY ACCESS for a reason. I love this game and I recomend it to anyone. I also recomend taking a look at the discorse. The community is wonderful, you can get the answers and news you want to know and you can give suggestions that the devs will see and could add into the game.			"

First and foremost you need to understand that Stonehearth is currently in ALPHA. This means there will be bugs, unoptimized code, and a range of other things that appear in alpha level content.Although Stonehearth isn't a revolutionary game, it is still very enjoyable. Even though I’ve only owned the game since Alpha 9, I have spent enough time in the game to get a good feel for the gameplay, features, and overall value of the game. At this point in development I can recommend the game for those looking for a fun game, but aren’t afraid to test out builds, and find bugs. In the games current state your goal is to not kill all your hearthlings. When starting the game you are given virtually nothing to survive other than a tool to make a carpenter and a trapper. From there your job is to craft tools, give hearthlings jobs, and start to grow a tiny civilization. If you are playing on the Peaceful game mode then you really don’t have anything to worry about beyond keeping your hearthlings well fed. The other game mode at this time is Normal, and includes some nice goblins for you to fight with. The goblins don’t make the game overly difficult at this time and really just add another degree of play. Personally I enjoy playing Normal since it can be somewhat boring playing on peaceful mode. As of Alpha 10 the goblins haven’t been in the game very long. They do a nice job of adding more gameplay options though. With the inclusion of goblins you will need to take defense into consideration while building. They will not attack you immediately upon starting a game, but they do increase in difficulty as you grow stronger. One of the strongest points this game has is the robust building mechanic. You can build whatever structures you can imagine, as long as it’s within the boundaries of tiny blocks. The build mode is very simple to use and really help you personalize it to your taste. When you get a structure created you can even save it to use at any time after that. It’s a really nice feature since you don’t have to worry about designing each building every time you need it. The game also allows you to edit the building before placing it, giving you a chance to personalize each one without the need to recreate it from scratch. The only issue I have found when designing the buildings you can’t add in items like desks, beds, chairs, or other things of that nature without having them created and sitting in your stockpile. Luckily you just need 1 on hand to add them into the building blueprint. At this time the hearthlings don’t really have traits, but they do have stats. The stats are things like speed, courage, diligence, etc. and can affect how well a hearthling does his/her given job. As development continues I am sure we will see more stats, traits, and other features added to the individual hearthlings. That is really just a rundown of the main features the game has at this time. If you are interested in learning more about the game feel free to join us over at the Stonehearth.net forums. We always have some discussion going about the game, and keep up with all the little bugs in need of squashing. You can also find my pros/cons breakdown below.   PROS- Music- Art style- Crafting system- Builing/Blueprint system is awesome- Fun factor-Replayability-Great development teamCONS- Occasional building issues- LUA issues(LUA hits 100% causing game to lag and freeze)- Ocassional errors while playing- Lighting/Shadow issues The only con that I’ve found to really be a hindrance is the LUA problem the game runs into. You can see the game resources in real time while playing via a small bar on the bottom right of the game client. Once the LUA usage hits 100% the game will lag completely out. This is a known issue and will hopefully be addressed soon.			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a game about building a small town, with the help of a group of 'hearthlings' who build, mine, farm and craft their way to victory (sometimes) over ever-stronger groups of enemies. You have an amazing amount of control over the appearance of your town, and you can custom build every house, road and wall. There are a variety of decorations and tools to place around your village, and there are two main storylines to follow (if you aren't playing on peaceful) - fighting the enemies, and becoming a township. You also get to pick one of two types of hearthling: The Ascendancy, who live in the forest, or Rayya's Children, who live in the desert. They have slightly different skill trees, so the gameplay is a little different. The hearthlings in the game have basic personalities, and the newest update (Alpha 21) brings likes and dislikes. They have attributes too, which make them more or less suited to certain jobs. It's easy to pick up which attributes make a good soldier, for example, but some of the other classes are more complicated. This makes for an immersive town, where new arrivals' talents can mean the difference between life and death for your people. Crafting in the game is simple, and you have the (amazing!) ability to easily queue multiple items, and even request that you always have four beds in storage, for example, so you don't have to intimately micromanage every item crafted. Items placed in houses you design will also automatically queue to be produced by your crafters and placed, which enables the game to run smoothly. Even if you don't have the ingredients to make the chair you want, if you place one when you design a house it will be built and placed as soon as the ingredients are ready. There are a variety of crafters, from the carpenter to the herbalist, and every town will require a different approach (as each map and every hearthling is random). You can farm a variety of foods, including animals, and mine the hills around your town for ore. Traders will visit, and you can sell them products or buy goods. The only downside I can think of to this game is that it is not complete yet. However, I've loved watching it develop over the last 565 hours that I have played, and I can't wait to see the finished game in the future. I am excited for the new types of hearthlings planned for the future, in particular. (And if anyone on the development team ever sees this: I'd love to have some of those pet fighting wolves for my hearthlings, please!) I really feel like the development team listen to their audience, and I have been very impressed with the quantity and quality of the work they are putting into this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys minecraft, terraria, the sims, simcity, cities skylines, stardew valley or animal crossing. It has beautiful scenery, and great animations. You do not need a powerful setup: the game runs smoothly on my ACER Aspire F 15, which does have a dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce) but which is not a gaming laptop. I have minor lag when my town reaches 25+ hearthlings, as the candles flickering at night make my computer slower. I find that toggling the walls down on my buildings at night solves this entirely, and it's really not an issue.			"

tl;dr Alpha 10 review:Cons:Lot's of bugs, minimal content.  Basically, it's a work in progress alpha game.Pros:Excellent dev team, great mod support, fun game with lots of potential.If you want a polished, feature filled, bug free game then stick StoneHearth in your watch list and wait a bit. If this looks like your kind of game, you want to have input into the development, you don't mind playing a game that will crash on you or just break because you clicked a button that causes an error, and you want to support Team Radiant.  Then buy it now.Full Alpha 10 ReviewIntroWhen you buy an early access game you are not just buying the game, because that isn't ready yet.  You are buying a look into the development of the game and the team behind it, and you get to play along as it's made, and then get the finished product at the end of it.  In my opinion the team at Radiant Entertainment are an amazing developer and I would happily buy into another early access game from them in the future based on my experience with them so far.What started out as a 2 man team when they launched their kickstarter has grown steadily over the past couple of years.  They have always interacted with the community with regular updates on their Dev Blog[stonehearth.net], answering questions, and helping on their Forum[discourse.stonehearth.net], and regular (currently multiple times per week) streaming through Twitch[www.twitch.tv] where they listen to and make changes from live feedback in the chat stream, explain the processes they are going through to help modding, and answer any questions people have for them about the game and it's development.I have total faith that this game will see it's completion and continued support afterwards.The Game (so far)You start with a small band of settlers with limited supplies and tools with the aim of building up a small town.  This is acheived harvesting materials, creating jobs, building items and tools, creating buildings (pre made and custom), and defending yourself from enemies.Controlling your town is a a bit of mix at the moment between telling your Hearthlings (the citizens) to go do something and then being able to forget about it (such as farming), and having to heavily micro manage other aspects (such as controlling production of individual items).  The initial concept from the kickstarter was that you wouldn't have to micro manage things in the town, so I would hope that this will be the case as the game matures.The building aspect of the game is developing well, and has had new features added with each new alpha.  You can choose to use a selection of pre-designed houses/buildings from Radiant or go all out and custom design your own.  The custom buildings part of the game is where I personally have experienced the most game breaking bugs, but it is certainaly getting better all the time.  If this is the part you are most looking at this game for I would hold off for a bit.Each Hearthling can be assigned a job/role within the community and will improve as they perform their tasks.  These include farmers, trappers, craftsmen, and guards.  These all work pretty well, although are all work in progress with the higher end skills still to be implemented.  And there are also new professions being added with each update.  Aplha 11 will be bringing us a cook, no more raw food!Enemies currently come in two varieties; undead, which will spawn on random nights and head to your town; and the goblins which are currently being worked on as part of the campaign that runs in game.  You do have the option to play on peacful mode if you want to build in peace and quite without having to worry about defending yourself.ModdingStoneHearth has been built from the ground up to support modding, and already has several great mods available, adding extra content into the game, changing the themes of the game and more projects in the works.  Because the game supports mods at it's core it is as simple as downloading a mod from the forum and dropping into the games mod folder.Final ThoughtsStoneHearth has a great team behind it, and is showing great potential for being an amazing game.  In it's current state you can definitly get several hours of enjoyment from the game, and get a taster of what is to come.  If you decide to purchase now expect to see bugs every game, from the amusing floating helmets, to annoying error messages, and I would recommend using the pre-made building templates until you are familiar with the rest of the game before venturing into more complex custom buildings.

								It's still in Alpha, so it does have its bugs and kinks. However, the developers are honest, communicate well, and work at an amazing speed. In the time I've had this game, it's improved tremendously, and I expect this to continue now that it's on public Early Access. The building tools already allow you to design almost anything, and Hearthlings are getting much smarter at building anything you can imagine. The leveling, RPGesque profession mechanics are truly fun instead of being a gating system. The RTSesque combat is fun to play albeit simplistic, and I think it will only continue to get more fun and complex.			"

								It's a fun little game but over the last week or two I keep finding myself being frustrated and I stop playing. Not because it's not fun but because it doesn't work, all the time. The building process is a mess, often times villagers ignore buildings halfway complete or dont even begin, sometimes the editing feature doesn't work so you cant even put wall on a building you're trying to make, any big projects like mining a large area or placing a big fence stop midway or cant be completed or cancelled. It's ""fun"" doesn't overshadow the bugs and frustration especially when you invest 20 minutes into something and have to start all over again more than once.			"

								I kickstarted Stonehearth and have been playing it since it was very, very simple in nature.  The graphics have remained beautiful (if you like voxels) throughout, each iteration has led to massive improvements in gameplay, and a number of bugs have been fixed - and the game is still in alpha.One of the ""big deals"" about this game is that it takes the dwarf fortress approach to items in the world and materials.  It then layers LUA scripting and html (no joke) for the interface.  Its modding system isn't a modding system so much a content-delivery system.  You want a new race? Describe some things in JSON and boom.This leads to some very, very awesome potential for BETA once all the systems are fleshed out.  The latest update added the second Kingdom, and playing as it evolves into a completely different playstyle.. and as near as I can tell it wasn't much of a code update, just a ""mod"" from the dev's standpoint.This is working out to be the ultimate kingdom builder / simulator.  Like Dwarf Fortress? You're gonna love this.  Like Minecraft but don't like doing all the digging yourself? You'll love it.  Do you like casual games? Yep.			"

			Chris continues to hammer on building bugs and improvements! Presenting: a bunch of community uploaded templates that didn't use to build, but that now do, and major interaction improvements related...		

First off, it is an early release, so bugs will happen, hoewever, I have never seen a team that is so responsive to the community. They can respond with a fix in less than a week!!1!!one!!1! Original Post: [/b]This is my favorite game, hands down, no doubt. Not only is it a great concept, but the execution is spot on. The combination of citizens you care about, and customization are huge selling points for me.Fantasy, city builders, resrouce managers, RPGs, and god sims in one without one over powering the others.Ok, so maybe you're worried about it being an alpha.THIS IS ALPHA DONE RIGHT!!!!The devs are very active, communicate and listen to the community and have fun with it!Every release feels like a leap forward with test builds available too.Honestly, at Alpha 14, this is more playable than a lot of finished games I have seen.Please feel free to contact me with any questions. In a library of over 1000 games, this one stands out in a great way. This is one purchase I've never regretted. "

Early Access Review
								I'm writing my review pretty early despite not having much play time so far. I bought this game during the Seam Summer sale at 20% off after having put it on my wishlist a while back. So far, the game is definitely worth the buy- and has shown itself already to be highly replayable even at its current state. I'm writing my review with the understanding that there will be a few bugs, some improvement suggestions, and in mind that more content will be released. Honestly, with where it's at now, I would love for a Workshop to be added for the community. Alas, it's still in alpha...Graphics: 9/10 being pixel themed. Very cute chibi like, so it appealed to me immediately. They glitch out sometimes for me, but I don't find it too annoying to not play. Gameplay Mechanics: 6/10 (this is definitely subject to change) With the fact that as others have stated there is much need for improvement for AI to properly work. I wish that the tasks they did were in order of your selection on what to build- meaning if you choose to build a cottage and you're currently building one- they will flock to the cottage you just qued instead of continuing to build the current one first. A way better tutorial on how to use the game mechanics at this point is highly needed. I had to google with no help to find out how to place a objects, such as my crafting bench, and had to press ""P"" to finally be able to go to a screen to place objects. After pressing P, I have not needed to do so, and placing objects started working for me. I would have also liked to understand how to use certain classes like the trapper early on. For the first part of your gameplay, you'll probably find yourself very slowly starting to understand how the game works because there is a lack of even a brief tutorial. The only tutorial you get is understanding how the camera options work, which if you play games regularly especially of this type, is pretty self explanotory before you even open the game. Content: 6.5/10* (subject to change) so far there are two playable races and two types of biomes to play in. The races pretty much work best only in their biomes- so if you're wanting to switch it up game play will definitely be harder. Not a bad thing, but I hope to see more races and biomes added for sure in the future which they've shown to be highly likely in the start screen. You are also able to select to be in Sandbox mode, normal, and hard, of course. I hope to definitely see a wider selection of crafting, building types, tasks, enemies, classes, etc. in the future. Once again, it's still in early acess- but even with its options now it's not bad. One complaint I have is that at the beginning of the game, you choose a selection of the map- make sure that the box you pick is not cut off in anyway because that section of the map is the only available area for you to build your village in at least in what I've seen so far. I hope that they change it to where that's just the area of the map that you choose to reside, and still can explore out further. Otherwise, it cuts a huge chunk of game time to me. You can't explore much out of your settlement, and it makes resources limited.Replay Value: 9/10 With the options so far that are available, you still have different scenarios and ways that you can play out in your game. And it's pretty addicting... Reccommend: 10/10 Would reccommend anyone this game at its current state even in early access. Stonehearth has already shown itself to have an extremely promising future. Hope to play with this game as it grows and expands itself. Hope to see DLC and a workshop in the future. :) "

								Stonehearth is a fantastic game!!It's cute little city-builder with some strategy and RPG elementsYou establish your own little town, in a randomly generated world Assign classes you your Hearthlings/Villagers. Like footmen, carpender, weaver, farmer. etcDesign your own buildings, draw out the walls and place furniture. Build bridges, statues, stairs and everything you can think of voxel-by-voxel with the slab tool(But don't go to crazy, the automatic scaffolding system can't handle too complex structures yet)Mine out the mountains for ore, and make your blacksmith create weapons & armor out of them.And you need to protect yourself from Goblins, zombies and wolfs (And there is more to come).Different races are planned, like Three different human clans, Rabbit people, Dwarfs and Orcs (some will be playable and some will not) It's already a fun game and the developer has such plans for this game. This game has so much potensial, and i love it so much. The developers are really connected with the players, both trough the forums and the multiple streams they have weekly. And they are sure to take your thoughts to account.The game is already fun, it just needs more contentI've had a lot of fun with this game and i would absolutely recommend it to everyone.

								I have waited above a year after initially purchasing this game for some simple but vital improvements to the game's building designer / editor, a key part of the game since it feels quite dead ended otherwise. Apart from the addition of a poor staircase generator, there have been no improvements that I can see. The game is still incapable of handling even slightly complex designs. Only a basic square room with a roof seems to work properly. Due to the very, very slow resolution to this issue I think it's only fair I write this one down as a no go. Which is a shame, because it seems to have had a lot of work put into it so far.			"

I think it's a fair price overall.. There is great support and if you have a great idea you can always submit it on the forum, maybe your idea will be added into the game!

								Stonehearth has the positives of Dwarf Fortress (DF): a simcity style game that focuses on individual citizens, their lives, attributes, and abilities without the difficult learning curve that makes DF so in-accessible for people. It has beautiful graphics, and has the option for a peaceful setup (for those not interested in fighting).It is by no means complete - but the team has been steadily working on the core functionality - and the improvement shows with each new alpha version. Update:Alpha 17 is quite playable - once you decide to focus on what works rather than what does not  -Lots of content. High quality UI. They have chosen well when they copied Dwarf Fortress (attributes, farming, combat, 3D) and chosen well even, or particularly, when they diverged from it (RPG-type-classes, experience, levels).The game creates interesting decisions - Embark - Race, difficulty level, choice of locationStart - Which classes to focus on, etcWorth buying not just to support but also to play.

Crafters quickly run out of use, some are just better then others (Oh boy.... pottery..... Only useful on the sand map, and even then ONLY so you can rush Mason.) Game world is tiny, feeling less like a world and more like and island. Wait until 10-15, or until the game comes further along.			"

								Even with the extra help in the newer updates, I still feel like this game needs some extra work to carry though.  Similar to Minecraft but relying on the villagers to do everything for you, you’d think the ai would work more effectively, but they still struggle from time to time.  Even trying to help prompt them so any ways, they still fail to complete tasks or build buildings.  So buy this game only when it’s on sale, since it is a fun game but not a completed game, so don’t pay full price.			"

 >>ALPHA 1.7 REVIEW<< This game has been very buggy at the beggining (which ofc makes sense this is an alpha) so at that time it would probably be a bad time to buy the game. But now this game has enough content and works well enough that I believe its worth buying it now.Now for the reasons: Worth it?/Not Worth it?Worth it!:1.)The managment aspect of the game is realy nice.{you can control what your little guys do to quite the detailed aspect including great buildings great combat detail}2.)Little details.{There is a TON of little details [Events,Merchants,Attacks,Thiefs,]}3.)Great development speed {This game gets updated quite fast with a lot of details added every time and buggs fixed all the time.}4.)Relaxing game{Nothing to say here.}5.)sense of progression{You got plenty of ways to progress It feels good and meaningfull}Not worth it:1.)Still lacking content.{This game doesnt have much for it but a lot is planned for it, and there was even less content when I bought it.{Disclaimer: Remmber point 3 on why is it worth it}}2.)Slightly buggy{allthough the game lost a lot of its buggs It still has some}3.)Mining system is really bad{The mining system is kinda bad if only because most of the buggs I know are there and the game can be quite broken on that aspect.}4.)Frames for second?{after getting deep enough into the game the high amount of details and things being done at the same time could the games FPS could drop duo to the high amount of lets say ""traffic"" going on in the game.Finale though:When considering if to buy a game or not you should think of the genere your looking at first and then at its weaks and strongs.I just want to remind you all this review was done when the game was on alpha 1.7,I'm sure it will get way better allthough its good enough right now as is.7/10or 8/10Hard for me to decide.~~Sorry for any grammar mistakes I have made and failed to notice~~ "

								I've had the game for a while now. It's great, fun, more responsive now given the updates, but the one thing they have yet to fix is the amount the game stutters (even with normal-high FPS (I run the game at an even 55FPS and my Hearthlings stutter like crazy)) at a certain point. You cannot really build too much or queue too much or else your Hearthlings will look like they're making a stop-go walk to their destination (even during work animations). The game isn't bad by any means and a lot of the construction bugs (I.E: not working anymore even when you have all required materials for a building) are squashed. Despite the cuteness and the fact I am recommending this game, I am not currently recommending it until some more optimization is brought into the mix. However, I don't expect my review to cause anyone to wane in their decision (for better or worse) so if you decide to buy it, then by all means you won't regret it if you can get past my aforementioned gripe.

								I enjoy this game very much, the bugs can be a bit annoying at times but it is Early Access game so what ya to do? :3anyways beside that you can find many bugs in the game to either be Funny or just jaw droping or facepalming (had many of those) And i Hope to soon they make it Muilplayer! I were really like to see how they do that, cause you don't see many games like this becoming muilplayer (I haven't) SO check it out! Buy it Or watch it on YT it great for both adults and kids! Also this was my Very First Review. I tired! ;P			"

Early Access Review
								42hrs now, FOURTY TWO!I recommand it because it's fun and it's a lovely game.The gameplay is cool and similar to the Settler and it's a bit buggy...very buggy actually. But the devs are actually pusing updates so it's fine for me.But before you buy, you should check the official site for Q/A and bug reports to make sure you can tolerate those bugs...Here's one bug or two I've encountered:Tried to build a three-decker, then all my workers(not all villagers) stopped building after completing the first floor and just idling around. Okay...fine, let's build something else, how about...a round barn! The workers again, left this one unfinished and the game started to crash ( probably because of the barn, I had to load the previous save to avoid it otherwise the game crashes).So I tried a less complicated building, a beautiful and decent modern dinner ofc, It's finished this time, very happy about it. Oh wait...the windows are missing and my workers refuse to install them, Naughty workers!			"

								I recommend the Davs make this game cheaper to reach a larger player base. This game has some of the best potential i've ever seen, if only it could be finished! You guys have a perfect basically 3D dwarf fortress here and the opportunity to make  game that touches millions if only you properly incentivize people to play. 25$ is just too much for this game in it's unfininished stage as you lose your save EVERY TIME there is an update. I really do love playing this game though. I rage quit after I lost my save though. Anyway, this game has potential, please keep developing and hopefully finish it!			"

								TL;DR - Enjoyable and relaxing sandbox game that has graphics similar to minecraft. 8/10 (as of 12/28/16), great game to relax and spend some time on.It's clear that this game has similarities to Banished with it's own graphic style. I am aware this game is still early access and is still changing so I can't review it like a full polished game yet.Some pros:RelaxingVery nice soundtrackCute art styleNice progressionActually tries to have a storyCombat/defense systemNo tiny BS micromanagementCons: After unlocking and building everything, the game feels empty - still early accessSometimes feels unbalanced with enemiesAI is sometimes buggyLack of important notifications - like a hearthling is starving.Slight lack of content, yet again early access "

								With the lattest set of patches fixing build pathing, the final grievance with this title is solved. Definitely one of the cuter sandbox colony sims out there, LOTS of potential in this little gem, and very enjoyable.  Easy UI, logical management system, plenty of customization, decent combat consideration and a wide variety of activities and considerations.With the lattest sets of patches, I cant recommend this enough! get it!

								I was lucky enough to be a kickstarter backer of this game and I've been impressed by the sheer competency of the devs. They are brothers, each with 10 years experience in the software industry and it shows. They've taken the time to perfect the underlying tech of the game and to ensure the AI works better than any sandbox-type game I've seen (with graphics that is, Dwarf Fortress is in a class of it's own). The game is fun to play in it's current state and more content is coming with regular updates.Currently, I'd recommend getting this game if you enjoy DF, Gnomoria, or city-building games.Keep your eye on this one, it's going to set the standard a new for sandboxes.

								I'm going to keep it short and express my quick thoughts about the game above.Firstly, I've got to give a shout out to Radiant Entertainment who, in my eyes, portraits as an extremely commited and trustworthy bunch, who you can tell are giving their all for this title, and who are often seen in dialog with its community.Stonehearth itself, I do believe got the potential to become somewhat of a rare gem, especially when they implement multiplayer. But even in its current stage of development it still offers great gameplay. I'm confident that this game, that just dropped as EA on Steam but that has been in development for quite a while now, will continue to update and one day become something fantastic.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR - Buy it now, You most likely won't be disappointed!A truly excellent game, well worth the money. I've followed the game and development team for 1 1/2 years and they put other Early Access developers to shame. They always keep in contact with us players, and are very transparent (hosting livestreams twice a week - where they show content being developed, and answer questions, and take suggestions/ideas, weekly development blog posts, responding to PMs and threads on the official forums, etc.). When you buy this game expect monthly-ish updates and alongside that pre-release versions to test out. (Very few Early Access games, update this often at all.)The community is also awesome. Check out the official forums where you'll find lots of mods, artwork, animations, Let's Plays,  interesting discussions and very mature and respectable people. I really love this game, and its admirable and impressionable devs. I can tell you right now this is not your typical let-down Early Access game! I can say full-heart'dly to buy this game. It's 100% worth it.Please note though, if you buy this game right now. It's still EARLY ACCESS, and things such as optimization or promised features are not all completed yet. The devs have worked really hard, and I hate seeing people flame the game, while blindly ignoring the fact that it still has a while to go in development. As of now there is plenty of content, and it's fairly replayable. It runs quite smoothly for an Early Access game, too. I say go for it, but if you're picky maybe wait a while! :)[ P.S. - If you buy the game, please watch the weekly livesteams almost every Tuesday and Thursday - and also join the official forums, again really awesome community! :)! ]			"

								Had this game since the kickstarter and I definitely recommend it. Features are missing and the game has a long way to go before its complete. Radiant has been wonderfully communiative with their fans the game and despite not hitting their kickstarter goals they continue pushing out updates.Stonehearth is a fun little mixture of minecraft, the sims, and town building games. There is enough content to make playing enjoyable but it is still buggy.Despite enjoying the game I'm not sure there is enough content to warrant the $25 dollar price tag. If it goes on sale its worth picking up :D Can't wait for more updates.  "

								Great strategy/city builder. A lot like minecraft except you control the villagers and organize them to keep them a live. If you are thinking of buying this game, keep in mind it is still in alpha. That being said Stonehearth has an amazing dev team who listen to all of your feedback posted on their forums. They work hard to give us the indie we want, and despite all the bugs the game has come really far in the past year. If you do buy the game I recommend opting into the latest developement builds. Typically a new one comes out each week, two weeks at most. If you are like me, itching for new content this is the best way to go. New Alpha builds seems to come out every 3 weeks to a month.			"

								This game is not a bad game. I actually Recommend it. The only bad thing about this game is the Price for the content the game has at this moment in time. Perhaps when the game is finished or when they add multiplayer this game will be worth it but right now it is worth around 10-20 bucks. Depending on how much you love games like these will depend how much you are willing to pay for it. I bought this game just to see if its worth it for the price and for the content it has right now its not exactly worth my money. I definitely will be picking this up on sale though.			"

								Now I have supported this game since the early days of their Kickstarter. Bias could be heard in my review but I will keep it honest. Stonehearth is phenomenal between the unique building creator to the funny item descriptions it doesn’t bore.  Every game is different you can’t have the same scenario. If you haven’t bought it your missing one of the great gems of the 2010s.			"

								TL:DR Do you have a realistic expectation of alpha/early access games? Are you willing to wait for more features and enjoy the current game in the mean time? Do you like the genre of this game?If you ansered yes, this game is for you.I have been playing this game pre-EA release, and honestly believe it is one of the most satisfying kickstarters I have ever backed and is already quite fun to play. It has a brilliant balance of city building, crafting and RPG elements, and rewards the player with a real feeling of progression. Each citizen has their own stats and skills which you can improve and you are able to get very creative with your architecture already with a little effort.PRO- Developer communication, every week there are numerous posts on their websites dev blog covering their progress and frequent developer streams where you may have direct imput in the creation of the game.- The game is being designed to be ULTRA modder friendly, I myself, someone with NO prior experience making mods have already made a few myself without causing bugs in the game in an alpha state. (Expect workshop support)- Frequent updates, the game is beginning to progress rather quickly and is adding features and busting bugs EVERY patch.- A wonderful art style, it maintains a simple charm while still looking brilliant and handling rather well even on less powerful machines.- Balanced progression, the game in this current state is slow enough to last but fast enough to hold your attention.- A fast forward button, I personally find this extremely important for things such as building or mining, or passing time while not active.CON- This is an alpha, there are occasional bugs, especially following new versions, but far fewer than there have been previously. For an alpha I have seen a relatively low amount and they always seem to get fixed before I can encounter them more times but there will be some bugs and if you go in to an early access game not expecting bugs you will be dissapointed.- Villager progression through classes is currently incomplete, quite a few are implemented so far but it does reduce the games variety.- can be hard at times as death of a skilled citizen can set you back for a while.

								Stonehearth, Stonehearth, Stonehearth... Where do I even begin? I absolutely adore this game. I have learned about it some time ago and purchased it via Humble Bundle. Since then, I fell in love with it like never before, as this game is my dream game, one I have always been looking for. It is excellent mix of Strategy, Sandbox and City Simulation. This game, as you can probably tell by the screenshots and movies, have it`s own unique feel and it`s as cuddly and cute as it can get. For now, the game is still in early to mid alpha, so there is much content to add, but even now game can be and is fun to play. Why should you buy this game?  Developers of Stonehearth, team Radiant, are the most amazing team of developers I have ever encountered in my gaming career. You wouldn`t probably believe how much they involve us (the community) onto the process of making game. First of all, they stream on http://twitch.tv three times per week, showing us how the game is being made, also taking countless advices from players (you could affect how the monster will look in game, how some mechanics should work or even name characters yourself). They also let us decide on how the game`s development should go from alpha to alpha (using https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap) so we can choose what content should be made next.  The game have an amazing building system, presented in the trailer. Your little Hearthlings will build everything you can imagine voxel by voxel, using scaffoldings. The building system is very intuitive yet complex, and is being updated even more.  Stonehearth is made in a way that allows players to easily add mods to the game. There already some amazing mods made by community members, and we can expect even more of those coming soon.  If you, like me, always want the game to be as filled with content as possible, you can expect some good things from Stonehearth, In the final version there will be alternative planes, additional biomes, extra races to play as, huge campains to play, dozens of enemies and events randomed by computer Game Master. And much more, that`s for sure.  Last but not least, you don`t have to be afraid of this game being abandoned by developers. They seem so excited about this game, and they don`t slow down while making this game in front of our eyes. I believe it`s a privilege being able to take part of making this awesome game.I r8 8/8 m8.			"

								To address people raging about this game so far, I’ll repeat what others have already stated. The game is in development, and it will get better. With that in mind I’ve loved this game so far, and it’s been the easiest timesoak game I’ve had for years.This game, in a word is pleasant. I've played games like Banished (which is probably the nearest comparable) where the biggest problem was keeping people alive, and the only way to do so was to go balls out at it deal with problems decades in advance.This, like I've said is pleasant to the point of a city-building game being relaxing. I personally play games to chill out with, and I've always enoyed games within this genre so getting something I can actually chill out with is wonderful.It's easy to understand, easy to progress through and at the time of writing (04/07/15) there are very few problems with it in terms of bugs that I’ve experienced, but I’ll detail any below. I do also have one or two suggestions but I'll detail those at the bottom. (Again, all in development stage. I don’t expect these to be addressed three weeks ago, chill your beans)On the whole though, I've thouroughly enjoyed what these guys have offered already, and I can't wait to see what comes up in the future. It's a solid game as it stands, and it's far from a regretable purchase. -- For the below, I'm just assuming the devs are watching these things -- Bugs I’ve noticedI was able to place single tables within dining tables after building the wrong tables. I don’t know if this is unique but moving things around to get it straightened out was a ballache.SuggestionsThe daily report – while I fully respect people’s desire to blast through games like this. A play through on peaceful mode (for example) where you play at a fairly slow pace leads to a situation where you can’t keep up with the daily goals. If these goals were changed from what seems to be programmed based on what day you’re on, to a flat ‘Achieve this level of food/happiness/net value to get a new person’ the whole thing would flow a lot better.A priority system, or a worker grouping could be set so sorting to storage can be made more efficient. For instance If I can make Phil gather a set range of materials (or if stores are refined enough, just tie workers to those stores). That or create a 'Runner' class of citizen, where their tasks is simply to move things around. (Teamster to the likes of Tropico)			"

								It is very rare that I log in to make a review. By that I mean (and I don't know if others have this issue) when steam connects me to make one it brings me to a new window where I am not logged in. But that is neither here nor there. Let me begin by saying this game has AMAZING POTENTIAL! However currently the villagers' AI is lacking though it is still an alpha build. Even then the game is still playable though you'll have many of your troopers standing around staring off into the sun like idiots.The great pros to the game:Great potential. Good graphics that aren't hard on your computer (I'm on a laptop, furthermore one built for office work and NOT gaming and I still rarely crash).The ability to build ANYTHING! Yes... anything! You can even build a giant hotdog if you wish.A city builder that isn't annoyingly complicated.The bad:Well, the AI sucks as forementioned. That's a work in progress I hope. Goblin attacks happen very early. I only had a carpenter and I was still working on making a guard when the first attack happened. I lost three of my five villagers. So yes, this is a bad thing but this also hasn't happened every game so perhaps it is just bad luck.Villagers don't seem to really want to work but that's probably just the AI again. Also, there needs to be a method to making each villager assigned to a specific home or shop area. I have farmers sleeping in buildings on the opposite side of town to their fields and blacksmiths sleeping outside the town entirely...			"

								Things I like about the game:Fight bossesSurviveManage a settlement and their economy to a pointTemplate or free style building availableExpandMany recipes, more with the t2 items added. Your settlement has jobs. You need certain jobs to open up other ones. Create traps and defend your settlement.Play all jobs at once. Serious time sink and time management for your hearhlings.Gather resources and minePretty gameMusicCute hearthlingsAs they level up they gain better abilities or buffsQuesting availableEntertainingGraphicsJob progessionCareer and ability progression for most employed hearthlingsStoryThings I dislike about the game:In game pop up's of Engine Errors that wipe your game saves or that make it so you can't ever build again on that save or map that you just sunk 50 plus hours into. Been months and no fix for this issue. Happens to others too because my friend who played has the same problem.Slow bug fixes.Building aspect of it is a mess. You can insert windows and doors etc but you have to force trick it to do it to free-style building by placing blocks behind them to connect it just to get a windows since it doesn't really allow for that. You can just use their walls but they are gigantic. Their huge walls have automatic colums and sometimes there is no color match up leaving you on huge builds with ugly colums in odd colors. Limitted colors to build in. Almost no different textures. Lots of solid colors that are blue, orange, tan or brown or pink hues.Double doors stick out of one side out of the doorway more than another side. Objects just aren't even. Lack of space even when making tons of vaults. Not enough clay without digging a lot compared to all other resources available to you when mining.Not enough building variety.Hearthlings are just too slow. Crafting times are too slow.Town inventory item limit is too low for a game that you can build on and decorate as well.Roofing tool doesn't like to work most times.Changing between colors on a wall means you have to select each wall. You can't just apply it with an option to all walls if you wanted too. Making the game even slower.You can't use the delete erase tool for anything other than slabs when building. Making this far more frustrating when building. You can't use it on doors, windows etc either.I lasted a good while on the game but enough is enough. I don't want to keep starting maps over any more. I can over-look many of these things in early access, however I can not over look their Engine Errors that ruining your hours and hours of maps when you can't no longer build on them due to these annoying errors as it breaks players game save files making it so they can't play or progress further. I played it a lot and re-started countless maps from scratch until finally I got burnt out of starting over. Game is slow paced some what as a result of starting over maps. Will update this once this game functions properly for the better & then re-visit it once bug fixes are made to the engine error issues. Follow it if you want. I can't recommend it in this state until they deliver those fixes. Disapointing to do so much work on it, then you have to be forced to start over again.			"

								Hey!This is my first review, so don't expect too much of it.________________________________________________________________________________(Personal Opinion)I can understand that some people don't like it because of its huge amount of bugs and that it has been in Alpha for an extremely long time. But honestly, if you ignore the countless bugs (which will be fixed) the game is one of the best games I've ever played. This game is a place where you could relax, a place where you can be happy without worries.  It helps me get through hard periods where you feel like life sucks. That's because of the music.The music, made by Raj Mann, here is just amazing (google up Stonehearth OST if you don't believe me, my favorite is 'Sailing into the black clouds & blue skies)  and everything, the animations, world, design style is just incredible to look at.The animals and the hearthlings are soo cute to look at.One of the main reasons why I bought this is because of its amazing soundtracks (Mentioned above)but also because of its simplistic playstyle. The AI is a bit buggy, and there are A LOT of bugs that need to be fixed (Its Alpha) but I do believe that this won't be a game that'll be abandoned, because the progress that has been done is immense and the team is just so amazing. Posting weekly blogs about how the progress is going.The gameplay is nice, and you can do a lot of things in the game.Want a big army with only archers and kill all the orcs that appear in random events, here you go!Want to build a palace? Say no more!You can make a big town with all the possible jobs, fully surounded by walls.Sometimes a big army of orcs will appear, trying to kill every hearthling you got and raze the lovely town you got.Or sometimes nothing will happen, and you can be free of worries.TL;DR====================================================================================+Amazing music                                                      I - Still in Alpha+Relaxing                                                                 I - Some bugs+Nice art style                                                         I - Computer heavy (Slow fps if you progress in the game)+Different playstyles (A lot of choices)                  I - A bit on the expensive side+Easy to understand the mechanics                      I====================================================================================Should you buy it? [] YES                               [] DEFINELLY             (That's a Gravity Falls reference btw)                               [] ABSOLUTLYNo but seriously, you really should buy it. You can wait till it is on sale or when its fully released,but its absolutly worth the 23 Euros.That concludes my review. Have an incredible day!			"

								This is a very exciting alpha game.  I really appreciate what Radiant is starting here.  Having been a long time Dwarf Fortress fan and player, I gotta say that Stonehearth is a great expansion of the genre and I hope it brings the beauty of fort games to others.			"

								I was looking for a game like Dwarf Fortress but with better graphics and easier to get in to.This is it.Obviously it is not as deep as Dwarf Fortress but the basic mechanics are there.You can build a cute little forest town, or a mountain fortress. You can slaughter all of the pesky Kobolds in the world, or you can be a peaceful little farming village.This game is brilliant. My only problem with it so far, is that you will eat through the Campaign/Story within a few hours.Luckily the replay value so far is in creating new towns etc.Hopefully the devleopers keep up their active content updates and patches until well after the game has gone gold.Couldn't recommend this product enough.

								I am quite a big fan of the genre, and have enjoyed related titles a lot. Stonehearth has everything it needs to fill the  form:- Villagers with names and faces (...and stats and opinions!)- Random maps (...and varying biomes)- Crafting / industry (...and leveling craftsmen)- Resource management (...and storage management)- Trade (...and trade missions/events)- Town defense (...and giant zombies).But it doesn't stop at that, the best thing about this game is that it oozes love. It's being crafted with TONS of love. The devs really care for this product, and it shows. It even inspired me to write them a small letter, to which they kindly replied.That said, Stonehearth still has a long way to go until it's a solid, solid release, but I am extremely optimistic about the outcome and wish both develolpers and early adopters the best of luck.

								It was either this or rimworld and since rimworld wasnt discounted for the winter sale I went with Stonehearth. I love games like cities skylines and i got a little taste of it with this game. There are some bugs with the scaffolding NOT being removed after building a custom building, which makes for a really ugly building. Other than that I would Recommend this game, but not highly until some of the bugs are resolved.			"

								For an alpha game this has a ton of promise. I am still very excited that the devs for this game are really behind this and whenever there is an issue its fix ASAP, not something you can get for most other games these days. It is simple to learn and allows you to be very creative in your builds. You control your town and your hearthlings and the outcome of the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves to build and control a town of people. Even if you don't normally like this kind of game or if you get bored with them, this one adds other clans to make it a bit more challenging. Of course if you want a calm game there is a mode for that too! Hell you can even choose what kind of people to start with and have a completely different experience playing all over again. I got this game on the steam sale but even then I would have paid full price for this. A game where the Devs are actually working on the game still AND interacting with the community make this a great game so far and I would buy it again if I had to. Just remember it is still a work in progress, but that does not mean its not worth it as it is right now.			"

								Its got little block peeps!Seriously though, if you have played Timber & Stone and liked that game, you will be sure to like this game! Development is top notch! I've not seen any other indy dev team so focused on progression and community input as Radient!Its alpha, so its buggy, but there are constant updates that try to make each alpha release stable. And alpha releases come at nice intervals.My only issue is that every alpha breaks saved games. So although you can save, you cannot progress in alpha builds if you are hard set on a settlement and don't want to lose it. This may change in the immediate future but as of my last game it has not.TBH, Stonehearth is the only website where I track & post on for indy games. I support alot of indy games but none is as ambitious as this one, with a team so focused and honest.If you do not own this game, you need to buy it! I'd bet my bottem dollar that this is a game that will see final relese, and  will be a game changer across its genre's!			"

--Playing unstable alpha 18--I have been playing now over 8 hours, that's not much, but I have not encountered any game breaking bugs that some people complaining, only couple minor bugs.The game runs well on my computer, Game play mechanics are good, graphics looks beautiful.I have enjoyed my time with this game and at the moment I think I will play many more hours with this tactical town building/managing game. This IS NOT Minecraft, if want you to search something that this resembles graphically I will say CubeworldWhen you start game first time there will be difficulties to understand what to do if you play this kind of game first time, otherwise just by exploring game and searching what your Heartling's can do will solve many problems. there is no tutorial atm, hopefully we get one somedayAlpha 17 is current stable version, but there is no option to remove building(temporarily suspended).So be careful with that. so do not forget door from you building/house.Minor bugs:1.After Completing building they will start tearing scaffolding's down and sometimes they will forget couple of these in place - solution for this - ""CTRL-C""  to open console, click select scaffolding and write console ""destroy"" and its gone.2.Some times after building they left some hunk of stone or couple block of wood to roof top, this is quite funny, and if you wanna get rid of those, again console, or create ladders to get them.3.Sometimes when you get new heartling she/he will spawn in odd locations and cannot find way to your village. that is annoying, time build ladders again.I have not witnessed it myself, but I have read that when you have complex building you should save game before you start build it, sometimes they dont know how to build it, but this might be out dated warning.After 8hours I will give this game 8/10. (I will updated verdict again when I know  more about this game) I really want to give higher verdict but after 8 hours I cant			"

								Take a little bit of Sims, a dash of Minecraft, drop in some random camp raids... and you have an instant classic! Stonehearth brings out the best of tedious God like sim management mechanics. The cute villagers and charming music make you feel like Notch sold his soul to Disney instead of Microsoft :P Hours of gathering, designing and building await in this excellent Early Access title.

								This is a fun little dorflike city builder. As with most of these, you start with 7 people (In this game, they're ""hearthlings"") and from there, you need to set up for food, shelter, resources, and defense. So far so same, right? The two largest twists on this one are how you can set up the housing (completely planning out a building, instead of either a hole in the wall or a prefab structure), and the animation style. I'm trying to find a good descriptor for the animation style, and I keep coming back to ""cute"". It's not the word I'm looking for, but it does indeed match, in my opinion. I feel emotionally vested in these hearthlings in a way I don't really get from the likes of Gnomoria, Towns, or even Dwarf Fortress, and I honestly feel it's the way they're animated. When goblins are charging into your town and you see your farmers scatter from their fields and cower, it makes you want to protect them. The victories feel more visceral when your footman is taking a giant stone hammer to the goblins instead of just getting lines of damage text.That is the best way I can really put it right there. If you're looking to just build a town, then there are hundreds of other games that do the same thing. If you want to take care of your citizens, check this one out.			"

The dev studio is just a training ground for people to learn and move on to other companies that, you know, release things.			"

If you can look past this issue (and I am sure they will fix it soon), then by all means, enjoy the game.			"

								I had fun playing this game. I really love to see this game to get optimized and be able to play without worrying about the performance. So far, the game starts to lag or slows down after a long session of this game. Hence, you have no other choice but to abandone the current game and start a new game. This cycle keeps going until you get annoyed since all your hardwork were for nothing since you have to abandone them just to avoid the lag. I really want to still play the game but knowing that I wont be able to get far on this game, I just give up on playing altogether.I hope they fix whatever is causing these lags/performance drops asap. For now, I would avoid buying this game yet on it's current state (Alpha 21).			"

								Even though I recommended this game, I wouldn't get it just yet. It's so buggy that it is absolutely unplayable. The developers update it regularly and I have full expectations that it will be one of the greatest city-building games ever made when it is finished. It's essentially Minecraft mixed with Banished. You assign jobs and tasks that need to be done, and your little hearthlings go do it. You don't controll the hearthlings directly, you simply guide them. They can die from combat and starvation, so careful planning and resource management is very important. It's as much a game of strategy as it is creation. The game is currently somewhat limited in the designs you can create based on the terrible AI of your hearthlings and the bad UI. It will get fixed, and when it does, you'll be able to create things on par with Minecraft. All while playing a sandbox citybuilder. When this game is out of the alpha stage, GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!			"

								This game could be great. I enjoyed managing my villagers, building mines, collecting resources and defending my tiny village from incoming raiders. But one key element has made me decide to not recommend this game.Designing and building things is a struggle against a ruthless stubborn AI and clunky difficult to use controls.The core of this game is about building things. Houses, towers, mansions, whatever you need to house your hearthlings and keep them happy. Right now this mechanic is broken. The controls are non-intuitive. I'm still unable to find a simple way to edit or delete plans. If I do start construction and finish a house halfway and then realise that I forgot to design a window, door, or anything else, I can't change the plan. Instead I have to delete the plan, dismantle and destroy whatever was actually built and then start over. Trying to destroy partially built homes is another struggle. Hearthlings will destroy the pieces around them leaving no way for them to exit creating floating walls or floors and even after you rescue them they refuse to destroy those floating pieces.Building a city is what this game is supposed to be about. It's an early access game. I understand. But I've been watching this game ever since the kickstarter and the constant complaint has always been about how difficult it is to get custom unique buildings created. It's been a few years and this problem is still around. Before you make a decision on whether or not to purchase ask yourself if it is a problem Radiant even CAN fix. "

								It's hard to evaluate any game that is in Alpha, so please take that into account when reading this:I have played this game for about 20 hours. (kids have put in another 40 and they love it) and I find it it be very well crafted and well thought out.  They really have nailed this so far.  every feature that is currently in the game is well done, and the crafting system, and promotion system is complicated enough to allow for a variety of professions while simple enough to play without spending a long time deciding what your citizens should be doing with their lives.If you think the videos look good, you should for sure try this game out, you won't be dissapointed.My only conern with the game is the roadmap and direction it is going.  What I mean by that is I cant really get a sense from googling this game on the internet or looking though the forums how close this game is to being finished.  In my opinion at ""Alpha 19""  it is only about half done.  there is no multiplayer yet, (although I believe that is coming)  and what this game really needs is some ""dwarf fortress"" or ""minecraf"" machine building capebility, (using physics, and trap doors and drawbridges and leavers and such to really bring your constructions to life.  I assume that is coming in the future, as it really seems like that is what the game is designed to eventually become.  I am enjoying it so far and am looking forward to seeing where the developers take it.			"

								Stonehearth is a fantastic game, and if you enjoy sandbox/city building games then I highly recommend it.I may be a little biased as I was one of the backers when it was still in Kickstarter, but even then I felt that Radiant Entertainment had a great take on the genre, and a great culture in regards to their backers and fans.  In watching the game and the team grow, I have not changed my mind.  They have shown consistent and impressive improvements to the game, regular updates on the game and the team, and an active role in the discussions.A few notes on the game itself.  It is still very much a work in progress.  Features are still being developed and released, each one coming with it's share of bugs and quirks.  As should go without saying with any Early Access game, only purchase if you are interested in seeing the game grow, and want the chance to add your voice to the development.  Radiant has done a very good job of adding polish to the game as they went, but their primary focus has been features, the rest of the polish comes later.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoy this game, even in it's unfinished state.  Radiant has built a good base for their game, and I look forward to seeing what they can do with it.-NB			"

You can build a larger army, you can raise a group of traders, you can role play this game. However there is one downside and the downside that unfortunately all games have. It's called memory leaks, it's called lag, it's called performance, of course this is in alpha, so if you want to get the game be ready for bugs, i sure hope the devs are dedicated to this game forever, i know i will be playing this a lot, but when the game crashes, i need to find something to surpress my emotions after that point, cause it's the only reason i can't play it. Memory stacks up after time, and it causes it to crash in the end, so i reccomend it in it's future, that i HOPE it will be an amazing game.			"

Early Access Review
								For all potential buyers:This game is very fun and the art style is really awesome. It's like the best of everything from all the pseudo pixel-graphics titles being released so frequently now. I enjoyed playing this game, for an hour or so. The game has a lot of good concepts, but nothing seems even partially fleshed-out. I understand that it is an early access game, but still. Charging $20 for a a game that you can experience everything in within 4-5 hours of gameplay is criminal, in my opinion. While I was watching some of the video reviews/let's plays, I saw that the characters don't have any sort of customization. They have no outfits, you can't assign them to a bed and decide where each one lives. This is fine with me, but I figured it was a trade-off for a more in-depth crafting system and/or building system. However, I was disappointed to find out that this was NOT the case. The crafting is very surface-level(and extremely annoying to level). The buildings have very little functionality other than to make your villagers do what they already do, better. Overall, the experience was a bit underwhelming. It was too much of a simulator(and not even a good simulator at that) and not enough of an interactive city-builder, like I thought it would be. I actually bought this game because I played Cities: Skylines and felt that too much based on the simulation and less based around fun, but in the end, this game left with a similar feeling.TLDR: Fun game. Cool art. No depth. Very little content. If I could reccomend a couple things to the developers: -Add more character customization. Instead of trying to build more into the ""job tree"", give each person with that profession a separate talent tree that gives each character some identity and gives you a reason to have more than one of them other than just that their job isn't being taken care of. -Add more functionality to buildings.-Increase villager cap and allow for more space to build on and allow towns to be converted into cities. -Add more tutorial information. Almost all of the stuff I had to learn how to do, was learned via videos. The tutorials taught me very little about how to play the game.P.S. I will be keeping an eye on this game with high hopes that it will be improved in future.			"

								This is a beautiful voxel sandbox sim, inspired by dwarf fortress. In its present state it has a good portion of the core features implemented, but it is far from finished. It is very playable, but like other early access titles it does succumb from bugs and glitches. However the Devs are consistantly finding and squashing bugs. This game is updated regularly and the Devs are very open about where the game is at and what is being worked on for each new update (except for a few suprises here and there). This is a fantastic game with a great concept, and if you don't mind an early access with a bug or two its definately worth checking out.I backed this title on kickstarter and have been following its progress ever since. It has been steadily improving bit by bit and its amazing to see how far its come. The Dev's have been amazing and have provided a real treat with regular twitch streams showing them working on various parts of the game, allowing the community that has grown around them to get a real good look at what goes into making this game and sometimes having a profound impact in the games evolution.

								Best town game I've ever played. You build up a settlement and things attack you. Not to mention you have to keep up with how much food you are producing. (you can do much more, I'm just bad at explaining it.) As any game, its not without faults. Here's a list of bugs Ive encountered while playing (This is still an alpha, however)-Footmen will continue to fight even when they are almost dead and you keep telling them to retreat.-Villagers often will stop constructing a building and never finish it.Most of these bugs force you to restart your village.A lot of the bugs I griped about are now fixed, so GG dev team!Also speaking of buildings, the current building tools are difficult m as you can only make simple structures. The visuals are limited too, as you can only use  one or two material types and colors for each section (Except roads and floors). It's not necessarily user friendly, but some pretty cool stuff can be madeCriticism aside, it's a wonderful game. I do believe it is worth the money			"

 Cute City Management Game The game is just cute and relaxing, allowing you to choose from ""Normal"" Or ""Sandbox"" mode, it is sure to fit for casual gamers who just want to craft and enjoy the game or peoples who want a little challenge from random enemy spawns.The game on its state seems to have lot of potential in growing further, but it still offers a wide variety of things to do to keep the game going for hours.Good: Solid Gameplay (Its super easy to learn and get into the game) Cute Long lifetime (Keeps you playing for hours) Relaxing Nice musicBad: Minor unbalance issues (easy to make money by selling items) Error messages/bugsIn all of its glory, the game is really worth the money and when all the bugs gets sorter out and updates have been made, its going to be even better.I can higly recommend it even now on its ""Early Access"" state.

								On its way to becoming a great game, but what game that is exactly remains to be seen.What's in the game now, is playable and fun, but also fairly bare-bones.  A lot of essential features are still missing. Being unable to tear down anything you've built being the big one. But there is a solid foundation and a lot of promise for the future and the devs are great at instilling confidence that they'll get there.Currently the game seems a bit torn between macro and micro management. The devs are constantly struggling with how much they want the game to ""play itself"". You can quickly and easily design custom buildings or plop down existing ones from templates. Farms are plotted out and then self-sufficient. But then you have to go in and tell your carpenter exactly how many beds, doors, chairs, fense posts, etc to make for the buildings you're planning.  Most of the game so far is ""set and forget"" but then you have to keep a close eye on your crafters to keep them producing what you need.  I could do without that part myself. I'd rather be the city planner than micro-manage the supply chain.Combat is very basic right now. You have guards you can make better gear for, and set areas to patrol or attack but you have no direct control over them. It's more about ""were you prepared ahead of time"" than skill or micro-management.  This approach could work I think but there needs to be a lot more to it. Hopefully new additions like ranged combat that are being worked on will do just that.  If not, I think they might do well to have combat be the one area they allow micro management to play a key role in player engagement.One thing is for sure, Team Radiant is handling the game's development very well. Communication is definitely one of their strong points. The community is always in the loop and updates are consistent and substantial. Bugs are common but generally fixed quickly.  I get the impression development has gone substantially slower than they initially anticipated but their commitment to see it through is rock solid.The game seems destined to be good at the very least, so it's an easy recommendation. It just remains to be seen if Radiant has the design chops and polish in them to make it great.			"

								Amazing game, cute characters, nice graphics, bugs everywhere. For being an early access game I say it's great. The devs do a good job updating the game regularly which makes me want to play again and again, sadly I can't keep playing with the same town for long because the game either takes a lot of RAM slowing everything down, or the building system would stop working in the middle of designing a custom building and delete what I've created. Sometimes the farmers won't farm, instead they haul other items letting my crops to rot. I play mostly this game on peaceful because it's relaxing, also there's no monsters jumping at you every minute or so. Enemies should have a spawn area farther away from the settlement because they can appear besides houses or inside the mines which sometimes is annoying. BUT STILL I RECOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE ITS FRICKING AWESOME, and cute, really cute.			"

								So, I played the game during 13 hours and ended with 13 hearthlings, 5 sheeps and one pet fox (and a hecking huge amount of everything, especially food). After 13 hours, I started to feel like I did everything. But the game is in EA, and is really good at this point. I highly reccomend it to every city-builder/town-manager fan, but be prepared ! The bug windows will drive you nuts ! At first you'll be softhearted because it's an alpha, it needs time... But those red windows spam so often it quickly becomes unbearable ! I wish there was an option to disable them... We don't understand why they appear anyway...Other bugs to repport : - some scaffoldings stay for ever, same for some ladders- road placing is an easy way to get a red windows party (it's soooo bugged)- some items tend to desapear... - Probably more but minor			"

								I don't think people understand the point of early access.If you wan't a complete bug free game don't buy this.Otherwise, If you like town builders... Well come on in, sit down, shut up and enjoy the ride. HOWEVER...I have been with this game since it's first playable release... wait... sorry since it's second playable, you get it.It is charming, and rewarding. You build up each and every buiding as well as Hearthlings (your villagers) for better or for worse. Each Hearthling can be given a job (Blacksmith, Carpenter, Hunter. ect. ect.) and based on some seemingly random stats, they will preform well or just level really slow.  When you have enough food/shelter/wealth - more villagers will start to join you (I swear they just  appear, no idea where they come from) Yes, they level to. They also die as well... which is why it is important to have someone with a sword handy at all times, otherwise the raiding goblins or night creatures... will end the town abruptly. Merchants, mining, farming all that good stuff with many many more features that will be implimented down the road thanks to their successful kickstarter.Now enough fanboying... is this game really worth the purchase? yes. Is it worth it in it's current stat? Sure, and I would recommend buying it LATER if you don't want to deal with small and some major bugs. But if you really understand what the concept of early access means and you aren't a child with mommy and daddy's credit card, then go ahead! Support the devs and then go to their forums to post any bugs you find! Then we can get through this a bit faster to release.BTW to my friend's reading this... get this, there will be co-op and PvP later.			"

								Awesome little city builder with a pretty good system for constructing your own buildingsits one of those games that gives your AI villagers decent autonomy, so you dont really have to micromanage them.the devs are active and as time goes on, ive noticed my little noobs can build more complex structures without bailing half-way through the construction.there are still a few minor issues, but two main ones that ive encountered pretty consistently:- its still difficult, if not impossible, to delete a building design once youve started it, and once youve started the design, its there for good. so if you try to design a building in the middle of town, but mess up on like one of the walls, your better off restarting the game from your most recent save. itll be quicker and actually work, rather than trying to undo what youve done. And sometimes scaffolding will remain forever because your little nubs think theyve completed a building when in fact they have not even come close to it. so the design/construction system def still needs some work.- youll start to run into issues once your little village has a couple dozen citizens. everything will start to slow down simply because of the complexity and demand on your little nooblets. that being said, the devs have been great and every update seems to fix a little bit more. my village can last nearly twice as long without me getting fed up with a stuttering population! so yea, id recommend it but only for like $20 max. wait for a sale, unless you want to support an early access game with active devs ;)10/10 critters stuck on the roof			"

								The best description I can give for this game is that it is like Minecraft if you controlled an entire town.This is a fun game at first, but I don't recommend it right now because the game is far too content light for the price they are asking. The devs are also slow to add content to the game, so their support for this game is quesionable give how long this game has been in early access. Also, the UI can be clunky in places and your townsfolk while mining can trap themselves and die. The game tries to notify you when they're about to die, but it's usually too late. I think they should be able to build ladders themselves and get out of the mine without having to send one of your other people over to build a ladder to get them out. Also, your townspeople will literally work themselves to death if ask them to carry something back to your town from too far away. It seems like these people could say something like ""I'm not strong enough to that"" to prevent accidental deaths or a UI indicator of how far they can go out to carry stuff back without dying. These kind of things are very annoying but you can get new villagers to replace them fairly quickly at least.You can make buildings for your townsfolk, but I don't see a point to it other than you like to build things. There is no weather cycles or seasons yet and the towns folk have no issue with sleeping in beds outdoors and eating outdoors. Buildings take a long time to build and they don't seem to be worth this investment in survival mode. Walls are okay, but monsters tend to bust down your gates rather quickly. The maps are very wide open in places, so the option to build bigger wall sections would be nice.The classes your villagers can become are cool (there's about 10 or so), but there really isn't a lot they can do and many items are there just for cosmetics. Some classes feel much more fleshed out than others currently. I think this feature will be great once it's finished.Still, the game has a lot of charm and I had fun with it while it lasted, but the game in no way feels finished, so buyer beware, it may be a while before this game is done!

Early Access Review
								What if Age of Empires, The Sims, and Minecraft had a baby? Look no farther for the proverbial answer, my dear reader, this is that game. Stonehearth could be easily dismissed among the ocean of voxel sandbox titles. Upon seeing a few screenshots, I had initially confused it with Cube World, a defunct adventure game that died after its foray into early access alpha a few years ago. Games that employ this simplistic art style are a dime a dozen nowadays... however, Cube World this is not. The premise is as follows: make a village and survive against invaders, mine and collect resources, slay bosses, and construct buildings. You are given a starting set of ""Hearthlings"" (think 'Sims') and can name them, assign them classes based on their strengths, build them homes and view their thoughts through the town journal. Naming them after real people made me feel more invested and attached to them. I'm really excited to see if they'll add more procedural interactivity between Hearthlings in the future because there's a very solid base for a great role playing sim here.From the moment I started making my first village, it was clear that Stonehearth is very different -- for better and for worse. Because there aren't other games quite like this out there, there's somewhat of a learning curve. There are different camera views, zoning tools, a custom building mode, mining/gathering/looting modes, managing classes, placing items... it's all quite confusing and somewhat daunting at first. I think I accidentally skipped the tutorial when changing the game settings to fullscreen (it made me restart the game and the tutorial was nowhere to be found).After becoming mostly aquainted with the systems, I began to appreciate how there are some wicked smart minds working on this game. The custom building tool -- while clearly an alpha product due to general wonkiness and a surprising pechant for not letting you delete misplaced things -- is surprisingly robust. It's pretty clear that their goal is ""If you can imagine it, you can build it."" It isn't as time consuming as Minecraft to make a fully custom house, as you can lay the floorplans and everything can be queued up for you, and soon enough you'll watch your little Hearthlings get to work building your masterpieces. On the fastest speed setting (which can only be enabled in the settings), it feels like watching a time lapse. Very fun to see them work.In my experience, I'm left believing that the AI runs on magic. I have no idea how they managed to program pathing, gathering, build-queuing this good... all while running quite well on my 6 years old system. Your workers will always be productive getting done the chores and tasks you've set up for them to do. Of course, they'll stop and tend to their needs from time to time (which only includes taking a lunch break and sleeping... we don't have room for lazy slaves in this kingdom).The team have laid out their broad goals for 2017, which sounds refinement heavy. I've been impressed with their progress thus-far, and updates are frequent.If you have interest in this game: stop hesitating. Once it gets multiplayer in 2018 (my prediction based on their roadmap), this game is going to get a serious cult following. Very impressive alpha.			"

								It's a good game that is starting to have enought features to keep the game challenging and fun, as well as replayable. Lots to do in the game with your people management.It has a few things that it needs to work out. There is a strangely sharp dificulty curve when you get to mid-game when the enemies go from trivial to world endingly strong with no middle step. Would be nice to have the game scale better.I would also like to see a dual class system for the people in some fassion.I would also like to see other villages. For example: an enemy village that can be ally, neutral, or eventually and enemy village that are not goblins. I think it would be interesting to have more variety of enemies/difficulties.TLDR?Fun game about building a village and fighting off monsters. More features and ballancing needed, but currently fun and replayable.Cheers			"

I don't know, it's not implemented yet. Also, there are COUNTLESS bugs that I've encountered in game. Not just tiny bugs-the bugs were so bad I had to make a new game a few times. Still, great game with tons of potential. If they add in the ability to remove buildings, and fix the current bugs this game will be more than worth it!			"

								Started this game up around 10 PM, ended up playing it all night t'ill 4 AM. This game is very addictive. Think of it as Minecraft, but now you get to control all the miners in the game and set up tasks for them to do. From building hoses to making tunnels it gets very addictive.Only thing I don't like is the progression ladder. To make a blacksmith you need a carpenter, to make a mason hammer to then make a blacksmith hammer at lvl 3. It takes a while to move up the progression ladder and can get a little frustrating setting up the basic professions. Also at this time there are lots of bugs that get your players stuck but there are console commands to move them out when it happens. In the 5 hours I've played I encountered maybe 6-8 bugs/glitches so just a fair warning it is still in alpha, BUT playable. "

								Stonehearth is a (very) cute 3D version of town-building games like Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria, where you must build a thriving settlement whilst fending off invasions and the like. Like Minecraft though, it has the option to play in peaceful mode for those who wish to just focus on the construction side of the game.It should be emphasised that the game IS still in its alpha stages - that means there's only a limited amount of content in it at the moment. To be sure, there's plenty more to come, but this is definitely *early* access. That aside, it's definitely very enjoyable, and the building editor and the like allows for very complex structures to be built already, and a single game can happily last for a few hours before you've reduced the goblins & undead to little more than nuisances.

The dev team is extremely receptive to feedback from players and maintain regular contact with their fanbase as well as transparency. When this game was first released, it was very buggy--as to be expected in alpha. And while bugs still remain, the foundation is becoming quite solid and gamebreaking bugs more and more rare. Stonehearth is beginning to take shape into the epic and memorable game it was designed to be, and the love and dedication of this team of devs really shows.Although it is Early Access, I feel like it's one of the better EA titles out there, and I strongly urge those interested to buy it and show support.

								I really enjoy this game! There so many opportunities and only creativity seems to be the limit. Im looking forward to every update the devs spit out - and the Alpha 11 seems VERY promising! :) I do need some way to control the Heartlings, like ""Go to"" and ""Priority on this job"". Stuff like that. That being said, this game gets a huge thumbs up - and I cant wait for the next updates!			"

								Currently in Alpha 11, StoneHearth shows promise. This said, It is in  ALPHA, and there is bound to be glitches. There is a pluthera of content, easy to learn controls, A cute and innocent atmosphere, and other appealing aspects. But, If you are playing the game for around a hour, without pausing and saving, the HUD will dissappear, and you cannot pause and save, making the only move you can make hitting the red X in the top right corner. It is a great game, but an autosave feature would be greatly beneficial.			"

								TL;DRA great Village building game with mechanics similar to Minecraft, Banished and Dwarf Fortress. Well worth the money asked. Developers are HEAVILY involved in development and community relations, along with consistant and crisp graphics.The community of Stonehearth show how amazing this game is, and how much potential the developers have.---------Where do I start on this brilliant game? I've been watching this EA game since Alpha 2, and have finally decided to buy it. There are hundreds of pros and minimal cons. It is well worth the money asked for (you could wait until the summer sales heil gabeN) Or you can spend it right now!Pros:- The DevelopersThe developers are heavily community focused, implenting features people think would suit the game, as well as fixing game breaking bugs that are encountered. They do frequent updates (Around one every few weeks) and keep the community informed with ""Desktop Tuesdays"" where they show off new features being implented- Beutiful GraphicsI don't often judge a game by it's graphics. But this is an amazing exception. The graphics are smooth, clear, and crisp, it often reminds me of Minecraft (minus the 16 bit textures) due to its simplicity. The graphics are consistent, and don't randomly change with updates.- The CommunityThe community is very well knit, and are welcoming of new players. You can often find them helping new players settle in to the world of Stonehearth, and help solve problems with bug fixes.Cons- CrashesLike most EA games, there are lots of crashes, there are a few crashes here and there, but if you remembered to save, you're in luck, they've recently added an autosave feature, which is absolutely brilliant, to make up for these crashes. They can be often caused by new features (the 64 bit update) - Steep learning curveLike Banished, it's going to take A LOT of tries to hit the ground running, but after learning why and where you went wrong, it gets a lot easier (my current ""village"" is on 40 hearthlings) and eventually you will end up with a small town.- AIThe AI in this game can be, at times, tedious, often when you mark a place to be deforested, they cut it down, but refuse to transport it to a stockpile (knowing me this will be the problem on my end), but eventually they get around to it.CONCLUSIONI believe that this game has a HUGE potential, and that the developers are prime examples of what should be the norm in the game industry (I'm looking at you EA) The community is one of the huge aspects of this game, there is some mod support, but sadly most are either broken or outdated. This game is well worth the £19 asked, with many features still to come.			"

								okay starting off with i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. but there are some things in it that are so annoyingly painful i straight up quit due to lack of control. i understand the ai needs its own personality and the npc's need to do their own thing, but when i have to keep my hearthlings in my base with the alarm because whenever i take it off they want to run out into a goblin camp and loot that log of wood, even though i cancled tasks in that area, i dont get a choice in their decision, so 1 by 1 they run out to loot something random even with haul, mine, job, off they refuse to listen, and because they go out to loot, my 2 footmen with 1/4 health decided to back him up and they all drop dead. would really enjoy a ""no enter"" zone for your characters to avoid (or even better a no civ zone and a no anyone zone) i like where this game is heading, but the ai is to off on its own to make it a game worth playing anymore. i still recommend this game to people because i can see how good the potential is in it. hopefully things get sorted out. good luck			"

								Add more minerals, that can be crafted into items, and used in trading and equippment, also some differnet types of weapons would be appreciated, like a bow, crafted by the carpenter lvl 3, a long bow, crafted by the carpenter lvl 6, a crossbow, crafted by a blacksmith lvl 5 or 6, maybe add muskets eventually, they could be crafted by a gunsmith, or blacksmith, the gunsmith could also craft turrents that could be placed and manned by some of your people, like catapults, very unaccurate but do moderate damage, and a cannon, very expensive to build and a lot of damge, moderate accuracy, and add some more variety of crops, like cucumbers, potatoes, beans, squash, u know a small variety, and of course bacon/pigs, beef,cows, and maybe you could add hourses, they could be ridden by soldiers, or put to work on a farm, give them a plow and the farmer can seed and plow alot faster. oh and add fishing, with small boats that can float along lakes, that way the rivers are at least useful.

								An entertaining, calming, slow-paced little village manager. I have fun with it when I play it (rare as that may be). However, development has been extremely slow. Gameplay promises from two years ago have still not been fulfilled. It's riddled with game-breaking bugs. Once you start a new game, it's only a matter of time before something goes wrong that you can't just ignore or build around. In its current state, it's nothing more than an expensive time waster. Currently, the game is definitely not worth the price they're asking, so I unfortunately cannot recommend it despite the moderate amount of fun that can be had with it. Grab it if it's on sale for 50% off or more.			"

I can play GTA IV, V, Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout III & IV on my PC, but this game usually slows down and eventually crashes most times, and I only use the lowest graphics settings.It IS a satisfying game if you can run it, but I would not personally recommend this until its official non-experimental release.

Early Access Review
								Alpha 21 Review:I backed this game on kick starter (2012) because it looked like a neat take on dwarf fortress or towns.  The cute little 3d voxel guys with destructable 3d voxel terrain and customizable voxel 3d buildings and forts, I was sold.  I have played the Alpha on and off for years, and I have waited patiently for a working voxel based town simulator that allows me to create neat buildings with little 3d voxels.  So here is my review, because the game should have been finished back in 2014, according to the kick starter page.Is it like Dwarf Fortress?  -No.  You have much more control over your people in SH, and you only get 20 people...Is it like Gnomoria? -No.  Gnomoria is closer to DF, and SH is nowhere near the oh crap feeling of running out of food and everyone dies.Is it like Towns? -Similar, but watered down.  Less jobs, promoting is painfully slow and the level up system is annoying.  SH doesn't have the dungeon diving that Towns has.  SH more or less keeps you on the surface and you are raided just about every day by very annoying enemies.  Dang near have to keep an army on hand to repel attackers, or build a giant wall around your settlement with a simple door...yes, a door, keeps enemies out.  The devs haven't added the ability for AI to bash or bipass doors in..years.Pros: It's cute, stable enough on common alpha builds to play for a time with little to no serious issues, save the occasional CTD, annoying debug error popups, or the dreaded slowing down of the game when you have 20 peasants all moving around.  Though I have a good rig, so it isn't too bad.  The building of towns or forts can be fun, but it's also tedious and frustrating at times.Some things have improved, like AI path finding, which was terrible in early alpha versions, UI / presentation, stability, and overall performance, which used to be terrible but isn't too bad until late game.  However, many other key aspects of the game have actually gotten WORSE over the course of development.  Primarily, the very feature that got me to back it in the first place, designing and building custom buildings.  CONS:This is one of the few titles that has seemed to go one step forward, and two steps back.  What's more, the developer continuously makes excuses and dumps money in useless quests, presentation, and blatantly feminist artwork.  Most every picture features a woman being in the position of authority or strength and the male is subservient, but that's just personal taste, I don't appreciate feminism or cultural marxism in my games, and feel with the times, it's necessary to warn people that do not want to support such things, or support it, your choice.I was furious when one of the Cannon brothers made the comment to me that not everyone agrees that the editor is a key feature, so it isn't a priority, back in 2014.  Yet over the years, I have seen hundreds of people complain about the editor's bugs and features being removed, not fixed, from the game.  Many of the original promised goals have yet to be implemented in the game, which has been in development for over 5 years now.  With each new Alpha build, a few new tweaks are added, but nothing mind boggling, or remotely close to what was promised ever surfaces.  Like multiplayer, seasons, or a building editor that allows you to modify completed structures or delete walls.Funny that you used to be able to disassemble houses, even re-design houses or erase features.  The feature was bugged, like workers get stuck, are unable to get all the blocks, or AI can't pathfind and the project sits idle and is ignored.  Instead of fixing these things, it was just scrapped in order to add cool things (sarcasm) like, leveling up your workers, constantly being wiped out by hordes of annoying goblins on day four, or re-arranging the UI for the 18,000th time. Come to think of it, I still haven't received my kick starter backer pet reward.Overall, this game could have been really really awesome.  But progress has been really slow going.  So I will not recommend this game to friends unless I see significant improvement.			"

								A good rounded game that gets recommendation because of how good it will be when finished. You can easily sink 10 hours into the game before even beginning to reach the point when you'll run out of things to do. Right now the game has very frustrating bugs and gameplay progress issues that stunt long term gameplay. But i still think anyone interested in the game or the genre should buy it now. It is good enough to play and it's fun watching the game progress, with regular alpha updates and close communicastion between the devs and community. If you have any doubts just check out the subreddit r/stonehearth to see the very active community.Considering there are less than 10 devs working on it the project is moving forward very fast to the point you can keep up with almost daily updates and watch the game progress. Join the movement now it is definitely worth it :)			"

								I've been playing the alpha since about 4 or 5.In terms of the gameplay and potential....it's great. Basically what I had hoped Castle Story would be.  It has a long way to go, but it's organized and consistently improving. The Devs may not be the fastest, but they're /far/ from the slowest. Best of all, there's been an exponential curve in development and things have been picking up pace without major missteps.  The roadmap has held up and progress makes sense.  Dev isn't as fast as weekly content additions, but I have complete faith in the management of this team and the game seems deep and well-thought out...modding potential should be epic.			"

								I have preordered and bought into a variety of different early access games, and Stonehearth is the one of the first few where I feel like I got my money's worth, or at least, will. Though there is currently not much content, I have been quite content (see what I did there) with the game's current state and the direction it is going in. The game has a fantastic community and set of developers that are all intent on making this the best it can be.Now, to the actual game:It is a townbuilding game, like dwarf fortress or towns, with combat elements, random scenarios, specialized workers, mining mechanics, and, of course, housebuilding. I must also say that this game can be very relaxing thanks to its laid back theme and fitting music.Because of it's early state, there are a variety of hilarious but also game breaking bugs. If you are easily frustrated by bugs and do not want to deal with bugs, I would recommend waiting until later to get the game.I must also state that this game opened to steam early access on my birthday, so I am only slightly (completely) biased. Nonetheless, it looks like it will grow into a great game!			"

								TL;DR1. Open and honest Dev team2. Game is genuinly fun3. Endless possibilities for its finished potential4. Mod support is a thingI have been a supporter of this game since the kickstarter campaign. It has gone through some very rough, very unpolished builds (seeing as this is currently in alpha 11), but the progress is constant. Each update comes in a timely manner and each one is noteworthy. The devs are open and honest about who is doing what and when things are likely to happen. If there is a setback they will tell you. This in of itself is a massive selling point for this game, just look at the mess that is Godus for a comparison. Regarding the game itself, its what I always wanted in a voxel style game; the freedom to create a city/kingdom from the ground up with my own unique band of citizens.Building is fun; you can follow a few set blueprints or make your own from scratch. As the game develops you will eventually be able to make massive castles, but for the current version as of june 2015 multi-story buildings are the new thing.Combat and resource gathering are about what you would expect, but agian this game is in its early stages and will become deeper as builds go on. Some of the stretch goals filled include elemental enemies and several magic using classes of hearthling. It is still in its early stages, but with the team behind it I am confident the potential will be realised. Another commendation to the dev team behind this game is that from the outset they have encouraged modding. In the future I would not be surprised if the modding community embraced this game like they do bethesda games. In closing, its a great game with a great team behind it and its only going to get better as it develops. Grab it now and become part of the community and help the devs out, because you will be hearing about this game in the future, and you will want it then anyway. Happy hearthing.			"

Early Access Review
								I have preordered and bought into a variety of different early access games, and Stonehearth is the one of the first few where I feel like I got my money's worth, or at least, will. Though there is currently not much content, I have been quite content (see what I did there) with the game's current state and the direction it is going in. The game has a fantastic community and set of developers that are all intent on making this the best it can be.Now, to the actual game:It is a townbuilding game, like dwarf fortress or towns, with combat elements, random scenarios, specialized workers, mining mechanics, and, of course, housebuilding. I must also say that this game can be very relaxing thanks to its laid back theme and fitting music.Because of it's early state, there are a variety of hilarious but also game breaking bugs. If you are easily frustrated by bugs and do not want to deal with bugs, I would recommend waiting until later to get the game.I must also state that this game opened to steam early access on my birthday, so I am only slightly (completely) biased. Nonetheless, it looks like it will grow into a great game!			"

								In essence a dumbed down Dwarf Fortress with goals. And, to be fair it does it very well. The progression system in which you have to level up your villagers in order to give them tier 2 jobs keeps you engaged, as does the ability to get goods from traders in order to complete quests.Certainly worth the money but buyer beware! It's early access and alpha. Game is reasonably stable but locking and memory leaks are common. Don't buy unless you're willing to accept these in this unfinished state.Some current bugs are very annoying. Building not getting finish even though you have all the construction elemnets, down in some case 1 single window. Also some quests rely on certain items which you have to buy and traders never have any (or in my case 3 sunflowers when you need 4. And in 15 hours of play no one turns up with the forth!).Overall it'll be a great game when it's out of alpha and patched up.			"

								I want to love this game. I want to play it forever and build forever, but I am pretty frustrated overall with the quality. It doesn't seem to be getting any better over time and the same annoying flaws keep popping up. Removing a building almost never works if the workers get other order in the meantime. I'm not sure how the workers decide what work to do when, but their whole scheduling mechanism needs a ton of work. Likewise, if a building recievs orders, especially ones that contradict previous orders, the newer orders should take precidence, such that I won't be constantly stuck with half-complete building that I cannot force workers to finish nor remove...Likewise the whole grid-selection mechanism is clunky and hard to use. I'd like more control over the selection, and maybe be able to edit and confirm it before workers start digging a tunnel straight down and getting themselves stuck.			"

								The game in it's current state is pretty glitchy but it has a dedicated and EXTREMELY involved staff. It's important to take into account this is an ALPHA version of the game which means they've been trying to get an MVP (minimum viable product) before they can take the time to apply all that finished-feeling polish. I'm extremely happy with where the game is at now and even more excited to see where it is going.Just a small tidbit--I have the first version they ever released on my computer which was really just a glitchy demo that you could only sit and look at--it infact only opened up on one out of three computers. So amazing to see the product release by release! I recommend this game but only if you can look to the future :) Happy Stonehearthing			"

								This game is amazing. I usually don't spend a lot of time on town managment games, but I was surprised at how addictive this game is. the vox style really gives the game some charm, every charecter is important in some way or form, and it's really noticable. doing simple things like building doors or making improvments to buildings feels really accomplishing, and the game, even in it's dull moments, still keeps my eye.the onyl cons are: it runs on lua script, so once things start to get hectic, expect the game too go through some hiccups. there are a lot of bugs (early access, duh.) so don't expect the best user stability ever. the game also doesn't hold your hand, so you may have to go through some guides or figure out how things work on your own.this game has a lot of promise, and I would love to see it's full form.

								""Great game!"" - 4/5This is a great game and I love playing it! Though as the towns get larger and you start getting more people a memory leak starts to occur and the game slowly becomes unplayable. Its not as though the game is laggy at all its more like as you play through the game you notice that some of the npc's dont do their job at all. You think that's werid... Normally I would restart my client and it would fix it for around 5 minutes but after that it would start to happen again. I feel like if you could fix that I would love to make a series on this game showing the expansion of a mighty kingdom!If you are looking to get this game I do recommend it as you can get some really good fun out of it!Thanks! ~Creative			"

								I actually wrote this, hoping to try and get some sort of suggestion out.. The game itself.. Is pretty nice, however.. You've got to admit that it has loads of flaws in it.. And one of them starts to shine through best when you try and play in hard mode. Makes it (almost) impossible to get off to a good start in that game mode, and will really start to have you wondering exactly how stupid your hearthlings are...Anyways.. the game needs some sort of way to prioritze things.. No.. I'm not meaning the little switches that say ""This person should do farm, while this person builds."" I'm meaning ""Hey you stupid piece of meat, go pick up that herb. RIGHT NOW so that I can make an Herbalist or a potion."" Without a way to give some sort of priority to what your hearthlings will gather.. Those who like to setup their villages to have a lot to do, won't usually have very much fun in hard mode.. If you try to plan too far ahead, the game will punish you greatly. As there doesn't seem to be a way to instruct your hearthlings to even drop all of their current queued projects.. And that is probably the most simple way to fix the issue.. It would suck to have to command your hearthlings to get back at it.. But It's better than having all of your starting hearthlings die, because you instructed them to build a house and they don't want to stop building that house to go get a herb until they're dead...For crying out loud.. I told them to go gather some wild herbs, and had a farmer working on growing some herbs, and he ALMOST finished growing the herbs by the time my gatherers brought the herb into town... But to my surprise, they STILL WOULDN'T GATHER IT!Either the AI need improved to recognize that a lack of items is bad, and make it so that getting items that are currently set at 0 is more important than carrying back the wood that you have 500 of or there needs to be a way to prioritize certain tasks.. Like by holding shift and telling them to gather this item.. They know that is more important to do than anything else.. Or even a way to over-ride it and say ""This needs to be done first."" Alternatively.. Like I said.. a way to tell your hearthlings to stop EVERYTHING. could work as well.Maybe some of this is already in the game and I'm just not seeing it.. But before a hard mode can really be explored too much, little simple things like this really need to be fixed.. Even if there is a way to clear all commands.. A priority system would go leagues and bounds beyond it.. and make the game feel more professional as well.			"

								Stonehearth is a management sim where the goal is to create a thriving settlement. While it's a little feature-bare in it's current, in-development state, it's got a smart, minecrafty voxel system that lets you completely customize all elements of your settlement. The game also has decent performance and seems to be developed by a competent dev team. Which is, y'know, rare for a kickstartered early access game.It's also built to support modding! That's always good.			"

								The dev team for this game are very good - the best ive seen for this genre of game. Development is promising, and the game itself is continually growing. I love this kind of game, however, in its current state, stonehearth is probably worth between $5 and $10.The game is very easy - I've so far been able to repel every attack, destroy every enemy base etc with two soldiers (I might have been overdoing it adding the second soldier, too!). Building is very bugged - I've had to cancel innumerable buildings as my villagers couldnt construct certain things or have gotten themselves stuck whilst trying. Being able to watch individual pieces on your building be placed by your citizens is cool but has lead to so many issues when actually performing this key functionality.Progression is basic and unfulfilling - you are a fully self-sustaining within 1-3 days of in-game time. Sure, this might not be a problem, as the game may intend to focus on thriving rather than surviving. However, thriving is impossible as the game cannot seem to handle having >12 citizens (at such numbers, you will see a lot of idling, and citizens with professions flat refusing to do their allocated job whilst there are other things to do - and no, the citizen management screen does not resolve these issues).Keep it on your watchlist, but unless you are looking for a very surface-level experience, steer clear until further down the development cycle.

								If you are into city buidling games, farming,  creating your own army, job management, etc, this game does a very well job presenting the genre of city builders.  The art style has a very cartoonish feel, at the same time giving the game its own charm; style that cannont be replicated by any other city building games out on the market right now. There is a lot of flexibility on how you want to manage your new village/town/city/empire and however you want to play it. With the plethora amount of new villagers coming into your town, you will find that there are many jobs that you can assign each Hearlthing. Build your own army to fight off hordes of Goblins and other such monsters. Loot from your enemies after you slay them and use the resources to help further expand your empire. There are also a variety of landscapes and even races of humans you can choose from; even more hours to explore how you want to play. While the idea of all this sounds great on paper, Stonehearth manages to crumble all those dreams.  Yes you will have fun playing this game and yes you will enjoy the many hours playing this game. However, the one thing this game suffers greatly is the amount of bugs and gamebreaking bugs this game has. It gives Early Acess the perfect meaning of unfinished game, but somehow manages to make it even sound worse. The major bugs I have encounter mostly revolves around trying to build houses. More specifically customized buildings you try to build are very much broken and have been since the start of this game. Builders will continue to remove and build ladders to reach higher areas of the buidling, and be in an infinite loops doing this. Sometimes they will continue doing this until the building is destroyed or if you somehow make the AI build other buildings instead. Also you cannot destroy certain buildings, it doesn't even explain why it cannot be destroyed. It could also be because the way customizing your own building could be broken as hell.One of the most essential mechanic of this game is broken and that's where I draw the line. A game that focus primarily on creating buildings is broken. Instead of the developers trying to fix this, they release more updates on combat and focusing so much into that. It is quite sad actually, made me not want to play this game for a while. I even contacted the developers about this bug, and they know it exists, they just dont want to do anything about it for now. Many other players also complain about this same exact bug. The only answer they gave me is to use console and to type in commands to instant build and instant destroy. Using a game's console to play a game, to even enjoy it is quite appalling to even hear, but that is the ONLY way to play this game without ripping your hair out of your head.I've had a few problems with combat, but it mostly had to do with the Battle music playing in an infinite loop. Other than that the combat is fine and I have no problem with that. Farming, Smithing, Crafting, Etc. are all fine as well No problems there. StoneHearth is a great idea, I really really really really want to say this game is a Great game. I wish, but this game is not great, this game sucks, this game is garbage. this game needs hate rather than love to show the developers they need to change and fix their game. I always look at this game every week to see if there is an update, JUST MAYBE SOMEDAY THIS GAME WILL WORK PERFECT. Don't buy this game until the bugs are fixed, don't even recommend or even mention this game to anyone. This game has the potential being the New way of playing city builders. The Next grounbreaking sim city game, it has that potential, THE DEVELOPERS NEED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS GAME. I know this game has the potential to have a large following, just fix the game.			"

								Well, great game in theory. In reality not so much at this time, as an example, promote a warrior, promote two more warriors, one forgets he is a warrior, starts staying ""safe"" in the village while the other two run out and fight. Overall, yes it is alpha, the game/sim seems to have no real purpose. Merchants sell things that really have little use. Mobs are easy to dispatch provided you can get the warriors interested.Skills are ""okay"". Altogether, great idea, poorly executed (atm), slightly boring after 10+ hours of play, seriously boring past 30+ hours of play. replay ability...mmm not sure it is there yet.Needs challenging mobs, more itemization of loot, more pretty much everything. Perhaps at some point they will introduce it. For now, it is not there. If you want to test and play knowing the game is far from finished after months of development, go for it. Honestly for this specific genere, not alot of choices out there at the moment.  "

								Remeber this is in early access and is subject to changeI have been following this game for quite sometime, and what I have noticed is that the game devlopers really have a passion for the game and will listen to the community and then respond with positive feedback. The game is updated regularly and will hopefully by the end of the year make it into its beta state.For the gameplay it is in an alpha state where anything could change, but it will at the moment give you a few hours of gameplay, and if you super creative; it will give you countless hours. I would also recommend this game for people that enjoy strategy because the game is coming to a spot where what you choose to do at certain stages will effect your outcome of the game later on. Overall this is an amazing game for where it is at.I have really high hopes for the games and am looking forward to seeing what is to come of it8-9/10 for the regular updates and gameplay :)			"

								A very engaging city building title, Stonehearth offers many hours of fun. Being an early access title does mean that there will be issues, don't buy the game if this is a problem for you. If your are interested, but unsure just follow its development. That said the game is very fun. From my very first play through I played for 15 hours because I was so captivated by this game, bugs and all. The development team has done a very good job of weeding out said bugs. After my initial play, I too set the game aside with the intentions of returning once more progress was made with performance and gameplay. Well the devs came through! Many of the frustrating bugs I was dealing with have been fixed and on top of this many optimizations and features added. I am playing the current unstable branch (Alpah 14) at the time of writing this review. Irregardless, I was very happy to see that the team behind the game is very active unlike other titles I have bought. The game is very simple: manage and provide for your hearthlings and watch them and the villiage grow. This simplicity is nice, but there is more depth to be found if you just look. Town building is very fun and very customizable. There is a set pallete of default building schematics at the start, but with a little imagination and creativity there is much you can do with the tool to design your own buildings. Also modding is being actively encouraged for the game by the devs.Many of the negatives in some of the reviews have been addressed, atleast in the ""unstable branch,"" though that is not to stay new ones won't pop up. Again this is early access and with that in mind buyer beware. If you choose to buy this product look into it before doing so. In my short time so far with the game I have been impressed with the pace of development and the game itself. The forums for the game are active and the devs stream weekly on twitch, just check out their site. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to he future of the game because it does look very bright. If you're on the fence, do your research, watch lets plays and see if this is really something for you. If you enjoy city building this game is very fun and relaxing, just give yourself time to get acquainted.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but could not get past the interface, this is the game for you. It's like a god game where you boss around a group of Minecraft players. You don't control your hearthlings individually, you simply direct them on what to do and they go and do it. The most control you have is in putting down a banner to tell a group of footmen to fight in a particular area (useful for invasions). Of course, you also tell them exactly where to mine, what trees to chop down, and what to build, you just don't control your workers to do this directly. Do well, and more hearthlings will join your mighty settlement. Do poorly, and your hearthlings will die by the crude sword of a goblin or die of starvation. It's a fully 3D voxel game in a randomly generated world where you mine, harvest, build, and conquer. The crafting system is still a work in progress, but there is a lot of stuff you can build, lots of upgrades for your workers and soldiers, and you can pretty much do whatever you like in the sandbox setting. Just look out for campaign events sent your way by the Game Master system (right now there's one campaign in three parts, but many, many more campaigns are coming). In addition to the campaigns are visits by travelers and traveling merchants you can deal with. These will give you some opportunities for trade that may benefit your settlement. Oh, and did I mention the game is extremely moddable? Oh yes, this is an indie game company that recognizes the value of their community, and wants to put the same tools in your hands that they use themselves to create content.Right now Stonehearth is in alpha, Alpha 10.5 as I type this. Please don't buy this game yet in Early Access if you can't handle some bugs, even game-breaking bugs. Don't get too attached to your settlements, either; your save game won't be compatible with the next alpha, and new alphas come fairly quickly. Radiant Entertainment is a fantastic company and they've been great about keeping players informed about what's going on, and fixing bugs pretty fast, but some of you may find the game unplayable at various times. If you're willing to help them test and submit useful bug reports, great. If you're coming here expecting a fully playable game hold off and wait for Stonehearth to get into beta, at least. You'll have a lot more fun then.According to their roadmap, about 90% of their custom core engine and technology is built. They're still about 70% on world generation, 60% on building tools, 50% on classes, 30% on the Game Master, and 20% on monsters and denizens. Multiplayer is coming too, but that's a long ways off. It's also worth noting that Mac and Linux versions are coming too, once they've got the core game finished.That said, Stonehearth has come a very long way in a short period of time.There are now 8 classes in the game in addition to the regular worker type class you get as the base. These include the Carpenter, Farmer, Weaver, Footman, Trapper, Shepherd, Mason, and Blacksmith. These provide the raw materials, and food your settlement needs, as well as the various tiers of crafted goods that allow you to advance up the tech tree of the game. Workers wearing a fancy set of clothes move quicker. Footmen with upgraded weaponry and armor are a lot better equipped to handle invasions of zombies, goblins, and wolves. And, of course, unless you want your hearthlings to live in a hole in the ground and sleep on the cold hard dirt, you'll want your carpenter building doors and windows for your houses, and your weaver can build nice curtains and make the cloth for your upgraded furniture like comfy beds. The mason will build stone walls and gates to keep invaders out or your shepherd's sheep in. Your crafters will of course build the tools necessary to upgrade your workers to advanced classes, as well. You can't have farmers without a carpenter to build wooden hoes. The interactions of these systems, combined with the need to manage your limited workforce, make the game complex and strategic. A lot of farmers means lots of food to attract new settlers to join your community, but not as many workers digging out tunnels to mine for valuable ores and increase the wealth your community has, wealth being another requirement for attracting new settlers.In terms of the rest of the game, the building and harvesting tools have come along very well since the earliest alphas. At this point you can actually play the game, and get pretty far, doing pretty much what you want. Want to build a gigantic fort with a moat? Yep, that's possible. Want to build a deep lair in a mountain, with the entrance looking like some kind of huge voxel head with flaming eyes at night? Yep, that's doable! Just carve away into that mountain. There is, as I mentioned, only one Game Master campaign at the moment, so each play-through will feel a bit repetitive, but they are still building the systems behind such things. Once these systems are in place, they will add a lot more Game Master content (and modders will be able to add their own campaigns as well).What I like best about this game is that you can really just play it however you like. The settlement I keep building each new alpha is very different from the settlements I see other people building. Technically the game is a sort of RPG/RTS/Roguelike, but at its core it's a sandbox game. It's a very fun sandbox to play in. While I would recommend this game to everyone, I wouldn't recommend you play this yet if you'll be bothered by pop-up error logs or if your game suddenly stops working and that settlement you spent hours building suddenly can't be played with anymore. These problems do happen. They've gotten a lot rarer since Alpha 1, but this is still an Early Access game in alpha, and you should only buy this now if you have a tolerance for bugs.			"

								So I Kickstarted this game a while back, and I havent regreted my decision. It's really addicting and immersive as it stands. There's a good amount to do already, and tons and tons of potential for future expansion and mods. There's still a lot of work to go, but I'm excited to see the direction that Radiant is taking.			"

								So Far I Love this Game. Dont Listen to others saying steep price for little content i dissagree completly anyone remember TITAN FALL, paid 60 for it and played the beta was hyped for it thinking great beta didnt realize that was the actual full game. Anyway this game is well done and being updated at a steady pace. For those who say it crashes there computer i dont know what they are running but mine is a amd build old build Phenom 955 3.2 Quad with a Nvidia GTX 560 ti 2gb DDR5 and 16gb DDR3 at 800mhz none of my build is overclocked and it runs the game on perfect settings. Yes bugs appear as you can see with any alpha game has not crashed yet though. I stream this game to Twitch and Put the Videos on Youtube so while streaming and uploading if it has not crashed my game yet then i say good work to them better than most triple AAA titles anymore. For a ALPHA GAME its fun and well worth the investment. Pick it up and Support the 3rd party DEVS that put their heart and soles into these titles.			"

								Remeber this is in early access and is subject to changeI have been following this game for quite sometime, and what I have noticed is that the game devlopers really have a passion for the game and will listen to the community and then respond with positive feedback. The game is updated regularly and will hopefully by the end of the year make it into its beta state.For the gameplay it is in an alpha state where anything could change, but it will at the moment give you a few hours of gameplay, and if you super creative; it will give you countless hours. I would also recommend this game for people that enjoy strategy because the game is coming to a spot where what you choose to do at certain stages will effect your outcome of the game later on. Overall this is an amazing game for where it is at.I have really high hopes for the games and am looking forward to seeing what is to come of it8-9/10 for the regular updates and gameplay :)			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth seems (even after about a year) very much still in the concept stage.  There's not much game here yet, but you can tell the devs are seriously devoted to making Stonehearth the best they can make it.  Even in this early stage you can tell it's the most charming, enjoyable 'concept' of a game out there (check my hours, and that's just through Steam).The devs work closely with the community every step of the way and are immediately responsive to most all bug reports and suggestions.The only caveat I can think of, is that it has been a long, long time getting to even where it is now, and it still has a long long way to go.  I do think it will get there and I have the utmost faith in the devs, but don't expect it in a mere few months.Your money invested here is not to have a fleshed out playable game today or tomorrow, but to help ensure the devs can make Stonehearth all it can be.  You won't have a game you can play day in and day out... just yet.. but it will happen and it will be wonderful.Edit:  I've changed my recommendation to NO for the time being.  There's just too little game here for the high price they're charging.  That high price was fine for kickstarter where you were investing, but now they're selling it on Steam and there just isn't much of a game here for that kind of money.  I also have concerns about how long development is taking.  Don't forget, this game has been in development for two years before it hit Steam early access. Over two years now and frankly, not much has happened for such a long dev cycle.  I honestly think the devs have gotten in over their heads and don't quite know how to dig themselves out of this hole.I'll happily change to Recommended when I see this game kick into high gear, but for now, it's 'wait and see'.Update:  I have to say after ANOTHER YEAR, the devs continue to dig themselve into a hole over their overly complicated approach to hearthling building process - to the detriment of the rest of the game.  The devs seem not to know they are fighting a loosing battle with the manual building process they've tried to implement.  A process so inherently complicated NASA couldn't figure it out.  But still they persist.I'm afraid the game will go nowhere now.  All the 'positive' reviews are based on just a few hours play time and ignore the deep-seated issue of a building process in the game that doesn't work.We could have had the nice rolling hills we were promised early on instead of the 'cliff' design we have now because it was easier.  If all the dev time was applied to landscape rather than this sink hole they've gotten themselves into with building, we'd have a glorious game by now.  And a finsished one.			"

Early Access Review
								Oooooookay!!! Here is my review, I'm very torn over this game and its for this reason. BUGS. The game isn't ""broken"", even in pre-alpha. It is a very playable and fun game IF you can make it long enough without a UI or engine crash, Bear with me as this is kind of long, but very worth the read if you want an HONEST review of the product youre buying Pros:*SUPER FUN- Ive played many RPG's, RTS's, etc. but this game is one of the most mind numbingly addicting games I have ever played.*Complete Sandbox- Like Minecraft, but better.*Ranking Systems- Hearthlings rank up in their profession, giving them cool perks.*Versatility- Plotting out farmland, building houses around designated land, etc. You build YOUR town how YOU want. To a point at this stage in the game.*GEAR- I love love love the armor and weapon progression for your soldiers*Custom building- You arent stuck to templates, although they are provided. Cons:*BUGGY AF- Remember, it's still in alpha. However, nothing is more frustrating than getting so far into a game then recieving a pop-up ""UI Crash"" report. Seems to happen every hour. Villagers glitch into walls, they wander off miles just to collect random sh*t on the ground, usually dying in the process. They sit and DIE when being attacked. Guards don't wake up from sleep to respond to threats.... this is a big deal when invaders come at NIGHT only and all of your guards are sleeping. Needless to say, the bugs make the game frustrating as hell at times. Once, my entire village got stuck in defense mode, starving to death looking out for enemies that weren't there. *LACK OF EDITING- after or during building process. This is probably the single handedly most frustrating aspect of this game. If you design a massive, beautiful building, spend the time and resources to build it, then realize you fuzzed up, youre SOL. You have to tear down adn rebuild the entire thing, which can take the better half of an hour.  *Villagers forget/refuse to do assignments. Sometimes it is simply because they have a long checklist before they get to that particular assignment. However, many times, they will just stop building walls, digging caves, or collecting resources. And no matter how many times you remind them, they will sit there and do nothing instead.*Mining is sloppy. There is no realistic ability to build UP inside caverns, you have to always dig down.... which is annoying to say the least. *Lack of defensive features...This broke my heart. Sure you can build a mkaeshift stone wall. Sure you can build a really tall building and call it a guard tower, but in a game where you are attacked by zombies and skeletons every night, this game NEEDS operational wartime structures. Maybe a tower your guards actually post themselves in, or a palisade where an archer <--also much needed--> can be stationed. Especially when you go to war with the goblin chieftans, they attack, steal, and raid you every chance they get. It would be nice to see more organized troop and defense structures, as well as a more convienent way to get up to different floors of buildings. Overall, I still think this game is amazing. Please don't be turned off from my review. I refuse to sugar coat it for you. The price tag is too high to lie to you. HOWEVER, I stand by my opinion that this game is beautiful, the soundtrack is wonderful and overall this piece has some fantastic potential. I will continue to play this game, and I STRONGLY urge you to support the development of this game and buy it. The devs care, releasing updates and bug fixes periodically, Buggy? yes. Lacking? Barely, but yes. But its still in alpha!  My rating comes to an 8/10 in its current state! I think this can and will quickly be a game to watch though, as long as the community continues to support it.			"

								Early Access city building game that has all the main features: mining, harvesting and building. But you also have classes and the ability to create your own buildings and customise them and your town with extras.It was pretty buggy at first as you would expect and I didn't play it for quite a while, but now new features (desert biome, more classes, monsters) have been added and bugs are being busted in every update. This has made the game really enjoyable to play now. The art style is really great too. "

Early Access Review
								A very engaging city building title, Stonehearth offers many hours of fun. Being an early access title does mean that there will be issues, don't buy the game if this is a problem for you. If your are interested, but unsure just follow its development. That said the game is very fun. From my very first play through I played for 15 hours because I was so captivated by this game, bugs and all. The development team has done a very good job of weeding out said bugs. After my initial play, I too set the game aside with the intentions of returning once more progress was made with performance and gameplay. Well the devs came through! Many of the frustrating bugs I was dealing with have been fixed and on top of this many optimizations and features added. I am playing the current unstable branch (Alpah 14) at the time of writing this review. Irregardless, I was very happy to see that the team behind the game is very active unlike other titles I have bought. The game is very simple: manage and provide for your hearthlings and watch them and the villiage grow. This simplicity is nice, but there is more depth to be found if you just look. Town building is very fun and very customizable. There is a set pallete of default building schematics at the start, but with a little imagination and creativity there is much you can do with the tool to design your own buildings. Also modding is being actively encouraged for the game by the devs.Many of the negatives in some of the reviews have been addressed, atleast in the ""unstable branch,"" though that is not to stay new ones won't pop up. Again this is early access and with that in mind buyer beware. If you choose to buy this product look into it before doing so. In my short time so far with the game I have been impressed with the pace of development and the game itself. The forums for the game are active and the devs stream weekly on twitch, just check out their site. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to he future of the game because it does look very bright. If you're on the fence, do your research, watch lets plays and see if this is really something for you. If you enjoy city building this game is very fun and relaxing, just give yourself time to get acquainted.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but could not get past the interface, this is the game for you. It's like a god game where you boss around a group of Minecraft players. You don't control your hearthlings individually, you simply direct them on what to do and they go and do it. The most control you have is in putting down a banner to tell a group of footmen to fight in a particular area (useful for invasions). Of course, you also tell them exactly where to mine, what trees to chop down, and what to build, you just don't control your workers to do this directly. Do well, and more hearthlings will join your mighty settlement. Do poorly, and your hearthlings will die by the crude sword of a goblin or die of starvation. It's a fully 3D voxel game in a randomly generated world where you mine, harvest, build, and conquer. The crafting system is still a work in progress, but there is a lot of stuff you can build, lots of upgrades for your workers and soldiers, and you can pretty much do whatever you like in the sandbox setting. Just look out for campaign events sent your way by the Game Master system (right now there's one campaign in three parts, but many, many more campaigns are coming). In addition to the campaigns are visits by travelers and traveling merchants you can deal with. These will give you some opportunities for trade that may benefit your settlement. Oh, and did I mention the game is extremely moddable? Oh yes, this is an indie game company that recognizes the value of their community, and wants to put the same tools in your hands that they use themselves to create content.Right now Stonehearth is in alpha, Alpha 10.5 as I type this. Please don't buy this game yet in Early Access if you can't handle some bugs, even game-breaking bugs. Don't get too attached to your settlements, either; your save game won't be compatible with the next alpha, and new alphas come fairly quickly. Radiant Entertainment is a fantastic company and they've been great about keeping players informed about what's going on, and fixing bugs pretty fast, but some of you may find the game unplayable at various times. If you're willing to help them test and submit useful bug reports, great. If you're coming here expecting a fully playable game hold off and wait for Stonehearth to get into beta, at least. You'll have a lot more fun then.According to their roadmap, about 90% of their custom core engine and technology is built. They're still about 70% on world generation, 60% on building tools, 50% on classes, 30% on the Game Master, and 20% on monsters and denizens. Multiplayer is coming too, but that's a long ways off. It's also worth noting that Mac and Linux versions are coming too, once they've got the core game finished.That said, Stonehearth has come a very long way in a short period of time.There are now 8 classes in the game in addition to the regular worker type class you get as the base. These include the Carpenter, Farmer, Weaver, Footman, Trapper, Shepherd, Mason, and Blacksmith. These provide the raw materials, and food your settlement needs, as well as the various tiers of crafted goods that allow you to advance up the tech tree of the game. Workers wearing a fancy set of clothes move quicker. Footmen with upgraded weaponry and armor are a lot better equipped to handle invasions of zombies, goblins, and wolves. And, of course, unless you want your hearthlings to live in a hole in the ground and sleep on the cold hard dirt, you'll want your carpenter building doors and windows for your houses, and your weaver can build nice curtains and make the cloth for your upgraded furniture like comfy beds. The mason will build stone walls and gates to keep invaders out or your shepherd's sheep in. Your crafters will of course build the tools necessary to upgrade your workers to advanced classes, as well. You can't have farmers without a carpenter to build wooden hoes. The interactions of these systems, combined with the need to manage your limited workforce, make the game complex and strategic. A lot of farmers means lots of food to attract new settlers to join your community, but not as many workers digging out tunnels to mine for valuable ores and increase the wealth your community has, wealth being another requirement for attracting new settlers.In terms of the rest of the game, the building and harvesting tools have come along very well since the earliest alphas. At this point you can actually play the game, and get pretty far, doing pretty much what you want. Want to build a gigantic fort with a moat? Yep, that's possible. Want to build a deep lair in a mountain, with the entrance looking like some kind of huge voxel head with flaming eyes at night? Yep, that's doable! Just carve away into that mountain. There is, as I mentioned, only one Game Master campaign at the moment, so each play-through will feel a bit repetitive, but they are still building the systems behind such things. Once these systems are in place, they will add a lot more Game Master content (and modders will be able to add their own campaigns as well).What I like best about this game is that you can really just play it however you like. The settlement I keep building each new alpha is very different from the settlements I see other people building. Technically the game is a sort of RPG/RTS/Roguelike, but at its core it's a sandbox game. It's a very fun sandbox to play in. While I would recommend this game to everyone, I wouldn't recommend you play this yet if you'll be bothered by pop-up error logs or if your game suddenly stops working and that settlement you spent hours building suddenly can't be played with anymore. These problems do happen. They've gotten a lot rarer since Alpha 1, but this is still an Early Access game in alpha, and you should only buy this now if you have a tolerance for bugs.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a highly enjoyable, in development, town building game. I have spent many hours building towns, learning the game, and enjoying the new game aspects they are adding from patch to patch as well as the bug fixes.With all of the good things however, there are a few bad.- The map generation takes quite a while per map roll (time consuming when looking for specific setups)- Save files are not compatible with updates, meaning you will need to restart each time there's an updateThese two things are not game breaking major, and they are wanting to implement the backward compatibility with save files, to prevent the need to constantly restart with updates, so it should no longer be a problem when they implement it.This game offers unique textures and means to build your town as well as prevents the need to have them always be building whatever is placed, which helps prevent accidents. This lets you build roads, houses, and other structures the way you want it. Do you want a flat area? Doable, do you want a roof-less house? Doable. Multi-structured mansion? Doable. Throw your guys in a hole and never able to get out? This can also be done, and those who are fans of the Tycoon games, such as Rollercoaster Tycoon, you will be familiar with the ability to trap your visitors where they cannot leave, or killing them with rides. Make this your own experience with the city and enjoy yourself as you do so.I will modify and go into more detail with this review as time goes on and as the game develops.Update 11/27/2015:This game has received quite a few updates since the original review. They have added the ability to create multi-tiered structures in the game, however this feature is a bit wonky and not 100% working in my opinion, as the settlers will often fail to build the bottom half of the house before the upper half or not build the building at all. They have also improved the errors that may happen in the game - if something were to bug out, it is no longer in a nasty developer box, but rather something a bit more user friendly to understand and depending on what fails, offers instructions on fixing the issue.There are some present AI issues in the game that can make it a bit frustrating to have a large amount of tasks, I've been able to circumvent this issue in the developer versions of Alpha 13 - which is said to fix the AI issues in regards to building, etc, but may not be 100% done yet - by removing the request and redoing it or suspending/pausing the task then resuming it. Assuming there isnt still a ton of things already requested for them to do, they often figure out that it still needs to be completed. The game is still very much in a playable state and I still highly enjoy it and my original review still stands at this point in time. They are making progres toward finishing the game and adding features. Please note that at the time of this update, that saves are still not backward/forward compatible. And my original con of the map generation taking a lot of time still stands as well, but it feels a bit faster than it once was.A few other major things they've added are a new style of settler and a new map biome type - the desert and raya's children. I've been able to play around with them in the developer build and its a very interesting change of pace to the normal gameplay that I had grown to love. This in combination with new professions and crafting systems in place permit for a more diverse and intricate creation system, making it feel like the crafters actually rely on each other to make the final product rather than it being a one man army. They have also vastly improved the game experience with making it run faster on my machine, and offering various options to help with slower/older machines as well as bug fixes. I haven't had massive bugs in regards to the UI or other pop-ups outside of one where I was clicking on buttons rapidly.So let me mark off my cons at this point in time in regards to Alpha 12/Dev Alpha 13:- Some AI issues in regards to tasks where they fail to complete (see above for my solution and some info)- Map generation still takes too much time- Save files are still not backward/forward compatibleThis said, let me list some pros of this game thus far- Multi-tiered structures- Intricate crafting system- Ability to trap your settlers- Aggressive (normal surviving) & Peaceful mode (for building)- Various travelling merchantsThere's a lot more as well that I would list off but this review would end up to be too long.

								Great game for alpha. yes bugs, yes some people have crashes, thats all expected. But i'm afraid for myself personally, that after night 10-15 I've run out of anything to do. You build houses, and then........ um..... well thats it. Even on the ""survival mode"" you can get by the entire survival mode with 1-2 warriors. Or just build a wall or a fence and you've outsmarted the game.Only thing i've found lately to make it a bit more challenging, is to increase the number of goblins or undead attacking me to keep it difficult. After about day 15 or so the workers kind of stop caring as much about getting things done, they also seem to get confused with where their food is even when theres a stockpile next door to them. I'm personally having a hard time with the food concept of the game, and NO I dont want it to be a sim. But why do I need 18 acres full of food to get one more person? No one eats much but for some reason I need SO MUCH FOOD. I feel like this game doesnt have any point after you made your first couple cute houses and made room for all the food you will need to get more people so you can...... so you can have more people to.... to build more houses.. well you get the picture. Can't reccomend in current state or for that price. Look forward to see what's on the horizon for this game. I hope it doesnt end up like Castle Story.			"

								First off let me say this: I DO recommend this game, because it's proof of consept is so grand, and it promises everything I have always wanted in a base-building game. That being said the price of $25 is a little steep for a game that is barely playable. I have put about 20 hours into it off steam, and will surely put more. If you are  reading this i am sure you understand the game is in ALPHA and is pretty buggy, however the devs are great at talking to their community and are squashing bugs constantly,There are several Game breaking bugs within the main mechanics that make it unplayable.The building UI is a great idea, however the coding isn't right on it yet, Walls not being build, crashing when creating a big building, hearthlings not building a roof for your house for virtualy no reason. there are ways to make buildings with multiple walls, but most of them are tedious, requiring manual wall building, planning and erasing to get the building to work right, that is if you game doesnt crash on wall building or just make it so that you can not plan buildings anymore without save scumming. Other than the bugs, there are features that are not present (some that they plan to add) that i belive are needed to round out the game and make it playable. I will list them here in hopes of Dev eyes and to establish discorse :D-Stairs (they have already said its on its way, but without them it is hard to make multiple floors, ladders are visualy unappealing and dont support multiple hearthling travel)-Manual Job Prioities (I wish that hauling wasn't a top prioities unless i set it as such)-Underground Walls and rooms (Though possible, it is tedious, anothering on their to-do list)-Better Mining Interface (Wish i could change all three tunnle dimentions)Those are some basic things that i am sure they will add, but without them currently it makes this more of a proof of concept than a game. Here is a list of some otherthings that i belive will make up for the lack of depth-Hearthling Personalities (Other than 3 stats, there is nothing that seperates one hearthling from another, making the game a bit shallow)-Diffrent Starting Zones/Biomes/Varity (These are already on the To-Do list, right now there is almost no varity in starting zones.)Really i had intentions for making this a long review and listing out everything i want to happen in this game in hopes of others seeing it and influencing the game, however it is just to soon to tell, they have so many good things planned for this including Multiplayer i only wish i didnt hear about this until it came out of early access, i yearn to play it everyday in its complete state. So should you buy it? Yes.... Support these great devs.			"

								Stonehearth is a great game, I have been playing since Pre-early access and have been astounded by the progress made by the developers and their level of community involvment, streams weekly, dev logs, weekly, roadmaps, quick responses on forums etc. Usually I'd steer clear of an Early Access game by a newer or less well known company. However Radiant have proved to be extrememly reliable and dedicated to their game. I would recommend this game, however it is in early access so bugs and a lack of features are to be expected (this is a direct attack of those posting negative reviews stating how is feature lacking - IT IS EARLY ACCESS!). If you are uncertain of whether or not you want to buy it, check out their streams look at some recent gameplay videos.			"

								I was fortunate enough to discover and back this game on Kickstarter during the original campaign and I've been hooked ever since. It is worth noting that I'm writing this review during alppha 10 and so many features are missing still. However, Stonehearth has evolved from being a very basic townbuilder game into a rich environment with many, many features (and many more planned). Some of my personal favorites are the richness of buildings that can be made and the burgeoning job system.It's also worth noting that the developers are very keen to support modders. They have made the game from the ground up with an extensible framework intended for modders and is how they are adding some of their own content as well.Finally, the developers are very active with their community, doing multiple streams per week as well as religiously posting blog entries on at least a weekly basis. They're very friendly on their forums and are regularly interacting with their supporters. I 100% recommend this game, even with the missing features.			"

								Thought I would buy this game and play it for 2 hours get bored a refund but instead i played it got hooked on it and cant stop playing it. Right now this game is like a 7/10 because yiou can play it for like 6 hours on one city before it gets boring  but in the future they are working on mulitiplayer and loads of other content so later i think it will be 10/10 no questions asked. But my advise would be buy it now so when more updates come out potentially increasing price you already have the game and dont need to pay more.

								I love watching this game be developed. This game surfaced around the same time as the infamous cube world, which, wound up being a flop. This game, however, has been highly persistent in updating and working on the game. Also, this is a FUN game, and when it is complete, it will be the best in the genre.			"

Early Access Review
								First off let me say this: I DO recommend this game, because it's proof of consept is so grand, and it promises everything I have always wanted in a base-building game. That being said the price of $25 is a little steep for a game that is barely playable. I have put about 20 hours into it off steam, and will surely put more. If you are  reading this i am sure you understand the game is in ALPHA and is pretty buggy, however the devs are great at talking to their community and are squashing bugs constantly,There are several Game breaking bugs within the main mechanics that make it unplayable.The building UI is a great idea, however the coding isn't right on it yet, Walls not being build, crashing when creating a big building, hearthlings not building a roof for your house for virtualy no reason. there are ways to make buildings with multiple walls, but most of them are tedious, requiring manual wall building, planning and erasing to get the building to work right, that is if you game doesnt crash on wall building or just make it so that you can not plan buildings anymore without save scumming. Other than the bugs, there are features that are not present (some that they plan to add) that i belive are needed to round out the game and make it playable. I will list them here in hopes of Dev eyes and to establish discorse :D-Stairs (they have already said its on its way, but without them it is hard to make multiple floors, ladders are visualy unappealing and dont support multiple hearthling travel)-Manual Job Prioities (I wish that hauling wasn't a top prioities unless i set it as such)-Underground Walls and rooms (Though possible, it is tedious, anothering on their to-do list)-Better Mining Interface (Wish i could change all three tunnle dimentions)Those are some basic things that i am sure they will add, but without them currently it makes this more of a proof of concept than a game. Here is a list of some otherthings that i belive will make up for the lack of depth-Hearthling Personalities (Other than 3 stats, there is nothing that seperates one hearthling from another, making the game a bit shallow)-Diffrent Starting Zones/Biomes/Varity (These are already on the To-Do list, right now there is almost no varity in starting zones.)Really i had intentions for making this a long review and listing out everything i want to happen in this game in hopes of others seeing it and influencing the game, however it is just to soon to tell, they have so many good things planned for this including Multiplayer i only wish i didnt hear about this until it came out of early access, i yearn to play it everyday in its complete state. So should you buy it? Yes.... Support these great devs.			"

Early Access Review
								Too many bugs to play a file reliably. You build a pathway, some times it bugs out and can't be removed. You try and build under ground to reach the tunnels/dungeons, the camera can't turn the proper angle to create proper tunnels. Constant bug notifications pop up on your screen, some times crashing the file itself. Buildings still don't function properly. The soilders bug out in the middle of the fights if they try to haul. If your civilians all have 'mine' set on, they'll get stuck in a hole forever. Miners can't reach directly above their heads, causing them to get stuck forever if you don't click in a methodical order. If you don't do clean mining strips then you'll have messy blocks sticking/floating out and there's no way to fix it. Sometimes you civilians stop building, mining or doing a task with no reason.The most annoying thing by far is that these games always fall for the same issue because the developers balance this game by being ""arm chair scientists"" rather than playing their game legitimately (without cheats/commands). This is a problem in every single game like this I've played, whether it's Banished or anything else I've unistalled. This problem amplfies the longer you have a file, and the more you develop a file. Your units need to eat, and sometimes while they're half way in to completing a task or walking to location. The result is an endless loop of them trying to complete/reach the location before ending up getting hungry and cancelling it to walk back to the designated 'eat spot'. This is a completely fatal issue, there's no way to combat this until the developers add in proper inventories so your peoples can hold some food in their bags. Assuming you manage to dodge the bug fest and end up creating a big town, the civs will get hungry just by travelling from one side of the town, let alone exploring tunnels or hunting mobs on the map.Stoneheart is the only game from this genre that I enjoy and look foward to seeing developed. It's zelda-like elements and potential make it endlessly replayable once the content rolls in. However once the developers start ACTUALLY playing their game and realise their are some fatal bugs/issues like the 'Food Loop' they completely give up and open up the mod workshops *cough* Banished *cough*. So lets hope it doesn't go down like that. However, this game is pure Alpha, or even closer to Beta. Don't buy it.			"

								Thought I would buy this game and play it for 2 hours get bored a refund but instead i played it got hooked on it and cant stop playing it. Right now this game is like a 7/10 because yiou can play it for like 6 hours on one city before it gets boring  but in the future they are working on mulitiplayer and loads of other content so later i think it will be 10/10 no questions asked. But my advise would be buy it now so when more updates come out potentially increasing price you already have the game and dont need to pay more.

								Fantastic game thus far, continues to improve with each patch. Excellent example of an early access game and a company that has great rapport with it's players. Strongly recommend to those who like them some city building with rpg elements and storytelling mixed in. Keep in mind that the game is still in early access and thus is still in the improvement stage. Bugs happen and features are constantly being tweaked and improved.Personally looking forward to seeing some of the more fantastical classes come out for the hearthlings, as well as the winter faction and whatever else may come.

Early Access Review
								Alright, I've played this game far longer than steam is showing, because I played it hours before I had it on steam at all.Also, I've been following this game for around two years now, and I think you can call me a fanboy. So is this review going to be neutral? No, definitely not! I love this game, and I probably oversee a lot of bugs. But at least it has a reason why I'm calling myself a fanboy.Two years ago, I think summer 2013, I've noticed a game called Stonehearth. A german video game magazine called ""gamestar"" reviewed it. A sandbox town building game in a voxel based world? Call me childish, but I loved to build huge lego forts so this game was bought instantly using the humble store for a much higher price than it's here on Early Access. I do not regret a single penny. Back then, the game was nearly unplayable. You enjoyed the concept for 15 minutes, but no longer. But, and this is at least for me one of the only criterion of an Early Access game, the developers were active. They posted news frequently and from time to time a new update was released. Not that often like - let's say Space Engineers - but frequent and huge updates.Now we have come to the point where I can honestly say that you can play it for some hours - if you are aware of some gamebreaking bugs. For example: Your workers need to eat, but sometimes the AI is stuck so they don't go eating and then they starve to death. Also if you have some more workers in your town the performance is getting really worse.And there is not that much of content, but you are busy for some hours. And don't forget: You buy an Early Access game to support the developers, to get an idea of what the game is going to be and to have a nice game for a cheap price when it's released!Now to the game itself:Imagine you play Minecraft. But not as a player, but as a god. And you can command your players to build stuff, to gather resources and to fight. Combine that with some RPG-mechanics (your workers, fighters, farmers, etc. can level up to be more efficient) and you have a nice combination of Minecraft, The Sims and SimCity in an medieval fantasy setting.The thing I love the most about the game is the great atmosphere. When it is getting dark, your workers will put wooden logs in a fire pit, they will light it and then they will sit around it warming up. Then they go to bed. After waking up, they go back to work. There is a living day/night cycle.Also there is a living world. At least a little bit. Don't expect too much right now, Early Access, remember? At night, skeletons and zombies are trying to kill you and at daytime, armed goblins try to take your stuff. You can defeat them and raid their outposts. Not that hard, not that satisfying, but the developers are on a good way.The last sentence could say all about the current state of the game. You will experience bugs, you will experience gamebreaking bugs and you will have to restart a lot.But Stonehearth is a lovely made game. The atmosphere is great. The gameplay is great. It is going to be awesome.			"

Early Access Review
								Long way to go, but even if i looked at this game in its current state, only consider all the bugs that it has polished, i would give it thumbs up. So since there are regular updates and fixes i have no reason not to recommend this game. Not all is great but i believe that it will be polished on the way.Digging up and down is badly done, needs re-thinking. The whole way how to look thru the ground in various heights is pretty badly made making it very difficult sometimes to see what you need to see when you ve been digging quite a bit.There is no way how to place dirt blocks back, they make no drop, no resource, so if you accidentally dig away something, you can only ""build"" a piece of stone back, but in x-ray view you will always see it there. There is no way how to make the your folk stop picking certain stuff up. So if your warrior dies in a gnome camp, your minions will keep running there to pick up the sword after the dead body, dying one by one. Sometimes they appear to die for no reason just like that, since the game doesnt tell you what happened you are just left wondering. I only played two games but there seems to be some sort of randomisation in various jobs position in the job tree, sometimes its the potter that is below the mason in the tree and sometimes its viceversa, this left me quite confused. The building system as a whole is a bit strange, i managed to design my stone tower, placed it on the ground and ordered start of construction, but nobody did anything and i didnt know why. There isnt enough of information about things, sorta ingame wiki. What does affect the sattisfaction of shelter? Food? Which food is the most sattisfactory? Optimization is another issue which surprised me. When you town is population 15+ the game will start somewhat lagging. Sometimes re-loading the game helps, sometimes it just stops on its own, its weird. But on my high-end PC its defo not a HW issue.There is a whole lot of things id like to see improved and i have no doubt that they will get improved. It already is very pleasant to play, has nice music, nice graphics, nice gameplay. Its very similar to game called Gnomoria, only with nicer graphics and heading in a little bit differend direction, direction that i like more. "

Early Access Review
								The short: A fun, cute, and refreshing civilization builder in the essence of its age-old predecessor: Dwarf Fortress.The long: As a avid fan of civilization sims and a old school fan of Dwarf Fortress 2, I bought Stonehearth on a hunch that it might be a aptly port to the 3D plane. In return, I was award with a different experience all together. Normally, I am a hard skeptic when it comes to Early Access titles and new wave Indie games. I am proud to say that this is a, currently, diamond in the rough.One of the first things I found with this game is the adorable graphics and artwork, which really appeal to its style. Everything looks nice and has a charming nature, even in the enemy designs. Gameplay-wise, Stonehearth serves really well as a civilization sim. Everything seems to mesh well together and controls are extremely easy to use. While earlier I ran into problems with the building controls, the recent alpha stage has fixed most of these problems and makes building and designing an awesome experience. Progression is very straightforward and aptly spaced parallel to your own speed. Combat, while simplistic, is easy to follow and pushes you to focus your troops into more diverse roles as your settlement grows. All in all, a very entertaining experience that makes me hopeful for a quality game the more it develops.While the current stage has not as much content as some would hope for, the team working on this has been effective at maintaining an open discussion with its playerbase. They have also been very well timed in releasing updates on development as well as new alpha builds, which is something I hope to see with any Early Access game. As with games of this nature, the time old expression of ""What do I do?"" comes to mind for those who aren't well versed with games such as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. However, the game is very easy to follow and figuring out your way is not as hard as such games mentioned.Basically, if you enjoy games in the nature of Dwarf Fortress, but aren't ready for the complexity of such a title, Stonehearth is the game to play. Adorable, addictive, and a fresh take on civilization sim.			"

								I have been following Stonehearth since Alpha 10 and after 17 hours of game I feel confortable enough to share my opinion with you guys. I'm going to do a list of Pro and Con, I hope you enjoy it.Ps:. Remember this game is in ALPHA stage so I can't avaliate everything, because it is constantly changing.Pros:- Game is constantly updated (weekly);- You can follow the game's development in Stonehearth's Website, Twitch Tv or in their Youtube Channel;- The team is always helpful and you can contact them in their own Forum or in Steam's Forum;- The game has an original cube style which is kind of criative and cool;- Stonehearth is pretty complete for an Alpha version;- The game has gorgeous graphics for an Alpha state;- The animations are pretty good;- We have nice bosses and monsters;- Building mechanics are good and you can basically create everything you want;- You have a lot of crafting options ( Carpenter, Blacksmith, Herbalist....etc). Therefore you need to update them;- The furniture of the game is just amazing;- You have three different difficult modes (Peaceful, Normal, Hardcore);- The game is always challenging although you play in normal mode; < Disregarding the Peaceful mode.- Hardcore mode is really amazing and challenging; < ( my favorite part )- You have a nice story although it's kind of silly;- The combat in the game is really nice. You have 4 different classes in combat ( Tank, Ranger, Cleric, DPS );- You have 2 biomes to play ( Desert, Florest ) and they are creating more + season system;- You have at now 2 different ""races"" to play;- The game's community is active.Con:- The game still having some bugs(Buildings/Combat), but it's in Alpha stage. It will change with the time;- The music is nice, but after a while it feels monotonus. I hope they put more soundtracks soon;- The combat's system is really great, but their auto-attack make it harder to play. I hope it's just a question of time to their change it;- The ""races"" seems predetermined for each biome which is a pity. Maybe they can change that;- The citizens also delay a lot to build something;- By the way, the game is not really optimized which means more work for your hardware(>> RAM <<);- Water bugs <<< It's really annoying but I bet it will change with the time.It's everything that I could see about this game. The game is fantastic, I personaly love it. I would recomend it for almost everybody. But remember, this game is Alpha Stage which means that you will find bugs. I recommend this game for people that have patience and understand that this current stage is going to be improved slowly. Ps:. Before you buy this game give a look at their website and on their development map. So you can catch up what they are working in.My Opinion:The game have a great potential for turn the best sandbox construction game after Dwarf Fortress. I personally had a great time playing Stonehearth. Building your own castles, Keeps, collecting resorcess, constructing a solid economy and defending your town against strong Trolls and goblings is pretty nice and cool guys! I had played other games before Stonehearth such as Towns, Craft the World, Terraria, Timberstone and Dwarf Fortress. I can assure you guys that no game is like Stonehearth. No game mix RPG + RTS + SANDBOX so well as this game and this is because I love it!Ps:. Remember this review was wrote in Alpha 17. So, the game can be better or worse after some updates.Ps2:. The game is on development I can't review it completely for that.			"

								I was an original Kickstarter backer back in mid 2013.The development of this game has long passed estimated release times. It still gets updates but they don't add much. Save games aren't stable between versions. Mod support has still yet to surface. OSX/Linux versions are on the backburner and may never come yet they were one of the first stretch goals. According to their own Trello board on their website both are ""to be done in the far future.""The game itself is hardly what I would call playable. Here's a list of the many things that go wrong:* Construction of buildings stalls. This means they never complete a building, which is a pretty important aspect.* Villagers consistently fail on their tasks meaning you have to re-task them. Again, and again, and again.* At random points the AI just stops doing things. It's probably the same issue with the former mentioned construction issue.Anyone comparing this to Minecraft are the people that think all Voxel games are the same.I do not recommend the game as early access. One day if it gets a full release then maybe I would recommend it. It has potential but the developers don't seem to prioritize work on the game.			"

								Written on 16 Nov 2015:Well when the game works it's a fun game to play, but if you are a Windows 10 user, you might want to pass on this game for now.  It took me an hour to get the game going in the compatibility section of Windows and editing the ""user_settings.json"" file.  Even after I had the game running, it crashes every 30 to 60 minutes.  There is also a User Interface problem that keeps showing up that prevents you from clicking on GUI buttons and makes the game unplayable and prevents you from saving the game.This game is early access, but for $25 dollars I feel it should be more playable.  If it was selling for $10 these issues would be more forgivable, but not at this price range.From what I see on the forums non-Windows 10 machines have much better luck running this.  I would recommend Windows 10 users waiting three months or more and then checking the forums to see if these issues have been resolved.  It really is a nice game, but it's not stable enough right now.			"

								*July 2, 2016* I love this game and can't wait for the core mechanic to work.Simply put, you cannot build houses. Builds often stop halfway. On top of that, you can't scrap the failed build. OCD nightmare.Googled it and... the same problem has been around for 2 years. Whoever is on top of this is not on top of this. So it would seem.If it's not fixed now... it's possible it'll be fixed by tomorrow (x_x)*October 2, 2016* It's been 3 months since my post above. I figured another go at this game was due. But after spending hours collecting resources to build a simple castle-like wall, well...It's disappointing and hilarious how bad this game still is. First off, everything but the actual walls were built. lmfao, I know right :sThen when I clicked on the structure to shamefully have to use insta-build, I couldn't.It said the build was finished. I realized it was hopeless after playing around with it.Maybe next year...			"

								Stonehearth, is a stoned survival and exploration game in a epic fantasy world, where you settle a town of hearthlings while defending agens invaders.The games layout, animations and sounds are really great, specially the way we can build the houses and duplicate our buildings on the ground, for each pieace. We can design everything from: Window, floor, door, roof, flags, fire, beds, and more. On the path while playing the game, people will visit your town and you can sell / buy upgrades. The atmosphere of the game is really nice, and you getting hooked really quickly.Be aware! They need some fixes aswell. Please keep in mind that this is Early access, and it's not finished. Check out my and others suggestions here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/253250/discussions/0/594821545179359856/Don't be a fool and think it's not worth it because of the missing features or sometime crashes with 5.273 error messages.If you search a relaxing and interesting stone, exploration and survival game in a fantasy world with invaders either in creative or survival mode, then this game is for you.Here is some old gameplay footage from june:

								Bought this game expecting to return at the 2 hour mark, that was 8 hours ago. The game was slow at first but after a bit of research I caught on to the mechanics fairly quickly and build a nice little town with a booming amount of resources. The ability to create your own buildings and really design your city is much different than many other city builders.TLDR: Easy, Simple  yet very intuitive city builder that keeps you busy!			"

								Holy crap, there's an actual game here! After ages of being pretty boring, buggy and unplayable, I was able to play for about 6 hours straight the other day with no hiccups, crashes or incomplete buildings. I was rewarded with a rich town builder that, while still missing some key features, is surprisingly deep. As a Kickstarter backer, this is a huge relief: most Early Access projects don't get nearly this far, especially in the town builder/management genre (example: Gnomoria).Furthermore, the team responsible for the game, Radiant, was recently acquired by Riot (makers of League of Legends). The team here is dead set on getting this project right from day one. Even though development has been slow, updates have been solid and have steadily built on themselves to create a game that is finally beginning to take definitive shape as a fun and unique take on the Dwarf Fortress genre. Keep an eye on this one, DF fans. It's going places.			"

								What a brilliant game, its cute, fun and very immersive.

The Dovelopment team are just out of this world, You can see the comitment in their work when you watch their live streams and in each update. I only see this game only getting better. Keep up with the hard work Team Radiant.One thing I wish to say to the new community before I finish, Dont wine and beg for the Multiplayer PLEASE. Let the game run its development path. If you really want something to be in the next update, go to https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap and vote for the next feature in the next update.Also head to http://stonehearth.net/category/development/ for the latest update news and development.10/10			"

Stonehearth is a very promising village/town builder! I'm very glad to have helped kickstart it. The developers push out updates and improvents frequently.Anyone who is a fan of Dwarf Fortress and DF-lite games (Gnomoria, Spacebase DF-9) will enjoy Stonehearth.Sure, as of this post, it has its share of issues:  Bugs (with the occasional crash to desktop) Waning performance (CPU and AI decision-making) over time (needing the occasional save-then-reload to refresh) Some not-yet-implemented UI functionality and UX flow that can make building clunky and unforgiving That said, Stonehearth not only shows improvement after every update, but it's also already quite fun to play!

Early Access Review
								I have a few things to say about this game. It has become one of my favorite pc games ever. No joke. It has unique gameplay and a very nice plot. It even has story progression for once you get to about the second in-game month, goblin camps start appearing. The game itself looks very well made and polished but even for this game, it has got PLENTY of cons.First off it is highly buggy and mainly when designing or building a house. Sometimes building the second story wall makes it two layer and overlap leaving it unable to undo or do anything otherwise without restarting the game. The AI could also use incredible amounts of work. They don't build under bridges of any kind and they need to be specifically ordered to do so or they will never get anything done. There is a feature that needs to be added single-handedly and that is making it to where the AI always run back to headquarters. Everytime there are mobs coming out and chasing after my Hearthlings, do they go towards the footmen who could kick some goblin♥♥♥♥♥ Nope. They run out to the woods to dig their own harty graves. That's not all for I have had to start my game over far to many times due to the poorly-made engine failing from doing simple tasks.But the reason why you see this thumbs up on this review is that this game overall has massive potential. And since I adore early-access games so much, I have gotten used to these bugs. But, then again, when the developers ditch the game to run off with the thousands and millions they make, then it is a big thumbs down for me. But greatly enough, they are still updating it. Maybe a bit slow at times, but they are still producing the game towards better recreational fun. I do reccomend this game and it is worth every penny you buy it for.			"

								This is one of those original games that you know can really go so far with the right amount of love and development. And for the few months I had this game before it hit steam early acess the devs have really proven that they are dedicated and willing to release frequent updates, and as important: fix bugs! Sure the game isn't complete and they are still adding more features, but already this is an awesome and open world, a city-sim with the micromanegement that an rts player would love. Another thing that really strikes me as impressive, and eleviates most of my concerns regarding the fact that it lacks content in some areas is their openess to the community. These guys are really awesome and open about their plans, have frequent dev streams and will tell you exactly what they are working on. In my opinion this is truly early access done right, and thats why this game is much more than some buggy early access scam. Definitely recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth (Alpha 10) can be best described as a pretty, easy to use, and lightweight Dwarf Fortress for the masses. None of what I just said should be taken negatively. It's a great concept. I absolutely can't wait for final release, because I'm convinced the devs are going to make it happen and hit a home run in the process.As the game stands, it wasn't until the latest Alpha release (alpha 10) a couple of weeks ago that Stonehearth actually started to feel like a game. So giving a fair review is hard to do. Let's just jump to whether or not you should buy in to the game as it is now. If you are an indie supporter who likes to see a game evolve and support a project early on, then yes, it's a great buy. Also if you are content with what amounts to a sandbox that is still very much a trial run of the features in the design doc but are OK with may features still outstanding, then certainly dive in while the water is relatively clean. The game is being made by great team that stays heavily connected to the community.If you are looking for a game that is near feature complete with only minor bugs, then perhaps it's worth waiting. If I had to guess, Stonehearth is at least a year away from being ready for final release; so if you don't have the patience to wait until the features you want are in the game, then you may want to wait. Perhaps the Early Access money from Steam will afford a larger team and speed up the development...In the end, be sure and check out the games website and watch some YouTube videos to help with your decision.

Early Access Review
								I spent a small amount of time playing Stonehearth and with a brief summary can say this game is the future Gnomoria. It does everything a simulation civilization survival game should do. It has a bit of leveling up, looser micromanaging, customizing buildings, unlockable classes, and a better feel of the open world. When your Hearthlings get hungry and you ask them to harvest berries, they don't starve themselves on a job and wait for another job class to go do it, they stop everything and grab some wild berries. I will say Gnomoria has a leg up in terms of making your own classes and uniforms but I'm sure as this game progresses it'll have the same options if not more that Gnomoria had to offer. The music isn't half bad and is soft however it does keep reminding me of the little mermaid...It is an EA and like all EA's theres errors but to have the game working on the day of steam release is a first +1 for its score, having a few options +1, having a save and load function +1, having most of the key features working in-game +1, having a balanced and playable gameplay +1, and finally I only encountered 2 bugs that have already been reported the headless bug and the red error box when making a custom house, neither were game breaking or that annoying due to being able to move the red box and the heads stay on if you zoom out. So for me a personal +1. I also want to wrap up by saying a huge HUGE THANK YOU to both the greenlight voters and the developers! The developers I thank you for stepping up to the plate WHEN YOU FELT READY, taking time to process your game and release it almost stable is a huge hat off to you (even though I don't wear hats).The price is a bit of a shock to those with lower paychecks and what with the economy the way it is don't be to embarrassed to wait. This game has great delivery, great promise, and a great dev team so far from what I can tell at least. I'll wrap this up by saying Steam needs more Indie dev teams like this who wait until the game is stable and has most of its key elements already in game.			"

When the game is complete, then combined with the talented user modded content the sky is the limit for your Hearthlings and long term game play for you.  I recommend this game if you enjoy city builders, action and adventure. When you play the alpha, don't look at it for what it is now, but look at what it can be.  "

								ive been playing this game for a while now ( since aplpha 6 first came out), and it keeps bringing me back for more. i would reccomend it for anyone, it is at a very reasonable price for what it has to offer. it is fun to see your city grow and constantly find new things too do. when i start to think it has nothing more to offer,i get sad, and then about 5 minutes later ill be at war with a goblin tribe, and while the combat isnt the best, it is pretty good. the construction doesnt have too many custom options but it still allows for some pretty massive and beautiful structures. This game is frequently updated and i have never had to worry about a bug for longer than a week. my only complaint, is that somtimes i will have to repeatedly remind my people to build stuff.			"

								This game is in early alpha. As such, temper your expectations. Bugs, Weird gameplay quirks, and some problematic AI script errors tend to make the game a sort of ""How long can you play before you need to save and restart the program"" thing. But dont take what I say as a negative review. This game is lovable and unique, and every moment I have spent playing it has been more or less a blast. And difficult, to boot. With Enemy zombies and goblins constantly reducing my villager count by 1 or so every night, it becomes far more difficult to maintain the city with each passing death.Good game, Still early alpha release, can't wait to see how it improves.

Early Access Review
								I sit here in my desk chair, 3am on a cold Scottish morn. Listening to the gentle hum of my PC as I watch my little hillside hamlet of Edoras expand, 4 houses, a public feasting building, a guard barracks, a blacksmith and a completly filled food storehouse. Every little hearther is happy, at peace and happy in life as we press further into the hillside, ever expanding, handing out food to passing merchants - we have plenty- in exchange for fancy chairs and rustic fire pits for the long houses. We gather to eat and jest, then sleep in simple beds with roaring fires to keep us warm.This is simple. Peaceful. This is Edoras.Ok, I'll be truthful, i was expecting a quick hour or so to get into it, set up farms, housing... basic stuff then just steam roll it for a half hour then refund it cause i wasn't enjoying it.But no, Stonehearth has this... charm to it that i just can't pinpoint. Maybe it's the building system - you have a few preset designs and the rest you can build using a fairly simple but effective system of drag selections and semi voxel based building -, maybe it's the constant strive to better your town and lure more hearthers (little voxelly pixelly villagers) into your town for workers.Maybe you just enjoy the sense of wonder of seeing your town flourish by your hand.Stonehearth is probably already worthy of a release, i don't even begrudge them £18.99 because the game is truly extremely fun. BUT One problem is... The AI... the hearthers are a little... single minded, monkey see, monkey do sort of thing. Like place desings for a house... they start building. Good. Place designs for another hosue and a... idk, a storehouse, and sometimes theyll  all flock to build the storehouse and begin construction. So that house you placed first unless you reinstate the build order, will become last priority. Not bad as such, just a little... irritating seeing half built buildings (storehouse and blacksmith in my village) being used and slept in with no roof, half a wall missing, and no door.. :pPersonal peeve and i'm sure others will feel the same way...

Early Access Review
								I have a few things to say about this game. It has become one of my favorite pc games ever. No joke. It has unique gameplay and a very nice plot. It even has story progression for once you get to about the second in-game month, goblin camps start appearing. The game itself looks very well made and polished but even for this game, it has got PLENTY of cons.First off it is highly buggy and mainly when designing or building a house. Sometimes building the second story wall makes it two layer and overlap leaving it unable to undo or do anything otherwise without restarting the game. The AI could also use incredible amounts of work. They don't build under bridges of any kind and they need to be specifically ordered to do so or they will never get anything done. There is a feature that needs to be added single-handedly and that is making it to where the AI always run back to headquarters. Everytime there are mobs coming out and chasing after my Hearthlings, do they go towards the footmen who could kick some goblin♥♥♥♥♥ Nope. They run out to the woods to dig their own harty graves. That's not all for I have had to start my game over far to many times due to the poorly-made engine failing from doing simple tasks.But the reason why you see this thumbs up on this review is that this game overall has massive potential. And since I adore early-access games so much, I have gotten used to these bugs. But, then again, when the developers ditch the game to run off with the thousands and millions they make, then it is a big thumbs down for me. But greatly enough, they are still updating it. Maybe a bit slow at times, but they are still producing the game towards better recreational fun. I do reccomend this game and it is worth every penny you buy it for.			"

								i love this game it is amazing, it runs smoothly, the way u can make a city of your own design makes it one of the best town building games on steam. Theres only a couple of things that could be added to make it perfect- make it moddable and have a mod workshop to get custom mobs and items- and secondly make it multiplayer because i think it would be awesome to be able to play with friends and either have wars with them or make huge cities- and bigger worlds cause they seem a bit too smallBut still this is a great game and i recommend getting it			"

								I've been waiting for things to become a bit more stable since I helped kickstart this game. I'm very happy to say that it plays SO much better than it use to. If you're skeptical about spending the money, I say it's worth it. Check out my first gameplay video on it and see for yourself. :)

								I have had this game for over a year but just got into it a few months ago. The developers really listen to the community and try to fix bugs right away. I posted a bug and a screenshot on the forums and within 40 minutes a developer had replyed and asked what I was doing when the bug occurred, then a few minutes after I explained what I did they posted how to recreate the bug and that they were working on a fix. Great game, great support and I really reccomend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth (Alpha 10) can be best described as a pretty, easy to use, and lightweight Dwarf Fortress for the masses. None of what I just said should be taken negatively. It's a great concept. I absolutely can't wait for final release, because I'm convinced the devs are going to make it happen and hit a home run in the process.As the game stands, it wasn't until the latest Alpha release (alpha 10) a couple of weeks ago that Stonehearth actually started to feel like a game. So giving a fair review is hard to do. Let's just jump to whether or not you should buy in to the game as it is now. If you are an indie supporter who likes to see a game evolve and support a project early on, then yes, it's a great buy. Also if you are content with what amounts to a sandbox that is still very much a trial run of the features in the design doc but are OK with may features still outstanding, then certainly dive in while the water is relatively clean. The game is being made by great team that stays heavily connected to the community.If you are looking for a game that is near feature complete with only minor bugs, then perhaps it's worth waiting. If I had to guess, Stonehearth is at least a year away from being ready for final release; so if you don't have the patience to wait until the features you want are in the game, then you may want to wait. Perhaps the Early Access money from Steam will afford a larger team and speed up the development...In the end, be sure and check out the games website and watch some YouTube videos to help with your decision.

								I spent a small amount of time playing Stonehearth and with a brief summary can say this game is the future Gnomoria. It does everything a simulation civilization survival game should do. It has a bit of leveling up, looser micromanaging, customizing buildings, unlockable classes, and a better feel of the open world. When your Hearthlings get hungry and you ask them to harvest berries, they don't starve themselves on a job and wait for another job class to go do it, they stop everything and grab some wild berries. I will say Gnomoria has a leg up in terms of making your own classes and uniforms but I'm sure as this game progresses it'll have the same options if not more that Gnomoria had to offer. The music isn't half bad and is soft however it does keep reminding me of the little mermaid...It is an EA and like all EA's theres errors but to have the game working on the day of steam release is a first +1 for its score, having a few options +1, having a save and load function +1, having most of the key features working in-game +1, having a balanced and playable gameplay +1, and finally I only encountered 2 bugs that have already been reported the headless bug and the red error box when making a custom house, neither were game breaking or that annoying due to being able to move the red box and the heads stay on if you zoom out. So for me a personal +1. I also want to wrap up by saying a huge HUGE THANK YOU to both the greenlight voters and the developers! The developers I thank you for stepping up to the plate WHEN YOU FELT READY, taking time to process your game and release it almost stable is a huge hat off to you (even though I don't wear hats).The price is a bit of a shock to those with lower paychecks and what with the economy the way it is don't be to embarrassed to wait. This game has great delivery, great promise, and a great dev team so far from what I can tell at least. I'll wrap this up by saying Steam needs more Indie dev teams like this who wait until the game is stable and has most of its key elements already in game.			"

At this point in time the game is still in early alpha but it shows great potential. When the game is complete, then combined with the talented user modded content the sky is the limit for your Hearthlings and long term game play for you.  I recommend this game if you enjoy city builders, action and adventure. When you play the alpha, don't look at it for what it is now, but look at what it can be.  "

								ive been playing this game for a while now ( since aplpha 6 first came out), and it keeps bringing me back for more. i would reccomend it for anyone, it is at a very reasonable price for what it has to offer. it is fun to see your city grow and constantly find new things too do. when i start to think it has nothing more to offer,i get sad, and then about 5 minutes later ill be at war with a goblin tribe, and while the combat isnt the best, it is pretty good. the construction doesnt have too many custom options but it still allows for some pretty massive and beautiful structures. This game is frequently updated and i have never had to worry about a bug for longer than a week. my only complaint, is that somtimes i will have to repeatedly remind my people to build stuff.			"

								This game is in early alpha. As such, temper your expectations. Bugs, Weird gameplay quirks, and some problematic AI script errors tend to make the game a sort of ""How long can you play before you need to save and restart the program"" thing. But dont take what I say as a negative review. This game is lovable and unique, and every moment I have spent playing it has been more or less a blast. And difficult, to boot. With Enemy zombies and goblins constantly reducing my villager count by 1 or so every night, it becomes far more difficult to maintain the city with each passing death.Good game, Still early alpha release, can't wait to see how it improves.

Early Access Review
								I sit here in my desk chair, 3am on a cold Scottish morn. Listening to the gentle hum of my PC as I watch my little hillside hamlet of Edoras expand, 4 houses, a public feasting building, a guard barracks, a blacksmith and a completly filled food storehouse. Every little hearther is happy, at peace and happy in life as we press further into the hillside, ever expanding, handing out food to passing merchants - we have plenty- in exchange for fancy chairs and rustic fire pits for the long houses. We gather to eat and jest, then sleep in simple beds with roaring fires to keep us warm.This is simple. Peaceful. This is Edoras.Ok, I'll be truthful, i was expecting a quick hour or so to get into it, set up farms, housing... basic stuff then just steam roll it for a half hour then refund it cause i wasn't enjoying it.But no, Stonehearth has this... charm to it that i just can't pinpoint. Maybe it's the building system - you have a few preset designs and the rest you can build using a fairly simple but effective system of drag selections and semi voxel based building -, maybe it's the constant strive to better your town and lure more hearthers (little voxelly pixelly villagers) into your town for workers.Maybe you just enjoy the sense of wonder of seeing your town flourish by your hand.Stonehearth is probably already worthy of a release, i don't even begrudge them £18.99 because the game is truly extremely fun. BUT One problem is... The AI... the hearthers are a little... single minded, monkey see, monkey do sort of thing. Like place desings for a house... they start building. Good. Place designs for another hosue and a... idk, a storehouse, and sometimes theyll  all flock to build the storehouse and begin construction. So that house you placed first unless you reinstate the build order, will become last priority. Not bad as such, just a little... irritating seeing half built buildings (storehouse and blacksmith in my village) being used and slept in with no roof, half a wall missing, and no door.. :pPersonal peeve and i'm sure others will feel the same way...

Early Access Review
								Only five hours in but I'm having a TON of fun, and it's only in alpha.THE QUICK VERSION: Do you like Gnomoria (or Dwarf Fortress)? Do you like Minecraft? If you answered ""yes"" to either of these, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you answered ""yes"" to both, you'll DEFINITELY enjoy this game.THINGS TO LIKE:+ The building system is the most robust of any citybuilder I've seen to date. You not only get to lay out buildings for your Hearthlings to construct (very intuitively, in my experience!) but you get to place furniture within and without at your whim. There's already a great deal of different types of furniture and decor your Hearthings can craft.+ The music is excellent. It's rich and well composed, and it gives the game a very quaint feel.+ Game generation is simple but fun and really makes you feel like you're having an impact on your game before it even starts. You roll a set of Hearthlings, each with their own stats, and can even name them. You also get an amount of gold to spend on a selection of items to start yourself off with. You select your options in storybook form when the game asks you to pick between two types of Hearthlings (one medieval-ish group and one nomadic, desert-like group), two types of biomes (temperate or desert), and two types of game (either you can be raided by enemies or you can't). Then your map is generated and you select where on that map you want to settle. Each region has access to different resources.+ Trade events. Just about every day, a trader will come by offering different deals. You can buy or sell certain goods from some, some will ask you to make them x number of items then come back after a set amount of time to trade you something agreed upon for them... It keeps things fresh and gives you new ways to get resources you maybe don't have access to based on where you settled.+ Hearthling jobs. There are several different jobs in the game and they all feel useful. Every Hearthling starts off as a basic laborer, who can only gather resources, haul them, or build. With items (most of which are constructed by the various crafting jobs), you can promote a hearthling to any number of other jobs such as Farmer, Carpenter, Tailor or Trapper. Every job has levels that increase as your Hearthling performs that job and gains experience. At each tier, a new ability is unlocked. These range from increased speed to the ability to randomly create high-quality furniture that takes on a finer appearance than the base item being crafted. Many jobs are also laid out in a tree wherein you must have a Hearthling of level x in one job to promote to another. For example, Cook requires Farmer at level 3.+ The ability to save your building designs for easy placement later.THINGS THAT NEED WORK:- Currently it's very difficult (possible though!) to build a second floor that functions. I'm sure this will be ironed out as the game plods along in development, though.- A few of the job abilities aren't implemented yet, but this will definitely be remedied later just on nature of the status being ""not implemented"".- You get occasional errors when trying to do things, pretty much always in regards to building. They haven't crashed the game for me, it's basically just the game telling me the engine didn't understand what I was trying to do.- Sometimes the building bugs a bit, but all that generally means is that you have to cancel building and start designing from the start again. Bit of a pain, but with trial and error, you'll get where you're going, and this is sure to be ironed out in the long term.FINAL VERDICT:It's already an incredibly addictive game for me. In its current state, I'd rate the game a solid 7.5/10. It has the potential to be at LEAST a 9. If for whatever reason you trust my opinion, I'd tell you this game is worth the buy right now. It's one of the sharpest alpha states I've ever seen for a game and there's already so much to enjoy and lose hours in. Five hours in, I've only scratched the surface of jobs and the like and I'm still going strong. I can see myself easily logging over 100 hours in this thing.			"

								I've been excited for Stonehearth since the Kickstarter which I happily contributed to. I saw a team of people who were passionate about delivering the product they envisioned instead of a watered down version.Two years later I'm happy to see that I wasn't wrong. The development team is very transparent, honest, and are not willing to give up on their vision like so many other games have. Unfortunately, that means that some things take longer to do and have more bugs because the implementations are more complex. I've watched and played the alphas, though, and I've seen fantastic and surprisingly rapid growth so I'm optimistic about where this game will be when it's finally complete.Worth the price, but please remember this is alpha-quality software so there may be some frustrations. Alpha 10 is pretty stable but if you'd like to avoid some of the game-breaking issues that can sometimes pop up I would wait a few more versions or even until Beta when the real bug fixing kicks in.

								This is a very satisfying game with a rather cute artstyle that scratches all the itches that towns left me with.Essentially, you indirectly command a small village of settlers to build up a town, attract new residents, and defend your town from raids by wolves, zombies, goblins, kobolds, and all sorts of similarly nasty monsters.The game, unfortunately, can be quite straining on your computer when you have a lot of villagers, but since I've started playing, the game's performance and optimisation have both improved dramatically. When I started playing, the game would get completely bogged down at around 20 villagers and they would stand around doing nothing until they starved, now I can have 30 villagers comfortably and the game only gets a little clogged after playing for several (8+) hours with that number of villagers.The developers are also very communicative and active and chat with the community regularly to take suggestions and feedback. If you enjoy citybuilding and sandboxy games then I really can't recommend this game enough.			"

								Fun and relaxing if you're into the city-builder genre, but also gives the option to pressure the player as a strategy game would through zombie attacks and goblin raiding parties.			"

								Only five hours in but I'm having a TON of fun, and it's only in alpha.THE QUICK VERSION: Do you like Gnomoria (or Dwarf Fortress)? Do you like Minecraft? If you answered ""yes"" to either of these, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you answered ""yes"" to both, you'll DEFINITELY enjoy this game.THINGS TO LIKE:+ The building system is the most robust of any citybuilder I've seen to date. You not only get to lay out buildings for your Hearthlings to construct (very intuitively, in my experience!) but you get to place furniture within and without at your whim. There's already a great deal of different types of furniture and decor your Hearthings can craft.+ The music is excellent. It's rich and well composed, and it gives the game a very quaint feel.+ Game generation is simple but fun and really makes you feel like you're having an impact on your game before it even starts. You roll a set of Hearthlings, each with their own stats, and can even name them. You also get an amount of gold to spend on a selection of items to start yourself off with. You select your options in storybook form when the game asks you to pick between two types of Hearthlings (one medieval-ish group and one nomadic, desert-like group), two types of biomes (temperate or desert), and two types of game (either you can be raided by enemies or you can't). Then your map is generated and you select where on that map you want to settle. Each region has access to different resources.+ Trade events. Just about every day, a trader will come by offering different deals. You can buy or sell certain goods from some, some will ask you to make them x number of items then come back after a set amount of time to trade you something agreed upon for them... It keeps things fresh and gives you new ways to get resources you maybe don't have access to based on where you settled.+ Hearthling jobs. There are several different jobs in the game and they all feel useful. Every Hearthling starts off as a basic laborer, who can only gather resources, haul them, or build. With items (most of which are constructed by the various crafting jobs), you can promote a hearthling to any number of other jobs such as Farmer, Carpenter, Tailor or Trapper. Every job has levels that increase as your Hearthling performs that job and gains experience. At each tier, a new ability is unlocked. These range from increased speed to the ability to randomly create high-quality furniture that takes on a finer appearance than the base item being crafted. Many jobs are also laid out in a tree wherein you must have a Hearthling of level x in one job to promote to another. For example, Cook requires Farmer at level 3.+ The ability to save your building designs for easy placement later.THINGS THAT NEED WORK:- Currently it's very difficult (possible though!) to build a second floor that functions. I'm sure this will be ironed out as the game plods along in development, though.- A few of the job abilities aren't implemented yet, but this will definitely be remedied later just on nature of the status being ""not implemented"".- You get occasional errors when trying to do things, pretty much always in regards to building. They haven't crashed the game for me, it's basically just the game telling me the engine didn't understand what I was trying to do.- Sometimes the building bugs a bit, but all that generally means is that you have to cancel building and start designing from the start again. Bit of a pain, but with trial and error, you'll get where you're going, and this is sure to be ironed out in the long term.FINAL VERDICT:It's already an incredibly addictive game for me. In its current state, I'd rate the game a solid 7.5/10. It has the potential to be at LEAST a 9. If for whatever reason you trust my opinion, I'd tell you this game is worth the buy right now. It's one of the sharpest alpha states I've ever seen for a game and there's already so much to enjoy and lose hours in. Five hours in, I've only scratched the surface of jobs and the like and I'm still going strong. I can see myself easily logging over 100 hours in this thing.			"

								Stonehearth is much like a city builder, but with some RPG/Adventure elements in it. The goal is to keep your Heartlings, or citizens alive by finding resources, building houses and defences and fighting off invaders. When I first got into this game I had a hard time getting used to it. There were many game breaking bugs that got your Heartlings stuck or buildings that could not get finished. Most of the bugs have been fixed and you won't run into any for the most part. The ones that do are often easily shrugged off.UiThe game is quite easy to get into. The UI is quite easy to handle and you can easily access any information you might need. Important events like raids, level-ups or traders will pop up and notify you of their arrival. You can ""slice"" the ground  so you can see your mines underground and the same can be done for the buildings (although this might need some improvement for buildings with multiple floors). BuildingBuildings can be made in any way you want as these can be build much like Minecraft block by block. After you're finished editing your building you can let your Heartlings build it for you. The game also offers some blueprint for you when you don't feel like building houses yourself and these too can be edited to your liking. When building starts your heartlings will get everything they need to build the structure bit by bit. They even build scaffolding to make the building making it cool to see your buildings being build from the ground up.ProfessionsYour heartlings will be able to be given specific roles. Like a carpenter, a farmer or a footman. This will allow them to level up in this respective tree which in turn will allow you more to make and progress your town further. Each role has their benefits and are overall very well balanced out. You will mostly want to have all of them every time.ChallengesWhile supplying your town with supplies is not hard all on its own, it does get a bit more exciting when enemies start appearing. Having to call back your citizens to the safety of your building while your footmen, knights, archers and clerics move in to take care of the threat. Combat is really fun, even when it's this simple it still gets you to hold your breath sometimes when its a close call for one of your soldiers. StoryThe game does not have much story going on yet. But it is easy to see the potential the game has and the devs are working on the story as we speak. Which brings me to the next part.DevelopmentNow, many people have been complaining about how slow the game has developed over the last months. And I can't blame them. But one thing you must keep in mind is that the development team is a small one. Personally I still back the dev team as they seem to actually care about the game.My overall opinionI like this game. Quite a bit. It is a bit like minecraft but more strategy based. Which I like. The game's theme is great. Very cute and playful making even the biggest fights look cute and huggable. The game still lacks some contend but even now I would pay my 30 bucks for it and think it money well spent. I love the system of the game and the way it works. The UI is simple and much to my liking. My only real downside is that I too would wish for more content being thrown out more rapidly. I give this game a 8/10. Some might say this is way too high. But you just cant deny this game is a lot of fun and still has a whole lot of potential. I hope the game gets some big updates in 2017 and I feel like the devs will deliver on this. My advice? Buy this game! Support these developers. It's small companies like these that make the greatest games. If given the chance.			"

								This is a good game for the first 2-3 hours. When you start making building that aren't already built in can be extremely frustrating. If you want to upgrade a piece of furniture in your house you have to destroy it and rebuild it from what i can tell. If you want to make a vertical mineshaft you can wish some of your hearthlings dead. Sometimes random items get in places you can't get. This game has good potental. It could be a great game if the building management was much easier.			"

								I, ehrm, ""test drove"" this game prior to Alpha 18 and saw it's potential, but hesitated to purchase it due to some lofty bugs and general lack of late-game content & optimization.I was very pleased to discover how much progress was made with A17 & 18.  These two patches alone convinced me it was time to support the devs by purchasing and recommending the game to others.  I wasn't sure you guys could/would pull it off, but this game now feels great to play for being in such an early stage.  Keep up the hard work - this is a gem awating it's final, glorious cut & polish!!!10/10 would stone my hearth again.			"

								What can I say? This game is just a ton of fun. I soaked up 4 hours playing this when I first bought it. If you like town/city builders, and like to manage colonies and the like, then this game is right up your alley. I thought that the art style would bug me at first, but to be honest, it is kinda nice. You don't get caught up in the graphic nature being a big point in the game, even though you can make some nice loking buildings and stuff anyway.Stonehearth looks like Minecraft, but plays very differently. It is in a top down-ish format, so you aren't controlling a single character, but rather managing what the colonists will work on. I won't go too much into the mechanics of such a game, as it isn't the first to do such a thing, but it is worth noting that you don't have IMMEDIATE control over what the colonists do, unless they are doing nothing at the time.This is an amazing game. I can only assume it will get even better, and it looks as though the devs intend to stick with it, fixing some annoying bugs already. If you are on the fence, I'd say just buy it, give it the 2 hours to decide, and if you don't find yourself completely wowed by it, Steam will give you a refund. You really can't go wrong here.			"

								The devs put their heart and souls into this game, and it shows! They're always adding in new and intersesting features and complete a new alpha release every month or so. It's nice to have a game where you can build whatever you want while defending it from the various and expanding array of monsters. I love the RPG elements of needing a previous class in order to advance further. Or a different class is needed to craft the necessary tool to level up a hearthling. Alpha games have lots of bugs you say? Fear not!

								I've been following Stonehearth for years, and finally picked it up on Steam.  It's a very fun game for passing the time.  You have partial control over your hearthlings by giving them tasks and telling them to walk to certain areas.  The rest is handled by the AI.  But once you have 20 hearthlings doing their thing you have plenty to do.  There are multiple job paths and little mini quests along the way.  Buildings can be custom designed as well or you can use some of the pre created cookie cutter models.The game is still in alpha but its looking very good and is very playable as it is.Another massive pro is their support!  I had one issue and they immediately replied and had several team members assisting me.  After some other recent Alpha flops I can't tell you how reassuring that is!!!  Very much appreciated.I hope this game only gets better and better!			"

								EDIT: I'm rewriting a review because I love this game a lot and want people to really understand whats going on. This game has so much potential. The devs really care and want it to be a good game. It's playable in the current state but at the same time it isn't. You will face several gamebreaking bugs during your play. I frequently try to play this game and see how it's going. HUD breaks, hearthlings don't do what you ask. Devs post weekly (most of the time on tuesday) about the upcomming updates, and i really like how much they communicate with the backers/supporters (i backed this game on kickstarter awhile back) overall I believe it would be better to add this to your wishlist/watch list and check back every once and awhile. If you buy it now you might find a few bugs and get frustrated. I'll edit this more in the future. -original short really bad review- (im sorry)I have been playing this game since the first alpha and let me tell you The devs listen, they care, and they want to make this game the best for us. I know $25 is a bit much (i bought it for $30 on their site) but it will be reduced to $15 on release. Either pick it up now, or wait. Either way this game is excelent and I love it.			"

								Pretty good overall for an early iteration. Lacking some significant fleshing out of features, and suffers from some pretty serious optimization issues and slow downs. With a little love it could be a beautiful dwarf fortress clone.The job system is more interesting than DF and DF clones, and with some more work could become worth the depth it shows in concept, however as it stands it seems more like a lazy content gate. Hopefully it will be the method they use to set themselves apart from the previous games of this genre.			"

If you enjoyed any form of base builder game, you'll like this. if titles like dungeon keeper, cultures, settlers (and many more) make you feel a little nostalgic then one day this game will too.

								At the time of this review (7-16-2016), I would say the game is already worth the purchase price. There are so many games that charge far more while delivering far less. And this game is only in the alpha stage. As many have already commented, if you like sim games (SimCity, Civilization) and other open-world, crafting type games then this is worth a look. With any sim/crafting game there is a learning curve and there is one here, but it hasn't felt particularly harsh. One thing that really struck me was the quality of the music--it's fantastic. Like, Howard Shore cinematic quality. Well done, sir.			"

								Rewrote this Review due to new updates, current Stable: Alpha 17, but Alpha 18 is playable and looking good too. Previous Review had 4 of 7 Helpful votes.Short Version: It's still a Dwarf Fortress/Gnomoria style game, but less focused on deep digging and more on exploration, crafting, and building. Class System is simple but interesting and more unique than simply assigning jobs, and much more user friendly than most. Don't let the simplicity fool you though, you can pour some fair time into this if you like these kinds of games.Since my previous review, it's still in Alpha, but has resolved or at least lessened alot of the Optimization issues, with more tweaks focused on that to come - judging by the dev blog and their videos, they genuinely care about fixing this, and they should since 2d Dwarf Fort lags up pretty bad once you have a big enough population going, imagine how bad it's going to be in a 3d game like this. Smart focus on their part, one of the rare devs that learns from others' issues, unlike every MMO dev out there.The AI is much better now, though still a little prone to bad decision-making. You can somewhat ""control"" their pathfinding by building Roads, as it favors those almost exclusively unless no road exists to follow nearby. The Building issues I had before seem resolved for the most part, though I'll still find a ladder or scaffolding stuck floating and undestroyable without using the Console.Combat has advanced by leaps and great bounds since my previous review - many more weapon/armor options, as well as 3 new classes: the Knight, with heavier armor and 1h/shield focus, bonus defense/stats and buff auras for his allies, as well as Taunt skills to protect the squishies - the Archer, your standard ranged attacker who can either slow or burn enemies based on their Arrow Quiver equipped(and double-shot at max lvl) - and most importanly, the Cleric, a Healer Monk who can do melee dmg and defend himself but puts their first priority as healing any nearby units with damage, both directly and through a passive aura. I make 2 groups of 1 of each class and it protects my bases pretty well + deals with the Story armies nicely.The Mining system is a little more controllable now but still not as fine-tuned as I would like to see, and usually see in other games of this kind - there's no Ramps or Stairs to be dug, and manually digging them up doesn't usually work because the AI prefers to build and use Ladders instead of stepping up/down 1 block steps.Overall they're making nice strides in the right direction, and I'm eager to see more.Bonus: There's already a decent-sized Mod community, and they make some pretty good mods so far, from whole new classes and items to entire Biomes(The Archipelago one is awesome)			"

								I'd just wait for the finished product. Ui is a tad clunky. Can't delete placed objects, you have to use a console command just to do that. Everytime I tried to click drag I remembered that you can't click drag. Villagers will just stop building, even if you have everything you need to build with. Leaving you with a half finished house that you can't delete.After an hour of playing, the shine really wore off.Update december 24th 2016: Sonehearth was on sale for 20 bucks so I decided to give it another try, and sweet mother of baby Jesus this game still has the same exact bugs as the last time I played it! Scaffolding everywhere. unfinished buildinGs. Settlers just standing around. I really wanted to like Stonehearth I really did, but bought the game twice and requested a refund twice. You would think that a game where you build buildings the building portion would be a ♥♥♥♥ing priority, BUT I GUESS NOT! I'd tell you to just wait for the ""finished"" product but who knows when that will even happen. ffs just play Rimworld.			"

								Good game if the only thing you care about is crafting a cute little town. The strategy tag should not be attached to this game. I really liked this game at first, but once I had a basic town set up, there was nothing else to do. The game has minimal story that can be beaten with only a few hours of effort. Yes, the game is randomized and its technically replayable an endless amount of times, but with the lack of content, I don't see myself replaying this game at all and I don't see this game really improving a whole lot in the future. TL;DR:Sheer lack of contentMinimal StoryRight now, totally not worth $25 ($10 MAYBE)			"

								I love this game, it'll keep you entertained for hours as you build up your town and train your men. Lots of crafting and expansion to be achieved in here. Weither you're building houses or carving your base into a mountain, or just building walls and defenses or training a small army to be undefeatable, you will not get bored here. Would highly recommend this game to anybody,Now for the down side: You only get 20 citizens through the game play so doing the combat quests can be a little hard if you dont strategize, also sometime the path will break when placing an object and an error message will pop up. But that's honestly all I have to say bad about it.			"

								While I may not have that many hours for this game on steam, I have played more than 20+ hours outside of Steam and have been following it since it first appeared on Kickstarter. This game is definitely worth your money, it's a great combination of RPG and City building and has many planned features that are currently being added or will be added eventually. Another great thing this game has is its active developers, who have consistently provided updates on the games progress and listened to the communities feedback, so you always know what's going down and will never leave the community out of loop wondering where the games is *Cough* Cube World *Cough*. If you want to see for yourself simply go to stonehearth.net and visit the Dev Blog.So if you're into city builders, RPG's and active developers this game is for you.			"

								I really do love the concept of this game.  The game has settlers left in the wilds to fend for themselves.  They slowly start to learn the basics to create their own city and a home for themeslves.At this point, though, the game is not ready.  The bugs are hard to get over and the game has not been updated to handle 'end of game' content or what happens when you level.  I build a place for everyone to sleep, to eat and then I'm pretty much done.  I have everyone collect resources, but really this only happens sometimes.  My blacksmith or Mason level up to create new things for my settlement, but I'm unable to impliment them, I don't see a reason to use them, and I can't make my own due to glitches.  Now I don't want you to stray from the basic game.  Despite this all, as I frist stated, the game is headed in the right direction and I hope it continues that way.  If the developer can pull this all together I think we'll have a huge hit on our hands a game I won't be able to stop playing.I do think the game is worth a try!  Watch out for the goblins!			"

								I've always been big on strategy games (since mid-late 90s) where you build your base, army, and go off killing those who try to kill me, such as command & conquer series, age of empires series, stronghold series and more.  I saw this game, ""Stonehearth"", on Kickstarter and just loved the whole concept.  they even had a great goals display to show you what their plans are.  Now I was skeptical to even put my money down because I was afraid they will just stop eventually and disappear like a great game that had potential, (The Stomping Land).I must say I’m very happy to have put my money in and then support them.  I played it since the beginning, even though I only have a total of about 15hrs, I just fell in love.  I stopped playing so that it can come up with better fixes, changes like any newly forming games.  I played it recently within few months and my goodness, it's even better!  they even have a dev map and objectives! I love it!Honestly, I highly consider this game to anyone that likes this whole minecraftish, base building, survival sandbox.  you can wait to buy it later or buy now, still great.  the dev's constantly work on this, they don't quit, they find more issues and fix them. they show videos on what they are working on, their issues they've encountered and so on.  I’m glad I put my money into this game.  i know in few months, this will become better than it is now with the speed and dedication all these workers put in. "

								StoneHearth has a very ""cutesy"" and ""family friendly"" look to it, and has a good and wide range of genres mixed together. its a great game for kids and adults alike.now the game is not ""feature complete"" or anything like that, it still has a lot of content to be added, but dont worry the devs wont give up, and most certaintly will finish the game.word of warning, the game is still very buggy. but then again that is the entire point of an alpha, squash the bugs and add awesome content. if you dont like the idea of playing a game that has lots of bugs and potential to crash, then this game is not for you. however if you love being right up front helping the devs hunt down and squash those bugs, then i recomend this game.Edit: it's been over a year since i reviewed this game, and i gotta say, Stonehearth has come a looonng way since my original review. the game has a ton of new features: new playable race, new monsters and campaigns, bunch of new classes, perfomrance improvements. and a bunch of other good stuff. and yes, there are still bugs and some crahses, but they'tend to be less frequent as before.so even after a year, i'd still recomend this game to anyone who likes town/city builders, early acces games, finding/reporting bugs, and being part of a great and friendly comunity.

If you are into city building, a touch of RPG, and don’t mind bugs then this is the perfect game for you. I find it surprisingly difficult to put this game and its backers into words on a review. But if you would like to find out for yourself head over to stoneheart.net (Love the new site by the way) and the evidence will be sitting right in front of you. "

								Stonehearth; the strategy survival game that isn't to be confused with Hearthstone. Now this is a great game and although it still lies within the grasps of ""EARLY ACCESS"" it has much potential that i can see it achieving in the future. With a very proud company stood behind it (Radiant) it is always improving, updating and upgrading your experience. However there are downsides to this game still being in early access. One being that the game still has many bugs which torment you throughout gameplay. One of my examples is the building bugs, now to begin i must say when i first saw this game i invisioned in my mind a huge expanding town with tall walls and a vast amount of buildings. Needless to say when i started designing and trying to create my own buildings i came up with one of the greatest problems. Buildings are at this point (alpha 16) really difficult to design without your heathlings (Settlers) just simply giving up mid-way. Now this is an issue that the company is working hard to address and you can see they are via their YouTube channel but still makes me suffer when trying to play this game how i want to play it. With other minor bugs that still annoy me throughout playing i still really enjoy this game and i love the abilities it has right now and is still improving! This game has so much to it and just to summarise:- Lots of different skills and professions- Tons of dynamic and varying enemies - Beautiful unique graphics- A world to explore and settle within - Over 100 items and resources to useI only have about 20 hours of gameplay (as of writing this review) but hope to get many more out of new alpha releases and maybe one day we will see this game be complete after its polished as this game could be great but falls short due to bugs and problems. Maybe consider supporting the creators to keep working on the game and give it a try.Would recommend! :)			"

Since that way the improvements made in patches have made the game more fun than the last time.What i really miss at the moment is having more pop (at writing moment, the max limit is 20, which is just enough to have a working settlement and 6 soldiers). More pre-made buildings; would be nice to have one building for each profession.Game crashed just as i reached the end. But unlike when i played last time, it didnt really lag or stuff like that.

								I kickstarted this game when it first showed up on kickstarter back in 2013.  It looked like a game with a lot of heart, and I believe it shows even in the early access stage.This game reminds me of Minecraft due to its graphical style and its voxel based world.  It however runs with the idea of building a civilization out of a small group of starting ""hearthlings"" as they are called.  You start with just a group of ""hearthlings"" and some supplies and then are tasked with creating a thriving kingdom from that.There are also a decent amount of mods available that add objects or campaigns to the game and they are worth checking out once you have some experience with the vanilla game.While there is not a lot of content in the game right now it is a fun little game that you can mess around with.  The updates seem to be more frequent now that the games development has hit the add content/fix bugs stage.			"

								A really good managing/city building game.My specs: GPU: GTX750ti                  RAM: 12gb                  CPU: i7-920Pros: -The game is often updated for bugs/optimisation (about once per week)         -The game is mostly in a playable state.         -Core gameplay is mostly there.         -Solid building system with rare bugs/crash.         -Load of jobs for your hearthlings (about 8 at the moment).         -There is really high number of stuff you can do to customize the way your city look.         -The game is quite well optimised unlike other Early Access game ive played.Cons: -Game sometime crash.          -Game has a weird thing that pop in the UI which block the entire screen sometimes and need the game to be restarted to fix it.

								I'm going to give a cautious thumbs up to this game. It is still very much in Early Access and it shows. There are bugs, unfinished features, very little documentation...pretty much everything you'd expect for a game still in active development.For all that, the devs are very active and quite open about where they are in the process and what they are working on. Much more than most other developers I've followed. It's reassuring to see things go up on their list and bits check checked off as features are added in.And what it does have already is quite fun and I find it rather addictive. Despite a few crashes and failed villages due to bugs, I keep coming back for more. There is just something so engrossing and relaxing about this game, I can't seem to make myself give it up!Personally I'm quite excited to see where it is going, and I think it is going to just get better and better.

Review: Alpha 10TL;DR:Do you like games like: Cultures The Settlers 1-4 (Before the serie was butchered) Castle Story City/Town Management games Designing thingsThen this is for you.More about the game:This is a sweet little gem of a game. The play-style is very much as a Cultures-like game, where you give your citizens a profession, which they get better at/more experience with. And then they can learn the next step of the profession tree. As an example Trapper(Hunter), who get's the bright idea that, ""Hey, i can just have animals in a pen, don't have to run around setting traps"". Much like how it works in Cultures, but you do not have any direct control over your citizens besides assigning them jobs. Some jobs, needs a workbench placed (Click on the citizen you have assigned a job to set a workbench), from there you can order items that the worker will make over time. The more they make, the more they can learn to make, some items can also be ""Fine"" which looks nicer.Any citizen that dosen't have anything to do, will help build buildings, mine, gather items and cut trees if given the general order (You select areas to mine/cut trees, which then whoever got time for it goes to do it). The games building system is pretty smart, tho still needs some slight work. Easy to build, place the floor. Auto-snap walls, auto-snap roofs, manually placed windows and doors. But the game also offers building templates, so just click and drop more or less(Works well if you don't want to use time building fancy buildings).There are currently two game modes, one which has enemies (Normal) and one without any dangers (Peaceful). The game is not very challenging just yet. Tho it might be a good idea to try out peaceful, just to get the general hang of things before heading into normal.The game itself looks great, very aesthetically pleasing, the characters look charming, smooth animations, pretty great character variety, trees have different ages and sizes. Terrain looks nice, eventho slightly plain right now. Will be looking forward to a bit more variation.Currently the game is in need of optimization, but that is something that will come along, especially since this is still in a early alpha. Alpha is all about adding new features and stuff for you to do. Optimization mostly comes from the beta. If you get a low framerate, i highly recommend turning down shadows if you have some performance problems.Conclusion:Personaly i really love it, it is a solid city-builder/managing, with some added rpg and combat. I know city-building isen't for everyone, but this is a great entry into the genre.Worth buying, if unsure, take a look at some gameplays!			"

								Sadly rare when a Kickstarter game lives up to expectations, but when it does happen they usually knock it out of the park. Stonehearth is one of those rare long-term Kickstarters which I've never regretted for a moment. The dev team is always responsive, the game is constantly evolving, and the community isn't as vile as a lot of toher builder games. It's an easy recommendation for a more casual building-focused DF-like. It's going to be a long haul for these guys as they get everything in this game that they envision, but it's worth every build!			"

								I got this game as a birthday gift from a friend a whileback when it was on kickstarter. At first i was a little skeptical about it since, A LOT of voxel games were out. After playing it for about 9.5 hours, its a lot of fun. I really enjoy the cute art style.The only thing about the game that is frustrating are the bugs.When you buy the game, be aware of the bugs. It is an early access game.If you do not want to experience crashes,bugs and so on wait till it is full release.Update:Welp, a bit over a year since my june 2015 review. And i love the game even more than ever now. Updates happen freqently, AND the team keeps everyone clued in as much as they can to whats going on. I love that, they continue to make me happier with the game with each update.			"

								8-5-16I've had this game for a very long time and have seen it come a long way, here are my gripes at this point that have prevented this game from being great and finally landing a negative review:They have kept the game ""playable"" throughout development which was a plus, fixing critical bugs along the way as well but the game, from the beginning, could not function past 4-6 hrs of playing because of poor optimization. This really limits the whole idea of this game and really enjoying the full potential of having your own little town. Another area of ""soreness"" has been the pathfinding AI, it has never really been great to begin with even with all of the improvements to it over development. The maps are quite small in reality and more people would complain as well if you could play long enough on one without having to restart. Another reason of really wondering where this game is going or what the final product will become.Until huge leaps of optimization and pathfinding find its way to this game, I'm going to have to say wait till a sale or more updates centered around these issues.

								Backed this game a while ago, great concept, and the Dev team is really doing some work to pull it all together.I do recomend this game. Its unusually addicting. I try not to play it very often because i want to experience more of the game all at once. Remember it is still very heavily under construction, so buying the game means expect bugs and what not, and please add constructive feedback. This game is backed by an excelent group of Devs.Great graphics for the style of game, music is addicting to say the least if not a bit repetitive right now. Gameplay although lacking many of the features they want to put in, even in its current state its amazingly fun.Similar to Timber and Stone but a little less hardcore in the mechanics (another game i recomend you check out). Free build cities block by block. Assign jobs to your people (Carpenters, Stonemasons, Chefs, Soldiers, and many more). Keep them fed happy and protected from an assortment of baddies.The only con i can see is the price. For the state of the game $25 is a little iffy. Certainly worth maybe $15 if you can catch a sale, and as long as the Devs stay on point it will be worth the $25 or even more.			"

								It is a great game. As for gameplay, it has its issues and is incomplete, but the game is beautiful, fun and, if the devs keep the good work, it will be a must for any lover of the style.But, as it is an early access, I'd like to focus on the developers. They are excellent people, work on every bug they can, are very transparent and posts constant updates in their blogs. If you're afraid of buying it because it is in EA, then you shouldn't be afraid anymore. Just hit their website www.stonehearth.net and take a look at their roadmap and devblog updates.			"

My OpinionStonehearth is fun game of Village construction and management. As the Devs said, it does remind me a lot of DnD or other fantasy worlds and universes. The Hearthlings all have their own streangths and weeknesses, but if you have too many they do start to seem quite similar. The building prossess for buildings, wall, canals, and bridges works quite well, allowingyou to build something simple and quickly, or complex and intricate over a period of time. The only issue with it is that on occasion the Hearthlings seem to stop building for no reason, causing you to have to save the blueprint and start over from the begining of construction hoping that it doesnt stop again. Rarely, they might accidentally trap themselves inside a buildings walls and starve to death because of this. Its more annoying then game breaking, but it is something the devs need to fix.The world that the Hearthlings can go to build a new home is quite diverse. Ore dominating the mountains while plants and fertile land dominates the lowlands. It cause you to have to think about where you settle at the start, as you dont want to send your Hearthlings too far from the saftey of your town. Goblins, Orcs, Entlings, Stoneling and more roam the forests and mountasins to attack, set up camps, and steal your stuff, providing quite the challange to defend your Hearthlings and stuff.Pros+Nice art that compliments theme of game+Monsters provide challange untill later game when you have a decent military and can deal with everything thrown at you+Animations on Hearthlings and Monsters make them have personallity and express feelings+Easy to use building system that is an, ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" type of thing+fun and easy to come back to gameplay+Really helpfull devs that actually care about their work and the issues their players are havingCons-Building is buggy at times, but it is still in alpha, so this isn't as bad-Hearthlings are utterly stupid and keep putting themselves in dangerous situations sometimes and not at others with the same command issued to them-Mechant stalls only seem to get the basic merchant types and not special or more specialised onesFinalFor a game in Alpha, it is incredibly far along for what it is. Many of the games core mechanics are implamented, and the game is a blast. I personally cant wait for Multiplayer, Magmasmiths, Geomancers, the Expanded story quests, visiuallised travaling merchants, Transportation options, the Rabbit clan, alternate planes, Dwarves, titans, more construction parts and decor, the combat system expansion, and all the other stuff the Devs are planning on adding over the versions. Stonehearth is game game I would reccomend to everyone.			"

								Reminds me a lot of dwarf fortress. I can only hope that the game gets that depth and complexity that dwarf fortress has. Excited to see where it goes. Definitely a fun few hours if you like city building type games.For the devs the only thing I wish is turning off the shadows of the clouds. Love the look but right now it slows down the image even through my i4-4790@3.6ghz doesn't get above 50% nor does my memory 16gb ddr3, Radeon R9 200 series. The only thing I can think of is that the shadows/lights isn't making use of all the resources and that causes some slow graphics.very dwarf fortress and when a game tries to do that (in 3d voxels no less) you're gonna run into some funk.

								After 7 tries, I've finally become comfortable in combat mode. I've got three levels consisting of farming, mining, and housing. There's a slight learning curve, but once you overcome it; it becomes beautiful. I really like Banished, and this mixes between banished and minecraft in a way that is Stonehearth. I've tried a lot of games in search of this feel and finally found it. Manage your village by managing your people and you can create wonders. I can't wait for the polished product.To the devs/design, there have been a few quirks with building, but I've learned to save often and reload my UI (F5). The save UI is a bit difficult to see, maybe and image bar on the right with a listing of saves that loads images on selection. Another note; the auto save feature seems to cause some issues with a couple of my games until I turned it off. I'll navigate the forums for defects of similar nature and post accordingly.Request: Allow prerequisite resource building for something that requires a base item. (eg. Creating multiple worker outfits will automatically create the required items if you have it, otherwise don't allow to create).A guard HAS to start with a wooden practice sword? I had better gear ready for the promotion, yet he required the wooden sword to promote. Anyways, if the max defense/attack item is available in stock, then equip that ish.I held off building; buildings. The reason was because in my last game, the doors, windows, and such were applied to the physical building, but not in the building completion list. I then decided not to care about building finalization until the workers took down the outer ladders.Speaking of outer ladders, I planted some trees nearby and they grew quite large. While building the tower, the top of the tree was used as a surface. The issue is that the ladder could not then be taken down. I failed at cutting down the tree to see what happens.Users: Use auto-save with caution. Scoring Card That Shouldn't Matter because you need to play it to say it---Coding: 9/10 ((on point)-1)Graphic Design: 8/10 (Hits pretty hard at high settings on my nVidia GTX 970, switched to medium for a more chill and netflix feel and I'm happy with the settings.

I got lucky and traded poo for 2 copper armor that got me through battles early game.- Upgrade your guards!- Farm it all (I always have at least 2 farmers, then when one is ready for Cook, I'll bring in another farmer once I've promoted the farmer to Cook.)- Build everything! Also, once your guards upgrade, you'll have gear to sell, but save some for the next recruit!!- Blueprints are pretty cool! I made a simple 1 story empty shop for the different shops. I'm about to make a blueprint for each craft. :)- I started at the 2nd level of ground from a lake, 1 story up is stone, so I get the whole shibang.- I'm still trying to get my blacksmith to level 6 so I can craft a gold chest that can hold 256 items. Nice number btw.- I went without a carpenter for a while to have a couple of workers at least- When creating a new game; get the farmer, weaver, and guard items (hoe, spindle, and wooden practice sword)- I haven't noticed any speed increase in having paths, so I use them as asthetics. You'll need the weaver to make a bunch of winter outfits (I'm still in Spring and my workers wear the Winter gear for the speed increase)- QuestionsQ: I haven't hit winter yet; should I expect to have a warm environment built, outside and in?A: My hope: Yes, you're screwed.Q: How long are the seasons? A: 30 days. Just hit dewmon (2nd) :)My theory: 90 days per season, give or take a fewQ: Why do I like this game so much?A: It exceeded my expectations and continues to ensure playabilityOverall (tl;dr), I will give this game an 8.33/10 in its current state and would recommend this to anyone.

								8-5-16I've had this game for a very long time and have seen it come a long way, here are my gripes at this point that have prevented this game from being great and finally landing a negative review:They have kept the game ""playable"" throughout development which was a plus, fixing critical bugs along the way as well but the game, from the beginning, could not function past 4-6 hrs of playing because of poor optimization. This really limits the whole idea of this game and really enjoying the full potential of having your own little town. Another area of ""soreness"" has been the pathfinding AI, it has never really been great to begin with even with all of the improvements to it over development. The maps are quite small in reality and more people would complain as well if you could play long enough on one without having to restart. Another reason of really wondering where this game is going or what the final product will become.Until huge leaps of optimization and pathfinding find its way to this game, I'm going to have to say wait till a sale or more updates centered around these issues.

								Backed this game a while ago, great concept, and the Dev team is really doing some work to pull it all together.I do recomend this game. Its unusually addicting. I try not to play it very often because i want to experience more of the game all at once. Remember it is still very heavily under construction, so buying the game means expect bugs and what not, and please add constructive feedback. This game is backed by an excelent group of Devs.Great graphics for the style of game, music is addicting to say the least if not a bit repetitive right now. Gameplay although lacking many of the features they want to put in, even in its current state its amazingly fun.Similar to Timber and Stone but a little less hardcore in the mechanics (another game i recomend you check out). Free build cities block by block. Assign jobs to your people (Carpenters, Stonemasons, Chefs, Soldiers, and many more). Keep them fed happy and protected from an assortment of baddies.The only con i can see is the price. For the state of the game $25 is a little iffy. Certainly worth maybe $15 if you can catch a sale, and as long as the Devs stay on point it will be worth the $25 or even more.			"

								First off, I love this game. I completly understand that its not finished, and still needs a lot of work, but gosh dang do i love this game.This is the type of game that I can get lost in. Sit down and turn on some music or a movie and just play for hours on end. I find this game very relaxing. well.... at times it can be relaxing.The only problem i have with this game is the frequency of attackers when playing in normal or hard modes. i find it hard to get thing done and make progress at times because im all ways focused on my army and possible attack routs. over all I would give this game a 8/10 as it stands right now.

My OpinionStonehearth is fun game of Village construction and management. As the Devs said, it does remind me a lot of DnD or other fantasy worlds and universes. The Hearthlings all have their own streangths and weeknesses, but if you have too many they do start to seem quite similar. The building prossess for buildings, wall, canals, and bridges works quite well, allowingyou to build something simple and quickly, or complex and intricate over a period of time. The only issue with it is that on occasion the Hearthlings seem to stop building for no reason, causing you to have to save the blueprint and start over from the begining of construction hoping that it doesnt stop again. Rarely, they might accidentally trap themselves inside a buildings walls and starve to death because of this. Its more annoying then game breaking, but it is something the devs need to fix.The world that the Hearthlings can go to build a new home is quite diverse. Ore dominating the mountains while plants and fertile land dominates the lowlands. It cause you to have to think about where you settle at the start, as you dont want to send your Hearthlings too far from the saftey of your town. Goblins, Orcs, Entlings, Stoneling and more roam the forests and mountasins to attack, set up camps, and steal your stuff, providing quite the challange to defend your Hearthlings and stuff.Pros+Nice art that compliments theme of game+Monsters provide challange untill later game when you have a decent military and can deal with everything thrown at you+Animations on Hearthlings and Monsters make them have personallity and express feelings+Easy to use building system that is an, ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" type of thing+fun and easy to come back to gameplay+Really helpfull devs that actually care about their work and the issues their players are havingCons-Building is buggy at times, but it is still in alpha, so this isn't as bad-Hearthlings are utterly stupid and keep putting themselves in dangerous situations sometimes and not at others with the same command issued to them-Mechant stalls only seem to get the basic merchant types and not special or more specialised onesFinalFor a game in Alpha, it is incredibly far along for what it is. Many of the games core mechanics are implamented, and the game is a blast. I personally cant wait for Multiplayer, Magmasmiths, Geomancers, the Expanded story quests, visiuallised travaling merchants, Transportation options, the Rabbit clan, alternate planes, Dwarves, titans, more construction parts and decor, the combat system expansion, and all the other stuff the Devs are planning on adding over the versions. Stonehearth is game game I would reccomend to everyone.			"

								Stonehearth is a great game by Radiant. This is one of the best purcheses I have made on steam. It's a nice city building game unlike any other! Monsters will attack your colony of hearthlings, but if you're not into the stuff, you can turn them off. The UI is great and it's fun to watch your colony grow to a threiving city. Another really cool thing is that I feel more conected with my hearthlings in Stonehearth then I do my villagers in Banaished or workers in Rise of Nation. They have names, there own look, and you only start off with a handfull so you get to know them very well. Remmeber that the gam is still in alpha, so there will be bugs and lack of content.Good:-City building (I like sandbox city building games)-Can turn enemies on and off-Kid freindly-Nice UI-Can design buildings-If your not gooding at building your own houses, you can use pre-made ones.-Even there it is still alpha, it's not an aboundend Early Access Game like banished and other uncompleted games that are on steam-The devs will sometimes stream them working on the games so they can get live feedback with the fans and can add what the fans want while the fan talks about it.Bad:-It's early access, there are bugs and a lack of content, but they are still coming out with updates to add the contenct. They even have a multiplayer mode planed.-Lack of tutorial so it can be hard for new players, but the games is only in alpha and there most likely will add that later.			"

								OK, Where to start.Well the game doesnt have an autosave so my first 3 hours are no longer exsistant. So SAVE REGULARLY. Other than a few engine bugs and trapped citizens the game performs well. By trapped citizens, i had to start 3 different saves as the citizens would spawn in some tress and be trapped up there. Engine bugs tend to happen when i place items into the chests.Its fun to an extent, once you have a knight, invaders are kind pointless as they dont really get stronger, just the same enemies in a bigger group. When you get a cleric it becomes stupidly easier to fend off invasions as they seem to heal only the knight and the knight likes to tank everything in the vicinity allowing for quick easier kills on everything else with archers or footmen.DO NOT BUILD TOWERS IN A HOUSE OR CITIZENS WILL KILL THEM SELVES BY BUILDING THE WALLS AROUND THEMSELVES.Farmers seem to be a bit slow a tending crops as well as having a short attention span, would be nice if you could assign a farmer to a specific group of plot.Altogether, Great game. Would recomend if you like being god.  Just dont build into the mountain side like i did, hard to grow crops under 40ft of stone.EDIT: There is an auto save, im just a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot.			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth. Not to be confused with the card game Hearthstone nor the novel Stone Heart by Charlie Fletcher.It's a medieval town building game where you control what your settlers, also known as Hearthlings, do, somewhat.It has a Sims-esque overhead view where you can position the camera to watch settlers eat, sleep, mourn over the fact they ate a turnip raw, or plant the camera into a nearby mountain and see how fast you can scroll out of the mountain.Enough about the camera, what about the gameplay?It does have strong points, the Hearthlings can farm, mine, deforest an ecosystem for a chair, or be threatened by goblins about 1/3 of their height. Hearthlings don't fight back when attacked by monsters. Oh, sorry, they do. They just have to have another Hearthling be killed in order to do 1/4 a heart of damage. Sort of a human shield metaphor going on.The only ones who will fight back before wimping out because they were attacked are footmen, knights, archers, and walking bandages- whoops. I meant clerics. I thought this supposed to be a town building game, not a DnD set up.Before I continue, I'd just like to point out that the ""heart"" I speak of serve as a HP bar, when there is only one heart.The combat is interesting, albeit unforgiving if you are outnumbered. Enemies will group up if Hearthlings don't kill them fast enough and they will chop at their health like a chef to a carrot.Speaking of carrots, there's farming. It is quite smart to have a rot system on raw ingredients, but from what I know, cooking the food will eliminate rotting and make it an MRE, essentially. But before your Hearthlings can have a nice serving of cold soup, you must have a cook because it seems like the Hearthlings were spoonfed and never learned how to roast a carrot over the campfire you are given from the very start. Oh yeah, there are levels for jobs as well, still leaning to the DnD metaphor, since the Hearthlings get buffs and skills from leveling up. Extra damage, more recipes, being able to herd sheep you pulled from your bum.""Ok, it looks like I need an archer and a knight since these footmen are getting destroyed by a sentient stump.""""Hold on there! Your footmen are only level 2! They need to be level 3 before you can promote them! Just have them walk in circles around that small farm plot for 4 hours!""""That seems easy, 4 hours ingame isn't that long, it's 4 minutes.""""No, I meant 4 hours in real time.""So I may have exaggerated there about leveling up. The Hearthlings level up their job by, er, doing their job. Farmers farm, Blacksmiths smith, Soldiers stare at dirt.Some Hearthlings level up faster than others because of their special buffs. There are 3, but based on value, the only ones worth having are Body and Mind. Body (health) is pretty straight forward. Mind makes your Hearthlings level faster and create better versions of items.I didn't really understand that. How does a carpenter take the materials to make 1 chair and create 2, while one chair is of higher quality?The higher quality furniture doesn't have any other use other than having a nicer look and a higher gold value. Trading in this game is similar to other games; Vender sells item at a fixed price, you can sell the same item for half. Sometimes you can get specialty deals from wandering traders. While some are good, the others are asinine. Some come along the line of ""I'll give you one twig for your 54 baskets of pumpkins!"" or ""I'll give you 40 steel bars if you show me a smile, you heartless being!"" Before you can make this transaction, you must wait a period because, I don't know, the trader has to preform a broadway play or something. Which makes sense, they make a deal which can be done in a minute or in 5 days. Sometimes you can get a trade for something from the other band of Hearthlings, which is nice if you hate seeing the same stalks of yellow vegetables. I couldn't say it WORKS yet, let me find out later, I got an offer for watermellon seeds and it just seems like it took my corn.Deforestation is also an issue. They fixed that by adding farmable saplings. ""What? Now it's both DnD AND Minecraft?! It's just a rip!"" And that is why those who point out things like that shouldn't make reviews. Wait... Anyway, be prepared to either have a sapling farm that makes 1 sapling every harvest, which isn't a lot, or 200 every harvest, which is just a tad too much.While writing this, I realized this review was long. Before I end this and rethink my life, there are a couple of things.Do I recommend it? Yes, I do. I'd recommend it only to people with beefy computers.What did you mean ""control the Hearthlings somewhat?"" Hearthlings act like they are their own AI, they run to get a log of wood that is guarded heavily by wolves. They destroy ladders from construction of a building while a Hearthling or 2 are still on the roof. Which, in return, they die from lack of food and things to do.What's a good starting point? Stay in the forests and on ledges, you can dig a trench and monsters won't attack your town (it actually does work based on it's pathfinding).			"

								This game has more in it than one would expect from an Alpha game. There is such a huge amount of fun to be had during your first play through, if you don't die that is, while unlocking the new jobs you can assign to your citizens. The game is cute and also quite the management simulator making decisions on what products you need vs how fast or what order you should do them in in order to keep your troops geared and healed to keep protecting your town etc. Overall this game is gonna get 4 big stars from me. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 is tha the combat is just a bit bland. There are the healers, archers, and melee units. There is no differences between healers and archers they all work the same there is just a slight difference in melee units. All melee you will face only damage 1 of your guys at a time and just have a smack battle to see who dies first the only melee that is different are the giant ogres which have an aoe. So the combat is very cool looking and you have a lot of control as to what your individual fights do but the actual mechanic variety in the enemies is low to non but hey its Alpha theres alot of potential to be had.

								Reminds me a lot of dwarf fortress. I can only hope that the game gets that depth and complexity that dwarf fortress has. Excited to see where it goes. Definitely a fun few hours if you like city building type games.For the devs the only thing I wish is turning off the shadows of the clouds. Love the look but right now it slows down the image even through my i4-4790@3.6ghz doesn't get above 50% nor does my memory 16gb ddr3, Radeon R9 200 series. The only thing I can think of is that the shadows/lights isn't making use of all the resources and that causes some slow graphics.very dwarf fortress and when a game tries to do that (in 3d voxels no less) you're gonna run into some funk.

								Amazing game. Having a ton of fun on it so far. However, I've had to completely ditch a few of my well-built worlds because of bugs. Sometimes I have to restart my world because it bugs out and my hearthlings won't build a building I've requested them to build.Also, I wish there was a way to make seperate rooms in a building. I mean, you can with freestanding walls, but the freestanding walls have ugly columns and if you connect it to a corner, then it makes these ugly columns. If you could hide the columns on the freestanding walls it'd be good.Other than the massive amount of bugs (only because the game is in early access right now), the game is amazing and I enjoy it a ton.

								When it comes to voxel games this might be the next holy grail. A sandbox ""city building"" game with crafting support and basic trading, this one mixes it all into one enjoyable game.Due to its early access phase its not a game I would suggest everybody to play right now. However, if you are not easily aggrivated by bugs in an early access game this might be the one game you have to try in the least.This game has a very active community which can be found trough the discourse Stonehearth website.Ofcourse the quality of the game isn't decided by its community, but the support the developers receive of all the players does help it to get in on track of becoming one of the better games out there. What does make the game so great is that it carries a replayability in its core design that will keep the players coming back over and over to sink more hours into Stonehearth.The music you hear while playing is not distracting and fits the game just right. Same goes for most of the sound effects. After about 15 minutes you'll learn to recognise the warning sounds from when your town is under attack and it feels almost like it has always been that way.The graphics aren't the best but its a voxel game that pushes the feeling of older 8-bit games into a modern 3D game environment. And it does it great, it shows a style that wasn't unique among similar games but if you see video's of screenshots you know that its Stonehearth. Together with the sound and music it just fits.The UI is userfriendly enough that without a tutorial you will learn to use it within the first 30 minutes. A small concern is the usage of the combat menu. You will navigate trough to many buttons in my opinion to react quickly enough to the enemy invaders of your town that there is a higher chance that one of your soldiers wont survive the battle.Also, because the game features your villagers as free spirited enitites, you give them commands that arent't always exact. This will give you the feeling that the AI is not listening or your villagers seem to be complete idiots.This can be very frustrating sometimes and with the early access bugs you will need alot of patience.With everything together I would give the game an 8 out of 10 score and when it comes out of early accesss I'd advise it to any voxel/city builder/strategy lover out there to at least give it a try.

								Early accessIt's rather fun, and you loose track of time. I easily get bored, fast, and even if I restart ""my journey"" with these hearthlings over and over (because something in the game didn't work out like I wanted to) I don't get bored - I can restart the game 10 times and it's as fun as the first time, tho it does say something, that I have to restart it 10 times...The good-It's easy to understand how to do things, as there are no instructions or learn-how-to-play-guides in the game. -Fun animations and rather good design. It's like a better version of MInecraft with more characters (several Hearthlings)-It doesn't take time to acheive certain goals you set. There are no goals in game, but if you want to build a huge castle and whatever, it doesn't take forever like in other games.-You don't just like your hearthlings, you love them and care for them.The bad-Remove buildings and other functions doesn't always work, and it seems some of it will never work. Delete a building, sure, but only after you exit and then re-enter the game --- delete or add a specific furniture/object in an existing building, no way José, you better had thought of what you wanted from the beginning!-You don't get to pick your hearthlings - they are diced, and you can't keep the ones you like and dice the rest... Same with map. Everything is random, and maybe that is good, but I like to pick my people and places.-No goals, red thread, main story. It's just  a sandbox... Maybe that's why I keep restarting the game, the biggest challenge is the start-up, after that it's too easy - even in hard mode.The ugly-I have found myself spending more time deciding on what group I shall have and picking the place, when that is done, I exit the game cuz I've been on it for 1,5 hours already...-If things go sour, it's easier to restart than to fix the tragedies... ""Oh no, almost everyone died! Meh, I restart it.""All in all, the game has room for improvement, but even like it is, it's ok. Minecraft gives me headache, this doesn't.***Added 67 hours into the game***The Ugly -I stand fast about the dicing and rerolls for the pick of hearthlings, yesterday I sat 1 hour just choosing the group. Now THAT gives me headache! Why not a sum of stats that I can hand out?-I have also found out, I have no idea what stats is best for each job. I mean, the herbalist, is that really some physical work or might it need high mental abilities figuring out recipies or is that ""I'm one with nature"" and need spirit? I understand with the trapper that if I don't want ""pets"" it should be a hearthling with low spirit, but does that mean that it wont spawn as much critters around?-67 hours in and I still can't figure some stuff out, does curtains buff the mood, what job requires what stats, why does the lake empty as soon as I build a mote?!

								If you quite like sandbox games where you build and mine, this is not the game for you. I am completely aware that this game is in early access and that content has not all been fixed in place, however there are other games out there that do the same thing, but better and cheaper.

This game is worth $5. If you are looking for an interesting game to play that are similar I would reccommend Gnomoria, Craft The World, and Banished. Totally worth the money.

								TL;DR= Wait to get it- give it a few more updates or wait until it's on sale, and then try it. It's going to be a super-fun game when it's finished. :)------I really, really want to love this game, and there's SOOOO MUCH POTENTIAL! Especially if they fill in the ""talent/job trees"" and optimize the graphics a bit.""Why I'm downvoting"": I'm usually really comfortable with games with lots of bugs in it- I can generally find a run-around and it's not a big deal.However in the case of Stonehearth, several of the bugs are completely game breaking (Not finishing building construction, villagers idling without reason, crafting tables not working (GUI reloads not working), etc..) and due to one reason or another I've found I've had to start a new game every 2-3 hours or so.  Which is frustrating when the game is pretty much all about resource gathering and village progression/development.When it's finished/optimized, I will absolutely re-throw my money at the developers wholeheartedly.

								This seemed like a very enjoyable game. Combining the freedom to build of Minecraft and the nature of group survival. However, after playing the game for a few hours and exiting, the game would no longer launch. It would seem after looking into methods to repair that this is a common issue and I hope the developers can repairs this soon. Overall, enjoyable game with no playability makes me advise players to stear clear of this game until repaired.			"

So dont expect to much  :PThis pretty much still holds true.......but i had the game for a year and devlopment advancements seems very limited.....So im starting to be a bit more doubtfull about this recommendation.community is generally good but does hold some favoritisme in my impression......and i think the game suffers a bit under that......moving focus to things that dont matter......get the basic building system working before you start making sheep behavior..and unfrotunately i seen nothing of that.......heartlings still faill my most basic buildings.....the core of the game :/ Not even incredible simple stuff has been added as more color choices..Vertical build space is still not a thing.  see tru wall tool will never work.....I still reccommend it but it wont stay this way for long......

								Before you play even though the reviews are very positive, make sure there is a sale before spending $25 or so.The game somewhat acts alot like Rimworld and Minecraft except you cant manually control your civilians.Bugs Ive encountered: missing heads, or head is where the torso of the character is, Stop building and working, no tutorial even though it takes around a hour to figure out how things work. For me after and hour of playing, didnt even save the game yet, a UI error appeared and the game broke, it was somewhat playable but i couldnt open my building tabs or job menus.... this was truly a waste of $25... ive read the reviews and watched gameplay... i reccomend you buy this when it is fully developed or when they lower the prive because this is more of a $10 game than it is $25... But hey add some things and it might even be worth $14.99 but not $25, even if everything is fixed and done it wont be worth $25, thats just a ripoff.			"

								When it comes to voxel games this might be the next holy grail. A sandbox ""city building"" game with crafting support and basic trading, this one mixes it all into one enjoyable game.Due to its early access phase its not a game I would suggest everybody to play right now. However, if you are not easily aggrivated by bugs in an early access game this might be the one game you have to try in the least.This game has a very active community which can be found trough the discourse Stonehearth website.Ofcourse the quality of the game isn't decided by its community, but the support the developers receive of all the players does help it to get in on track of becoming one of the better games out there. What does make the game so great is that it carries a replayability in its core design that will keep the players coming back over and over to sink more hours into Stonehearth.The music you hear while playing is not distracting and fits the game just right. Same goes for most of the sound effects. After about 15 minutes you'll learn to recognise the warning sounds from when your town is under attack and it feels almost like it has always been that way.The graphics aren't the best but its a voxel game that pushes the feeling of older 8-bit games into a modern 3D game environment. And it does it great, it shows a style that wasn't unique among similar games but if you see video's of screenshots you know that its Stonehearth. Together with the sound and music it just fits.The UI is userfriendly enough that without a tutorial you will learn to use it within the first 30 minutes. A small concern is the usage of the combat menu. You will navigate trough to many buttons in my opinion to react quickly enough to the enemy invaders of your town that there is a higher chance that one of your soldiers wont survive the battle.Also, because the game features your villagers as free spirited enitites, you give them commands that arent't always exact. This will give you the feeling that the AI is not listening or your villagers seem to be complete idiots.This can be very frustrating sometimes and with the early access bugs you will need alot of patience.With everything together I would give the game an 8 out of 10 score and when it comes out of early accesss I'd advise it to any voxel/city builder/strategy lover out there to at least give it a try.

								It has the potential to become something great, but i feel the game is a little disorganized in gameplay.  Theres some micromanagement needed to produce goods, and I feel the hearthlings needs better AI to collect reasources and items that are just lying on the ground. Not only that I have trouble crafting because i don't have an instant idea of what reasources i already have and and what i need to craft new items and even build buildings. I guess what I think the game really needs right now is for the hearthlings to become more intilligent and autnomous so that they're always doing something productive other than restocking the stockpile when i'm not giving orders.These are all things i think should be dealt with as the game updates. Quite frankly i'm impressed that the game is set to continue running depsite all the erros and bugs that pop up which is of course a clear indication that the game still needs some polishing. But I am sure that once this game is eventually completed it should become something very fun.			"

								Been playing stonehearth for some time now. Devs are great people and listen to their audience. They are fast paced at fixing issues and listen when you give advice. The game itself is amazing, even in early stages like this. With each new alpha the game grows phenomenally, and gives you so many additional things to do. It has it's bugs yes, but its early access and people need to remember that. If you bug out, read into it, find out if its common, and talk about it. We have the opportunity to form this game and make it what it is that we all want to play. Give the devs your ideas, but remember. They are gamers just like us, and want to help end our boredom and give us something great!			"

								One of the backers, here. Game is still in early alpha, but, by this point, has a fair amount to offer. Multiple-story buildings, combat, raids and counter-raids, and some nasties that come say hi at night. Great town simulation game with fun RPG elements.At the moment it's still short of what it wants to be, but with the progress the devs have made in the transparency in their progression, I doubt it will be long before you can play with your buddies and experience the other classes and goodies the game will offer.It's a game I've had fun coming back to nearly every update, and one that I eagerly await release of.

								TL;DRToo exensive for so little content.In itself the game has a lot of potential. Basically it is a RTS Minecraft more or less. You decide what your villagers build, what furniture or weapons they craft etc etc.Sadly, the content so far is very limited. And it does not feel like there is any progress in this regard.After the first few nights it feels like there is nothing left to do. You have accomodation, a few farms and traps and a small military squad to fend off invaders.From that point onward it is literally just wathing your villagers eat and sleep.If the devs would add more content this would definitely be a recommendation. But in its current state the game is way too expensive.			"

								I enjoy this game for the first 30 or so minutes but you can tell it's still a work in progress. One major issue I have problems with is after about 30 minutes of game time it slows down and starts lagging. I'm not sure of the reason for this, I assume it's because it's loading more of the map into RAM as I explore. So i find that the more of the map I explore the slower the game becomes until it's basically unplayable. Once this issue with lag and RAM hogging is resolved it would be a great game and I will recommend the game.			"

								TL;DR - If you like sim/survival games à la Gnomoria, Craft the World, etc... This game VERY worth it.This is one of the best Dwarf Fortress clone on the market at the moment. It beats games like Gnomoria out of the water mainly because of slick UI and easy to navigate Z axis for depth mining.There are bugs. But nothing extremely game breaking at the moment, the devs seem to be doing a good job of cleaning up their code.As some people mentioned, VERY CPU intensive. I've noticed that it seems the game has a memory leak problem, it'll run smooth for a few hours, but after 3-4 hours straight in one settlement, it starts to frame lag. Closing the program, waiting, and restarting fixes this. So at least it's not something permanent even if you have 30+ settles and a lot of business on the screen.I love the Tech tree idea, I hope it will come with a lots more jobs and advacements.Building design is HARD! If you're new, don't bother with it, take the default buildings and run with that. After a few games you can start banging your head on the design thing. It's not intuitive, that's the biggest problem, but once you get the functions, it DOES get  quite easy.Pros- FUN! The game might not be feature complete, but it's a hell of a lof of fun- Slick UI and non-confusing X,Y,Z in 3D environment nagivation (not easy to do imho)-Crafting! Gosh I love crafting, and this has already quite a few recipes. Could have a lot more, hope it gets more, but already very satisfactory- Sound and music: bravo- The two different tribes and map types give interesting variation in gameplay. - Some jobs are retro compatible, e.g. cook will keep faming. Which is a very cool feature- There are small quests and bigger mission types to get your town marked with township and such, so keep on going even if it seems you are at the end of progression, some nifty things are coming your way- Nice graphicsCons- Seems the mobs are very scripted, completely not random. Depending on your difficulty, you will always get the same waves at the same time. There are random mobs and spawns on the map, but by now I can already mark down when the first 5-10 invasions will happen in a Mid or Hard game. Takes away from the excitement.- Some bugs. Most annoying at the moment for me is that after level 6 or so while digging, mining highlight do not sticky. The task seems to be set in, but the yellow marker doesn't show. Hard to keep track of where I clicked.- Current soldier AI is not very good. I've had my soldiers die because they completely split up when attacking, specially when chasing Archer/Ranged type enemies, and they end up dying 1 by 1 even at high levels because they just don't work together. Lots of micromanagement needed on your troops which can be annoying.- Some parts of the game are no obvious. Where do you get sheep, or Poyos? Still need to find it out...Suggestions- Give workers levels too. They work so hard, and get nothing for it, poor things. But seriously, it would make sense to have your base workers be able to gain levels and maybe advance in things like: harvesting, mining, hauling (inventory expansions, etc...)- Priority system for the regular worker tasks (see Craft the World)-Allow remapping of the keys! I can't tell you how many times I send my damn tribe in alert mode because I am trying to turn a furniture piece to the left before placement, whoever took R as the alarm instead of ROTATION never played these games before :P- It doesn't seem to have any benefit to level up a class to the max before promoting your Hearthling to the next job. Would be cool if some bonuses would stick. Specially when it comes to the military, as a Knight level 1 might get trampled even if he was a Footman level 6 before.- Would be nice to be able to set patrol areas for your soldiers, instead of having them just marching in the base camp all the time- And on/off switch for soldiers would be great. If not walking/training, they could function as regular workers- Training area for soldiers/archers etc...- MORE MAGIC! Love the cleric, need more- Babies! Marriage, love, interactions, old age?- Fishing!- Multiplayer would be a blast, but I guess quite hard to do with Co-Op mode?- Dyes for clothes, more clothes with bonuses for the various jobs- Bit more functionalities for pets, don't even notice I have any most of the timeSpecsWin 10intel i7 479016 GB RAMGeForce GTX 980			"

								Funny Game (like Gnomoria, but easier and a lot more intuitive to start with). Now I'm waiting for a multiplayer coop-version and some improvements. Edit: - For the status, the game is (at the moment: June 2016) not worth 24Euros. Honestly, it most be like gnomoria about 5-10 Euros, not more. If everything works (includes Coop-Multiplayer) we can talk about more then 10Euros.			"

								I enjoy this game for the first 30 or so minutes but you can tell it's still a work in progress. One major issue I have problems with is after about 30 minutes of game time it slows down and starts lagging. I'm not sure of the reason for this, I assume it's because it's loading more of the map into RAM as I explore. So i find that the more of the map I explore the slower the game becomes until it's basically unplayable. Once this issue with lag and RAM hogging is resolved it would be a great game and I will recommend the game.			"

								TL;DRToo exensive for so little content.In itself the game has a lot of potential. Basically it is a RTS Minecraft more or less. You decide what your villagers build, what furniture or weapons they craft etc etc.Sadly, the content so far is very limited. And it does not feel like there is any progress in this regard.After the first few nights it feels like there is nothing left to do. You have accomodation, a few farms and traps and a small military squad to fend off invaders.From that point onward it is literally just wathing your villagers eat and sleep.If the devs would add more content this would definitely be a recommendation. But in its current state the game is way too expensive.			"

These aren't crashes from me doing unusuak♥♥♥♥♥♥by the way, Ill try to create a stockpile, crash. I'll try to select a character in the citizens list, crash.

								TL;DR - If you like sim/survival games à la Gnomoria, Craft the World, etc... This game VERY worth it.This is one of the best Dwarf Fortress clone on the market at the moment. It beats games like Gnomoria out of the water mainly because of slick UI and easy to navigate Z axis for depth mining.There are bugs. But nothing extremely game breaking at the moment, the devs seem to be doing a good job of cleaning up their code.As some people mentioned, VERY CPU intensive. I've noticed that it seems the game has a memory leak problem, it'll run smooth for a few hours, but after 3-4 hours straight in one settlement, it starts to frame lag. Closing the program, waiting, and restarting fixes this. So at least it's not something permanent even if you have 30+ settles and a lot of business on the screen.I love the Tech tree idea, I hope it will come with a lots more jobs and advacements.Building design is HARD! If you're new, don't bother with it, take the default buildings and run with that. After a few games you can start banging your head on the design thing. It's not intuitive, that's the biggest problem, but once you get the functions, it DOES get  quite easy.Pros- FUN! The game might not be feature complete, but it's a hell of a lof of fun- Slick UI and non-confusing X,Y,Z in 3D environment nagivation (not easy to do imho)-Crafting! Gosh I love crafting, and this has already quite a few recipes. Could have a lot more, hope it gets more, but already very satisfactory- Sound and music: bravo- The two different tribes and map types give interesting variation in gameplay. - Some jobs are retro compatible, e.g. cook will keep faming. Which is a very cool feature- There are small quests and bigger mission types to get your town marked with township and such, so keep on going even if it seems you are at the end of progression, some nifty things are coming your way- Nice graphicsCons- Seems the mobs are very scripted, completely not random. Depending on your difficulty, you will always get the same waves at the same time. There are random mobs and spawns on the map, but by now I can already mark down when the first 5-10 invasions will happen in a Mid or Hard game. Takes away from the excitement.- Some bugs. Most annoying at the moment for me is that after level 6 or so while digging, mining highlight do not sticky. The task seems to be set in, but the yellow marker doesn't show. Hard to keep track of where I clicked.- Current soldier AI is not very good. I've had my soldiers die because they completely split up when attacking, specially when chasing Archer/Ranged type enemies, and they end up dying 1 by 1 even at high levels because they just don't work together. Lots of micromanagement needed on your troops which can be annoying.- Some parts of the game are no obvious. Where do you get sheep, or Poyos? Still need to find it out...Suggestions- Give workers levels too. They work so hard, and get nothing for it, poor things. But seriously, it would make sense to have your base workers be able to gain levels and maybe advance in things like: harvesting, mining, hauling (inventory expansions, etc...)- Priority system for the regular worker tasks (see Craft the World)-Allow remapping of the keys! I can't tell you how many times I send my damn tribe in alert mode because I am trying to turn a furniture piece to the left before placement, whoever took R as the alarm instead of ROTATION never played these games before :P- It doesn't seem to have any benefit to level up a class to the max before promoting your Hearthling to the next job. Would be cool if some bonuses would stick. Specially when it comes to the military, as a Knight level 1 might get trampled even if he was a Footman level 6 before.- Would be nice to be able to set patrol areas for your soldiers, instead of having them just marching in the base camp all the time- And on/off switch for soldiers would be great. If not walking/training, they could function as regular workers- Training area for soldiers/archers etc...- MORE MAGIC! Love the cleric, need more- Babies! Marriage, love, interactions, old age?- Fishing!- Multiplayer would be a blast, but I guess quite hard to do with Co-Op mode?- Dyes for clothes, more clothes with bonuses for the various jobs- Bit more functionalities for pets, don't even notice I have any most of the timeSpecsWin 10intel i7 479016 GB RAMGeForce GTX 980			"

								I've had this game for about six months now. Enjoyed it a lot ! This game is brilliant and is kind of  defining a new game ""genre"" with it's unsual mix. Minecraft, Final Fantasy Tactics, real-time strategy with complex economy and yet... a significant touch of RPG. You really have to try it in order to understand the thin line on which the devs are refining the new concept. One of the best thing is probably it's adaptability. The game let you choose without asking or inteferring if you want to focus on building peacefully or on the adventure and the fighting... or both. You don't have to developp and max every job tree available, yet you can try and face a really interesting challenge.BUT... I'm beginning to be bored. Maybe it's the fact that the game developped so fast during the first months... now the last 2 alphas we're about the building system. But everytime I come back and try and lunch a new game to see if the bugs in the building system got rid of... I just face the same fact : those scaffolding are driving me mad ! It's still impossible to build a decent 10x14 blocs, 2 floors house without having those staying on the stairs inside or on the walls or on the cliffs or...whatever... Are the devs going to clear this bug definitely one day ?			"

								Stonehearth is a rather charming village builder. You start out with a handfull of ""Hearthlings"" to start out your village. By making buildings, gathering food, getting wealth, and keeping moral you can grow your population. I have been playing this on and off for the past year or so and have seen some great improvements from the devs and can't wait to see what is coming in the future. You kind of have to be in the right mood to play this game; sort of in a relaxed, animated fantasy sort of mood. But I suppose you kind of have to be in the right mood to play any game. Today, I'm going to break the mold and start with cons:-It's still in alpha. There are some bugs yet and I have found some in various parts of the game. -There isn't much of an end game. (That I know of)-the bugs that are fixed cometimes create new bugs. Pros:-The building aspect offers some cusomization with custom floor plan, building material, and a bit on roof design.-Depending on which job you give your Hearthling, they will progress in levels and you can promote them to an advanced job or let them increase their level at the current job and be more productive.-You have hard mode which offers a big challenge to your management with planning and managing. -The devs are very active and take in feedback and bug reports and fix them within a few weeks. -The devs also keep regular updates in blogs every other (or every) Tuesday about what's going on and near future plans. -I enjoy the cartoony art style. The Hearthlings are cute and the monsters are kind of ugly but in a cartoon, funny kind of way. -There is a job tree with various different jobs to give your villagers which is still in progress but improving with every alpha release. Hope this helps.			"

								This game has potential but as of right now I think they are asking for a bit much when it seems they don't have that much yet. The game is super laggy just a couple of minutes in to gameplay even on a monster gaming pc. And the gameplay engine seems very un-optimized when it comes to queing orders of building or crafting. For some reason they just refuse to make stuff for the longest of times and blacksmiths focus more on building than cfrating what you ordered and so on. Doesnt seem to be other players as of yet even ai is only limited too some random single or up to five unit squads attacking, but no bases or ai players to attack or loot. Very small map too. Still I am going to put this as a positive review because of the potential and what this game could be. Please dear developer, don't screw your fans over. You have asked a high price and received it, please live up to the expectations that come with it.But no updates in a long time and to many bus for me to recommend.			"

								This game is one of the best, challenging,and fun all in one. The game allow your to build amazing building with its free building system. The game is also challenging in the ememies of course they get harder the more your grow your town but there is actually there is a story in the goblins and the hearthlings (names of the people) when you get in late game they send whole armys of goblins attacting your town. So now the things i don't like about the game....at it current build the game is laggy but i know its just because the game is in alpha so i can past that through now (just seen its in aplha 20 and they said in alpha 21 there gonna fix the lag). Somthing else that i thing is just because its in alpha is somtimes the actual game engine breaks XD and you gotta to delete your town and start over so yea. So do i think you should buy the game well yes but at this momment its up to you since it is in alpha its still have alot of problems and will still get more and more content. So if you wanna wait till the game is fully released i think its ok but like i said its up to you if you wanna buy it right now.			"

I've done a couple of play throughs and am getting the hang of managing the little town and it is very addictive. At the moment there is a bit of a lack of things to do at the later stages of the game, mining for minerals has only recently been added and beyond upgrading gear doesn't seem to have much purpose, but I'm sure more will be added.Of course, it is still in Alpha so there are many issues that can be annoying, the AI of your workers can be poor at times and they can just get stuck doing nothing. I think it would really benefit this game to allow some control over individual workers, or at least allow some prioritization of tasks because at the moment it is a bit frustrating when for example you want a worker to pick something up that he's stood next to but he just doesn't do it.These bugs aside the game is very promising and I will certainly be following its development closely.

								Read the reviews. Don't buy the game unless you are interested in its development. Game has some game breaking issues and bugs. Biggest issue for me at the moment is that buildings CANNOT be destroyed or deconstructed, without using console commands. -Graphics are perfect for this type of game.-UI feels more like a browser game UI. Game its self is great and has some potential.-Some advice if you do want to buy and play it, is to save often so if your building bugs out and doesn't get completed or you don't like how it turned out you can just load a previous save.

								I might change this with further updates but as of now i wouldn't reccomend getting this.When i bought this i thought it would be a bit like a minecrafty version of Rimworld but its not really.It's like rimworld but 1. the ai storyteller isn't trying to actively kill you ( a plus ) and 2. the building is realy realy horrible.Everything and i mean everything is made using that new building button, so you end up with roads counting as a building.Don't even get me started at making 2 floors or more.. i can't figure out how to make stairs at all, even though you think it would just be block on block right? not in this game.So what i do is i go into the mountain and make cave dwellings. this works rather well. Untill the lack of optimalisation kicks you in the teeth.All in all it looks nice and it's fun to play but until they do some major optimising and some work on the building aspect i say go play Rimworld instead. It's not threedee and looks a lot like prison architect ( and last time i checked also still in alpha ) but at least the reason why your settlement dies out is because the game actively kills you not because your computer is getting strangled.

There are some good things worth mentioning about this game like the music and the design your own buildings aspect. But you just sort of run out of things to do or things start feeling repetetive about 8 hours in. Most game destroying bugs are fixed at this point but for $25, I would at least wait several updates.

								I got this game months ago, since I wanted something relaxing and sandbox-ish, and this game's charm and city-building/adventure mechanics looked really great. Back then, I had a bit of fun trying to build a village, but found things quickly messed up with buginess, especially with the building editor. Fair enough, I thought. I'll come back to it later.It's been months, and the devs still haven't fixed up the building editor. You can't even undo or delete structures. If you make a mistake, it's permanent. This game has been on the market for almost 3 years, as of writing. Building is a central mechanic. It needs to be playable in this regard before the developers even think about adding other content.Keep an eye on it if this is the kind of game you enjoy, but I'd advise against spending your money on it as of writing.

								Still very broken at some points. Truly a fun game but has many issues that can break the game and force you to restart. They just added a new feture where you hearthlings will be knocked out instead of dying so you can try to save them. I was not far into the game and had 3 troops while playing on normal. Out of no where can this enemy that was really tough but they game through more enemies right away and all my troops were knocked out. My hearthlings couldnt do anything. With this new update it seems like hearthlings, even troops run away more. they get hit when they run away and then im left with 20 hearthling knocked out and unable to do anything. Also any enemies that survive the battle just linger around so if i get a new hearthling, it will get butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the enemy in a second. Great game, just too many issues that break the game, like the difficulty not making any sense, hearthlings not working anymore, too many powerful enemies attacking too early. One game it was day 2 and a really powerful giant came and wrecked my village. they need to really just take a step back and look at the game and fix the bugs.			"

								So far I can gauge this game being a ""Minecraft/DF town sim blend done right"". Things that are in the game work well and good (until you meet bugs), and the whole process of managing your town is quite smooth and nice, easily the best or near-best of that I've seen in similar games.So, why it's ""not recommended""?At the moment, there isn't much to do there. The amount of content that you can try is extremely low, vertical progression is basically nonexistent - you can unlock all the things that are currently implemented in the game in 2 to 3 game days (that's 1-1.5 hours of playtime at most), and afterwards there's nothing left to do apart from ""build more stuff because you can and it's the only thing you can"".Additonal grain of salt is the building editor - customizable buildings is one of the defining points of the game (that is, one of the defining points that is actually implemented right now), but the editor is rather clunky and hard to use in cases other than traditional 1-story building (multiple stories aren't implemented at the moment) with simple inner structure and minimal amount of walls. Try to do complex multi-room irregurarly-shaped buildings, however, and you will be fighting the UI much more than actually planning.And finally, the pacing of development is nothing to write home about. The initial plans (from Kickstarter campaign) were to release the game towards the end of 2014, you know. Now it's the end of 2015, and we recently had an alpha version where devs were mostly fixing internals, such as pathfinding. Going by this, it is extremely unlikely that we'll see any reasonably-sized chunk of gameplay - that is, content and actual mechanics - available until the end of 2016, and beta/release stages may follow even later. And that's only if the development won't stop abruptly at some point.To summarize, it's a game that promises really great things, but currently allows you to plant turnips, design and build simple small buildings, dig through mountains, and hit randomly-appearing enemies such as goblins with some swords (archery is not implemented yet). That's all.			"

								It is fun, I won't deny it. But the vast amount of bugs get in the way of that. From villagers not building things to them getting stuck in walls or tables (sometimes a save and reload just does not work), to not explaining what you can actually do. I designed an amazing house for instance, clicked ""build"". Nothing. Nothing at all. Nobody doing anything. The worst part is that i still dont know what was the cause. There is nothing to tell me what im doing wrong if I am doing something wrong at all.It is early access and so far the gameplay is fine, but with the large amount of bugs and the high price, I just cant reccomend it in the current condition.

It's regularly updated, has appealing graphics and the custom structure building is pretty great once you get the hang of it.The only con I could see is the price, that and being early-access may not appeal to the more instant-gratification seeking consumer.  It can be a little rough around the edges, but the devs are pretty diligent in stamping out bugs as they come.In conclusion- get it if you want to play a work in progress that already delivers a pretty great experience.  Perhaps wait til its on sale if the price bothers you?			"

In its current state, I would not recommend it until bugs and lag issues are fixed, especially for the cost of the game. Currently, I refunded my money so I could play other games I'm interested in, but I can see this game being something really awesome in the future. At a later date, when things seem to be fixed, I would consider purchasing the game again.			"

								Current level of recommend?Strong Follow!If your interested in the game I'd give it a follow and check back in a couple months. Game is still very early alpha and most of the updates are focused on making the game more stable while adding in one thing at a time. In its current state for its price, your looking at maybe a weekend or a couple sessions worth of game time. Updates are a bit slow but are pretty steady in frequency. Been playing stonehearth on and off since alpha 5 and the game does have quite a bit of potential (devs are also active on their forums which is a plus)If you do choose to pick it up just remember the early access tag means early access. In its current state you be able to play around with the basics but will likely run into bugs/glitches your village grows. Also, its a good idea to save before you start a new building that way you can reload your save should you run into any bugs/issues.			"

								Hey guys! This is my review of the game as a newbie to it. This Is a honest and non bias review. Ok. So. When first starting out you may be like what the hell but as you start to figure out what there is to do and the system it gets amazingly good! At first I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth $20 (steam summer sale) but within 30 minutes of playing I loved the game. It's fresh, intuitive, creative, and seems to be VERY OPTIMIZED for all of you who don't have the $ for high end pc's. I truly believe this game is worth the money and is definite worth a shot! Especially if your into games that involve build your own community, exploring, surviving, and taking care of your little towns people! The only downside I found to this game was that there was really no clear instructions on how to start or even controls, the controls feel kinda weird but as you progress you start to like them since they make building amazingly easier. Also that the game has a full base building system and resource system, caves digging ext. I am very picky when it comes to these types of games but this one was just to good to let go. Definitely recommend it! Worth your time for sure!!!			"

								Hello everybody! I have been with Stonehearth since alpha sixteen, I believe. This game is amazing, BUT definitely get it on sale if you can. I think it may be a little expensive right now, considering that it has no multiplayer and still in alpha and all that. So, here I will make a pros and cons of this game.Let's begin with the PROS:- Unique building system- Minecraft-like creativity- Recent updates allow for more complex structures to be made- Combat- Updated frequently. (Weekly updates/Bug fix updates, new alpha versions about every month or two)Now for the cons...:- Pricey- Buggy because it's still in alpha- Enemies are overpowered on harder difficulties- The game has the basic idea for turret defense but for the price it's virtually useless- NO MULTIPLAYER, something the devs said would be in the game in about 6-8 months, and about a year later it still isn't here.- No memes. (This one is just a joke don't get you panties in a bundle :D)What I want to see as a player?- MULTIPLAYER- Lower pricethats about it :D Keep going devs your doing great.would recommend if you can get it on sale for >$20 :)			"

								After 10 hours I can't said more than : ""stay away until the dev fixed the main problems"".  This a pre-alpha ... which is not closed to be playable. The building editor contains tons of bugs, multi stories buildings are never built, settlers management is terrible (they can stay doing nothing even if a building stay unfinished in front of them), remove a building is never working, edit an existing building is not possible, external walls can't be manually built, ...

								Great Game, absolutely love everything about it... except the fact that 9/10 times when building a structure my workers will just stop in the middle of building and nothing I do will make them resume. I'll build a wall and they'll leave the scaffolding up and the enemies will just climb right over it. I'd really love to give this game a positive rating but until this problem (earliest reports going back all the way to 2015!) is fixed I can't make myself give it a positive rating. I've been forced to stop playing because I simply can't get anything done with this bug around.			"

								This game has an interesting concept -- a cute take on blending Minecraft and SimCity play styles. That said, heed the ""Early Access"" warnings. This is most certainly alpha quality software. That's not to imply that the game crashes often but there are a lot of kinks to be worked out in the gameplay. In about 2 hours of play, I encountered significant issues -- hearthlings spawning under water and unable to exit, default buildings with no doors, in progress buildings with ""confused"" workers that never seem to finish the job, an in-progress teardown of a building that left four hearthlings permanently trapped inside. If you're into play testing software and sneak peeks it may be worth a look. In it's current state, the price point is a tough swallow.			"

								Alright, so first things first.  This game is Early Access.  Meaning that you will experience bugs.  It is unfinished.  You don't buy this game for what it is, you buy it for what it can be.  That is why I paid into the crowdfunding.  I believe in the game idea and the creators of the game.  If you want an interesting game with a lot of potential and a solid base, then I would say look into this one.  The dev team is really straight forward and keeps the community informed on the current state of the game.  What they do, why they are working on what they are currently working on.  The pace at which they work is steady and with care and attention.I feel that they have a good idea on priorities with development.			"

								I adore this game.Im a long-time fan of Dwarf Fortress and this immediately appealed to me.  Now, its not as...  baroque as DF, but it shows much potential thus far.  It's regularly updated, has appealing graphics and the custom structure building is pretty great once you get the hang of it.The only con I could see is the price, that and being early-access may not appeal to the more instant-gratification seeking consumer.  It can be a little rough around the edges, but the devs are pretty diligent in stamping out bugs as they come.In conclusion- get it if you want to play a work in progress that already delivers a pretty great experience.  Perhaps wait til its on sale if the price bothers you?			"

								Hey guys! This is my review of the game as a newbie to it. This Is a honest and non bias review. Ok. So. When first starting out you may be like what the hell but as you start to figure out what there is to do and the system it gets amazingly good! At first I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth $20 (steam summer sale) but within 30 minutes of playing I loved the game. It's fresh, intuitive, creative, and seems to be VERY OPTIMIZED for all of you who don't have the $ for high end pc's. I truly believe this game is worth the money and is definite worth a shot! Especially if your into games that involve build your own community, exploring, surviving, and taking care of your little towns people! The only downside I found to this game was that there was really no clear instructions on how to start or even controls, the controls feel kinda weird but as you progress you start to like them since they make building amazingly easier. Also that the game has a full base building system and resource system, caves digging ext. I am very picky when it comes to these types of games but this one was just to good to let go. Definitely recommend it! Worth your time for sure!!!			"

								This game is hella cute and could totally be fun if it weren't for the game breaking bugs and lag issues. I bought it with high hopes, which is my fault since it is still early access after all, and was vastly dissappointed. In its current state, I would not recommend it until bugs and lag issues are fixed, especially for the cost of the game. Currently, I refunded my money so I could play other games I'm interested in, but I can see this game being something really awesome in the future. At a later date, when things seem to be fixed, I would consider purchasing the game again.			"

								Current level of recommend?Strong Follow!If your interested in the game I'd give it a follow and check back in a couple months. Game is still very early alpha and most of the updates are focused on making the game more stable while adding in one thing at a time. In its current state for its price, your looking at maybe a weekend or a couple sessions worth of game time. Updates are a bit slow but are pretty steady in frequency. Been playing stonehearth on and off since alpha 5 and the game does have quite a bit of potential (devs are also active on their forums which is a plus)If you do choose to pick it up just remember the early access tag means early access. In its current state you be able to play around with the basics but will likely run into bugs/glitches your village grows. Also, its a good idea to save before you start a new building that way you can reload your save should you run into any bugs/issues.			"

								Stonehearth will likely become a great game once it's finishd; however, it is hard to recommend it in its current state. Its utter lack of features leads to boring gameplay, which makes its price of  $25  completely unjustifiable. This game has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it is hard to recommend at this time.			"

								The game isn't very deep, and a lot of the time your work orders get ignored.  A least half of the buildings I told them to construct are still unfinished despite having well over enough resources available.  You can't edit a building once it's told to be constructed, unless you want to remove it entirely, and even that task gets ignored by workers.I would only recommend this game after the developer fixes a lot of the core issues with building.

								the concept of the game is nice, if they ever complete a working game.it's an alpha, I understand, however it feels like the devs just add/change stuff and then throw it out without even playtesting it once. The nr of easily found (game breaking) bugs by just playing the game once is crazy, even more crazy that they throw it out like that. what they expect ? that 100 people find the same bug and then take the effort to report it in their own way ? While a developer + debugtools + normal playthrough will be 100x more efficient in understanding the majority of the obvious bugs and then fixing it.IMO we're to make this game monkey proof, not report that a carpenter/cook/blacksmith just forgets his job and then see no fix for it in subsequent releases. I mean c'mon, did they even play their own alpha game ONCE ??!?! Next, the devs are caught by the 'multiplayer syndrome', insofar everything has to be #$%^&&&% multiplayer these days so they made a client-server architecture to prepare for it. Now looking at the nr of obvious bugs every release I get a simcity 4 feeling : How to f**k over a great gameconcept by making it multiplayer/client-server.all over again.....do yourself a favor and wait for the finished product, currently it's aggravating as hell.

								I'm sorry to say, but I simply can't recommend this game yet.While the design and presentation is really charming and cute, which makes it just fun to look at, the game has too many bugs. I purchased it shortly after it's EA release and it had heavy AI flaws and problematic controls. I thought to myself, ""Give it some time."" Some time has passed, and I'm still encountering the same bugs as before.Whenever I try to design an advanced building, using all the tools available, workers won't start build it. It seems some combinations of walls, items or whatever are just not possible, even if the tools allow it in the building menue. Sometimes they start digging the ground out, but then they just stop. Even loading the savefile or restarting the game doesn't solve the problem.Sometimes the people at the workbenches just won't do their job. There is a log on the bench, there is work to be done, but they won't do anything. These bugs are stoping the game in its function, are very frustrating and happen pretty frequently.Maybe it's just something with my system (I doubt it), but I guess it's simply not really ready to be played yet. You can buy it to support the developers and try it for yourself, but I honestly would suggest: Wait.EDIT - 25.01.16I gave it another shot and I'm still encountering the same problems. I can't get passed the first two houses for my seddlers, because they just won't start building them. What I don't understand is, when I look at some screenshots of other players, they have super nice villages and castles. How!?Something is going very wrong here. Very unfortunate.			"

								THIS IS STILL AN INDEV GAME, so COMPLETE THE HELL OUT OF IT!!!A problem a lot of people face is that the game is ""Completeable"" within a few hours, but thats the fun of it! You have the ability to 'finish' a game in a few hours, wherein you can unlock everything and have little left to do, then have the opportunity to go nuts!The extent of my current accomplishments (before the game crashed in previous updates) was to build a town of ~30 people over 5-6hours (2 of which I walked away and did housework and listened to the music for when I should give input).They had half the world covered in a ""To-Be-Mined"" segment, a backlog of items to be created by the individual proffessions, and frankly more money than Bill Gates.From there I took the minecraft approach and figured ""Well lookie here, I have 4bazillion gazillion stone... ... ...Lets build a castle of such complexity and awe that god himself shall be impressed with what I can do in 7 days.""And so i did! The people kept on peopleing, and I kept on creating, and by the end I had a metropolis that noone even really lived in cause they were to busy building my metropolis bigger!If you have the ability to think of this like Minecraft, then you will realise half the fun is when your production seems to overcome your output. Then you get bored and build, and build, and BUILD!*Edit: Oh, and normally I will finish a game, then wait for the next update, then feel special getting to play the next alpha and have a reason for a new game :-D			"

								Game is good. Dont get me wrong its like a way easier dwarf fortress and Gnomoria thing. But heres the trouble, Its been in early access for quite some time and it still has an absolutely massive memory leak issue. After a while of game play usually around 30 mins to an hour, it starts to feel like you are clicking through mud. You'll click something and it wont happen for ten seconds or so. They really need to fix the leak, Gnomoria has this going on too but after much longer in game. I dont know what it is about this style of engine but it lends itself far too easily to this leak issue. If its a known issue which all of the forum posts about it makes it apparent that it is, then it should have either been addressed or fixed long ago. Im wondering if they even plan to. In case you care or wonder what my specs are here:Visheara 8 core 4.2Nvidia GTX 970Windows 7900 watt HE power supplyCrosshair IV Formula Mobo16 gb Ram gamer stock I dont remember name.  and thats probably all ya need.

								A couple notes on playing the game; Have at least 1-2 Farmers. Once you make one of them a cook, they help harvest, but you still need them to plow the fields. Workers are VERY much so necessary. Although the carpenter, potter, mason and other occupations do help build/haul, you're going to want to keep the people with low-ranks down on the worker size (1, 1 and 2 for the body/mind/spirit; Keep them a worker) Fighters and such need to be the most populace unit category (Archers, Knights and Footmen); At least have one of each with an herbalist. (For the three, high Body and Mind. Mostly so they don't run like cowards) Herbalist and Cleric; Have one of each. One heals while the villagers sleep/get into beds, one heals just by walking around/in combat. (High spirit for these guys is necessary) All ""Worker-class"" occupations need mind and spirit. All three are much so needed for the farmers than anything. ALWAYS. ALWAYS remember there's a pause button that lets you keep playing. Helps you plan things. Town watch; Love it, use it, learn it, remember to turn it off after everyone is done fighting. Always go after goblin camps/""stray monsters"" after the next invasion summon (Ents/Golems/Etc), that way your villagers aren't defenseless.			"

								Thumbs up for the game. Style is great, idea is great and gameplay is good. Bug squishing is pretty good (with interim updates for bug fixes between major updates)Progress?Their own progress graph and trello board claims that most of the single player stuff is about 70 - 90% complete? I hope that isn't the case.Having owned this since  the second day of the Kickstarter back in early 2013 I'm pretty underwhelmed at the content in the game. The Legos style building is nice, much better than it was a few Alphas ago, but the gameplay itself is still very under developed.Very few professions, not much threat, not much in the way of resource or tools to manage them.Even on hard level this game shows you everything in a few hours.As of Alpha 18, (September 2016) playing all this game has to offer currently, and seeing all there is to see -  will take you half a day at most. Taking the two ""races"" and exploring the 2 available biomes is a very similar experience after the opening 20 minutes of play, that might turn half a days entertainment into a day? Ok I was hoping for a well realised Dwarf Fortress with a decent voxel art set and a good UI. Not the full depth of DF of course, but at least on a par with what one man teams did with games like Gnomoria and Towns. At least that much depth given the backing and the much larger team involved.Sadly this isn't the way Stonehearth is panning out.It's more of a kids game. Very simplified. The complexity comes with designing your own buildings, and that is a great feature, but serves no gameplay purpose at all. It's like""Here's an abstract building game like DF, Prison Architect, Clockwork Empires Gnomoria, Towns etc.And here's a architectural Lego gameLet's put them together and errm? Well you can build big buildings on the map - and then imagine that their is a reason to do so - because in reality there is none.""Then you are left with a virtual lego set. Which is nice and all, somewhere to express your imagination.But big buildings that have no purpose other than to exist? That's not really a game -  and I'd rather do that with a real lego set than in here.			"

								Instead of tagging this as a ""City Builder"" It should be tagged as a ""Hut Builder"" just check out the second video, posted in 2017, years after their initial launch of Alpha. The game still cannot handle anything more complex than simple small one room designs. Not worth buying now, but could be if they ever actually make it a true ""City Builder.""			"

								Good lord, the bugs. This isn't a game when it crashes every fifteen minutes. Uses 4+GB of RAM when you get up to 25 citizens, literally more than late-game Civ. Sorry I bought it. Hopefully things get better with subsequent releases and moving out of alpha. Don't buy it yet, though. Not worth it.			"

								Sadly I dont think the makers can get this game right, the mechanics work for some thing and not for others, this game needs one awesome computer to run it aswell for high population villages, I find once I go over 12 people the game stuggles to play smoothly (Quadcore, 32G RAM@2400, Geforce gtx 970 4gb ect.) when I did get luck a few times (no bugs) I found all my hard work would always be lost at some point from a massive glitch, which has totaly killed the game for me personaly.My advice to the makers would be ""Try alot harder"" My advice to anyone wanting to buy this game, dont, buy some gaming making software, make your own game and sell it before it is finshed, you might get luck like the dayZ boys and rake in millions for an Alpha release of your game, minimum work, maximum money.

								This game is great, but there are some things that would be nice to see.There should be difficulty settings, they could edit things like how long before enemies begin to attack, or how powerful the enemies are.There is no way, that i've seen, to make specific units do specific tasks.It would also be nice to be able to set patrol paths for footmen.The terrain seems very blocky which does not meet the expectations of the thumbnail.Also, how do I equip my units with other items?All of these complaints are to taken with a grain of salt, I know that it is difficult to make games, and I know that Early Acess does not improve that. In addition I know that as an early acess game, it is not done. This is just a list of things to consider.All notes to the developer aside, this game comes highly recommended and has been one of the only games I've continued playing for long periods of time lately.

								I'm sorry to say, but I simply can't recommend this game yet.While the design and presentation is really charming and cute, which makes it just fun to look at, the game has too many bugs. I purchased it shortly after it's EA release and it had heavy AI flaws and problematic controls. I thought to myself, ""Give it some time."" Some time has passed, and I'm still encountering the same bugs as before.Whenever I try to design an advanced building, using all the tools available, workers won't start build it. It seems some combinations of walls, items or whatever are just not possible, even if the tools allow it in the building menue. Sometimes they start digging the ground out, but then they just stop. Even loading the savefile or restarting the game doesn't solve the problem.Sometimes the people at the workbenches just won't do their job. There is a log on the bench, there is work to be done, but they won't do anything. These bugs are stoping the game in its function, are very frustrating and happen pretty frequently.Maybe it's just something with my system (I doubt it), but I guess it's simply not really ready to be played yet. You can buy it to support the developers and try it for yourself, but I honestly would suggest: Wait.EDIT - 25.01.16I gave it another shot and I'm still encountering the same problems. I can't get passed the first two houses for my seddlers, because they just won't start building them. What I don't understand is, when I look at some screenshots of other players, they have super nice villages and castles. How!?Something is going very wrong here. Very unfortunate.			"

								THIS IS STILL AN INDEV GAME, so COMPLETE THE HELL OUT OF IT!!!A problem a lot of people face is that the game is ""Completeable"" within a few hours, but thats the fun of it! You have the ability to 'finish' a game in a few hours, wherein you can unlock everything and have little left to do, then have the opportunity to go nuts!The extent of my current accomplishments (before the game crashed in previous updates) was to build a town of ~30 people over 5-6hours (2 of which I walked away and did housework and listened to the music for when I should give input).They had half the world covered in a ""To-Be-Mined"" segment, a backlog of items to be created by the individual proffessions, and frankly more money than Bill Gates.From there I took the minecraft approach and figured ""Well lookie here, I have 4bazillion gazillion stone... ... ...Lets build a castle of such complexity and awe that god himself shall be impressed with what I can do in 7 days.""And so i did! The people kept on peopleing, and I kept on creating, and by the end I had a metropolis that noone even really lived in cause they were to busy building my metropolis bigger!If you have the ability to think of this like Minecraft, then you will realise half the fun is when your production seems to overcome your output. Then you get bored and build, and build, and BUILD!*Edit: Oh, and normally I will finish a game, then wait for the next update, then feel special getting to play the next alpha and have a reason for a new game :-D			"

								Purchased Stoneheart about half a year ago when it was still in an earlier phase of developement.Team Radiant is doing good work, the updates are coming steady and the Forums got an active community.The game itself is... from my POV a mix out of minecraft and dungeon kepper.Where you pile up the blocks in minecraft yourself, here you assign a silly crowd of beings to a schedule to terraform the world in a way you want it to be.Design your own Buildings from the very scratch. Or dig. DIG! and build the dwarven settlement you always imagined.Personally, only played in Peaceful mode so far. Reminds of Settlers in the Free Settlement Mode.Hopefully, as its displayed on Stonehearths website, there is a multiplayer support to come. PS: This game is very RAM intensive, and even made a 16gb RAM machine crash once, from lacking memory.			"

THATS 9 MONTHS!This is my first ever thumbs down.... I feel bad because the game play (when it works) is honestly very fun.  "

								While still very much in the fledgling stages of the development, Stonehearth is still an amazing game that offers a voxel-themed sandbox/city-building experience that gives you plenty of direction with what to ""do"" next without being constricting about it.About the biggest concern I have about this game is the lack of micromanaging. If you're a fan of games like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, or even Towns (or what you had hoped Towns would become), Stonehearth may leave you wanting for a bit more control over your individials and their priorities, or just the allotment of work between citizens.I hope to see Stonehearth grow bigger and stronger, particularly with things like Seasons, expanded climates and map varieties, and some additional aesthetic content, but that's no reason to not pick up a copy and try it out for yourself. Stonehearth has got a solid foundation, a history of active and attentive devs, and a bright future ahead.			"

								I played this a bunch last night, and plan to play a bunch more in the future. This is a fantastic little game. I can tell it still needs some work, but so far, pretty fun. Things I wish were better:-The camera is a little awkward, and I wish I could get on a lower perspective to the ground sometimes, since the animations and art are so damned cute, it would be nice to be a little closer to the inhabitants.----It would almost be worth it to have a 'walk around' mode, where you can 'be' one of the characters-When you have a blueprint for a building, and don't build exactly the required item for your specified blueprint there is no way of knowing, and the workers will not override one door for another, and if you decided to manually place items into the build, the ghosty blueprint remains-Items like fences don't 'auto complete' the way I wish they would, and leave gaps-I wish you could follow around a specific character, and their overlay wouldn't cover up the entire screen.Anyway...that is what I noticed so far....I will be building adorable little towns soon...and I am sure I will find little irksome quirks. But, that won't stop me from playing.UPDATE: just picked it up again...still really fun. It seems like some kinks were ironed out. I really like this game.			"

								I once did a review of this game around when it came out explaining how the game was a little glitchy. But since then it has been updated a bunch. Im normally not a town builder type game fan but I really love this game. You have to use your people wisely and give them correct jobs. Such as a footman who protects the others if the footman's spirit is not very high they will run away or get scared in battle, if their body is high they are most likely to not take much damage. Once my footman took down 3 wolves without getting hurt because she had high body. Also there are specific tools, if you gave everyone a job and you want to mine some ore you wont be able to because only workers (people with no jobs) can use pickaxes. Although I agree that the price for this game isnt cheap I still highly recommend buying it.			"

								Currently running the Alpha 18 build, game is heavily buggy when it comes to building, to the point that within the first major building I start, game bugs and can no longer build in the current game, even save/load wont fix it, must start a new game, and wait for it to happen again there. Very frustrating to have happen in a game that revolves around free form building. Another problem with building is hearthlings building up higher than the scaffolding is leaving them stuck up on some high peak waiting for someone to either build up to them or for you to make them a ladder. If you dont baby them, you could end up with multiple, or even all of your hearthlings stuck up there forcing you to use console commands to make ladders to save them.Currently the enemy difficulty peaks out very early, once you get 2 clerics along with 1-2 knights and 1+ archer combat just fades out. In other words, a leveled up blacksmith means you win. Archers never want to defend high ground and will always run to the enemys level and fight them there. No establishing patrol routes, only defend locations.Another bug I have found that seems to be constant lately is the starving of my hearthlings, they will have 0 tasks other than harvest food and will just stand around and starve to death instead of gathering the food.Game has amazing potential, the mod community is growing and has some good ideas and the devs seem to care and are constantly trying to improve things. But with the current build problems and building be a core part of the game, I wouldnt recommend paying for this game until its more consistently functional.			"

								This game reminds me of Dwarf Fortress. Its great to have everything animated and all but the content included is very low and it starts to get laggy at around 15 hearthlings.3 hours in and I'm wondering why I don't go play Dwarf Fortress instead.I can see this game becoming good but it's going to need a lot more content and optimization before its worth it. Pros:Animated Dwarf FortressYou can click objects in-gameCrafting system is easily accessibleCons:Lack of ContentWorkshops are hard to find (you have to find the item when its crafted, to place)Laggy at around 15 HearthlingsWhen this is updated, I'll consider changing my review but right now its not worth the price they're charging. I understand 'early access' means you're paying to test but honestly this game is more of a concept/remakea than an actual game or early access.			"

								I have played stonehearth every now and again for a long time.If you asked me when I first got the game I would have said no, but the game has come a long way!This is in the core exactly what you'd want from a settlement city builder.You choose how you want to play, do you want to be creative? or create a strong military and fight monsters?The gameplay is great, and the building tools have improved a lot! There are still ocacional bugs and script errors, but it is way better than it used to be. Though I still hope for more optimization in the future. My computer is a decent pc, but since I have had a lot of problems with it because of age I'm not sure if this is true for other people. But around 20 villagers I start to get a fair bit of lag. I am sure a better computer would allow atleast 30 or 35. But don't go hoping for a massive village of 100 people with tons of activity.This is a slow paced relaxing game, that can be either challanging or creative, depending on how you play.			"

								ALPHA REVIEWJust don't get this.  There's potential for days, but the UI and AI are both infuriatingly bad, which is made worse by the design decisions made for the game.  Wait until release so they can fix it up.  Right now, it's exactly what you should expect from an alpha build, and nothing you should expect from Early Access.  Wait a while, and this will probably be an excellent game.  The music - all nine minutes of it - is really good.  The art is charming.  The game is terrible.I backed this on Kickstarter and have been playing it off and on for months, hoping with each new alpha release that it will become enjoyable.  It never does.			"

								Sure it's a good game, and it's early access, but once you get past your first 10 nights or so, you begin to question the goal of the game. There aren't a lot of features in it's current state (again, I know it's early access) and this caused me to get very bored with the game almost instantly.I can't imagine the devs adding something that makes the gameplay interesting enough to warrant the $25 pricetag. They would have to add a whole new game element or something.6/10 at most, it got very very boring rather quickly. If I put more hours in and change my mind, I might update this review.			"

								$25 will buy you five large cups of coffee. I would rather have the coffee than this game. +An interesting game that has potential if the devs come through on their promises+Lots of possibilities for creative projects+The best minecraft clone out there that isn't trying to be minecraft+A nice aesthetic-Characters move super slow even during fast forward speeds-You start with a map of the generated world, then must choose a terribly small section of it to be your entire game world.-The building system is difficult and unforgiving. Small mistakes means you have to scrap the entire building plan (alpha issue)-Very unstable with frequent bugs ending entire game worlds (alpha issue)-Currently a very real lack of content outside of the buggy building system (alpha issue)-The game has been in dev for five years but they are still in the alpha stages and they have announced that they intend to start making other games. They've really done a good job keeping frequent contact with the community but I'm worried they will eventually abandon this project all together if the seams cant hold it together.			"

Early Access Review
								Well i have played this game for aprox 10 hours and i can say that at its current stage its not worth to buy it. The reason is that the game doesnt have enough features implemented to it and a lot of bugs.The good:+nice graphics+the gameplay is verry fun+the combat is ok (the enemary archers kitting you is verry annoying since you might end up chasing them to the enemy base)+the crafting&gathering system are verry well doneThe bad:-a lot of bugs-horrible UI for building stuff like walls and bugs out often. Editing a building is verry difficult since it doesnt always take your commands and its unintuitive.-at the moment building any kind of buildings its pointless. Your people can sleep verry well outside even on a bed for example. So its mostly decorative and to increase your value as a town. I really dont see the reason to build anything because they dont provide any bonuses and they are far to little buildings at the moment.-Mining or digging is verry poorly implemenred as well. For example if you want to mine in a mountain for example and then decide to go up you need to manually build ladders for them to go up or down for that matter otherwise the order to mine will not be done. Why cant this be done automatically by them? Digging also requires ladders to be built manually for every layer you go down because otherwise they cant haul what they have mined and they cant get out to eat and they will soon die. So you need to be carefull.-Poor ui and inuititive. For example it took me a few hours to finally learn how to edit a building and when, i had to google on how you can build roads or walls etc. These are just a few examples but its an overall feeling.-Verry ppor AI pathing. For example a lot of time i see my workers doing a hauling of an ore just to put it down and go pick up another ore imediatlly next to it and haul that one instead. Also they tend to take the longest paths when building anything or just leave their work completly do something else and then come back.-Another bad thing is that devs are pushing updates at a verry low rate. This game is from june 2015. so for over one and a half year the game is still in alpha. Also the last update was October 2016. That means that the game development will go verry slowly and you wont be able to enjoy it at its full features.My recommendation is not to buy this gama at its current state since it doesnt offer a lot of depth to it. Its fun to watch your people them build stuff, gather and fight but it seems shallow as you get depper into the game and the fact that a lot all of the buildings are useless and just cosmetic doesnt provide any depth to mid to late game.I would wait untill this game goes into beta before buying it unless you really want to try it or support the devs.			"

								Too much ""good enough"" programming in this product. The building editor stops working when Hearthlings try to build user defined buildings.  Well if the user sticks to premade buildings or just uses walls instead of slabs they will be fine.  Good enough for early access.  Hearthlings can't mind direclty overhead on a ladder.  Well if the user sticks to the blocks in front of them they will be fine.  Good enough for early access.  The user can't select on the verticle plane.  Well they can select the horizontal plane.  Good enough for early access.....etc.I get that the devs want to put in more features, but the current features should work or at least not introduce frustration to the user.  Right now I'm quitting on playing this game for the moment.  Its just not good enough to spend my time on or, really, the asking price they want.Stonehearth is getting a provisional down vote.   Fix the above in the next update and the game would be worth playing and buying.			"

								I like the idea of this game. I like the visuals and ultimately I believe that the final product is gonna be very enjoyable.However, in the current state I can not recommend this game to anyone. We all know that ""early access"" means bugs, and that's ok, as long as you can still play the game. Sadly, this is not the case for the Stonehearth today.I've spent ~1,5 hrs and was not able to design a single house (which is sort of the purpose of the game, right?): the game crashes, or freezes, or the UI gets broken, or something else happens. Ultimately, after more than a dozen attempts to restart the game and get to actually play it, I gave up. I do hope that the devs will fix this and I'll be able to change the review. But right now, my advice - don't loose your time on this one.			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a voxel based RimWorld game. Poorly optimized, pathing needs a lot of help, and guards cant use ladders. Over all I like the style of the game, BUT in its current state I would hold off on getting this. If you want something more optimized I would say take a look at RimWorld. When I say its not optimized I mean when you get to around 12-14 villagers the game starts lagging bad. (dont start saying I have a bad rig, 16gig ram 1Tera SSD 7950ATI card and 8 core 4.2ghz cpu) Most of the class's arnt in the game and about 25% of the skills for the class's that are there dont work. The game itself is easy going but when your village gets up in size everything slows down. I cant even get them to make a wall. Ive been waiting over 5 hrs for them to hang 2 doors. Give this game some time to flush out everything. Should be good if they fix the bugs(there is a lot of them atm) and do some real optimization.			"

								This game was fun to play when it actually works... There are some install issues that I was having, the game will download to a little under halfway and then it pauses itself. Also everytime I restart steam I need to reinstall the game because it is missing files. I believe it will be a good game once most of the issues are fixed.			"

								The concept is great.Unfortunately, at the time I am writing this the developers are asking $24.99 for a game that is so buggy it's damn near unplayable.If the developers are able to fix the extensive list of game-crippling bugs, it will be a great game, maybe even worth their asking price, but as it stands, don't buy this game.

Early Access Review
								I've been looking at this game for a while now, something told me to stay away from it, but I gave in and grabbed it on a city builder binge. I'm sad that I did.I like the defence/survival element of Stonehearth, where camps of enemies will spawn around the map and periodically attack your settlement, you can either attack them early and risk your guards, or just wait out the attacks for the XP. There are also loot boxes and such around the map to be discovered, usually guarded by some mini-boss creatures. That part they did right, it's fun.For a game that's been in development for such a long time, I really wonder why there are so many bugs. I understand it's a early access game, but that's not really an excuse for the really terrible building mechanics. It's a city-builder game, if i was developing a city builder, the first thing i'd get sorted would be the building mechanics, at the moment they're extremely frustrating and unintuitive. You have no ability to change things once you've placed them, so if you want to extend your wall out by 2 squares, you need to undo everything you've done to get back there. This is really frustrating when building and planning complex structures.I'd like to see defensive walls (properly) added, or at least the ability to create stand-alone walls outside of the custom structure editor, for a simple project like a perimeter wall the player shouldn't be forced to stuff around too much. I noticed also that it's very clumbsy at sticking to things. i tried to incorporate a pre-existing structure in my town into the wall, instead the custom structure editor decided that the sections of wall touching that building now belonged to it, and not my wall, so the only way to get rid of those walls was to destroy that building. Annoying to say the least.Along with numerous bugs that caused my workers to get stuck on window ledges, placing objects is a real pain. I've been forced to build a cobblestone fence piece-by-piece because if i try to place more than one at a time, the workers freak out and wont complete the task.At this point I can't reccommend the game, I feel like I was ripped off, to be honest.

Early Access Review
								Would I recommend this game? Absolutley. However, not at this time will i suggest you purchase it. There has been many moments in game where I have reached at least 20 people only to have the game glitch. Not in such a way that it can be overlooked. Buildings glitch. Making them inhabitable or unusable. There's no erase option (At least not in the ""stable"" version) so have fun with that. Assigning Footmen to different war parties makes them not able to fight. They stand there. Lifeless and take hits refusing to dull them out or even respond. Footmen run in one direction after setting your banner and stay there. No matter if you delete it or set another somewhere else. Sometimes when you're creating your own customly designed building, an error pops up and builders stop constructing. Usually, at this point, I wouldn't say it matters much but this game does seem like it is based around building. As I see it, the devs are cool. They've been updating the ""Betas"" branch somewhat often and the art style is cool as well. Although, I can't recommend it at this time. If you are patient and want to take a leap of faith, buy it. If you are skeptical and don't want to be dissapointed? Wait. Watch the updates. Because I do believe this game will be great in time.			"

								Without a doubt, this game has huge potential. The gameplay is fun, the combat & building system is great, & it's just a really relaxing game to play. Only problem is it's unfinished and broken. Once you max out all levels of 20 citizens, there's nothing else to do. There's no goal after that other than making useless buildings, & stacking up mistakes & bugs that cannot be fixed. If you're interested in this game, keep it on your wishlist until it's released from Alpha. You'll get through all the objectives in a day or so & then you'll just be waiting on updates to arrive. This game, at its current state, is not worth buying unless you are willing to fund its growth.			"

Building homes is a bit bugged and you can easily glitch a building (and it never finishes), also combat is not very balanced yet, and a bit boring , and again , a bit fiddly to control.If you don't mind playing aplha's go ahead otherwise, just wait a while.

Early Access Review
Please note: This is an early access review.I tried Stonehearth on a whim after I had sworn to myself that I would never play an Early Access game ever again. This game has simply reaffirmed my convictions in this matter.This is not to say that this game is terrible - it's not. It has potential, and there are a lot of good things about it. It has cute animations, enchanting music, and a nice crisp graphic style (although I must admit that the minecraft-esque aesthetic is getting a little old at this point).As for how it plays, it is a minecraft derivative (not necessarily a bad thing), though instead of building and defending your settlement by yourself, you must order AI-controlled peons to do it for you. This is an excellent premise on paper, and sometimes it works beautifully. Watching your peons work, collect, harvest, eat, sleep and fulfill their tasks is sometimes very rewarding.However, in many other ways, this game leaves something to be desired. The UI is confusing, tutorials are nonexistent, the camera controls are clunky, the building tools are even clunkier, and the minion AI is so glitchy that they will fail to build even the simplest of structures. Even the basic building designs that are shipped with the game will be left incomplete by your peons once they start building despite having all of the materials available. This forces you to scrap those structures in an attempt to build them again, and of course, there's no guarantee that your peons will actually finish them the second time they try.Other crippling bugs include peons who will simply freeze in place and refuse to move. Even when they become exhausted and start to starve, they won't move even to help themselves. The only way I've found to fix this is to reassign them to another job, but in doing so, they lose all of their accumulated levels. Not fun!Issues like these are a bit concerning, considering that the game is over halfway through Early Access by now. But even with the bugs aside, Stonehearth seems to be sorely lacking in content. The plain, empty expanses of the landscape really aren't very stimulating and there's very little to do out there. Once you get your settlement up and running (and it's not hard to do, despite the fact that most of your houses will be missing the odd door, wall or roof), you will simply repel invader attacks over and over again, collect whatever loot they drop, and continue to farm your crops.This might actually be fun if the inventory management was enjoyable, but it's not. You can't really manipulate the objects in-game directly, so you have to rely on your peons to manage the plethora of items that you will craft and collect. Usually this means that they will throw them into an unsorted jumble within your stockpile; other times, they will squirrel it away in crates and boxes. If you have more than one, it will be anyone's guess as to which one they've put it in. If one of your items is missing and you can't seem to track it down, good luck finding it!Stonehearth gave me a few moments of fun within the hours that I played it, but mostly I just felt bored and frustrated. It's a shame, because I really like the idea behind it. I may revisit it once it leaves Early Access, but if what I've seen is indicative of the final product, I could probably take it or leave it.The good news is that the developers are providing regular updates and are obviously very dedicated to this project. It should improve over time. I really hope it does.			"

Early Access Review
								this game has alot of potential. and if you are a banish fan. this game has the ability to blow it out of the water. however there are way to many bugs at this point. so much so after about 4 hours of game play things just stop working for you. workers tend to all of a sudden pick up resources than drop them all, pick them up and drop them all. when you want to promote a worker to a  specific class this ability stops as well after a few hours. if you buy the game you will enjoy it for about 3-4 hours. and than you just have to restart. and restart. and restart. even if you want to help out with the bugs the developers need to get the game going to a point where you can atleast advance in the game without bugs stopping you. to many bugs, game crashes once and awile. i would wait 3-6 months at the time of this post. and if the developers finish the game accordingly and dont slack off. the game will have very good potential for unlimited hours of building and fun. its a thumbs down at this point. dont release the game this early with this many issues. i get the whole alpha thing. but it should be the developers, developing the game. not the consumers who pay to develope it for them.

								I bought this game because I truly love the genre. Now that ive put a few hours into this game here is my two cents. the game concept is reaally cute, watching my hearthlings struggle to survive and build a town is about the most fun I think I can have with this kind of game, however, struggling with the interface to design buildings.. having my game crash, redesigning my buildings, crashing the game yet again. redesigning my buildings only to get the camera stuck beneath a tree I think.. finally giving up and just making nothing but boring square one floor buildings, was about the most ive ever cursed at a game in my life. Now im not a game designer but from the comments ive been reading these building design bugs have been lurking about since day one of EA, you would figure they would have at least made the building designer functional and mostly bug free.in all honesty I cannot recommend this game at its current price of 24.99$ you would be better off spending an extra 5$ and buying rimworld, which although is also an EA title seems to be way more playable than this and offers most of the same concepts as this game.

Early Access Review
								While I love these type of sandbox/management games, this one seems to fall a little short. Originally, I bought this around the time I was playing Towns, and liked the idea that it was graphically superior to Towns and had a few more features in planning. Many features were still in development, but I don't mind supporting independent developers. Skip forward some months, and the problems inherent to this kind of development become self-evident. Even easy-concept games can be a nightmare when you start adding in features. While the community is very strong and supportive, the developers communicate frequently and consistently, the game itself is fundamentally flawed. Gameplay is only tenable for about 12 hours, from there it's the same thing in a new setting. At the moment, many core features of the game are either uninteresting or broken. The engine itself is unsustainable or poorly written. AI still breaks itself after enough time has passed (or becomes so inept at tasks they become useless). Town areas are by default limited to 20 citizens, because the engine really can't handle much more than that. The map bogs down after about 10 in-game days with very little activity (2 gb ram and 16% of a decent quad-core processor on PAUSE). If you're looking to purchase this game, wait. See if the developers iron out the bugs, but even then know that it's likely not going to be a game you're going to come back to or play for too long. It'll be something casual when you've got nothing else to do - download, install, play, get bored and repeat in a couple months. Pros:- Good looking UI and general landscape - blocky but tastefully done.- Good conceptual design of core elements.- Good balance between difficulty vs. reward - easy enough for new players, but can't immediately make everything.- Consistent small updates, if a little slow for what the updates usually are.- Consistent and constructive communication from developers and community.- Implemented crash reporting that actually means something will get fixed eventually. Cons:- AI bogs very quickly.- Processor hungry for package size. - Gameplay can get repetitive (not talking about unimplemented features).- Spend much time after initial rush just watching your citizens do things.- Buggy as hell, but to be expected in Alpha.- Gameplay is geared to non-expansion - there's no reason to really expand much beyond starting area. Just pick a good one and wall yourself in. - Gameplay itself is very short. When you've done it once, it's the same thing on a different map. tl;dr:Wait a while if you're following this game. It's buggy and VERY casual. Devs are slow, but do communicate.			"

								I was one of the original kickstarter backers. This summer will be the end of the third year (going on the 4th) since this game has been in development. To say the progress has been slow would be an understatement. Triple A games take less time to develop than this has and it is still far away from release. Very little content because so much time has been spent constantly fixing things that should have been fixed in the early alpha's.A lot of the bugs have been with this game since Alpha 1. Especially with AI. They have fixed AI building at least 3 or 4 times and it still doesn't work right. They have to keep going back and rewriting code over and over again.They are nice developers but watching this game being developed has been amatuer hour. I was really into this game the first year watching all the dev streams and such but then it became obvious that it was going to be one of the longest development cycles in the history of gaming and I lost interest. Here it is - March of 2016 and they just had another stage of Alpha dedicated totally to bug fixing and fixing AI - Again! This game is very charming and the music is top notch. It has such great potential but many of us have been waiting a very long time to see it realized and we are still waiting....EDIT April 2017 - I just checked the game out again after almost a year. Some really good improvements have been made. They added a lot more devs to the studio and things seem to be moving along a lot more quickly but considering we are going into the 5th year that is not saying much. The personality system for the Heathlings is quite good but limited. It is a great start though and I am liking the direction they are moving in. Game is also pretty stable - it was running smooth although I did experience quite a few bugs. The new combat and classes are good - a lot better than the combat I was playing last year. The Herbalist seems like a total waste of a class. It doesnt do anything at this point and the only reason to have one is to make a cleric. They need a major revamp of the herbalist because from what I played it is totally useless.Overall the game seems to be coming along but it needs a LOT more content. I didnt get any stuck workers so it looks like they FINALLY got that problem resolved. Overall I am a lot more optimistic about what I played today then what I was playing last year but I still can't recommend it due to the low amount of content. Still no flowing water, weather, etc.			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, Picture Gnomoria, but with better graphics, better UI, and Papa Johns Delivers.Now you have your delicious or disgusting pizza, depending on where you live, and you can start your crafting and managing and building journey to keep your citizens alive. The crafting system is very simple and easy to learn, while still being of a good size for this early on in development. The raids on your town can be very simple and easy to fend off, to brutal cavity defiling, child sodomising, soul endingly devastating. So always make sure you have a Fighter or two ASAP. Focus on getting them better equipment over getting your next crafting milestone. Your people can live on without a Trapper for a few more weeks. They won't be living if a horde of goblins kill your Defenders and then your people because all they have for equipment is still padded armor and wooden sword and shield.This game is very much still in progress but I like the progress thats being done. Most games in early access that say they are still in Alpha (Which this one tells you it is right at the start) have half the content, and 1,000 times more bugs and crashes. All this has that I've noticed so far is a couple of UI and AI bugs and logic loops, and a small tendancy for data leak. So restart your game every hour and a half or so and you will be fine. Also you have to turn on Auto Save, which was weird. Sometimes your Citizens will go to move an object you designated to be moved elsewhere and someone else will get to it sooner and that previous citizen will still go to where that object is. Though once they find out the object is there they move on to the next objective which is nice. Sometimes in Gnomoria (A finished and released game) Gnomes will do the exact same thing but instead get stuck in an AI Loop and you pretty much have to wait for them to get hungry or tired to reset themselves. So far the majority of negative reviews about this game are about buildings not being able to get fully done. In my opinion since I have a fully functioning town with 12 buildings, 5 of which are custom design, roads, pastures, lengthy defensive works and what not, all of them 100% completed. That the complainers are idiots, and that they try to do multiple projects at one time, run out of materials and then complain that the game is broken. Much like that meme where a guy rides a bike then puts a stick in his own tire and complains about someone else doing it. Your citizens will do multiple projects at a time, and the game will tell you that you have enough resources for a building if the resources are still in your stockpile. That means that if you pause the game, and try to construct 3 houses, each time it will tell you that you have enough resources in your stockpile. If you are that tired and don't notice that logic issue, please go to sleep. Or stop being a moron.A couple of suggestions that would be nice in my opinion.-Make it to where when digging a mine tunnel, they auto construct ladders, since people will sometimes forget and well there goes 3-6 of your citizens. -Possibly already in development but if there could be some sort of food preservation thing. Like an Ice box or something that will keep my fruits and veggies fresh longer would be nice.- Lower the amount of food it takes to get a new Citizen at ALL levels. I am currently sitting at 15 Citizens and producing enough food for 80. Still can't get a new Citizen. I realize this may be due to the developers wanting to give people a possible Siege supply incase they take heavy losses to Food or Food production capability from a raid, but there is an option wether or not to accept a new Citizen. Let us take the risk.-Developers. This tip more than all the others is the most important and I hope that if you read this review and take anything from it, that you take this one to the heart. Give yourselves a pat on the back, and some high fives all around. You state clearly that this game is in alpha and its already so well done. I don't particularly enjoy games like this. Gnomoria is a bore and I couldnt stand to play it for more than 30 minutes. Any other game like this that involves city management with no Army management or Cities to pillage and conquer leave me bored and moving on to another game. YOU got me to play this for 4 hours so far, and once there is more content I can happily say I will gladly add 100 hours just to explore and enjoy this finely crafted game you have made. Good job, and keep it up.			"

								I just bought this game like 3 days ago and I'm already pushing 30 hours played. Highly addicting even for early access if you enjoy sandboxy games. LOTS and LOTS of room for cool and new ideas with seemingly active developers (2 patches/bug fixes between now and time of purchase) which is awesome! Very much looking forward to watching this game evolve and happy to support it. Despite there being a few annoying bugs I'd say the game is 99.9% playable with what content is added so far and I actually found trying to play around the bugs half the fun once I learned how to recreate them.

								I bought this game because I truly love the genre. Now that ive put a few hours into this game here is my two cents. the game concept is reaally cute, watching my hearthlings struggle to survive and build a town is about the most fun I think I can have with this kind of game, however, struggling with the interface to design buildings.. having my game crash, redesigning my buildings, crashing the game yet again. redesigning my buildings only to get the camera stuck beneath a tree I think.. finally giving up and just making nothing but boring square one floor buildings, was about the most ive ever cursed at a game in my life. Now im not a game designer but from the comments ive been reading these building design bugs have been lurking about since day one of EA, you would figure they would have at least made the building designer functional and mostly bug free.in all honesty I cannot recommend this game at its current price of 24.99$ you would be better off spending an extra 5$ and buying rimworld, which although is also an EA title seems to be way more playable than this and offers most of the same concepts as this game.

								I bought this game directly from the developer's website and I played it when it was in Alpha 15.  I still don't understand why this game is fun or otherwise enjoyable.  Everything happens at a snails pace.  While it is interesting to build your own houses, ultimately it amounts to little.  Playing a game like Rimworld moves so much faster and there are consequences galore.  The story telling in this game is practically nonexistant.  The gameplay hasn't changed much and there are still the same graphical glitches that happened even in Alpha 15.  I'm pretty disappointed and so I'm moving on.  I wish the developers luck because they're going to need it.			"

The game gets updated pretty frequently, and now that the company has added more priority on this game, I think it will definitely get updated even more now. Let's hope for the best!!			"

								1st game ever that makes me spend 20bucks for a game! still worth it , why? because its an early access game! there are sooooooo many possible developments in the future (with the help of the community of course)heres my theory of possible developments:*relationships of hearthlings*1st person perspective (controling a single hearthling)*horses! for faster movements*more different races of enemies*making kids *more jobs! (specially the knights i really want to have a necromancer like in the loading screen)*and more fixing of bugs!*multiplayeR?maybe it will take years to release the full game . but its still worth trying to play this early access :)			"

								Recommended, but with a caveat...I cant say as it is right now I find the game that enjoyable. The dev team has a lot of work to do to get the game finished, but its the dev team behind the game that makes me want to like this game. They constantly release new content that addresses mine and others issues with the game, and its progressing quickly. In a few months I believe there will be enough substance to it to make it a really fun game. Get it only after taking a look at the devs homepage and deciding yourself if what they have planned still makes you want to buy it. Also note that its not a complete game as is and you will be playing a watered down version of what is to come.			"

								This is an excellent game and I can't wait to see what they add. The only bug I have seen so far is that when you design a custom house, the people don't finish building it. But as long as you use the premade buildings, then everything is fine. It would be great for them to fix this, but I can definately live with it. Also I think it would be great to add some more wildlife besides foxes and racoons? But overall, this is a great game and I definately recommend it to anyone who thinks they may be interested in it.			"

								If you've ever wanted to create a village/kingdom with control over crafters and defenders, farmers and the sizes of farms, locations and the ability to move those fields. This is for you.First let me start with the cons -1) This is Alpha and does not represent the end product.2) It's not finished yet and has bugs.And now the pros in my opinion -1) Ability to set where you want to start your village.2) Ability to determine who is right for the jobs available.3) Ability to change jobs of your Hearthlings (townsfolk).4) Ability to custom build any building and save the template.5) Ability to place stockpiles inside of buildings for protection against raiders.There are many game aspects that I have not listed, but I hope I have at least touched up on some important deciding factors for potential backers. I love the game and can't wait for the release.With that in mind, every Tuesday they have a post ""Desktop Tuesday"", it's a great place to see what the team has been working on, and don't forget to check their website for additional information.

Alpha 14 Update -There has been a lot of new content and improvements since my initial review.New enemies, new jobs - herbalist (that makes potions and bandages for healing and buffs), cook (self explanatory).New crafting stations which allow a more unique look and feel to your crafters including more crafting options, more armor, weapons, decorations.They still have a lot more planned and coming, they still do their Desktop Tuesday so be sure to check it out!

								If you've ever wanted to create a village/kingdom with control over crafters and defenders, farmers and the sizes of farms, locations and the ability to move those fields. This is for you.First let me start with the cons -1) This is Alpha and does not represent the end product.2) It's not finished yet and has bugs.And now the pros in my opinion -1) Ability to set where you want to start your village.2) Ability to determine who is right for the jobs available.3) Ability to change jobs of your Hearthlings (townsfolk).4) Ability to custom build any building and save the template.5) Ability to place stockpiles inside of buildings for protection against raiders.There are many game aspects that I have not listed, but I hope I have at least touched up on some important deciding factors for potential backers. I love the game and can't wait for the release.With that in mind, every Tuesday they have a post ""Desktop Tuesday"", it's a great place to see what the team has been working on, and don't forget to check their website for additional information.

								This game is in alpha over 2 years after its normal release date and Riot bought Radiant in the meantime. Despite promises and an endless good news show anybody who plays it will discover what could be a great game if they dig deep enough beneath game breaking bugs, a lack of many features and the dubious odds it'll approach something resembling complete this decade.

								Seriously I cannot say enough good things about this game.  The best early access Fort-like experience you can get in 3D.  This game and Gnomoria are the best Fort-likes on Steam.  The  dev's on Stonehearth are constantly adding new content and the recent update with a new playable Kingdom type and terrain just reminded me how much I love this game.  There are a few more playable races in the pipe if I'm not mistaken, and multiplayer! Oh I cannot wait till MP.  (It is not MP right now to be clear.) I'm an EA who ore but this is one of the ones I would recommend with no reservations. In the game you plop down a group of curated settlers in a hospitable or inhospitable landscape and have a solid town building survival experience.  Give Hearthlings jobs and watch as they level up, then you can promote them into higher tier professions.  With awesome mods like Candledark you can really add some variety to your game.  The community is great and I've got nothing but respect for these devs that regularly live stream their work on ye old Twitchbox.Edit: They added more classes!!!!I (still) love this game.			"

								Cute, funny and interesting little game, with a dedicated, wonderful developer team.It's pretty addictive to play, just make sure you save every now and then.(especially before you're about to attack the enemy AI, if you are unsure) - because you might lose interest if you even lose one citizen, i've experienced many times. Also save alot if you keep using the experimental max speed, it could crash the game eventually.Sometimes it's a big unforgiving, but this game's kind of challenge doesn't want you to quit permanently, at least.It's always fun to see the game waiting to be updating in the download tab of steam, and I'm really curious on where this game is going. I had hoped for snow here in december :'(			"

								There are too much bugs in the AI which make the game unplayable. Your ""Heartlings"", or ""Lazylings"" as how I call them, go idle after a certain point in the game. Mostly when you go above 17-20 heartlings what i've noticed the past months. They stop mining, stop collecting resources and when you want to build a new building, they build it up for a part, then stand idle for many ingame hours... As a gamer you want to make progress but this game lacks a good enough AI to let you make progress. You can only build up a little, then the AI fails. Only thing you achieve here is stress and irritation, dont pay money for that.When the game has a proper AI I will probably update this review. You still want to buy this game after reading this? well, thank you, hope that money goes to the AI coder so I can finally play this game in the future since a refund is not possible anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								I really like this game. Seeing the rate of content added with respect to the roadmap that the developers have made available on their website at http://stonehearth.net/roadmap/ gives me an inclination as to how much effort they are willing to put into this game, and it looks promising. The blocky and simplistic style of the game really contributes to the charming, cozy atmosphere of the game (when enemies aren't attacking of course) and gives you something that you want to protect, if that makes sense. The music itself is also charming, and fits well with such a simplistic style.However promising the game looked and looks, I believe it still requires a tonne of bug fixes, for example the soldiers going off to attack enemies without your command, and the unfinished building bug, however I am yet to check after the latest update whether that has been fixed yet. Another downside is that the normal difficulty seems way too easy as you progress further into the game. The attacking of small miscellaneous enemy camps can get quite repetitive and pesky at this point too, but I suppose there isn't really any better alternative, and it makes do for gameplay.At the time when I bought the game, I regret paying as much money as I did for it, however from another point of view involving contributing to the growth of the game I am glad that I took the gamble of it not being another abandonment in the piles of steam early access games. £18.99 is a little overpriced, even though I enjoyed it. Despite having addressed the negative side of the game, don't misunderstand me. I really enjoyed it, and await to see further development.			"

								Stonehearth is probably one of the best games ive played to date. You can easily manage all your resources and the game is just for you to build and have a few challenges as you work your way up to having a town or city you are proud of. I really want more weapon and armor options. Maybe more ore types for legendary items or something. Also wouldnt mind a different race or a few races to play, just to make it more exciting. Lastly if we had another AI playing and diplomacy options then it might add a great dynamic, I would love to ally some goblins and attack another guys castle or raid their villages. Thank you for this game, now hurry up and finish please!			"

								This is absolutely the game I was looking for when I couldn't find a game even remotely close to Magesty or Majesty 2. Each villiger get's assigned a job (by you) and will continue to work towards what ever you assign him to. I don't know how to submit feedback or suggestions but I know the devs are extremely active in informing the players what's going on with their game.But I'd really appreciate an A.I level up feature for all the crafting professions. It gets kind of tedious when having to assign autobuild x10 for a certain crafted item in order to level up a blacksmith or potter.  And in addition maybe a notification that pops up saying that in order to continue leveling up, you'll need more of X resource.  I have no gripes with the game considering it's still in  Early Access, it would be nice to see that feature though. Expecially because micro managing my tradeskill guys is what I find annoying.  "

								A good alternative to Timber And Stone, incase anyone still plays that.At the time of writing this review, theyve just made a major overhaul to the combat system - giving the game several types of different ""secondary"" class for your soldiers, forming a triangle for the standard RPG party (Tank/Heal/Dps). i've probably planted about 40 hours more than my counter says into this in the last week, but my computer was running in offline mode.Knights (tanks) soak up damage and keep the enemies attention from your more squishy classes, Archers plant pointy projectiles between enemies eyes and clerics perform the role of healer, the footman class still exists, but its now more of an initiation rank for the first two and serves as melee dps later on in, clerics upgrade from herbalists.While this game isnt as ""pretty"" as timber and stone (read; its slightly more cartoony and blocky) - it feels like a greater attempt has been made to flesh it out and as a result, it has a far higher playability and in my opinon is more enjoyable.Like quite a few early access games ive played, the updates seem to be quite frequent though this game is far more stable than others.

								Blockstyle in a cute Fashion! Building like in Minecraft! Crafting things through Carpenters/Herbalists etc.! Chilling and watching when all is working out and ur little Villagers do everything u wanted! Great!So far i enjoy the game, bought it few days ago. If u have no time on the hand and want to finish everything fast dont bother i suppose (i am not far enough in to say if there are things like ""speedruns"" but ofcourse is there a optimized strategy to start). Otherwise give it a try, lay back in ur chair and watch ur village grow, the Villigars gather and maybe read a book as long nothing is happening. Music is really Symphonic and the Graphicstyle is just cute. So far i encounterd not much Bugs (just one, they wouldnt build a door in a building, rebuild fixed this) but sometimes there is a curiouse clippen through the ground, just turn cam around again all is fine :)10/10 would build a village again!

								This is absolutely the game I was looking for when I couldn't find a game even remotely close to Magesty or Majesty 2. Each villiger get's assigned a job (by you) and will continue to work towards what ever you assign him to. I don't know how to submit feedback or suggestions but I know the devs are extremely active in informing the players what's going on with their game.But I'd really appreciate an A.I level up feature for all the crafting professions. It gets kind of tedious when having to assign autobuild x10 for a certain crafted item in order to level up a blacksmith or potter.  And in addition maybe a notification that pops up saying that in order to continue leveling up, you'll need more of X resource.  I have no gripes with the game considering it's still in  Early Access, it would be nice to see that feature though. Expecially because micro managing my tradeskill guys is what I find annoying.  "

								A good alternative to Timber And Stone, incase anyone still plays that.At the time of writing this review, theyve just made a major overhaul to the combat system - giving the game several types of different ""secondary"" class for your soldiers, forming a triangle for the standard RPG party (Tank/Heal/Dps). i've probably planted about 40 hours more than my counter says into this in the last week, but my computer was running in offline mode.Knights (tanks) soak up damage and keep the enemies attention from your more squishy classes, Archers plant pointy projectiles between enemies eyes and clerics perform the role of healer, the footman class still exists, but its now more of an initiation rank for the first two and serves as melee dps later on in, clerics upgrade from herbalists.While this game isnt as ""pretty"" as timber and stone (read; its slightly more cartoony and blocky) - it feels like a greater attempt has been made to flesh it out and as a result, it has a far higher playability and in my opinon is more enjoyable.Like quite a few early access games ive played, the updates seem to be quite frequent though this game is far more stable than others.

								After the tragedy of the game Towns, there was no real replacer for that game. This one is quite the spiritual successor to that game, with a far more responsive dev team and prettier graphics.The buildings, if you haven't guessed, are customizable down to the very block. If you create a custom building during one game, you'll be able to save its blueprint for all of your other games. Yay!Despite the nice graphics and smooth gameplay, bugs do exist. Sometimes they are game breaking, but the devs of this game usually patch it within the next update, which is ~2-4 weeks. Considering that this game has been out for over a year already, I'd say the development has come a long way.You should probably wait for a sale, however. Whatever amount you spend on this game, it's going into good hands.			"

								I love stone hearth and like how it is updated regularly but I would really enjoy if the developers added Stonehearth to   Xbox 1 and other consoles because I enjoy building and creating defences but after awhile it gets laggy and eventually unplayabe but this is mostly because of my computer. I think that if this game was available to consoles it would be much more fun later on in the game because the preformance of my Xbox is alot better than my desk top. I also think muiltiplayer would be really fun to try out,  and controlling on of your hearthlings might be kind of fun too. But in the end I really enjoy this game and enjoy how it is updated regulary.			"

								First of all, i dont write reviews... i just dont, but this warrants it. To the potential players: must get! its still in alpha and runs wonderfully with minimal bugs ( in my short time i saw none). it has beautiful potential that i have never seen froman alpha game. to summarize it, think Settlers, mixed with minecraft, mixed with xcom. i'm truly excited to see what the game's future holds. The maps are different everytime so it won't get repetitive.  To the Developers: i am aware i have short time but i have a few suggestions. 1) add textures to stone floor (specifically in mines) as it is hard to differentiate between the walls and the floor. 2) for campaigns, allow Ai civilizations that the player can be diplomatic with (similar to age of empires). 3) i had trouble with the building costumization (maybe just add a tutorial for it that goes a bit more in depth). 4) add magic if possible. you could add a new combat class, add enchants or buffs to weapons. 5) KEEP IT UP!!! this game is incredibly unique and brilliant!

								I've been around since the beginning of this games origins on Kickstarter, and this game has evolved so much since then. While true, this game AS OF NOW is a little shoddy in some places. However, even with those problems the game remains to be a fun and enjoyable experience. The devs spend countless hours fixing bugs and moving the game forward, relesing beta updates on a weekly basis and constantly keeping the players informed, even taking in their suggestions on their dev stream and the Stonehearth forums. The game is, unlike most, being molded by not just the developers, but the players aswell. These qualities make me certain that this game will travel from the state it's in now, which is still a good game as is, to even grater heights.4/5 would recommend AS IS.5/5 would recommend for the future.

Workers not working, buildings glitching out, soldiers doing stupid attacks to their death.  I cannot think of one feature in this game that actually works properly.The latest update did not address bugs in the slightest.  Instead it added more content, which added even more bugs.			"

								I played a little when I first purchased StoneHearth. At the time it was Alpha 12.

And the game, after 5 alphas, it 2X better than I remember it. It was OK at best but now it's pretty fun. Seeing this kind of progression though 5 alphas, I can't wait for full release!

Early Access Review
								     It's another early access, but why should you take the risk of buying the game before release?  This game is receiving updates every Thursday.  An update usually includes a new entity or two (some new content) and a lot of bug fixes.  While the pace seems a little slow, the updates are frequent and the two developers have a reputation of interacting with the community and effectively implenting feedback.     The developers are talented individuals with computer science degrees and related career experience.  Check out their website: http://www.radiant-entertainment.com/     They're not your average joe indie developers working out of their parents basement to make a quick buck.  These two are passionate individuals that want to create something truly enjoyable and worth playing.  That being said, Stonehearth still has many bugs and is definitely not as enjoyable now is it's destined to be.  And Stonehearth is destined to be the best Dwarf Fortress-like game of our age, that doesn't require a nerdy learning curve to actually enjoy.     Stonehearth is promised to be a depth-filled, fun adventure of building a village.  But unlike Banished or other village-builders, you will find yourself fabricating stories about your villagers as you explore, survive and build.  Just watch half the youtube Let's Plays if you don't believe me.  It's that imaginative element, that makes games like Stonehearth more than just another city-builder.  Stonehearth is not just another game, it's a journey into your own imagination as you build a village.  So, if the experience resonates with you, support this young and promising studio, as the developers craft a gem in the indie gaming world.  Personally, Stonehearth rubs off that feel-good aura, that this early access is an investment that's worth the risk!			"

								Wow, no reviews for this game? Stay a while and listen!This one, this is a masterstroke in a careful and delicate balance between the game being a city builder / user interface hell. Yes, it is still early access and you'll probably hit a bug while playing, nothing has crashed the game for me in 30 hours so I'd say this is in the better half of Early Access (though I had not purchased the game sooner so I'm not aware of initial foibles. There is so much to love here: Likable residents, cute formatting and design. The UI is clean, the layout does pop over itself but that is trite in comparison to the data you're shown / what you need. What you need is where you'd expect to find it with a very responsive layout. Basically, you can get in and play without having to dig through where you were or push F1 to research many words to explain a simple concept. Well executed devs.Cheerful would be one word to describe this game. I haven't found a single annoying aspect, and willingly will put many more hours into this game with content that is sure to come.You do not need a wiki to play this either, if you need help you can surely find the answer here or in a wonderful community base posting your question.This game has brought the best aspects together in a very clean voxel format that does away with common issues that has will take away from the experience of the game. The difficulty can be scaled in game through use of items (placing trophies), and you can pause to collect yourself if you're in trouble. I eagerly await content and consistently return to an enjoyable experince each time I load up StoneHearth. It is one of my favorites, and an answer to what I seek in a city building game. Thank you for putting this idea out there to make me realize what I'd been missing in this genre.			"

Say you ask your carpenter to make a shield, he/she will put the log onto his/her workbench, BUT WAIT! HE/SHE MUST MOVE EVER GOD FORSAKEN ITEM IN THE GAME TO A STOCKPILE FIRST! Genuinely annoying.There are other bugs but those are really the only game-breaking ones I can find, and because of them I can not recommend this game :(			"

								I Just want to bring to light what has been my experience while owning this game... I bought this game before it hit steam, for $30 USD. After it was released on steam, i noticed it was $5 cheaper, when I created a ticket to the Devs, explaining my situation, and asking for some sort of compensation. They reponded back by saying there was a post on their website telling people it would release on steam for cheaper. Thinking to myself that i was an idiot and feeling kind of down, i let my friend know about what had happened, he went on the website and found out that they had actually created that post AFTER the date in which i bought the game, and lied about it. The Devs have yet to repond to any of my numerous emails. I just wanted to let people know what kind of Devs they are getting in bed with. ***Thumbs Up so people can see***			"

								This game is really fun initially, then it caps out pretty quick. I have 7 hours on it, and im already capping out. The max number of villagers you can have is 20, which is not very many. You can increase it but it drops the performance of the game tremendously. I have a world that is unplayble because of all the little things and items in the world it has to load, and my computer is pretty good.			"

								This game is great as a concept.  It's fun, engaging, challenging at times, and downright infuriating.  It's plauged by bugs that have been around since the beginning.  Ask anyone who's played this about unfinished buildings, hearthlings standing around starving for no reason, or crafters with a full crafting queue that are idle for days.  It's maddening.I really want to enjoy this game, and sometimes I very nearly do.  However, I cannot reccomend it in it's current state.  Too many game breaking bugs to be any good.			"

								Cannot reccomend as a core mechanic of the game is completely broken. Building is attrocious. There are 4 or 5 prefabbed template buildings (ugly and boring) you can get away with, but any sort of cuztomized building whatsoever and the game just breaks. What's more... this is the central mechanic of the game for improvement of your tribe and village... you need to craft buildings for your population to grow. The game has charm and potential, but week after week I see zero improvements to this game breaking flaw. Please fix buildings and I will change my review and start reccomending (and even playing) your game.			"

								Its a buggy mess. Not saying that it wont become better, but at this point and time Stonehearths biggest appeal for me, the building, doesnt work well. Its hard to build what you want. Its more work to acctually get something to build than it is acctually designing something. Also the performance is sub par. I often have to reload to get a game to run decently. I would like to comment on what the later stages of the game are like but all my games have bugged out impeading my process and halting my progession. At the moment dont buy, but if you see this in a few months check it out. I have no doubt that this game will become something amazing, all the deves seem very passionate about the project and i have the best of hope for it.			"

								Very fun and addictive! Alouth i feel i've brought this a few years ago and it ended up going abandonware and resurfacing here, so i brought it again and almost every mechanic is the same just totally different textures and a way more simple world generator. From what i can see already devs are getting sloppy and the building system is currently bugged. once i tried to use to dev tools to fix stuff, things would really break lol as you would expect so im going to give it a month or so and try it again and hope for a better experience. The game itself is very fun, extremely cute and ridiculously unforgiving!!! The ui overlays are very nice and easy to navigate. Units are very responsive to commands although i did feel a little clustered at some points latter on. Being able to move individual workers would be nice to control them when there being attacked or walking into a pack of wolves, saves me calling everyone back to safety because of 1 idiot who wanted to pet the wolves pup. BUT the biggest let down, The tutorial left me hanging -_-concept 9-10mechanics 7-10 (please fishing) graphics 7-10 textures 5-10 performance 4-10 building 3-10 gameplay 7-10 overall 5-100GL Deving!

								3/5The game is alright. I really enjoyed the 24 hours I played it, and finished it. It was super cute and I found it refreshing. However the game lacks depth. So you go to the game's official forums and talk about it, and any ideas that introduce an idea of depth other than building little houses that after 4 hours all look the same, and harvesting loot and trying to get the max amount of villagers--they are all met with the same retort.""Mods.""I do not suggest this game to anyone unless they are a modder and want to learn how to program and make this game for the the devs. They don't even have Steam Workshop enabled, yet are relying 100% on mods to keep people interested in the game. It's a fun game, don't get me wrong, but if you buy this game you're buying ""Mod Simulator 2017""I hope they change this mentality before leaving Early Access.			"

								It's got quite a game-breaking bug where many (basically all) custom buildings will not get completed. They just bug out and your villagers don't work on them anymore. There's no fix for it aside from cheating to instant-finish them.And the bug has been around for awhile. Not really worth playing until this gets fixed. unless you don't want to play for the building aspect. You can just lay out all of your stuff on the floor. But where's the fun in that?Should I not give it a thumbs down because it's still in early access? Of course I should. I'm giving a thumbs down to the early access because it's severly broken. Steam handles beta reviews when games are released, don't worry about it. I'll reconsider when the bug is fixed.			"

								Game has taken way too long to make. It's still in early access after years of development, and they haven't even added many of the main features they promised to add. It's very dissapointing honestly, the game has so much potential but they are developing at the pace of a 2 man team even though they've made so much money off of it. I wouldn't reccomend buying it unless you can wait another 4 years to see if they ever finally finish the game. I check back every 5 months or so to see if any new features have been added, but it seems as though they've only worked a week.			"

And I love how you all put so much effort into creating this game, like, you update almost monthly, and sometimes even weekly. There has been days were I just find a new update after a couple of days from the last update, not even a week apart. Awesome really. LOVE IT!!! Please keep doing this, and I would really like if the population could also grow timely, like if children generate. Thanks again :D			"

								Stonehearth is a great game with a lot of promise. It could be great if it weren't for a few things. One: The building mechanic is great yet is a bit limited to what you can decorate with (this is excusable as its till in alpha). Two: There is a bug with building where your hearthlings stop building a structure halfway through no matter how many materials you have. Three: Some hearthlings refuse to function and stand still and slowly starve to death slowly killing your population. Other then that stonehearth is great yet don't buy it at this stage as it is incredibly frustrating when your village refuses to function and starves to death.			"

								For an Early Access Game it's really fun if you are into city management games and making a nice looking village for your self and slowly upgrading it to be better and to expand your land to do more things with.And I have only had two issues with the game, but it's an Early Access Game so thats to be expected so I am very sure they will get fixed soon enough.But all in all I would rate this game a 9/10 just until the bugs get fixed.

								so many years have passed since the developpers promissed us the world and here we are still in alpha... yeah the devolopers promissed us that the game would be in beta 3 YEARS AGO. and a finished game 2 years ago. i thought hell ill take a chance and i even want beta access..... this was clearly a mistake since this game is a buggy mess that is still lacking most of what they sold it on. "" Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?"" “8 to 12 months”... thats what they said on steam 19 months ago. so they keep promising and never deliver. this company is the main reason i dont trust kickstarters and early access anymore. i have waited and waited on this game but at this point its a running joke. sure they make updates to the game. but they are nowhere near where they prommissed to be no matter if you go by the steam prommis or the kickstarter.

								When i originally bought this game June 2015, the game had zero content at all... It had the barebones of a game. With as much gameplay as poking a cat with a stick (You'd either get bored of poking the cat or the cat would just run away to no avail), back to the review.After a few months past the game actually started to show some promise. Though the AI wasn't that inuitive...Then the game vanished off my radar into the blue.Then after hearing someone i knew was asking my opinion on the game. I gave it a try.Played it for 16-17 hours from that point giving all my attention. I do enjoy these genres of games... Unfortunately because it is processing data. There is always a point where these games tend to crash. Which disappointed me indefinately... This game reached that point towards the end where the challenges were almost non-existant and all the enemies were more a nuisance. I was enjoying building a town with a thriving area... Just as i was about to create the 15th Building... The FPS started to tank like as i was hitting the memory threshold or something. In the end the map eventually became unplayable.For the amount of time this game was enjoyable. Just wish the experience lasted.			"

								It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but there is a severe lack of an end goal. I've played enough of each character type/map to understand the basics and I don't find myself trying to improve my town. I just leave it as it is and hope new Hearthlings come by. It's fun to play, but it's too easy to unlock new components. I would rate this game higher if there were time or population based unlocks that kept me playing past the first 15 citizens.			"

								Very fun game. I have been itching to play a game like this for a while and it has satisfied me. The only reason why I am not recommending this game is because of all the bugs. Yes it is in early access, but some of the bugs that I have ran in too can push you back an hour or so of building, including a bug where your workers refuse to finish the building that is currently under construction. Once these bugs are fixed then I will be glad to recommend  this.			"

								This is not a game to buy at this point. The devs make excuses to some very long time game breaking bugs. If you like restarting your game every 10 to 15 minutes to make it work, or losing whole towns because of errors.. then maybe this game is for you. In its current state it is unplayable and all the devs focus on is new content without correcting the game breaking bugs. What good is new content if you can't play the game?Your town people will idle for no reason (stop working).There is pathing issues that will make your town people die of hunger.They will not complete buildings early in the game, this is for the simple designs forget trying to build complex buildings.Restarting the game every 10 to 15 minutes in hopes it corrects the issues ( and most the time it does not).It will use up your ram at high velocity and spam you with error messages (got over 5k a few times on error messages).This is just a few examples of the state of this unplayable game. If they had a report game button I would hit it in a minute.Be warned before dumping money into this game.Steam forums are not important to these devs. I am sick and tired of devs thinking we owe them something and have to use their forums.. because it is easy for them, not the customer..

								So, I have been playing for 40 hours as shown, included about 4 play through, I really love the concept and art work, but I can not recommnad this game.This game has 2 critical problem and 1 of them is greatly affecting the core of game play, and I believe both problem been exsisting since alpha 17 began or even earlier.The building system is either coded badly or the whole coding design was wrong in the very first place.When I encounter a gaming bug I generally try to assume why it happened and try to work around, but I just dont understand why the hearlthlings would just stop building the already planned stuff so suddenly.When player confirm the build, the building plan would be executed and set as first priority, it is a do until done task.I'm confused becasue the hearthling's AI doesn't seems off at all, they can access even just 1 single block, they know how to switch around between build and collect. It doesnt make sense for them to just stop building.A few possibility would kind of explain but a bit stretch. For example I started my latest 2 buildings together at the same time and put it real close.They eventually stop at 50%. Maybe becasue not enough room? but they build both to about 50% for no problem, I even mannually asked hearthlings to put up stairs to see if it's spacing prolbem, but nope, they went up normally and got down without any hardship and ignore the half way done building. Now only 1 possibility I can think of, hearthlings got confused by getting 2 building order, whitch I cannot explain why if this is actually what happen...Another bug is, hearthlings will not put down stuff when told to. But there's a fix, whitch is when they refuse or ignore the order to put down certain stuff, just go and build a new item. They will start putting stuff down when the new stock come into inventory. I assume this is some sort of data lost whitch the items in the inventory was not visible to the hearthlings.The invaders also got some problem which I just discoverd today.Goblin Kings Dialog show up said that army was arrived, but they did not... and never did after days... It only happen once.I really wanna play more hours but I can't when I cannot build up my town... The whole game is about fighting the invader and build your customized town, 1 of them is 80% broken.I understand this is an early access game, but alpha 17 has been out for 1 whole years, I watch the video for last year and compare with my game there were so little different to be honest. Dev. really need to work harder on both coding and debugging.			"

								If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.But for the review's sake, 9/10. The game is great, but pike all games it can be buggy.			"

								Simply awesome, one of my favorite town crafting game. Lots of change since I voted for this one on greenlight, gameplay is basic aswell as graphics and animation are basic, but it all fit perfectly for this kind of game.Pros:- Town builder- Use one of the 5 or 6 building already there to build your house, or do them by yourself with an amazing system that made the house crafting really easy- Your settler do their job and seems to focus on what is more important, did not found any problem with the items collection yet- Tunel digging, (a bit hard to handle for now, with the camero position)- Invasion (not so hard for now, but I saw my brother fighting a huge beast) :D- Like I said earlier, gameplay is really basic, making the game really fun, really easy to handleCons: (Only found one yet)- Hard to stop playing :D			"

								Horrible. This game has way too many game breaking bugs. It has potential but is horrible at the moment. Your world may last about an hour before the bugs start happening. If you wan this game, wait for it to update a couple of times because this version is really bad. Now, on the bright side, this game is still an ALPHA game, which means its not complete and has many more updates and bug fixes. Dont get me wrong, this game IS fun just that the bugs get out of hand. The bugs can make your game crash too so i suggest turning auto saving on because if you dont you could lose a lot of progress.I give this game a 9/10 for what does work but as a whole i give it a 5/10. This is after an update: Update didn/t help. This game is still broken. Don't get it.			"

								You know those over-ambitious games that you hear about and think they'd be amazing, but then you play them and are immediately dissapointed?  That's this game.I got suckered in by the Kickstarter, and it's been the same glitchy mess for three years.At its core, the game wants to be a city-planning, strategy, completely customizable dream of a game with strong community support.  The problem is that, at the moment, there's very little customization, no strategy, and no real city planning.  Towns rarely last long enough to build more than a handful of homes before glitches break a save.The new features that have been added over the years have been nice, but they'd be nicer if I could actually enjoy them without having to restart because of a game-breaking bug.One of two things will happen.  Either your adorable hearthlings will simply stop doing anything, or some problem will arise when building a structure and nothing will be accomplished as all citizens will get stuck on a ladder or permanently be stuck holding materials or literally lose their head.Some bugs are fixed, but the game hasn't progressed nearly far enough while in development, and now that Riot bought the company, I sincerely doubt anything will come of this game.tl;dr - If the game didn't break so much, it'd be a fun little time waster as it is, but that's a pretty big ""if"" at this point.

								I would love to love this game, but it is incomplete, clunky, and boring.  The ""voxelated"" graphics are a poor and cliche aesthetic choice.  Progression is slow and meaningless.  Building design, though quite intricate, ultimately adds little to the game mechanic and ends up being mostly a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  (You must pre-design buildings rather than construct them block-by-block as in Minecraft or Dwarf Fortress.)Yes, it's an early access title, but the only material change in the game in the last 9 months seems to be breaking save compatibility.  Give these guys 2-3 more years to put out a finished game before you pay anything for it.			"

								I tried to go to offical Stonehearth site to find more info and  even that site was too complicated for me. I looked here perhaps I am missing something being totally newbie but I keep running into things that I can't figure out or even begin to explain why I can't figure out. Ugh like first it was the inventory then its building issue, then its why isn't my workers working. I don't maybe I should ask for refund. Because everything I try to find never exxplains how resolve it.  The videos on the game and progressiion is great over the year (I watched over 200 videos on the game before I purchased it.)But not sure ift worth paying 27 for a game I can't figure out how to play or I am not sure if its a bug that is preventing me from playing it. I am so over early access. Let me know when the game is more user friendly than I might play it again.  I'd ask for refund but I aleady had the over 4 games this last month I ask for refund. Very disappointed at the moment. I don't think I want buy another Steam product at the moment.			"

								The game is fun at first but as you play and continue to find stuff that is not complete in the game and know there should be there it's not fun. You can not fully edit your building because some of the editing tools are not there and doing some research on the internet it's been like this for quite sometime now. I hope the game will improve soon.			"

								While I haven't yet put in a lot of hours into the game, I will say that what's there is quite fun to play.It's an ideal game for anyone who likes Dwarf Fortress or Towns, as well as anyone who enjoys the whole ""minimal input"" genre of games. You can designate a plot to build on, then watch your little workers get to work. There's also resource management, combat, farming, and lots of other stuff that you indirectly have control over. Presentation wise, you can see that the creators of this game have put a lot of love into the detail and mechanics of the game. There's leveling up, skill progression, exploitation of resources, and all the fun stuff you'd expect from this genre of game.All in all, a worth it purchase.			"

								This is a good game. This game takes alot of ideas and throws it into a bowl without any part overpowering the others. It all blends really nice. Like a backrub from a high quality german stripper who, on her off time, met you at a coffer bar. She noticed you needed someone to talk to and came over with two Caramel Macchiatos. She sat down and asked how your day was, and you reply, ""Stoneharth is difficult and I lost my favorite villager."" Knowing how important it is that you keep all of them alive, she offered to help you play it. She sat you down and coached you through the hard parts. Told you to always work on military as well as how much food and wealth your village has. ""Defences often save your life."" She noted. You realized that at that moment, this game you've been playing is depper than you thought. The german stripper smiled, and left. You were too busy playing this game to ♥♥♥♥. That is alright. It is worth it.9.8/10 (Early Acess, it'll be 10 soon enough)			"

								The concept is fantastic, and there's a lot of potential in the game, but...There's far too many issues with its current state. Building custom buildings is near-impossible, the controls are often non-responsive, there's a nasty memory leak (this game should not require +6 gigs of RAM), and that's only the biggest problems. Workers that don't work, ladders and furniture that can't be deconstructed, etc. There's many small things that combine to make the game very hard to enjoy. Putting aside the bugs and building problems, the game is well designed. The progression of your minions is simple but effective, the resource harvesting likewise. My only quibble is that it takes a very long time to do anything with only a 2x speed option. I'd like the ability to go up to 8x at least.Given the strength of the underlying design, I look forward to playing the game more once it's had some bug-fixing done. However, I can only review it based on what it is now, so I cannot recommend this as is.			"

								Stonehearth is a game of soldiers meets time management; you build a town and keep your inhabitants happy and defend them against enemies. The controls are simple enough to understand and do not require players to have an insane amount of dexterity to master the game. It's something of a sandbox designing villager's houses and towns.However the game meets a limit once you've established your colony and becomes tedious to defend against mobs. There are also times when I find myself sitting around doing nothing.			"

This game looks amazing and the game play is awesome...But I can't recommend playing this as of now. So many glitches and errors make the game for the most part unplayable. This is ridiculously true when attempting to build a multi-story building: things get stuck, walls get stuck, building undeletable, etc. Hopefully in the future I can upvote this as it does look promising. There are better things on Steam to spend $30 on.			"

								I participated in the kickstart and got two copies from it because of my pledge. I played several alpha versions up to A20 and finally quit trying. If you watch the Kickstarter and earlier videos and then you play the game as it is now, it is like water and wine. The original seemed a lot more casual and about building a nice town and eventually castles with aspects of crafting, hunting and so on. However, the game grew in complexity so much that it is now not only too complex to be casual, but it is too complex for the developers to keep it up and follow up on the infinite bugs that it has. This game will never be complete IMHO because the development team forgot their basics and went for a too complex approach to be any good. When you get stuck over and over trying to build a single building, you will notice it won't go far.They should have left all the detail and minimalistic things and gone FIRST to the big game: place buildings, structures, etc... make enemies, little wars, little raids. Get the game WORKING, allow you to make any city or castle you wanted without worring if the door is aligned to the freaking wall or will even work. THEN elaborate the minimalistic things.Clearly, a team with no programming experience. Shame ...			"

								Do not recommend. Combat controls are too awkward, and the dev tools mod is too limited.  You should be able to edit characters' stats and such.  Part of the fun of these ""sandbox"" games is to do what you want, but it feels very constrained.  You either have ""Peaceful"" mode, or ""survival"" mode, but you can't setup your base to, say, fight off hordes of enemies.  I think what annoys me most, is how *easy* it should be to implement those tools.I will happily change my review in the future if more edit-ability is added.			"

								The bulk of their updates have been color swaps of already existing items. Two years on and the game still tanks with around 15+ hearthlings. Two years on and the game still doesn't really have a story. Two years on and the maps are still extremely small. Two years on and we've only gotten a handful of classes and new items. Two years on and we've only gotten a few new enemies. Two years on and the game is still plagued with bugs and errors, the same ones in many cases too. Two years on and the building tools still haven't really been improved. See the pattern? The development for this game is as slow as Interstellar Marines.Avoid, this is one of those Early Access games that will likely never be finished and they'll just rip the EA tagging off of it and abandon it. Regretful purchase. Most people I know who have it only put a few hours into this sandbox game and abandoned it. It was a great idea, but unfortunately it's the wrong developers. Play for 3 hours and you'll experience all that the game has to offer, which is pretty much the same as what it offered two years ago.			"

								This game has some potential but due to several (gamebreaking) bugs it is barely playable.For a game with a focus on building stuff, one would expect the builing mechanics to work more or less (early acess or not) but it really does not. Most builings (which are slightly more complicated than: four wall + roof) wil not get finished or the building tool will kinda crash. The inability to remove buildings does not help.The worker AI is also very glitchy and in most cases a (pretty annoying) reload of the game helps, but not always...So, what do i think about the game?I like the overall setting and i also like the simplistic graphis style. I think, this game has a lot of potential and will be very good + addicting, when its finished.Is it worth your money (leaving aside the early access nonsense)?No, not yet -> ""too early access""			"

								When I first saw SH I was so exited.I thought ""yes! this is a great idea, I bet this will be loads of fun"" I was wrong.Let's get this straight. The concept for this game is really good, it had so much potential, and if and entirly different team had made it then yes this might have been a new favorite of mine.It was not.This game is not thought out, the gameplay is dull and boaring and the developlers don't seem to be able to see, or care, about the mirad of major game design flaws that continue to criple this game.Maybe if this team is replaced by an entirely different team this game could be good, but as of now it is not.The way this game is developing it will NEVER BE A GOOD GAME. Do Not Buy.			"

								This is a good idea. Take dwarf fortress, make it into a GUI. But my goodness, the execution. Its horid. Not so much in how everything works, its ok in that department, but how many things can you see on screen? Basically nothing. Its like your always in 480 or 720 when you have 1440 resolution. It works, but it looks like its from the 90s. Add more units, a larger area you can see at once, and mabe it will be passable. I would return it if I could at the current state.			"

								Giving a bad review because just trying to move around is terrible, your camera view is so clunky and just bad. Like you can't hold right mouse click to turn and use ""w"" to move forward at the same time. Then trying to view in mines or trying to mine at all is nearly impossible due to really bad camera. Could be good game but the camera and how mining works makes it unplayable, waste of money "

								Interface workflow makes management a chore, the ""art style"" with its complete lack of material textures is downright ugly, building design includes game breaking bugs, combat means finding your soldiers and individually pointing them into the rough direction of the enemy.A good idea and concept very badly implemented. After 1.5 years in early access, I expected something more playable, not having to write down items from one interface to feed them into another.			"

								im enjoying myself so far but wont be long before im bored, had to configure computer to play the game as , as soon as it downloaded i was faced with white error screen when loading start up so had to sort that out before playing .... the game is pretty buggy, although not really crashing on me the games performance slowly but kinda quickly if that makes sence drops on you the more minutes your in game and you start to notice things stutter . gave up on normal play and had to start playing hard as other options are just way too easy, but im finding hard to possibly be way too hard, theres no middle ground. its ok i suppose and i would give this game a thumbs up if i had payed no more than 12 pounds for it			"

								As far as potential goes I think this game has quite a bit, and while I would not reccomend the game as it is due to the reasons below, in time it should reach the point of being a worthwhile game for the current cost. Which is another thing..this game right now at most should be 15-20, since its not a game with a lot of content and with some major fatal bugs. Currently most lot of the planned content is no where near being in which makes me question the pricing decision. Right now only 1/3rd of the intended jobs are in.During my five hours of gameplay I consantly ran into UI crashes and system failures, which would result in parts of the UI or game becoming unusable forcing you to reload. Twice now it has nearly crashed my pc to the point I was forced to do a false restart where the computer shuts the program down since you hit the power button but you then cancle the restart when it asks you to close your notepad. The game draws more ram then needed from your system causing sound glitches. Also combat in it can be frustraiting, having to use a badly designed party/designated area targeting system. And a warning, do NOT save when one of your characters is in direct combat, when you load the game takes a while to load the ui and seems to suddenly jump a minute or so ahead in combat, often instanly killing any non guard character without giving you the chance to react.

								Okay, this is fun. Heavily racist, but very fun with a mod. :-/ Danger zone maybe? Nah, heres how it is:It's a Banished/Minecraft clone essentially with the diffrence that exploring is limited to a smallish area and it's purely a town ownership and creation type game gathering resources etc with ikkle people/hearthlings, but it's enough to keep you hooked for endless hours once you realise that you can actually create your own building designs from literally the ground up. Forget the standard builds you can just select and place in the world for the Hearthlings to work for you, honestly, I recommend creating your own 10>20 person dining hall with a sleeping area on a second floor for the same amount in the beginning of this, then create walls etc.There are still some bugs that need ironing out, but for the price at the moment, it's a very enjoyable game and the devs are working hard on this continuously.Now, if you havent already fallen asleep reading this boring review I will get to the racism part...........We all like Multiculturism to a level where certain religions are NOT concerned, but if you choose ""The Ascendancy"" and want to have your town based on European based medievel type era castles etc you have to go through the randomise option a hundred times before you can get a full set of ginger, brown or black haired WHITE Hearthlings and 9/10 times they will all have rubbish stats, so you are forced to relive history as some kind of reinvention where all other nationalities were magically ""transported"" in like a bad star trek episode, where in the early year 1000's there were all colours and nationalities in old blighty and Europe. Yes I know, it's fiction with regard to stone monsters etc, but the castle walls and weapons etc are based on historical European designs.Not racist on my behalf, I want to recreate my tribe as per my historical descendancy!Now, however and the MAIN point here.........if you choose 'Rayyas Children' to play on either the Forest or Desert biomes and decide to import your white Hearthlings through that randomise button, you will spend eternity clicking and clicking to have a WIlliam Wallace white, brown haired hardcore dude as a hearthling because you can only play that sect as people with coloured skin! See where I am going here? ;-)Luckily there is a non dev mod available in the Steam store I eventually found, but really? You shouldnt have to use a mod to recreate a castle and medieval atmosphere! This is a game for the paying customer after all and everyone is scared of pointing this fact out due to being branded racist against colour of skin. This is racist against whites in my opinion!All that being said, with the mod it's a fantastic little gem this and worth under 20 quid in my opinion. A lot of work to be done ESPECIALLY with the system resource it requires even though its a tad basic (Needs optimisation in the code), but it's already worth that asking tag at the moment.Great work you racist bunch of devs, but mods shouldnt be needed! :-D			"

								Well this game looked kinda interesting. Mild humour in the loading screen and light, hassle free gameplay with a lot fo customisation if you want it. basically it looked to me like a cross between a build your village game and minecraft. That's kinda cool. Sadly I am very disappointed to report that this game doesn't work for more than 3/4 minutes at a time before bugging out and ""not responding"" as windows likes to put it. I appreciate that this game is still in its alpha version and I wasn't expecting alot of awesome content till much later in development. For the princely sum of £18:99 which is more than Minecraft btw I would expect to actually be able to play this game. I'll give this one more shot before I give it up as lost money. Until I actually get to play thsi game I'll give this game a big thumbs down.Edit: I gave it another go and manged to que up buiding a building before it bugged out on me. My next target is to last a whole half-day.			"

								This game is cute, Not only cute but it look really fun. Is this right?? yes and no. This game is a good idea, hell a very good idea, but the bugs... pretty bad, I can understand when your people just leave♥♥♥♥♥♥on the building but when they just ignore youre commands to build or do anything at all... thats something else. Half the time my people needed food, I made a farmer and set them to plant corn, he just sad there and continued to starve, same with the trapper(s). Not to mention the building system is very unfriendly at the moment. A. when you try to make your own building, the game almost breaks when you try to have a structure with more then one floor, Then if you somehow get past that, half the time when you tell your workers to build it, even if you have everything you need they will continue to sit there. One this game is fixed I have little doubt it could be one of the best games of its type. but now it is anything but that. Do Not get this game now unless you want to wait for updates			"

I just lost a hearthling because of stupid game design(seems to be the norm in this industry for the past decade), when moving items in my town from box to box, the hearthlings walked to the other side of the map IN THE WATER for no reason, goblins spawned and killed them in 2 hits, seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, why are the path movements blocked? i have a town with roads, heaps of space, yet the AI decides to go on a trek for no reason (no loot to collect on this side of the map btw). ♥♥♥♥ knows why they are going out there? and why the hell cant i control theyre movements? get a grip....

								Look promising and graphic look nice. Did not play much before refund. The reason is the building mechanic makes me frustrated. It is quite clunky and you cannot modify the building once builted. I think, building modification should be able since early development phase, especially this game is sales in alpha state (which is already 5 years). I think there are different between adding addition features and debug VS problem of game mechanic and functionality. Browsing through the developer website and forum, there is no mention about putting this feature in the game at any stage of development. Probably the game engine is at fault and building modification is not possible. Hope the developer or those with deep insight with this game can help answer my question. For now, I do not recommend this game due to the problem I mentioned.			"

This type of game has a lot of potential.In its current state it is too buggy to be enjoyable for more than 4 hours.Looks like everything comes down to bad path finding right now. Devs say they are going to fix this. We'll see...Update [27.10.2015]- Pathfinding bugs are mostly fixed- Game starts crashing as soon as your village becomes too big (10+ villagers).
