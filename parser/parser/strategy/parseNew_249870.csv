												Do you like Scribblenauts? Buy this. Do you like DC Comics in remotely any shape or form? BUY THIS. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game is a giant nerd love letter. Even better - instead of the ""5 missions and a starite"" system of Unlimited, all non-""event"" missions are randomly generated, and I think the only thing I saw repeat on my first run through the whole game was the occasional ""capture this person"" bounty hunt.Literally the only character I wanted in the game who wasn't already was due to licensing issues with Milestone (sorry Static :( ), this thing popped out anything I threw at it, sometimes even surprising ME with the versions it'd conjure up. Also it's very, very cleverly written for the funnybook fans. I'm pretty sure one joke is even a giant shot over the bow of current DC and a massive ♥♥♥♥ing plothole.The only thing some people might find an issue with: there's now a scoring system on your solutions to puzzles. If you use the same adjective and/or item over and over, you get diminishing returns. (A little icon will warn you.) It limits you from performing The Dead Clown Trick this time around, but I thought it was worth it to go for high scores given that you can spend the points to unlock new powers/outfits for Maxwell as a result. I only wish they'd gone a little further with the lady outfits, you have no idea how bad I wanted to get a Power Girl costume. (They cover some real niche roles though. Starman? Swamp Thing? Animal Man? A random Wonder Woman battle armor? Yeah those are all in there.)This is a game where, due to my choices, Harley Quinn ended up riding a cow as she and my evil twin tried to murder me with giant novelty props. Can you make better stupid decisions? Prove it, in Scribblenauts Un(-50% POINTS FOR USING UN-ADJECTIVES OVER AND OVER)			"

												Scribblenauts Unmasked is a great game. In a way, it's educational because you'll try to remember words you used to know, and it also makes you think of objects you usually have no connection with, or that only existed in your imagination.But as the title suggests it's all about the DC universe so if you hate comic books you probably won't be able to enjoy yourself with this game. or at least not as much.So, there are multiple worlds to visit; Gotham City, Metropolis and worlds connected to other DC characters like Aquaman or Wonder Woman. The levels are pretty big, and there are always multiple random objectives/quests to finish, and one story segment to complete. Modifiers can also be activated (like only writing words starting with the letter N) that earn you extra points. These points are used to play origin stories or other levels. You'll need to unlock all levels in order to be able to complete the game (which should take you somewhere between 10-15 hours, depending on how much you want to complete). Earning points, however, happens very fast and it will never take long before you can go the next area.Scribblenauts Unmasked is basically the same as the previous Scribblenauts games, but with a different theme. This time it's a theme I usually adore. But writing and thinking of words is what it's really all about. And that's not bad. Not bad at all. In fact, I had a very fun time with it, but I do wonder if it can keep your attention long enough...I would highly recommend it personally.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												I came into this game with the impression that it took away ALL of the good things from the previous Scribblenauts game. I am happy to say that I was wrong and while it does have its shortcomings, it's still a good game at its core.The best way to look at this game is to view it as half Scribblenauts and half another medium to experience the DC universe. It takes a small bit of the creativity that was required in the previous game and fills the vacuum with all the DC heroes and villains we've come to love.Here are some slight observations after 2 days of playing and completing the game:The Good:- Adds a plethora of new characters- Interesting origin stories!- Cool costumes. It was fun to test them all out. Keep in mind some of them overlap due to having similar strengths.The Bad:- The game can limit your line of thinking by having you rely on the same nouns and adjectives over and over again. There's more combat so this is normal. Consider it a challenge to find more creative ways to deal with these combat scenarios.- Content = less meaty overall. The previous game had way more things to do so therefore I can't really agree with the current price.- If you're not a DC enthusiast, you may not know how to do some of the repeatable objectives (such as the number guessing game).It's a good game. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Make sure to watch the cutscenes! 4/5			"

												Warning: In this review I will be comparing this game to Scribblenauts Unlimited, just for convience and ease of explanation! You have been warned!Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comic Adventure is very different from Scribblenauts Unlimited. Different in their freedom, different in their objects, different in achievements, different in level desgin, and different in their challeneges.In Scribblenauts Unlimited there was unlimited freedom, as it says on the tin. But in Scribblenauts Unmasked there is a big limit, and this limit can inspire even more creativity than Scribblenauts Unlimited. The limit in question is that in each level in each session, you can only use a certain adjective or noun once, and if you continue to use it, points will be deducted. (These points are merely a type of coin system you can use in-game to perchase in-game costumes for your character.) This will force you to come up with a different object to use instead of the one you were going to use, or it will force you to come up with a way to do the same thing you were doing, but without that adjective or noun.Scribblenauts Unmasked is obviously a DC Comics game, and thus you can spawn DC Comic related things, which means that the objects you can spawn are very different from Scribblenauts Unlimited, in that they are actual copyrighted things that are allowed in game. This doesn't just serve as a theme, or as a nice little detail to fanboy about, but also it can serve as another way to challenge you or to give you new ideas. As well as it being DC Comics, you are also allowed to make your character some description of a superhero, or supervillian, when you desgin your own character you can give him/her super powers and a swanky costume that you designed yourself. Of course the super powers are a bit limiting, I will warn you, as they only really involve attacking and nothing like flying or invisibilty, but those can be added after character creation with adjectives or even nouns, such as a flying ring.There are almost double the achievements (Scribblenauts Unlimited 25, Scribblenauts Unmasked 40), as well as adding random (showing up at random) challeneges when you enter a level, which will challenge you to not use adjectives, or only use DC characters, which can be interesting and a lot of fun. Because there is so much to unlock with the points you collect, when you finish everything in the game then you can gather heaps of points and try and buy all the costumes and super powers.The level designs are much different in Scribblenauts Unmasked, as they are a lot darker and grittier. There is also a level path for certain parts of DC comics, such as a Batman path, where at the end you can 'learn' about his backstory, just in case you were so isolated that you don't know.If you are going to buy this game, keep in mind that although it has many positives that Scribblenauts Unlimited didn't have, you will most likely get more playtime out of Scribblenauts Unlimited then this game. But this game has a lot more potential play time then Scribblenauts Unlimited had. And in some ways it is better than Scribblenauts Unlimited,			"

												Scribblenauts at its best! While Unlimited was good, it ended fairly quickly, and then there was not much else to do other than use the backgrounds and spawn things randomly.Here there is dynamically randomly generated content that goes on endlessly, every time you reload a level there's more things to do, even with variances with the dynamically generated content, the quest giver/target as well as the things being asked change even within the same quest.And to top it all THE MASSIVE ADDITION OF THE DC UNIVERSE!!! All of this together makes for the best Scribblenauts experience I've ever had! 10/10.			"

												Scribblenauts Unmasked is an interesting beast. Let me begin by saying, yes, I believe Scribblenauts Unlimited is a better game. Now, Unmasked is still a fantastic game, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessor. Unmasked focuses too much on the combat that has never been the strong suit of a scribblenauts game. In addition, the random mission aspect of the game, while a good idea, tends to be the same few missions repeated. Gone is the uniqueness of all the small sidequests of Unlimited, replaced with random fetch quests.With that being said, The game is still, at it's core, a scribblenauts game. Your creativity fuels the game, and the inclusion of the DC universe brings some interesting things to the table. If you get the chance, definitely pick this one up FIRST. You won't be disapointed. Then you can move onto unlimited.			"

												I recommend it, but only if you're craving more scribblenauts with the understanding that this one just isn't as good.Pros:- Creativity similar to Scribblenauts unlimited. If you can dream it, it's in there- HUGE database of DC universe heros and baddies. Seriously huge. You will learn about comic book heros you've never known existed.- Lots of interactive Lore, the starite missions and the origin missions are a blast!Cons:- Fighting is horrible. It is the same horrible clunky fighting system as in Scribblenauts unlimited but it is used everywhere constantly! It is almost unbearable and is entirely frustrating- Game progression is clunky, new areas are opened up by collecting medals in each respective comic universe. - Did I mention the fighting is terrible? Weapons degrade and disappear faster than they can kill an enemy, yet every time you turn around some random bad guy is attacking either you or the person you're doing a riddle for.Over all? 7/10 if you really liked scribblenauts unlimited. If you never played scribblenauts, 4/10.			"

												So being my first experience with a scribblenauts game this was an excellent experience for a DC comic book fan. Being able to do thing like grab blue kryptonite to make fighting Bizzaro easier or providing not any old time machine but a time bubble to someone asking for a way to time travel I was really pleased.That being said this games combat is lackluster and at times I did feel kind of limited as to what kind of word combonations I could provide to solve puzzles along with the ease at which you could missclick in combat and make enemies of your allies it could get kind of frustrating at times.That being said the time I put into playing this game was overall enjoyable until my last two achievements but as they have nothing to do with the story it is not that big of a deal. If you are a fan of DC comics I would say it is well worth at least one playthrough.I give it a rating of 7.5/10			"

												Only play if you're interested in a DC sandbox. The game itself is a big step down from Scribblenauts Unlimited (so, a HUGE step down from the first two Scribblenauts games). No clever puzzles. Very little incentive to be creative. You just grind reputation by completing braindead randomized encounters so you can unlock the next story mission. Then when you're done with that you can grind MORE reputation to unlock the origin stories for the major characters, which take about one minute each to complete. And then you can grind more reputation and unlock costumes if you haven't fallen asleep yet. Despite being very disappointed in this game, I did enjoy its MASSIVE collection of DC characters and items. Sadly there are no Watchmen or Gaiman Sandman characters (or anything from Vertigo). There are, however, hundreds of Green Lanterns, alternate versions of characters (there are like 30 different Batmen), and obscure crap like Arm-Fall-Off-Boy. If you're a comic nerd, it's fun to mess around for a while and just look at all the stuff they put in here. It's too bad the game they built around it is so tedious.			"

												As a DC Comics fan I enjoyed Scribblenauts Unmasked immensely.Trying to create various semi-obscure characters just to see if they’re in the game by itself can be a fun experience, and the same could be said for trying to use the various characters’ powers and abilities in a creative way to react to the various challenges.The Mxyzptlk challenges (having to play a stage with some restrictions such as only using animals,  superheroes, words starting with a certain letter, etc.) can also help spice up things, should you choose to accept them, when you are not utterly ridiculous.While it’s obvious not all characters and items are present the number and variety of the ones that are is incredible. I was personally kind of bummed I couldn’t summon, say, Lou Martin just to be pleasantly surprised later when I saw Vext or Shade the Changing Man pop out.The story is really cute and permeated from start to finish with irony and a childlike sense of adventure. There’s a whole lot of little in-jokes from Batman refusing to use guns, to little hearts appearing over the heads of characters who are romantically involved with each other, to Maxwell time traveling to the past and asking Batgirl how her spine feels as a thank you after she saves him.The problem with the game is that it might not be as appealing for a fan of Scribblenauts who is not into DC. When you strip it of the fanservice the game feels inferior to Unlimited. The random tasks add a lot of variety but they feel tacked-on and sometimes even break for no reason. It may happen that you enter a stage just to see a character with a task icon die miserably or conversely see a task complete without any input from the player. The game is also far more combat oriented than its predecessors and a lot of challenges can be completed simply by creating a lot of powerful superheroes. Last but not least, Unmasked is painfully short. There is only 12 main missions divided between 3 categories (Gotham, Metropolis and Justice League, which involves Oa, Atlantis, Themyscira and Central City), which are only a few minutes long, and 6 mini missions in which you help the main DC heroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, Flash) through their origin story, which are even shorter.In the end Scribblenauts Unmasked is a good game if you are a DC Comics fan and an ok game if you are a Scribblenauts fan, but if you are just interested in the series and trying to pick your first title, go with Unlimited instead.

												Like the first, I can't rate this game high enough in terms of the whole storyline, the puzzles and the numerous things that can be created or described to move onwards. At eight years old my son (not my mental age, just to be clear) has already had hours of enjoyment playing the first Scribblenauts but with his love of super heroes, in particular DC ones, this game has taken things to a whole new level. I'm loving seeing this game help with his reading, typing, spelling as well as his mouse and keyboard skills. We have a rule that if he is playing then he has to think things through and also try to enter the names of items and characters - and it works! Of course I'm also getting a kick of out any hearing the weird or wacky ideas he comes up with that solve the puzzle (as well as dropping a few of my own) and there have been times when we have both laughed quite freely while playing.And yes, I've had a blast playing on the game myself. For obvious reasons this is less likely to appeal to someone without kids and I much prefer playing the game with the young'n but I would not say it cannot be enjoyed by any age group. The difference in enjoyment is just expressed in the ways you play and hell, for under £4 who wouldn't want to trample over Sinestro on a giant rhino riding Cthulu or defeat Lex Luthor by striking him with an invisible singing fish?

												Big Fan of the Scribblenauts Games. So far I've only played the other games released on my DS, which I take everywhere to fight boredom. This Game combines not only Imagination and Creativity like the others, but also one of my favourite Comic Franchise. Which pushes it up a step further. Playing this on PC is much more enjoyable, better quality but still plenty of Fun. Great entertainment and awesome for everybody. The things you can make with a little dash of imagination and creativity inside the games is amazing and I highly recommend that you get all the games available in the franchise of Scribblenauts if you can. But for outstanding quality and freedom of creation I would recommend this and Scribblenauts Unlimited.9.5 outta 10 from me. \(^_^)/""Creativity takes Courage"" - Henri Matisse.""Everything you can Imagine is real"" - Pablo Picasso.

												I adored this game's predescessor- 'Scribblenauts Unlimited'. It was a charming, relaxing game that was an absolute joy start-to-finish. This game? Well, it took the core formula of 'Unlimited', and added an amazing amount of characters and items from the DC comics world. It's a lot of fun to just fly around goofing off- spawning a giant Parralax and various heroes to fight him. Things like that. But the changes they made to the core gameplay are a big turn-off for me- namely combat. The first game had only a few very basic situations in which you could be hurt. They were not threatening and few and far between. This game is almost constantly putting you in combat, which might be an acceptable change if combat wasn't dreadfully boring, clumsy and imprecise. I still HIGHLY suggest playing this game (especially at a discount), but I just wish it had dropped all the combat nonsense.			"

												Loved it, it's a tad less good than the original but it's still an awesome game.The positiveScribblenauts Unmasked lets you unleash the power of your imagination. The number of items you can create is astonishing and now you can create DC comics characters (as well as a lot of alternative versions of them). You can have a lot of fun trying to make them interact with each other. I don't know much about comics characters and the game teaches you quite a bit about their origin (there are dedicated quests about the origins of a few characters), their powers and how they're all linked to each other. The number of side quests is huge and can sometimes be tricky to solve. It's also interesting to find some unusual combinations to solve them. Scribblenauts might look like it aims at a younger audience but even when you're not a kid anymore, it's still a hella lot of fun. I love the very cute graphic style and the soundtrack is pretty awesome. Imagination is a powerful tool. Finally, for achievement hunters, most of the achievements are easy to get.The negativeIt's not very long (just a few hours) and unlocking costumes is just grinding, you have to solve a lot of quests to get them all. The story isn't very compelling to be honest and is mostly carried by the DC universe. The number of different environment isn't very high as well and it's a bit disappointing.Conclusion Great game, for both kids and adults. The cuteness of the graphics and the soundtrack, as well as the (probably not always obvious) depth of the gameplay makes it really enjoyable. I'm just disappointed that they basically took Scribblenauts Unlimited, added the DC universe and didn't add very much new gameplay mechanics. Get the first one if you haven't played it since it's better in my opinion, unless you're a huge fan of the DC universe.			"

												Do you love Scribblenauts? Do you love the DC Universe? If so, this is the game for you. This version of Scribblenauts makes great use of the DC Universe to make a game that any DC Comics fan would love. Not only do they make use of the usual cast of DC characters, but they also use characters that many people might not know. They also use quite a few different versions of characters, (such as the Superman from Red Son). I find this game to have the best Scribblenauts story out of the few I have played.			"

												First off I'm a sad 14 year old kid who spends a majority of his life reading comics and playing games... BUT this game is great cuz it gets the comics and the games and makes a game for 5 years olds so when my mum comes in my room I don't have to explain why there is someone getting shot or stabbed on my screen and instead she sees me playing a innocent game that is decently fun.

												...I would play this game some more to test it better. For now... is it a bad game? No it's not, nor it is the little masterpiece it could have been. The ""create what you want writing it"" thing is cool to some extent; it could easily become boring and, when rapid action is needed, you would probably create something basic just to solve the problem quickly. Otherwise, you would smile two or three times creating absurd things, then the action will become very repetitive. In the end, also language understanding problems by the AI will prevent some of your fantasies to be created in the game. What about the DC Universe? On the one hand, the game has an enormous library containing almost all of the DC characters, the most strange and forgotten ones too. That's cool, but... on the other hand, the narrative is very basic and not only made for chidren, but actually childish and sometimes annoying. So, if the game is made for (quite stupid) children who probably haven't a deep knowldege of the DC comics, why is this enormous fan-service library provided? ...who is this game for, exactly? I can't say, but probably not for me. Try it at the lowest price, just to satisfy your curiosity: 6-/10			"

												I reaaally enjoyed scribblenauts unlimited so I thought I'd like this one.+ having a hard time getting into the story.+ glitchy, it even crashed on me and lost my save info+ it has a point system per level, and limits the words you can use.---thats not fun for people like me who cant think of so many words to mean one thing on the spot, or younger peoplenot really any pros I can think of because its basically just scribblenauts unlimited's graphics, so go buy that instead. if you like warner bros stuff, it might be cool getting some jokes and stuff, but don't get it if you 'just like scribblenauts' like I did. Ehh..			"

												Was a fan of Scribblenauts Unlimited, so when I heard they were making a DC themed game, I preordered. Since then, I've played Unmasked many times, and until recently I hadn't played Unlimited in years. Unmasked is hands down the best DC game out there. While it doesn't have every DC Comics character (The Penny Plunder and James Gordon Jr. are two omissions that immediately come to mind), it has most of them. There’s some really obscure characters in here; RUU-9-2, Salamanca, Kritter, Dragon King, etc. You can use the Batcompter to get information on them at anytime, although some of their profiles are a bit odd. (Computo’s entry is clearly about his New 52 version, but the character himself looks like his Pre-52 incarnation) Admittedly, the story mode is a bit on the short side, but it’s enjoyable while it lasts. Everyone is in character and the dialogue is funny.  The choice of main villain is a bit uninspired, but he works as a main antagonist. The levels look amazing, and the backgrounds are extremely detailed. Maxwell has a ton of unlockable costumes based of DC characters that can give him their powers. For example,  the Flash costume increases his speed, the Orange Lantern costume causes the characters you kill to rise from the dead and fight for you, and the Scarecrow costume allows to use fear gas on enemies. One of the main parts of the  game is the Heroic Feats (randomly generated quests) that spawn in the levels (With the exception of the last one , the Batcave, and the Watchtower. These are both a blessing and a curse. My main issue with Scribblenauts Unlimited is that once I had gotten all the Starites, and had helped everyone, I was basically done the game. (There’s the Object Editor, but the Hero Creator in Unmasked is better.) There’s  not really much to do in Unlimited’s  levels once you’ve completed the story except find new ways to kill everyone in sight. Thanks to the Heroic Feats, there’s tons of stuff to do in Unmasked. Ok, so they are kind of repetitive at times, and I must question why a superhero needs to waste his time helping people with arcade games and capturing digital flags. However, there are plenty of situations where you help superheroes and fight super villains. If you bought the game to play superhero, or just mess around, you will have a great time. Heroes will ask you for weapons, ask you for help tracking down a villain, or ask you to join a team of heroes.  Often, hilarious situations happen. For example, it’s not uncommon to see a member of the Green Lantern  Corps asking for something to help them fly, or asking for a weapon. You will see villains like the Anti-Monitor mugging people with Christmas lights and fire hoses. There’s sometimes feats like “Make this urinal cake healthier” or “I’ve prepared this lovely ceiling fan, but have nobody to serve it to”. During one feat, I was baffled to see what appeared to be a bank riding in a car. It turns out that Catwoman had dropped the moneybag she was supposed to be stealing, and stole the ENTIRE BANK instead. I sometimes go back and forth between levels for hours just to see  what random things happen.The best and worst part however is that the Heroic Feats are messed up when it comes to spawning. If a hero or villain spawn near  each other, they will fight, no matter what. This can lead to mass destruction, a zombie plague infecting everything, or a massive battle going in the centre of the level. At one point, a hero vs. villain battle was rudely interrupted by a kid’s pet Basilisk falling from a building, landing by them, and turning everyone in the battle to stone. It makes the level feel alive, unlike Unlimited where once you help everyone, everyone just stands around waiting for you to do something. The bad part is that this can get annoying when you actually want to complete the heroic feats without interference. I’ve gotten instant rep when spawning too many times to count because some villain I was supposed to defeat had the bad luck of spawning near Batman. Or an angry villain destroyed the out of control car I was supposed to stop. Other times, I fail a heroic feat before I can even do anything. Several times I’ve spawned right by a car that runs someone over before I can even move my mouse. Or the person I was supposed to escort spawned by an hungry T-rex. The combat is a mix of good and bad as well. It works the same as in the other games, which makes sense. Watching heroes and villains battle is entraining, and sometimes I spend hours pitting characters against each other. But, I can’t help but feel that the combat could have used a revamp. The battles between characters with weapons and powers are the most enjoyable. When it’s a  battle between  ordinary humans, it’s a slap fight. Even if a character has a gun, they will often get as close to the enemy as possible before firing. Other characters are OP when it comes to fights, especially if they have poison powers. Tar Pit is the most OP,  due to being able to poison characters and set them on fire. He’s killed Darkseid, defeated the entire Justice League, and sent the Anti-Monitor in a comma.  He was not this powerful in the comics. There are also characters like “The Superman” or Match who don’t take damage from normal attacks unless you make them weak, or make them “Flaming Explosive”.On the other hand, other characters are underpowered. Captain Cold and several other cold themed villains have a useless gun that does nothing but go “ZOP!”  and freezes people for a millisecond. (Mr. Freeze has a much better gun) The Weather Wizard summons doves with his wand instead of changing the weather.One funny thing about combat is that characters don’t take friendly fire very well. A lot of the more powerful weapons are tough to aim, and you can hit the wrong person by accident. However, the AI considers anyone who hits them as an enemy. Quite often, after summoning the Green Lantern Corps or another team to help with a villain problem, the members would turn on each other in an unstoppable fit of rage. Another good and bad thing about the game is that it is quite buggy. Scribblenauts games have always had glitches. Due to the amount of possible interactions and combinations, it’s impossible for the Developers to  test everything. And with the randomized heroic feats, you are bound to run into plenty of odd things. Like the other Scribblenauts games, the glitches are minor, and won’t normally get in the way.There’s some funny stuff. If you spawn Solomon Grundy, then give him the adjectives “Flaming” and “Explosive”, he’ll fly across the screen in a massive line of explosions. If you are in his path, you end up stuck in a situation where the game thinks are you dead, but you aren’t, so you are stuck in what can only be called limbo. The AI isn’t too smart, leading to citizens killing themselves on dangerous objects like fire, or heroes trying to attack villains with a ceiling or floor in-between them. There are some bad ones though. Sometimes a story mission will just glitch up. You’ll be there but be unable to continue it. There are ways around this of course, but it’s still annoying. There’s  also some bugged characters. Richard Dragon and First Appearance Superboy are stuck in place when they spawn, unable to go in any direction.  I personally consider  Unmasked to be the best Scribblenauts game despite its flaws. There’s a lot more things to do then in the other games, the DC characters are well designed (with some exceptions), and there’s more replay value. However, it’s also a bit of a guilty pleasure, as part of the enjoyment comes from the bugs and the ridiculous heroic feats.  If you are a DC fan, or like Superhero games you should pick up this game. However, if you want a less crazy game, or are not interested in DC,  Scribblenauts Unlimited would be a better buy.  "

												I like Detectiv Comics. The story is okay, nothing good or bad. Gameplay is fine only a few German words i missed but for that the game has an epic lexic like the other part, only that this has extremly much DC persons too. The levels are mostly short, you get the stars very fast so the main game is really a bit to short. But for DC fans you can build a lot of fight, sure there movement isnt big and not really interesting. For me made this game 10 hours of fun, the many submissions need your brain and if you have challenges mode you get really to a little tough time sometimes. Get this game with a discount 50 % or higherI give this game 75 % and wish me 3rd game of Scribblenauts on Steam. Thx 4 Reading.			"

If that sounds like fun to you, then get this game.  If you have no idea what i'm talking about I would suggest getting Scribblenauts Unlimited instead.			"

												This is a very fun game to play. If you love comic based games then this is one of those games you should get. Not only will you team up with DC characters but you can also look up those same characters as well. And heck, discover all sorts of heroes and villains that many would simply not know that they existed in the comic-verse.And at certain points, you can play these side stories that devel into your favorite DC character. Granted it's not a lot. But by the end of it, you'll have some fun either way.Lastly, you can create your own character too and share it with other players through the Workshop which is pretty neat, seeing all the funny and cool created characters. I won't spoil the story, but I will talk about the mechanic of the game. Using the book to think out of situations which is a pretty interesting apporach. Granted you may have to think outside the box every now and then. But that is the beauty of this game. The game doesn't really punish you if you went all silly. Because obviously this game was made for fun and not to be taken seriously.			"

I know people beg to differ, but really, I don't care much for this game. I very much recommend the first Scribblenauts game, ""Scribblenauts Unlimited"".  "

Most games you use the tools the game has to solve a certain problem but in Scribblenauts Unmasked you create the tools and find different ways to solve a problem. With the nice, smooth graphics this game is great for all ages. Now with the story. The story is just like the Scribblenauts Unlimited we all know and love but in this you get to play with every single DC superhero and villian. Me being a great Scribblenauts fan and DC fan I found this game extremely entertaining. I would reccomend it 100%.			"

												As a big Scribblenauts fan since the original for the Nintendo DS, I looked forward to this game. Adding to the large dictionary the previous iterations had to offer, the developers add almost every DC character- an impressive acomplishment. You can still screw around in a sandbox world, just like in the previous games, writing anything. The only problem is that your sandbox doesn't save your progress when you exit, however, which can be annoying since there is already the manual option for resetting. A (somewhat) new feature was the hero creator. In short, it's Scribblenauts Unlimited's object editor in which you could edit any existing object, but with the ability to add super powers. Additionally, Unmasked introduced a combat system. Right clicking would activate your built in powers, or otherwise, a punch from your character. If you add more than one ability, it's kind of inconsistant on which ability will appear. Often times, my heat rays will shoot everything, and my green lantern punches were nowhere to be found. The superpowers are neat, but they feel difficult to use. Something I should also point out is that the charming Scribblenauts music from the previous games did not return. It was a bit depressing not to hear the familiar songs, but eventually you don't bother to really care about the music anyway. The puzzles in this game felt like a combination between the first Scribblenauts puzzles with Unlimited's puzzles. They aren't perfect though. After about two hours, you'll find the same recurring puzzles, which makes you want to stay in the sandbox batcave. The biggest problem though, is that sometimes, I could enter a world, let my character stand there, and immediately, somehow automatically get an achievement. You'll soon take notice that it's due to the puzzle givers intertwining paths, killing each other because ""Heroes V.S. Villains"". I understand the developers had put effort into keeping all the puzzle givers into one world, but it didn't end up working. Even though Scribblenauts may be losing its color, it's still a very unique game. Fighting with/against the DC characters in their adventures makes you want to read the comics.  In some ways, Scribblenauts Unmasked excelled in areas its predecessors could not handle. In other ways, this game went back some steps. Despite all this, it won't stop me from continuing to beat up Batman with my bare fists.			"

The only diffence is the addition of DC Universe objects, heroes and basically words (such as 'kryptonian').Pros:- New DC Universe content such as objects and missions- Updated animations- Added interactions with objectsCons:- Doesn't bring anything new aside from the DC content- Gets repetitive quickly- Limited DC content interactions; not as diverse as usual contentIf you've played Scribblenauts Unlimited before, don't expect much to change here. It's pretty much the same game with added content. It would be interesting at first but then you'll realize you're just playing the same game with an updated glossary. Still a pretty neat sequel though.			"

Its a perfect world full of perfect things from the DC universe,  along with creations from the bat computer's hero creator, like my Stephano and Stephano's Cutlass, this game is generally fun for all the ages, good with kids who like heros like super man and batman, good with kids who are creative. Let their imaginations fly! Soar! Just let it go up up and away with this game. I promise they should have atleast a bit of fun. Beyond the tutorial mission you can get really creative.  And it appears the dreaded DoppeGanger has appeared as well as so many DC villains and heros that Im not going to spoil any more.Rating: 130/100 (TEH BEST IMAGINATION GAME EVER)Rank: Elite Leader of Creativity.Worth: $45 (Game sells for around $20)			"

Aside from this it also has all of the fan favorite venues of the DC universe, add to that the limitless possibilities that the Scribblenauts series already offers and you have a really addicting game on your hands.

												This game is really good for young people who admire the DC Universe.  This game is cute and pretty fun to play.  Though if you're a gamer who wants action, you'll be saldy disapointed.  This is basically ""Scribblenauts Unlimited"" with DC Comics.  However, this game does have a fun hero creator where you can make your own hero or a hero that they didn't add in the game.  Trust me, there are some heroes and villains that were left out of the game.I hope this review will be beneficial to you.  Bye and happy gaming.			"

Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics AdventureI have finally earned my last achievement in this game :D and so I thought I should rate it :) I had finished the previous game Scribblenauts Unlimited here is the review :)  TheSlayerBaron's Scribblenauts Unlimited Review	 This game is still as amazing! except harder in some ways, if you are not very familiar with the DC Comics some of the game might go over your head, I myself know some but nowhere near the amount in this game, which might sound like a bad thing but I loved it! I learned about lots of new characters within the game database if you like Scribblenauts and like Superheroes you will love this, you get to create them use their powers and have a cute quirky storyline witch after you can still have loads of fun, let your creativity and imagination go wild :)  #TheSlayerBaron #Creativity #Imagination #Scribblenauts #ScribblenautsUnlimited #ScribblenautsUnmasked			"

												If Lego Batman 2 (maybe 3, haven't played it yet) and Scribblenauts had a baby, it'd be this. You get costumes of characters from the DC universe that allow you to imitate their powers (or use their weapons for characters with no superpowers) and make the world how you want. Want to ride the Flash and use him as your own taxi? Do itWant to spawn someone and then give them an adjective that contradicts their powers? Do itNeed a basic wiki for the DC universe? Use the BatcomputerWant to make your own superhero (or your own Amazo, that is)? Do itWant to give Batman his parents, then shoot them again? Do itWant to bring Superman's parents back and then shoot them with Kryptonite? Do itBasically you can do anything with the only limit being your creativity and knowledge of the DC Universe			"

												The game doesn't hold up to all the other games in the Scribblenauts trilogy. While it was fun overall, I never quite completed the game due to repetive puzzles, restrictions and frequnt crashes. Bad level design and a lack of features from the original Scribblenauts: Unlimited makes this title a huge step down. Puzzles are randomly selected, meaning on more than one occasion I have been given the same puzzle to complete, and the game seems to want to trick you into thinking that the game isn't linear by showing you multiple worlds from the map screen you can't unlock until you've solved enough puzzles. There are side missions thrown in, but overall the game is unstable and dissapointing. I tried to finish this one to the end, but by the 3rd crash on the very last level I was finished.			"

												As with most of the other Scribblenauts games, Scribblenauts Unmasked is a light-hearted, feel good game for all ages. For those new to the Scribblenauts franchise, essentially each game has you play as the lead Maxwell, who goes about solving problems and helping others by creating practically anything using his magical notebook, meaning that a mundane task of say knocking over a pile of bottles can be done with a more typical throw of a ball or perhaps by the use of something unorthodox like the shot of a battleship. In a nutshell, every Scribblenauts game uses this formula of requiring the player to creatively and often hilariously use their own preferred means of problem-solving a variety of different scenarios that warrant different kinds of thinking - which is awesome! This basically means that you can play and progress the way you want to, which feels rewarding for the player since it is because of your own imagination and thinking that got you past that particular level.Now, Scribblenauts Unmasked retains this same mentality, but admittedly pigeon-holds it. How Unmasked differentiates itself from the other games in the franchise is its introduction of DC-related items. As you can probably already assume from the screenshots and titlecard, Unmasked's story (without trying to give away too much) involves Maxwell helping out in the DC Universe. To anyone vaguely interested in DC, this concept sounds extremely great on paper, but in execution, it was a bit lackluster. Certainly, it was great to see familiar faces like Batman and Superman, to be introduced to more obscure characters, and to utilize both DC heroes and their gadgets to solve puzzles. However, the puzzles, or ""Heroic Feats,"" that we are supposed to solve are all extremely similar. They almost always involve you either destroying/killing something/someone, finding something for someone and returning it, or delivering stuff in some shape or form. Any other puzzles are unmemorable or are too easy to be worthy of any mention. Because of the similarity in all the puzzles, you end up just using the same methods of solving them, making optional puzzles something more of a chore/point farm than something I do out of just genuine interest. As well, there was little to no theming done for any of the locations. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, in each place you visited, e.g. the hospital, firehouse, art museum, etc., there were missions related or made sense in the context of each respective location, which helped with theming and immersion. I sadly found little of this in Unmasked. The optional Heroic Feats scattered around each location, and even the story missions specific to each location, were so similar that nothing really separated each location apart, aside from obvious things like aesthetics. What was frustrating was how the game put you into a position where you had to farm these optional puzzles, because unlocking other worlds required you to spend points, hence the puzzles being, as already mentioned, now a chore. It didn't even feel that fulfilling to unlock a new location for all you really did was do the exact same puzzles.Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to paint Scribblenauts Unmasked as a bad game, because it isn't. Despite these flaws, it's still fun and a feel-good experience, but it's definitely the weakest title released within the Scribblenauts franchise. If I could, I would give perhaps a sideways thumb, for I want to both recommend this game and not recommend this game, but to particular groups of people. I would only recommend Unmasked to specific demographics, namely to children/parents looking to buy their kid a light-hearted and fun game, fans or players who have already enjoyed other Scribblenauts games, and achievement hunters. Scribblenauts games are all easy to pick up and play and are games which can easily be enjoyed by all members of a family, which is why I'd recommend it to the former. For those already familiar with the series, while there are certainly those aforementioned flaws, Scribblenauts Unmasked retains enough of the original Scribblenauts formula to keep fans interested. And as for the latter, the achievements for this game are relatively easy - you should have both the story fully complete as well as unlock all the achievements within 6-8 hours. The demographic I wouldn't recommend this game too are those using this game as their entry into the Scribblenauts experience. In other words, if you are new to the Scribblenauts series, you should avoid this title as your first Scribblenauts game, because although Unmasked is still pretty fun, it doesn't do the franchise complete justice - try Scribblenauts Unlimited first. Whether or not you like Unlimited will help you in determining whether or not you'll like this game, because if you end up disliking Unlimited, you'll definitely be disliking Unmasked. I would also advise anyone and everyone looking to buy this game to get it on sale, for while it is still fun - it isn't up to par with the previous titles, and the whole game feels like it's just an expansion for Unlimited.Condensed review: Scribblenauts Unmasked is a fun game for any aged and kind of gamer, but is riddled with a number of glaring flaws that hinder it from being as great as the earlier released Scribblenauts game; Scribblenauts Unlimited. Grab it on sale, or get Scribblenauts Unlimited instead if new to the series.			"

And, while you progress through the story, you help out the people with their different problems and issues. Amazing game! Recommended!			"

												At first I was skeptical of this game.  Then I read online that it had virtually every DC character EVER MADE.  So next I tried to stump the game with an obscure character.  (In fact, one of the earlier Batman quests has him request an alternate universe version of himself - so I typed in ""Earth One Batman."" Instantly Batman shouted ""There Can Be Only One!"" and attacked him).  So I started with some easy ones.  Black Lantern is in the game.  As is every color of the spectrum of lanterns (even the Indigo Tribe).  I tried true identities (for example, I typed in ""Julian Day"" and the game automatically created Calendar Man).  I tried one-shot alternates like Red Son, Batman Year One, Dark Knight Returns ROBIN (the female one).  Then I looked at the dictionary of characters and noted that under the letter ""A"" there are 640 PAGES of characters. That's just for the letter A.My quest has been fruitless, but I am definitely recreating the Infinite Crisis battle with this.  Oh, and apparently you still have to find Starites.			"

												For fans of DCU this is a no brainier; with almost every character from the comics and steam workshop support you can play out some of your greatest imaginary battles and find out who would really win.  While this version might be shorter than Unlimited your mileage may vary depending on how much you explore.  Unmasked also introduces unlockables which can be bought with credits starites earned helping people.Now for the negative.  In this version when you spawn into an area all the tasks and characters in the level you help are automatically generated.  This can sometimes cause chaos when it begins with contradictory items with even some goals completing themself.  Some find this RNG element boring and repetitive as it takes away the unique feeling and creative design in every mission from the previous Scribblenauts but it is a trade off for replayability with new scenarios each time.

												I would most definetly reccomend this game.   Scribblenauts Unmasked is a great game for people who A, like DC Comics, B, want a game that isnt like others, and C, a game where you can create your ideas (Besides Little Big Planet, Minecraft or ROBLOX). The game is really fun and addicting. The create a hero thing is especially cool because you can create things that you have on your mind. It is a sequal from an already fun game, Scribblenauts. There is only two downsides to this one. In one and the original one you had a stamp limit for creating your own things. That really annoys me because I like to make detailed things but with the stamp limit it doesnt let me. If the make another Scribblenauts game they should get rid of the stamp limit. The other thing I like which is only on this game is when you are riding or using something that can attack, they can get destroyed. If they make another i would also like them to remove that. Scribblenauts Unmasked is an amazing game that only has a few flaws.			"

												You will get a lot of enjoyment out of this if you are a dedicated DC comic book nerd, giving you a sandbox with almost every character from DC history. Unfortunately this was done at the expense of challenge and length: the unlocked levels become progressively  smaller as you progress. The three intially available ones are probably the biggest, and they already aren't  what I'd call expansive. Each of the ten levels has one measly story mission through which they more or less handhold you with no real increase in difficulty. So it was most likely made with younger players in mind. "

 Positive + Just like the first game, the art style gives the game a cute unique look, with many characters and locales from the DC Comics universe being realised here+ Some gameplay elements (reduced reputation points on repeated words, and a bonus for DC Comics references) encourage you to be more creative with what you should create to solve problems. Negative - Again, the gameplay is very simple; unless you have little knowledge on the DC Comics universe, which may lead you to struggle through some of the tasks (though the game does provide a big database with all of the necessary knowledge you may need). NPCs randomly attacking you very often in some of the levels was also rather annoying when trying to accomplish some of the side missions- The game is noticeably shorter than the previous one (around 3 hours for the story, and another 2 hours to get 100%). The way progression is handled is also rather tedious, involving you completing random side missions until you gather enough reputation points; I feel the previous game’s mission structure was much better. Verdict “Not quite as intuitive or fun as before, Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure does still provide an enjoyable experience... just on a smaller scale. The use of DC Comics properties does breathe new life into the series, but also somewhat limits how you can play the game, with some tasks having odd solutions. Still a solid game nonetheless.” 7/10 TJBs   "

												Two of my many favorite things in one action packed video game: Scribblenauts and DC Heroes. The gameplay was repetitive at some points as I had to do the same heroic feats many times to get enough reputation to get through the whole story, which was the main negative for me in this game. I was looking the most forward to having the gameplay been approved from Scribblenauts : Unlimited, but it got worser in my opinion. The game overall was great because it was saved by its storyline, as it was interesting and long with many interactions with the DC heroes. Also, I enjoyed the bonus unlockables where background info was shown through stories of the main DC heroes. The game gived out another great moral, like all games should have and it was shown in the ""tearful"" ending animation where the main lesson of the whole story was that you should always forgive others even if they caused so much trouble to you for a long time because you will eventually see that they have feeling to.GG, 5th Cell and Warners Bros., hoping for a next installment to Scribblenauts coming to PC in the near future.-8/10 "

Another great thing is the creator, allowing you to make things from other objects and post them to the Workshop. I will list more good things below, and bad things too.Good:The object creatorSome/Most of the missionsHow you can spawn in some of the devs and see how they look as femalesthe comic book-styled cutscenes at the beginning and endBad:How certain adjectives give you 0 points in a questHow using the same object twice halves the points you get (but it's understandable and partially fair)SOME OF THE WORKSHOP CREATIONS! SOME LOOK LIKE THE CREATORS BARELY TRIED!And that's about it. I loved the game overall, and I will always enjoy playing as my custom avater, Deus Mex.Hope this review helped!			"

I chopped their heads, poisoned them, and threw them into a pit of lava.Overall? This is a really friendly game for kids to unleash their imagination. Buy this for your kids, you won't regret it.

												[Warning: There will be spoilers, continue at your own risk!] It was a really fun game and sets itself apart from all the other Scribblenaut games. It had a very interesting story that I found cute and funny at the same time. The ending however really pulls your feels. Especially if you played Super Scribblenauts since in the last level you go up against Doppelganger. This game continued on Doppelganger's story, showing that he was not really an evil version of Maxwell, but just a lost and lonely person who only need a friend...which is how Doppelily (Doppelganger's new sister, the doppelganger version of Lily) was created. The Doppelgangers remained in the DC universe to fix all the damage caused. That really pulled my feels, man! I rate this game 9.7/10 and I would (and will) play it over.			"

												A very OKAY game. Not as good as Unlimited by far, it seems a lot of the development time was spent making 80 different versions of Batman that you can spawn instead of the various challenges and actual gameplay. Most of it consists of ten or so focuses missions, which are similiar to the Starite misisons from Unlimited; somewhat scripted. Everything else is mini ""Spawn a thing"" or ""Do a thing"" missions to get bux to unlock outfits. You can beat the actual game in a hour and be left with nothing but the mediocore filler missions.If it's on sale for under ten, by all means. I wouldn't recommend it for anything higher. Get Unlimited instead.			"

												Scibblenauts, is a fun liitle toy to play. its a game of creating things to solve puzzles. The DC universe adds to the potental of the creativity. And having different puzzles each time you load into a level also adds potental. But dispite having more potental then predicesors I would have to say if your going to pick up a Sciblenauts game that Scibblenauts Unlimited is a much more enjoyable game because while the puzzles are the same every time, having a smaller pool of puzzles allowed for more interesting mechanics to the puzzles, Unmaked puzzles just don't feel as thought out.  And because of that I unfortinitly can not  recommend this game. Its fun, it has more items then Unlimited, but between this and Unlimited, Unlimited is a much better purchase. In either case both are better on PC then any console both because of having an actual keyboard to type, but because Steamworks adds a lot more items into the game that the console versions don't get, so though games like the Wii/WiiU versions have more items built in like Mario characters, but with Steamworks you can get those items anyways with someone having created them.Good game, pick it up if you played Unlimited all the way through and wanted more puzzles to solve, but otherwise pickup Unlimited instead.

												This game is waaaaaay to easy. All you do is do heroic deeds to earn rep points and you don't need that much to unlock many areas. There is also a narrow variety of missions, making this game a complete ripoff!			"

												This game is just dull. The story is boring, the missions have no real purpose and I think this is just a bad game. It's a cool concept, but not fun. The gloomy feel of the game along with the MANY quests just bores me.			"

												This game was alright, not bad but..not really what i was looking for. it felt more restrictive and you get TOLD what to do more then in Scribblenauts Unlimited. you would get intrupted while you tried to solve the mini quests to be asked if you were ready to move on, which is fine but i felt i had barely started in the area i was in.mostly though, the game just didn't feel like my cup of tea.

												I was told you could write anything and it will magically appear..i tried typing in a light saber to see if it might give me the one from star wars, it gave me a light colored saber sword. 10 / 10 would be decieved again. and i did, since i bought both this and unlimited. lolthe game is pretty ok if you have a big enough imagination. or if your mind hasn't been corrupted by the reality of our world. the darkness and despair that grips our society, slowly consuming our sanity until the only thing that makes you happy is seeing the suffering of other people. MERRY CHRISTMAS everybody. have a wonderful christmas, and a happy new year. i know i am.....................(all jokes aside, this is an ok game. i really need to brush up on the more unpopular dc heroes. can't keep using superman and flash to fight the battles for me)			"

												Scribblenauts Unmasked is a great game to play when bored even if you are not a hardcore DC fan. You play as a character called Maxwell who has a sisiter called Lily. They both love comics and use their minds to warp them in to Gotham City. From there they use their powers (being able to create anything) to assist their favorite DC characters.			"

												GAME BREAKER:I was enjoying this game until I had to get the last starite on the Wonder Woman mission. When Doppleganger and Cheetah Lady were to be teleported out nothing happened and controls were still locked for the cutscene. I tried this multiple times and still could not get the game to proceed ergo making it impossible to finish the game.I was looking foreward to playing this game for a long time so I'm very disappointed. While a compatability issue is possible, if it can happen to me it can happen to others.In short, buy at your own risk.UPDATE/WARNING:Do not use a custom avatar before completing the main storyline.I think it may have had something to do with using a custom avatar before completing the main storyline as the problem started soon after creating one. I cleared all the data and was able to finish the game after doing so. Still, it shouldn't have happned in the first place.With that aside I'll say it's a decent game otherwise.			"

												If you're wondering about playing this, I suggest you watch PewDiePie play it on YouTube. I'd have to say he does a good job showing how ridiculously awesome this game is. If you are a DC Comic fan - this game is a MUST for you. It literally has every DC character ever. I nerd out everytime I see a DC character I've never seen anywhere else except for the comics. Really, really cool game, brilliant too. The only bad thing I have to say is that I wish the story was a little more linear though.			"

												This game is surprisingly educational. You have to know how to read, write and spell to be successful in this game, and is aiding my son in those areas. You also have to understand the meaning and definitions behind words in order to succeed in the gameplay. I would reccomend this game for 8 years and older. Both kids and adults will enjoy this game.			"

												Game was interesting when it worked. Installed it again today after a new system build and the game lags terribly.System Specs:Windows 1032 GB RAMCore i5-6600K @3.50GHznVidia GeForce GTX 1080There's no reason I shouldn't be able to run Scribblenauts.... I can run other games just fine with much higher requirements.The menu gets about 10-15FPS with input lag and the game itself gets about 5fps with extreme input lag.If anyone has any solutions, please, I'm all ears!

												Creativity. This game does not push that really more than I feel like it should. They push your creativness into a jar and hold it above your head while punching you in the stomach for trying to reach and saying false courage like ""You can reach it go ahead try it again"". it's like living high school all over again. but other than bland random encounters and soft puzzles. I would recommend if your a very imaginative person, and a huge DC nerd. :3			"

												Eh it was fun, but way overpriced. Not much re-playability, and the puzzles are far to easy once you get the hang of things. The amount of content in terms of what you can summon is staggering, but it's more than undermined by the short story mode, lack of post story gameplay and less than well thought out play model. Pretty mediocre.			"

												as a scribblenauts fan i loved every single game before this. i loved the original. and when the sequel came out with adjectives, i was sooooooooooo exited. and when i found out about scribblenauts unlimited, i was hesitant but when i got it, i was not disapointed with the new added storyline and origins, i was happy and that was the best scribblenauts could get. when this game came out, i got aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnddddddd. it sucks. here is what i call the scribblenauts unmasked effect. the game ropes you in by adding DC superheros, villains, tools, worlds, and vehicles. (plus a hat for tf2 if you pre-ordered the game) you buy the game and it basicly just like a DLC for scribblenauts unlimited. you could just easily get scribblenauts unlimited and download some DC stuff. seriously just look at the workshop they have plenty of them! plus this game is buggy and constantly freezes in cutscenes (mostly in boss battles) i can't finish the final mission due too this bug. this game is borderlined. crap. just crap don't buy it. and i intend to never buy a scribblenauts game again.

												It's pretty much the same Scribblenauts game as the last few, nothing really majorly different is in this except from DC Comics characters.The map unlock system is flawed as well as towards the end you'll end up farming in O.A. and Central City as the majority of areas need Justice League rep, but the majority of the maps give Superman and Batman Rep.Also yet again the game suffers from heavily reusing scenarios endlessly, again with the usual ""I'm frozen, melt me!"", ""Devs need donuts!"" (Protip, use Doughnuts, the UK spelling of it to save a XP penalty). But now it's joined by the ""HAWKMAN IS A LAZY PLEB, GIVE HIM A FLYING MACHINE TO FLY WITH""Scribblenauts had good potential when it first game out, but they never really expanded upon it, sad really, as there are several unsupported concepts that would work well in this game, but just aren't programmed in.

												SPOILER FREEINTRO/SARCASM This game is not fun.  I think it would be great for kids just learning how to read (as long as they stay away from browser history, I think that is a very good thing).  This game is meant for super-hero fan boys, and you know they type! Let me explain… let’s say you take a HUGE crap and then shape it into the bat-symbol & clam it to be a chocolate bar… A fan boy would buy it for an excessive amount of money and after taking a bite would clam it to be the best chocolate bar of all time without critical thought.CON:-Every level forces you to replay it.  They are so small and honestly not that fun the first time you play it.  How small… You can transverse the level in less than 50 seconds and see everything each worlds has to offer. - Puzzles seem to be more repetitive than fun.  The game feels like work. - Levels tend to be so lame that even you’re in-game sister will interrupt your “free-romming,” every 5 seconds to annoy the you by asking you to leave a map, because even she thinks this game sucks.  She is like that girl you know that will not stop talking but has nothing relevant to say.  She also makes me think this game is sexist. - Game tends to use a lot of Zombification as game mechanic and it makes it more frustrating than fun.  - Combat is so terrible. You have to face the character your hitting, so if you use a keyboard to move.  Even then your allies get in the way and if you accidently hit them 1 freaken time they go Bat-SHHIT-CRAZY and attack you.  You will be like… Dude I just stood still and your literally ran into my fist.- There is no grey view of ethics of justice.   If you spawn Catwomen, she is considered to be a villain and will be attacked by heroes.  - They left Static Shock out of the game…  I assume it is because this game is full of sterotypes that make it Rasist, Sexist, and Homophobic.  Including one of the original created black superhero might be controversial… Sorry I think Feminist Frequency has brain-washed me into caring about such things… What is with feminist and Plaid shirts…Seriously, do you think they are like, “Hey this looks terrible, now people will take me seriously”.    - You cannot play as 60s Robin from that Adam West Days.  That guy had some serious bulges in his shorts. PRO-	Making random strangers get “pregnant” out of no-where. -	They have all my favorite obscure characters that you do not hear about too often. (Suicide Squad, Green Arrow, Deadman, the Question, PowerGirl Owlman and Plastic Man). -	The game even manages to include different versions of every character excluding Nazi Superman, which is probably a good thing.    PERSONALLY-	The game just too small, too short, and too easy.  This is the definition of a cash grab because it is low quality crap.  TIPSYou can use adjectives like FAST/Speedy & STRONG to get through the game quicker.  WHEN you accidently hit a dumbass allies: Use the adjective “Peaceful OR Happy.”  My preference is to just kill the F@#$ and then respond someone cooler. Use your Keyboard to move; otherwise you are more likely to hit allies.It is a good thing that Fan-boys love chocolate (I sell a special one of a kind batman chocolate so send me money!!!!)You can make your own hero costumes.  I like playing as the Ambiguously Gay Duo.   "

												Oh boy... this game...Well, just to start off, it's not a terrible game. But it's not very good, either.One of the new things they advertise that this game comes with is a random mission generator. The idea of this is there's supposed to be an infinite number of missions, but in truth, there are only, like, 12, each with slight variations -- despite what the devs think, simply replacing ""Item A"" with ""Item B"" only rarely causes an actual change a mission. Beyond that, most of the missions are based on combat and other action-y things. If you've played any previous Scribblenauts games, you'd know why this is a bad thing - Scribblenaut's is at it's funnest when you're allowed to let your imagination run free, but that's not really an option when it comes to fighting -- it just comes down to ""Summon a new weapon or superhero, wait till either you kill them or the weapon/hero breaks, rinse and repeat.""The story's not that great, either. Granted, I wasn't expecting it to be great, but if you're buying this because you think the DC influence will lead to an interesting and engaging story-line, well, then this will disappoint.Now, this game does have its cool parts. The fact that it makes you constantly come up with new items in a mission is a cool idea. The special conditions that rarely apply when you approach a new area is a cool feature.But overall, this game is not very good, and if you want a fun Scribblenauts game, I'd recommend the infinitely more polished and well done Scribblenauts Unlimited.

												Although having barely any hours into this game, I can't help but feel like this game is not worthy of being a game under the Scribblenauts franchise. What this game is a Scribblenauts and DC Universe mashup that contains both heroes, villains, and Maxwell & Lilly (The protaganists of Scribblenauts) all in one game. The story is Maxwell and Lilly travelling to the DC universe after losing the starites that allowed them to get there in the first place, but the villains have claimed them as their own and are using to them to benefit themselves. You have your story missions that take you five minutes to complete in which you create roughly three things and the conversations take over the entire duration of a mission. All missions are not unlocked up front, you have to get reputation to purchase areas for you to explore, but this is a poorly executed idea.The quests are extremely repetative & it bored me out of my mind by doing the same thing over and over again just so I could progress with the story. The person who thought that you shouldn't be able to use the same two words in the same area needs to be FIRED. This just toys with the experience and it doesn't take long before you rip out your hair trying to think of a new word for dead. You can also purchase costumes that add ♥♥♥♥-all to the game & origin missio...FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKES. Stop with the origins! The movies, the video games (most, anyway) just are trying to tack on entertainment value but they cost alot of reputation and after 30 minutes of playing you really begin to wonder what you are doing with your life and just want to give up and start your life again in China.If you are new to the series, just do yourself a favor and buy Scribblenauts: Unlimited. That game was alot more fun to play with and it doesn't get repeative to a such a quick extent as Unmasked does. Not saying that this game is completely awful, but it just doesn't seem worthy as Unlimited was.			"

												I can sum up my review in just five words. ""DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."" I can't even describe how unsatisfactory the first thirty minutes of game play had been for me... I feel like if I had been tricked into buying this game. Despite the use of the notebook, it shares none of the qualities Scribblenauts Ulimated possesses. There is very little freedom in the amount of words you can use in this version compared to Unlimated, and you're even punished if you want to use the same word more than once. It's... just... terrible. I'm so happy there's a refund option, because I will be able to get something that isn't this with what money I spent on it.			"

												I do not reccomend this game. This game attempted to put quality over quantity, but it failed at that! This game costs too much. And it's VERY SHORT! I beat the game in less than a day. Like, 3 hours. It took about 3 hours to beat the game. It tries to make up with randomized puzzles, but all that changes is the object and the character in the puzzle. It took me an hour or two to have known how to solve every puzzle. I do not reccomend it! However, for $14, it might be worth it, just slightly. Not reccomended. Have a great day C:			"

After all the diologe and the fight breaks out i am unable to move and so is doppleganger. all that happens is you watch Batman and Joker fight. At first I thought ""Oh, I just got to wait until there done,"" but no the fight can go on forever if you do nothing wich is the ONLY thing I CAN do.

												How can something be so bad when you take a good licence and a funny universe (DC). I played unlimited, and it was a lot of fun, so when I found Unmasked that included the DC universe, I was convinced before trying. First meeting was batman, I thought I was about to start something very good... But the problems started. First, the mission system is definitely not well established. They tried to create a randomization system, so that you can have countless missions. I don't know if I have very bad luck, or if it is a bad coding, but I ALWAYS have the same, and they are pain to complete. Then there is the map, one per hero, and too few heros included in the scenario. Compared to the last game where you had lots and lots, you end up having gotham, metropolis, and atlantis... and almost nothing else. Last but not least, the cinematic system. If you fail a campain mission, it has to start all over again (ok that's fair) but you also have to watch and read all of the introduction from its beginning. Damn that's a pain because they are so slow. And the worst part is that they crash sometimes. Between two dialogs, it stops, and you only can watch your characters gazing at each other, with as only option ""restart the mission"" (and endure the cinematics again). Difficulty is unbalanced, the game is short, and uninspired. It was one of my greatest deception through every steam games I have.			"

												Coming from Scribblenauts Unlimited, I was expecting this to be the same old, qwerky fun and style which its older brother had left behind, however this fell short of that and turned out to be quite a disappointment. Although this is supposed to be integrated into the DC Universe, this has also adopted many new game mechanics and a completely different art style, which makes Maxwell look like he's on drugs... Anyway back to the mechanics, there has been a new system in which you cannot repeat the same word or you'll lose some 'Superhero Points', which I honestly do not know or care for. This introduces a completely unnecessary learning curve for younger Scribblenaut players and ruins the fun for people who like mucking around. Like, I'm all for a good challenge and all, but you don't really expect this to be for hardcore gamers right? Next time, play your cards like CoD and stick with what works to keep your fans happy.

												This game bored me.I was quite exciting by scribblenauts when it first came about, the hypes were high and so was my expectation though I haven't the time to try the game for myself.When Scribblenaut pops up on the weekend deals, I quickly grabbed the game with great excitement.A few hours into the gae, I find myself falling half asleep. The vocabulary library provided barely tug at my imaginations, my carefully crafted words often goes unrecognized by the game's limited understanding of how things should diverge as I see no reason why a marshmellow laser porcupine starship shouldn't be a thing.Words aside, I'll still be plenty happy if the game was well made. The controls were horrible and unresponsive, there is a slight moment's pause after each command, lending to my frustrations.There are no merits I can wholeheartedly give the game and with every second I see the game's title on my purchased games list, my heart aches with regrets and humility.

												Probably the weakest iteration of the Scribblenauts franchise yet.Sure, it's nice to be able to create your own freak of nature of your favourite DCU character. Unfortunately, whatever fun Scribblenauts has falls short due to a very short campaign, and the randomly spawned puzzles lose their appeal rapidly.My final verdict: Just buy Scribblenauts Unlimited instead.

												I liked Scribblenauts Unlimited a lot, so combining that with memorable DC Comics characters seemed like a kinda cool idea at first. While the game does kinda deliver on the DC part with a load of characters, it seems to have gone at the cost of anything else. There wasn't much of a desire to toy around in this game, since using regular objects on DC characters feels kinda flat, in fact, I think I saw less regular objects than the last game, but I could be wrong on that. The missions of sorts seem cool at first, helping heroes fight their respective villains, but it feels very linear and forced, with the actual solutions being so specific that I was forced to go for the straightforward boring options. This game also seems to have more of a story, but it just feels like a bad fanfic and is an excuse to have way too many unskippable exposition cutscenes. I completely lost interest after playing Metropolis for a bit. If you are a big fan of either Scribblenauts or DC you might want to check this out for yourself, but for anyone else this is a definite skip. Get Scribblenauts Unlimited if you like the concept.

												There isn't much to say about this game. It is very much more of the same from the previous Scribblenauts game. The only thing different this time is story line now includes super-heroes.You can ""draw"" your favorite heroes and have them join in on the action whenever you want. Each hero has multiple different costumes from their own comics which adds to the variety in the gameplay.I couldn't quite get into this game very easily however, the story seemed very bland and not interesting. The side quests which were available were also all very samey. I suppose I am probably in the wrong age bracket for this sort of game, the younger audience may appreciate this more.The graphics keep to the same colorful playful style as with the other games in the series. Plenty of customization is available through creating your own heroes and sharing them through Steam Works.If you are a fan of the series or want to try something a little bit quirky and different, definitely check this out. However at full price, I wouldn't purchase this title, Scribblenauts Unlimited is for sure the better of the two on Steam.			"

												6/10As a fan of the Scribblenauts series, I can't help but feel that this game is a bit of a let-down. It's not so much the setting, as the DC universe freshens things up and actually gives the game a focus and plot. However, the reality is that the combat focus on much of the game makes this a bit less enjoyable, particularly when adjectives don't work the way you think they should.It's Scribblenauts, so it's fun, but it's definitely not a full-price game unless you're a comic junkie. Yes, the superhero specific puzzles are definitely beatable without too much lore-specific knowledge, but at the same time, you're probably not going to have the same ""OOOH!"" factor as a comic book afficionado.On sale, this is a no brainer, particularly if you're a Scribblenauts fan. If you're new to the series as a whole though, there's better titles in the series to get your introduction. "

												I created a machine gun that is as heavy as a skyscraper, and if caught on fire, creates a nuclear explosion. It Also has a bucket head and bunny slippers. 12/10.But seriously though, this game is actually a lot of fun. It may seem childish at first, seeing as it's just a cartoon character who smiles all the time and runs around helping people, but in the first 10 minutes of playing, I stole a police officers gun and started shooting everyone in sight. I created a mecha robot T-Rex and startd to attack the villans Joker and Deadshot at the same time. I kicked enemies into the ocean, and then spawned a massive shark into the water to finish off the job. This game is full of imagination and extreme possibilities. This version is connected to the unlimited version, and I suggest playing that one first. I jumped straight into Unmasked because I love the DC comic Superheros and was sold on the idea of playing a game with all the characters. It really does test your imaginiation and creativity. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. Especially for five dollars. Get it while it's cheap. Because it's worth it.			"

												by far one of the coolest games i've ever played. not only does it expand scribblenauts but it captures everything that is awesome from the dc universe as well. And if you spot something that is not there they have a hero creator that you can make pretty much anything if your willng to put in the time. Definitely worth more than 20 bucks. When can we get some more scribblenauts?please....			"

												I recomend this game for fans of the scribblenauts series and superhero fans.Its a little short but its randomized challenges provide unlimited gameplay.for superhero fans It has a large variety of dc comics characters with bios included.As A long time scribblenauts fan I was sceptical about this game but I now believe it is one of the best games in the series.(and I for one am very happy to see douppleganger offically estabished as a charecter.)

												This is a neat little game set in the DCU where can manipulate people and objects with near omnipotence. The game is about a kid with a magic note book and his sister trying to get home, inorder to do so they must help DC's superheros over come villains aided by someone with the same powers as yourself. I bought this rather than the first game since it's set in the DCU, so I can't compare it to the original. I picked this up on a steam sale, which is where I recommend you buy it.Pros: simple lighthearted fun, plenty of material and details for DC fans, the ability to mess with things like your mr mxyzptlkCons: poor mouse controls, grinding to pad out the game,  overly scripted boss fights, occasional glitches/bugsThe drawbacks to this game are that the mouse is sluggish, this can be a problem when you're trying to click items in the game. This is not a game breaker by any means, and the game is easy anyway, but its an annoyance when you first start the game. Another problem is that new missions are unlocked by in game points rather than beating prequesite missions meaning that you may have to grind them with sidequests late game. The side missions are really where the game shines because you can get creative and/or fail them without consequence Boss fights mostly feel like their holding your hand and telling you exactly what to do which can be annoying since you want to get creative. I undersand this is for kids, but a higher difficuluty for adults would be appreciated. I've found one mission where the game doesn't give you back control unless you mash enter and/or space, reading the forums alot of other people also have this problem.All and all I would recommend buying it, though for me it's not worth $30 US(that said I'm on a budget so decide for yourself if you want to pay full price) It's a neat little game that rewards creativity and experimentation. Despite it's flaws the game is definitely worth checking out.			"

This game has more freedom than most of the other scribblenauts games I've played and the object editor was a huge plus. It was fun to cutomize new characters with different outfits and superpowers, there were so many options, even a "" giant panda with a fex that had snow around it and could throw a green lantern punch"" :P Highly recommend this game to anyone who liked the previous scribblenauts titles :)			"

												After playing the first Scribblenauts game, I went into this with high hopes. Hopes that the game really didn't live up to. The levels are a pain to get around in, and some of them outright require flying, which is just annoying to have to reenable over and over again. The puzzles themselves really just seems overly repetitive, and it didn't feel like there was as much creativity involved in them.In the first, areas could be cleared, whereas here there's a boss fight (these were rarely terribly interesting) but every time you visit a level it will be filled with a new set of randomly selected puzzles. It meant that I didn't really feel like it had the neat theming that was present in the first game. It also meant that having to clear out these smaller puzzles just felt repetitive and uninteresting.Finally, the superhero element, while neat in some situations, largely just meant that there was a whole bunch of repetitively high powered foes and at a certain point, it just became frustating enough that my solution to every indication of violence was ""Green lantern corps"", which would bring in like 10 heroes at once. At least that made the achievement for 150 green lantern members happen faster.The game should feel fun, and it just really, didn't.			"

												This game's extensive collection of DC's characters includes, well... just about all of them, ranging from characters you've probably never heard of even if you do dabble in DC comics to dozens of variations of characters of the more popular heros, like Batman and Superman. For me, this game is worth it for the enjoyment of seeing all these characters in one place alone, but that's not all this game has going for it.This scribblenauts game is different from the others because of the new approach it takes towards gameplay. The game encourages continued creativity throughout levels by reducing the rewards you receive from repeated use of them in an area. And while it doesn't punish you for not having a large vocabulary, you won't be able to 100% this game by reusing the same dozen words in every level. You'll even be penalized for certain word choices (i.e. Invincible) if only some of DC's writers were held to the same standard.Another change is the combat in this game. I often felt that the fighting in other scribblenauts games was a clumsy mess, which often lead to me opting for the non-violent solution. No more will you be forced to join the pacifist ranks with the likes of that vegetarian Gandhi. You'll be able to cross swords with the best of them. But watch out, because weapons have durability now as well, so feel free to visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_weapons for some ideas.			"

												As someone who adored Unlimited (and before someone comments calling me a dirty pirate as I dont own the game, I used to have family sharing with someone who did), I honestly think this game was not intended for those who like Scribblenauts as much, but moreso a game for DC fans to drool over. The big problem this game has is that Unlimited had set puzzles to do which were all unique, whereas this game tries to add replayability by renewing the puzzles everytime you restart the level, but almost everytime you refresh, the puzzles will just be repeats. That's their excuse for having less levels and having to unlock them with in-game currencies. I know the original DS game(s) did the ""unlock with in game currency"" thing for level sets, but the structure of the game was completely different (although it did have the same premise - type words, answer puzzles) so it worked. Worst part is, I'll still play this through because I liked the rest of the series so much.			"

												A pretty fun game, especially so if you're a DC Comics fan. There's a ton of fanservice packed into the game, and nearly every character from the comics is included. If you're not a DC Comics fan, the game is still enjoyable, but a lot of the references will likely fly over your head. Nonetheless, the game is still a lot of fun, and I reccommend giving it a try.			"

												Overall 8.5/10.To enjoy the bulk of the game you MUST be a DC fan or have to at least know about the""darkest night"" and new 52 reboot. Other than that, its a very good KIDS game. Dont come expecting some huge plot or dark story... but I will say that this is a good way to get a kid to think creatively. Art is clean, music gets a bit repetative but just enough to get through the game.If you ever feel like seeing a Growing hippy superfast batgirl fighting a silly pink slowed joker ...or something along those lines, this game is for you.Also 40/40 achievements for you chieve hunters! :P			"

												Of course, this game is mainly focused around the endeavours of Batman and his DC friends, yet this still far outclasses ordinary Scribblenauts in other terms as well. The scences, views and enviroments all seem much improved, and the graphics have improved. The unlimited possibilities of creativity are thoroughly pleasing and the whole art of spawning, mixing and discovering new objects and/or adjectives is fantastic. Even the Object/Hero Creator option allows for more imaginative designing and you can unlock superpowers/special abilities for your custom avatar too! I would reccommend it, but only to those who actually enjoy the puzzles and journeys of the Scribblenauts games.			"

												I honestly would not recomend scribblenauts unmasked which is realy a shame because the scribblenauts series is an excelent concept I enjoy. I spend most of my time in this game running around in free play doing dumb suff rather than having your favorite DC superheroes bark commands on how to help them fight in missions, afterwards you will enter a realy slow paced fight scene where you right stuff in your note book to help you. Than after you complete a misson, you relaize to play any other missions you have to collect points by helping random citizens in free play. I can see how many people can enjoy the thousands of combinations but I just bought because it was on sale and I believe I got my 2$ out of this game. So if I where you I wouldn't spend my 20$ on it			"

												Pasted from my Scribblenauts Unlimited review: ""So charming, and you're really only limited by your creativity (and the in-game dictionary very, very occasionally). Length could be stretched out a bit, but you could always reset the levels and set in-house restrictions on the puzzles*. Nonetheless, I loved this game.""In some ways, I enjoyed this game a bit more than the last. Despite not being a big superhero fan, seeing how the developers used each character was clever (not to mention genius implementation of a few of them and their powers). I'm a fan of the set pieces, and the game is charming as heck.With all of that said, I think I enjoyed Unlimited a tiny bit more. This could very well be because it felt like I had more freedom (perhaps due to the lack of a license, and therefore lack of corporate restrictions). More likely, because it was my first go with the Scribblenauts series. If Unmasked is your intro, there's a good chance you'll make a similar attachment.No matter what, this is a darn fine title -- an all-ages one to boot -- so give it a shot.			"

												I played through Scribblenauts Unlimited with my 3 year old and he enjoyed learning to spell various words. He was able to help with the challenges and we had a great experience playing it together. As we finished up Scribblenauts Unlimited he was excited about playing Scribblenauts Unmasked. If you're like me and played the first game with a young kid, I do not recommend this game. Many challenges start with your character being attacked before you even know what is going on, other challenges have confusing failure states where you will knock out or freeze a villain and the challenge will be failed or you will scare a villain and when he runs away he'll scare other characters and break another challenge. It's a mess and it is not for someone who is playing with a kid or wants to take their time to think up solutions. If the hero action that disrupted the puzzle challenges was fun, I might still recommend this game for adults, but it is a mess. Characters fly around bumping into each other, attacks frequently harm bystanders, and heroes often behave like drunks at a tough man competition just punching away even if they have powers. I don't really know who this game would appeal to except maybe people who just want to see what DC characters would look like as Scribblenauts characters.Definitely do not buy, even on sale.			"

												I created a machine gun that is as heavy as a skyscraper, and if caught on fire, creates a nuclear explosion. It Also has a bucket head and bunny slippers. 12/10.But seriously though, this game is actually a lot of fun. It may seem childish at first, seeing as it's just a cartoon character who smiles all the time and runs around helping people, but in the first 10 minutes of playing, I stole a police officers gun and started shooting everyone in sight. I created a mecha robot T-Rex and startd to attack the villans Joker and Deadshot at the same time. I kicked enemies into the ocean, and then spawned a massive shark into the water to finish off the job. This game is full of imagination and extreme possibilities. This version is connected to the unlimited version, and I suggest playing that one first. I jumped straight into Unmasked because I love the DC comic Superheros and was sold on the idea of playing a game with all the characters. It really does test your imaginiation and creativity. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. Especially for five dollars. Get it while it's cheap. Because it's worth it.			"

												I used to play the original Scribblenauts on the DS during my linguisitics lectures. At the time you'd get a car, a rope, and a basket and solve every puzzle ever. Scribblenauts Unmasked ups the ante by sending you into the DC comic world of Superman, Batman and all the other super heroes you didn't know. The game consists of a series of puzzles in the form of distressed NPC's who need your help with their troubles. Instead of getting the star out of a tree, you're now trying to get the entire red lantarn corps out of a fortified tree hut by conjuring a different lantern corps of your own. Or you're trying to help superman overcome his nemesis Lex Luthor by giving Supes a lead armour and replacing Luthor's laser cannons with water pistols. Everything is doing overly simplistic and rather adorable, but it gets old quite fast.The big, narrative driven puzzles are amusing, but you need to unlock them by collecting enough points of a certain currency. This gets tedious fast because the payout is actually quite low and the controls are a bit iffy. You'll be grinding your way though menial tasks like giving musicians they instruments or by curing sick bear cubs of the flu. What you want to be doing is summoning 17 different versions of Superman and letting them duke it out over a sandwich. Still, it is a funny little game, but I cannot reccomend it at it's regular price point. Get it in a sale, and have a few laughs.			"

												Pros:- Great for fans of DC Comics- Has A LOT of characters - Literally EVERY location is a sandbox map where you can do whatever you want- Live out your ""Character"" vs ""Character"" fantasies - Good way to waste time when you're bored - Achievements are easy to obtain so the game is good for Achievement huntersCons:- The creators don't update the game and add more characters from the more recent comic books like Convergence, Earth 2 and Injustice- Some characters attack each other for no reason- Characters like Superman and Doomsday are invincible, but they shouldn't be. They are very durable, but should just have a lot of health because Doomsday/Superman could beat each other to death with nothing but fists. Some characters need some real adjustment with their health, endurance and attack power.  Should you get this game?If you are a hardcore DC fan like myself, probably not. You'd be disappointed by the limited character selection. The characters are so off balance and inaccurate battle wise it'd make you go crazy. If you are new to comic books or just want to play a scribblenauts game, sure go for it. The game is a good starting point for people to learn about existing big name characters in a broad sense. Overall, the game is okay, but with a few updates, it would be a REAL paradise for comicbook lovers.			"

												I ended up beating this game in 2 days, total about 10 hours. I now currently have 15 hours of gameplay. Scribblenauts: Unmasked is my favorite Scribblenauts game of all time. I like Scribblenauts games, but I could live without them. But this game, Scribblenauts: Unmasked, is an amazing game and good if you are looking for something without violence. If you want more action in a sandbox game, I reccomend some mods for Gmod, another great game and only $10.			"

												6/10As a fan of the Scribblenauts series, I can't help but feel that this game is a bit of a let-down. It's not so much the setting, as the DC universe freshens things up and actually gives the game a focus and plot. However, the reality is that the combat focus on much of the game makes this a bit less enjoyable, particularly when adjectives don't work the way you think they should.It's Scribblenauts, so it's fun, but it's definitely not a full-price game unless you're a comic junkie. Yes, the superhero specific puzzles are definitely beatable without too much lore-specific knowledge, but at the same time, you're probably not going to have the same ""OOOH!"" factor as a comic book afficionado.On sale, this is a no brainer, particularly if you're a Scribblenauts fan. If you're new to the series as a whole though, there's better titles in the series to get your introduction. "

												I honestly would not recomend scribblenauts unmasked which is realy a shame because the scribblenauts series is an excelent concept I enjoy. I spend most of my time in this game running around in free play doing dumb suff rather than having your favorite DC superheroes bark commands on how to help them fight in missions, afterwards you will enter a realy slow paced fight scene where you right stuff in your note book to help you. Than after you complete a misson, you relaize to play any other missions you have to collect points by helping random citizens in free play. I can see how many people can enjoy the thousands of combinations but I just bought because it was on sale and I believe I got my 2$ out of this game.

												A little directionless, but what it lacks in coherent structure it more than makes up for with charm. The style and art direction are fantastic! The characterisation of the DC roster is generally solid, if understandably 2D. It feels like the kind of simplicistic presentation that comes from love of the source material. In that sense, it could be seen as a less successful cousin to the LEGO games. The interface doesn't particularly lend itself to a PC, clearly being designed with a touchscreen in mind, but this only creates the smallest of irritations. The game is suitably slow-paced, so it never becomes genuinely problematic. A fun game, if lacking in depth.			"

												Of course, this game is mainly focused around the endeavours of Batman and his DC friends, yet this still far outclasses ordinary Scribblenauts in other terms as well. The scences, views and enviroments all seem much improved, and the graphics have improved. The unlimited possibilities of creativity are thoroughly pleasing and the whole art of spawning, mixing and discovering new objects and/or adjectives is fantastic. Even the Object/Hero Creator option allows for more imaginative designing and you can unlock superpowers/special abilities for your custom avatar too! I would reccommend it, but only to those who actually enjoy the puzzles and journeys of the Scribblenauts games.			"

												Overall 8.5/10.To enjoy the bulk of the game you MUST be a DC fan or have to at least know about the""darkest night"" and new 52 reboot. Other than that, its a very good KIDS game. Dont come expecting some huge plot or dark story... but I will say that this is a good way to get a kid to think creatively. Art is clean, music gets a bit repetative but just enough to get through the game.If you ever feel like seeing a Growing hippy superfast batgirl fighting a silly pink slowed joker ...or something along those lines, this game is for you.Also 40/40 achievements for you chieve hunters! :P			"

												A little directionless, but what it lacks in coherent structure it more than makes up for with charm. The style and art direction are fantastic! The characterisation of the DC roster is generally solid, if understandably 2D. It feels like the kind of simplicistic presentation that comes from love of the source material. In that sense, it could be seen as a less successful cousin to the LEGO games. The interface doesn't particularly lend itself to a PC, clearly being designed with a touchscreen in mind, but this only creates the smallest of irritations. The game is suitably slow-paced, so it never becomes genuinely problematic. A fun game, if lacking in depth.			"

												Pros: Another Scribblenauts game! If you're like me who just likes to get their hands on any Scribblenauts games it's fun. It has an interesting atmosphere to it and you can get really creative with the DC comics stuff, even has things you'd least likely expect it to have.An interesting little set of stories.Cons: Personally I don't like the way the camera is handled in this compared to Unlimited. Normally I use the right clicking to move the camera around, but for Unmasked, it's used to attack, so you gotta drag the cursor about. I have a tendency of doing this a lot on accident when I'm not trying to.Another thing is that it feels very limited to like Unmasked. You can't be quite as super creative with random stuff like in previous games.Overall, if you can overlook those little issues then it can be a fun game. I've had a blast sitting there trying to play guessing games with my husband and we laughing a bunch at some of the results we come up with.			"

												This game's extensive collection of DC's characters includes, well... just about all of them, ranging from characters you've probably never heard of even if you do dabble in DC comics to dozens of variations of characters of the more popular heros, like Batman and Superman. For me, this game is worth it for the enjoyment of seeing all these characters in one place alone, but that's not all this game has going for it.This scribblenauts game is different from the others because of the new approach it takes towards gameplay. The game encourages continued creativity throughout levels by reducing the rewards you receive from repeated use of them in an area. And while it doesn't punish you for not having a large vocabulary, you won't be able to 100% this game by reusing the same dozen words in every level. You'll even be penalized for certain word choices (i.e. Invincible) if only some of DC's writers were held to the same standard.Another change is the combat in this game. I often felt that the fighting in other scribblenauts games was a clumsy mess, which often lead to me opting for the non-violent solution. No more will you be forced to join the pacifist ranks with the likes of that vegetarian Gandhi. You'll be able to cross swords with the best of them. But watch out, because weapons have durability now as well, so feel free to visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_weapons for some ideas.			"

												It's a scribblenauts game. You can kind of tell what it'll be like just from looking at it. However, it's also fairly decent as a DC game, if you're into that kind of game. It has qutie a collection of available DC characters, pretty much any one you can think of. Even down to specific incarnations of the character. And if there's a character you want that isn't in the game, well...make it yourself. Or see if somebody else has. The game has workshop support, after all. The story's not exactly the best story that's ever been wrote, but, it is super-hero game directed at kids. I'd reccomend giving it a try if you like DC games and creating your own things. Though, after a while, the game DOES start to feel kind of...stale. Everything begins to become ""Been there, done that.""			"

												A splendid game ! A lot better than Scribblenauts Unlimited. What was supposed to be a game for kids, turns out to be a very entertaining and captivating game no matter the age. The game is limited only by your imagination. You can create almost anything, in any combination possible and sometimes even impossible. You can unlock costumes of superheroes or supervillains, which gives you superpowers, or different gadgets so you can become pretty badass. There are also a lot of side missions that can be refreshed so even after you finish the main story you still got things to do. The campain it's pretty long and sometimes challenging so you must be creative or a quick-thinking. The game itself it's very funny and the fact that you can create weapons using crazy combinations makes it even funnier. I would recommend this game anytime to anyone because it's a very pleasent experience and you won't get bored.Funniest♥♥♥♥♥♥I did in game : I rode a flying egg in gotham, cloning pidgeons to defeat my enemies, made water burn, killing bad guys with laser pie, I spread a plague of zombi to make people immortals instead of saving them.In Gotham I met a ""Cockatrice"" which laid an egg and enclosed into a ""Baby Bomb-Shooting Griffin"".

												It's a scribblenauts game. You can kind of tell what it'll be like just from looking at it. However, it's also fairly decent as a DC game, if you're into that kind of game. It has qutie a collection of available DC characters, pretty much any one you can think of. Even down to specific incarnations of the character. And if there's a character you want that isn't in the game, well...make it yourself. Or see if somebody else has. The game has workshop support, after all. The story's not exactly the best story that's ever been wrote, but, it is super-hero game directed at kids. I'd reccomend giving it a try if you like DC games and creating your own things. Though, after a while, the game DOES start to feel kind of...stale. Everything begins to become ""Been there, done that.""			"

												Pros: Another Scribblenauts game! If you're like me who just likes to get their hands on any Scribblenauts games it's fun. It has an interesting atmosphere to it and you can get really creative with the DC comics stuff, even has things you'd least likely expect it to have.An interesting little set of stories.Cons: Personally I don't like the way the camera is handled in this compared to Unlimited. Normally I use the right clicking to move the camera around, but for Unmasked, it's used to attack, so you gotta drag the cursor about. I have a tendency of doing this a lot on accident when I'm not trying to.Another thing is that it feels very limited to like Unmasked. You can't be quite as super creative with random stuff like in previous games.Overall, if you can overlook those little issues then it can be a fun game. I've had a blast sitting there trying to play guessing games with my husband and we laughing a bunch at some of the results we come up with.			"

												A pretty good game, worse than Unlimited in my opinion due to a weaker game progression and a lack of coherence. The DC world just feels too big compared to the length and depth of story, maps, and tasks. I saw the same tasks far too often and the whole ""creativity"" that scribblenauts feeds feels lacking in this rendition. It just feels like it could have used more time in the oven. Still a worthwhile game if you really liked Unlimited.			"

												A splendid game ! A lot better than Scribblenauts Unlimited. What was supposed to be a game for kids, turns out to be a very entertaining and captivating game no matter the age. The game is limited only by your imagination. You can create almost anything, in any combination possible and sometimes even impossible. You can unlock costumes of superheroes or supervillains, which gives you superpowers, or different gadgets so you can become pretty badass. There are also a lot of side missions that can be refreshed so even after you finish the main story you still got things to do. The campain it's pretty long and sometimes challenging so you must be creative or a quick-thinking. The game itself it's very funny and the fact that you can create weapons using crazy combinations makes it even funnier. I would recommend this game anytime to anyone because it's a very pleasent experience and you won't get bored.Funniest♥♥♥♥♥♥I did in game : I rode a flying egg in gotham, cloning pidgeons to defeat my enemies, made water burn, killing bad guys with laser pie, I spread a plague of zombi to make people immortals instead of saving them.In Gotham I met a ""Cockatrice"" which laid an egg and enclosed into a ""Baby Bomb-Shooting Griffin"".
