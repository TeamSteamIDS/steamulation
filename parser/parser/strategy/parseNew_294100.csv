Early Access Review
 I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far ...	So I had just established my young but promising new colony, Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ...). The basic needs were all covered, everyone had a nice place to sleep, decent clothing, enough to eat and time to relax. The people of Ashton were prosperous. They lived in harmony with nature and each other. Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans.Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe, the Pig Face Men, attacked the settlement, but the people of Ashton were safe, relying on the strength of their automated defence systems. And so the colony grew and I thought: This is it, I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours.As if ...Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature? I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists, most were friends and there even was a married couple, Tali and Waltz.The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent; the people relied mostly on their crops, eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g. old age or other animals), so the animal population in the near forests remained stable. So far so good. But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way. But then came the tortoise.	Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal. So Waltz has just grabbed it, when a tortoise nearby turned mad. I thought ok, those aren't that fast, Waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise.  Nope!	 I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak. Anyway, when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace. Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly. However, its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun. And so he came back home, injured but happy, that now there was even more meat than expected. But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving. The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves. The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker. If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs, that might had saved him, but you can't just amputate someones chest.At last he couldn't fight any longer, the infection overwhelmed him. Tali, his wife, carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus. The burial ceremony was heartbreaking. Everyone had come: Tali, his sister Julia, his friends Vas, Jones, Stephan, Boyd and Leia, Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2. In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband, brother and friend, before the people of Ashton went to bed. With Waltz dead or not, they had to cary on.But apparently it was all too much for Tali, not very surprising if you think about it. There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac. When the rest of the colony slept, she left her big and empty bed. Driven crazy by grief, she did the only thing able to ease her pain. She set the forest on fire. Finally, exhausted almost to unconciousness, she fell back into her bed again.While she slept, the others, waken by the crackling fire, desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings. But they simply weren't enough, they could either try to save the buildings or the forest, not both. Of course they tended to the buildings, to the food storage to be exact. However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest, completely sorrounding the settlement.In the end it was all too much.Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish, Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat. And then, when no hope was left, the gods, the ancestors, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in, heard their cries. Rain started falling down, putting out the fire. But it was too late. More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames. Vas, Stephan and Leia were unconcious. Julia was the only one still able to stand. She did what she could, but with all the medicine burned she had no chance. Leia died first, Vas second. This caused his wolf Nevile, who had been laying loyal by his side, to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end.Traumatised Julia, who managed to flee when Stephan was killed, wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton. Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere. All the food they stored for the winter was gone, the fields empty. With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse, Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings. She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it. So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked. With the solar panels a loss to the flames, the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath.12 / 10 - Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs; looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction ...).Thanks for reading if you made it this far :-)			"

								I'm not one to write reviews for games - especially games that are in early access. So, I'll classify RimWorld as a lifestyle instead of a game. I was an original kickstarter backer and have played this game (almost) daily for the last 3 years with an estimated 1000 hours of playtime (before the game was avaible on Steam). So yes, I'll recommend this game and give it a positive review. The best way that I can describe RimWorld is the aesthetics of Prison Architect mixed with elements of Dwarf Fortress set in a Firefly styled Universe. In it's heart, it's a colony simulation game where you take control of colonists who are on a planet away from ""civilization"". You make the decisions to equip, shelter, feed, and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions. Sure, the game is still in Early Access (Alpha 14 at the time of posting), but there are a ton of replayability and mechanics to learn as well as different difficulties and multiple AI types to ""guide"" your gameplay. The game is relatively bug free and nicely balanced in the vanilla game. The modding community is healthy and a lot of really solid mods have been released and updated.With that said, the game may be a little daunting for new players. There are a lot of elements and core mechanics to the game that take some time to learn. My suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes. When your colony dies, restart a new map and learn from your mistakes. Losing is fun.All in all, it's worth the $30 - even if $30 is expensive for an indie game. I mean, you can cure asthma by replacing a colonist's lungs. As I said before, I did purchase the game through kickstarter, but the developer added me to the game as a character - so I didn't technically get this game for free, but I did a bit of a bonus.

								Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.Really, what else do you need in a game?			"

								My Rimworld story: One day in my medium sized, seven person colony, we were attacked by raiders. I send my best gunman to deal with them, but one of my colonists was immediately shot, and incapacitated. The colony had a very good doctor, so I had the doctor drag him to the hospital to be treated. My other colonists mopped up the raiders and returned to work while my injured colonist recovered. He was in the hospital for days when I finally realized that he was shot through the spine, leaving him paralyzed. There is no current remedy for paralysis. He would be a reasonable drain on valuble resources, but I couldn't bring myself to euthanize him. So I gathered all the colonists into his wife's bedroom for a ceremony, in which my vegetized colonist was lowered into a cryostasis pod. Now he sleeps in a metal tube, next to his wife who didn't want to be apart from him, waiting for his fellow colonists to develop a remedy for his condition.10/10 Ludeon plz add mech suit for my sad vegetable. His cat misses him :(			"

								I had created a successful community that in it had two particular people. One was named Pidoux who was an amazing hunter and miner who happened to be gay. The other one was Jacob, a social person and doctor. Pidoux loved Jacob but Jacob was not interested. Everytime he passed by Jacob his heart would fluster, he would continue to confess his feelings only to be rejected.One faithful day, our settlement was attacked by a maddened elephant which tore Jacob's foot off. He was quickly operated on by one of our surgeons, but prayed before he was operated on. One operation later, Jacob was the owner of a peg leg. Everyone was asleep when he woke up, so he walked over to a comfy chair and meditated.Days after, we had decided to create a hosptial bed thanks to new research. Jacob was estatic to have such a great piece of equipment, but we had no steel.Pidoux, blinded by love, ran to a mountain and begun mining to find the precious resource. During the pouring rain, Pidoux hacked away, determined to impress his love. Suddently, rocks collapsed. Pidoux's body was not recovered, Jacob is staring at a completed empty hospital bed.

								I started quite innocently at a save, three wonderful colonists. Things were going well, I got some growth up and my happy colonists were making friends with the visitors. My farms were doing exeptionally well, and after not too long, I had over one thousand in Rice, Potatoes and corn. In addition to quite a lot of strawberries. All of this in my refridgerated room. I figured I didn't have to worry about food for a long while.I was wrong.I got the fine idea of buying a hen and a rooster from a traveller, thinking eggs would make some fine additions to my food storage. I made a barn and made sure all the animals had access to food.Focusing on other things, I completely forgot about the animals for a while. Until all of a sudden there were 30 chickens. I was a little shocked about the rate in which they'd grown, and started a hay farm to give them an alternate food source that didn't ruin me. This would all be good and dandy in no time. I was wrong.By the time I'd gotten the hay sowed and partially grown, I was down to less than 500 of all vegetables. And to top it off, a blight was around the corner and completely destroyed all my crops.I had to start over. Completely panicked, I slaughtered some chickens. At this point, it was 70+. So I figured taking 25 of them to the slaughterhouse would give me some time.I was very wrong. Desperately looking for a way out, I had to slaughter another 20 something chickens. Now they were approaching 70 again. I was just hoping for a caravan to show up so that I could sell some chickens and buy some veggies.I got some hay grown and decided to cut off the chickens access to all other food sources. Now they were getting past 80. But I had some hay, hoping it would work out, I kept at it. I didn't mind the chickens for a while, until I noticed that some of them were starving. By then, I'd gotten my veggie count back up a few hundreds. I let the chicken into my pantry. And forgot about it.Some time later and A LOT of chickens later, a caravan finally appear, so I figure, finally, time to sell some chickens. Let's check how many I've got. ♥♥♥♥ING 241 chickens is what I've got! And they've pretty much cleaned out all my food by this point. Angered and slightly panicked. I sell ALL the chickens. The caravan wanted them cheap, but I didn't care, I just wanted them gone. So, some 1600 Silver later, I happily decide that my days as a chicken farmer is over, And get four alpacas instead.I was delighted.Finally, no more chickens!The caravan takes on it's way and I go about my merry business of rebuilding my food stock. Until all of a sudden it pops up in the corner 'Chicken 13 has gotten food poisoning from rice'. Puzzled, I look over to the barn, and ♥♥♥♥ing sure enough, I have more chickens!It's at this point I remember, chickens lay eggs. The chickens I had before laid eggs, I ♥♥♥♥ing forgot to sell the eggs!So I go at it again, harvesting my hay crops early and locking them away from the food supply, mad at myself for forgetting the damned eggs. But these are just tiny little chickens. They don't lay eggs, yet. So I decided to let them live until they're adults so I can slaughter them for their meat. And I go about on my merry way.GUESS WHAT, CHICKENS LAY EGGS. And these started laying eggs because I forgot about them and they grew up! I got angry, because I could see where this was going. So I marked them all for slaughter and forcefed the eggs to my innocent settlers. They didn't like it very much, but I couldn't wait until the next caravan to come along.Now I don't run a chicken farm anymore. I will never get chickens again.I love alpacas.10/10 would do again.A perfect 5/7 score for keeping me entertained			"

								I enjoy Dwarf Fortress. But I felt disconnected with my dwarves. Honestly, 80 dwarves in one fort, and I'm supposed to care about how my Baron feels?Then I tried RimWorld. I got it October 20th of 2016. And. I pretty much played it for near 20 hour stretches. Until that Sunday night when I realized, ""I have work on Monday.""My first colony was thrown together in something of a huff as I didn't know what I was really doing, but the game is very straightforward so once I figured things out (and the ingame helper is a nice touch, Devs. Kudos), I was grooving.My two main colonists were a fighter and doctor, plus a crafter. They got along. All was well. Between the mining, expanding, animal taming, it all felt very easily managable. There were a few mistakes, but the colony thrived.Until he came along. The pyromaniac. He would occassionally start fires, usually after being rebuffed by the good female doctor who had her eyes on someone else. Often this would lead to him being arrested and thrown into a cell. If the fires were set away from the compound, then that was fine.It kept getting to the point everyone was tired of his abrasive attitude and having to put out his fires. Literally. His mood would always tank after the tribal and pirate raids, yet he seemed ecstatic when it came to lobbing his molotov cocktails at the would be attackers.Then IT landed. An AI Core. The crafter had gone out to retrieve something, and that triggered the core. Out slothed a slow moving, minigun armed slug. Everyone went on alert and was ready to fight, armed with the pistol, rifle, and knife that remained. The fighter died in a hail of bullets. He died. Blown literally into pieces infront of the good doctor. She went berserk, broken at the sight of her lover ripped to pieces. For all of the 5 seconds of rage the slug allowed before she was mowed down as well.The crafter turned tail and ran. Fear had overtaken him. He dashed into the recesses of the compound. The pyro had long since lost his mind, laughing and setting fires, about the colony, then in the compound. The first to burn up were the dearly dismembered lovers. The crafter tried to fight back the impending flames by was consumed.As the slug advanced, our moronic miscreant looked to the slug, then back to the flames... It was a simple choice in his mind. The loving, warm embrace of a firey death. The single thing he loved more than anything else in his life. A deep laugh emanting from the depth of his core as he leapt into the raging inferno..... Meanwhile I'm sitting here watching this all unfold sipping a red bull like, ""... THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME."" Rolled another colony and was up till 5:30am the next day still playing. This repeated ad nasuem all weekend in a variety of scenarios, now enabled by some mods, because hey, themed plays are fun. Especially the Cannibal Run. Oh man. That was... That was really bad.Then monday morning I show up to work looking like I'd been partying all weekend: ""Dude are you okay? You sound like♥♥♥♥♥♥ How much did you drink?"" ""... Rimworld."" ""Huh?"" ""... I was playing RimWorld. All weekend."" ""Oh. Is that a game?"" ""Yeah."" ""S'it any good?"" ""... Yes. Yes it is very good.""So that's my review of RimWorld. The first game I have played in the last 10 years that has managed to keep me up past 2am (when I usually pass out), through consecutive days without any pings of boredom or tedium. That hasn't happened in a very long time.Now if you'll excuse me? I have to plan out my Squirrel God playthrough. A mad human colonist with a bomb in his head, and ascetic tastes for squirrels. To raise them, to eat them, to create and command an army of them. And DEATH. DEATH TO ALL WHO OPPOSE US!! .... Maybe he'll let in the occassional boom rat. We'll see. Either way we're gonna have a lot of fun, am I right? :D			"

								This game is unreal. The stories and narratives that evolve as you play are endless. Let me tell you the story about Joe.Joe crash landed in a pod with two other survivors. Joe was not too bright, he loved to fight, and make art. That was all. He refused to cook. He refused to clean. He refused to haul things. He couldn't heal people. Joe was in his 80s. He was the only hunter in the colony. Time went on and the colony flourised. Stockpiles were high, foodstores were significant, many different varieties of meals and all were happy. Then the raiders hit. A significant force. Joe, being the only competent fighter, took to the fields. Frightened colonists in tow. The fight was fierce. Scouring the area, he discovered a couple of colonists were injured, he took them to their beds to die. There was nothing he could do for them, but offer them comfort in their final days as their conditions slowly worsened. Soon. Only Joe remained.Days and weeks passed. Winter, came and went. The stores of food were plentiful. To pass the time Joe created great works of art from the materials his dead too soon friends had gathered. Just an old man. Waiting to die. Making beautiful art.He made art that told the stories of his friends. Murals of beavers representing honesty. Frescos of winged marmots representing strength. He created art in rememberance. Suddenly. A call over the communications relay. Someone was in trouble. Looking for help. He offered assistance. Grabbed his weapons and charged outside. A young man, tribals on his heels. Joe charged. He slew bandits left and right. He cut them down like a man possessed. Til the arrow caught him. Then another. With one final swing of his mighty club. He took his attacker out. Fell to the ground. Dead. Joe may have died, but the colony lived on. The youth he rescued rebuilt. With Joes art, the only evidence of those who left it behind.This is just one of many different stories that happen in this game... This particular one took place over a year ago. There have been so many additions to it. So many great and wonderful things.			"

Ludeon, keep developing this and make it better and better. That said, I have to step away from it for the sake of my free time.EDIT: Though no one will see it, or cares, I felt the need to update this for the Wanderlust update. The game was addictive before, but this update cranks the addition up to 17. With the ability to expand to multiple settlements the game is just downright amazing.			"

								18:00 - I'll do another couple of minutes and then get something to eat.20:00 - Ok Just need to finish this off and I'll break for a few minutes.22:00 - Right now we're stable I can think about expanding again...00:00 - Did I remember to put defence turrets down?04:00 - Five more minutes08:00 - ""Hi boss, I'm really not feeling to good today, I think I'm coming down with something.  I'll take a day or two so I'm not contageous"".  Right just need to get some more resources in.......This game is deeply addictive.  I've racked up many sleepless nights trying to build the perfect colony and agonising over how best to keep everyone alive.  It's very possible to become attached to your colonists and find yourself reaching for the quick load when you lose one of them to bad luck, bad planning or just your own incompetence.Don't let the early access tag put you off.  The game is in a very solid and playable state and well worth the asking price I think.There are a huge range of mods which can keep the game as deep and varied as you desire but even without mods there are many, many hours of play time here.Pros:Simple to learn, much harder to master.Roguelike gameplay means it's very replayable.Cons:Risk of unemployment cused by non attendance at work.

								You've conquered colony building across the multiverse. You are a master of resource management. You are a trade mogul. A ruthless general. RimWorld doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥. You will fail, and you will reload at 4 am with your sickday alibi already planned. You tried to be clever. You made elaborate plans. You re-rolled colonists until your probability calculations made sense. And then you howled in anger as your fledgling ecosystem is left to be defended by the last man standing, a near-zealtous pacifist. You watch as the raiders free the prisoners and your final coward runs to the stockroom. ""Finally"", you sigh ""he's going to pick up a weapon and at least die on his feet.""When the raiders find him, he is calmly eating a simple food ration in the dark. They unceremoniously bonk your last colonist over the head, and drag him silently into the night. And as you are left staring at your motionless, dark tomb of a colony, the rain begins to fall. Your generator batteries catch fire, and your dreams, your plans, your efforts slowly burn to ashes. And in that moment, you have one singular thought burned across your mind; ""This is the best early access game I've ever played.""			"

								Our only doctor, aptly named Doctor, got a bad case of the Mondays and decided to take a walk while the colony's leader suffered from an extremely infected neck wound he had recieved defending the colony. Our leader struggled bravely but without medical care he died a painful labored death. Farter, our brave leader's dog, took this loss especially hard and lacked an emotional coping strategy. He tore out our cook Herman's throat out as he was preparing his famous boomalope casserole. Sprinkles, the custodian,  was the next to go. The dog found our one armed janitor enjoying a beer in the common room. Sprinkles defended himself admirably but all was in vain as there is no viable defense against a grief stricken canine. Farter ripped off Sprinkles' remaining arm and dutifully trudged outside. He found Doctor strolling amongst the palm fronds, feeling sorry for himself and presumeably writing weepy poetry about his trials and sorrows. Doctor pleaded his case to Farter. How could this dog not understand that the living room had been too dirty? THREE DIRT PILES IN THE LIVING ROOM!? How can he save lives if there are THREE DIRT PILES IN THE LIVING ROOM? What kind of kiddy pool operation would make a PROFESSIONAL work under conditions like that? Is it any wonder he had to get out of there and take a power jog? Surely, our great and brave leader would have understood, right? THREE DIRT PILES!Death did not come quickly for Dr. Doctor. The bite had crushed his spine and only after two hard days did he finally succumb to the elements and starvation.  As for Farter, his job was over. It was time to rest. His victories had come at too great a cost and the defensive wounds he had taken each battle were taking their toll. Farter limped his way back into the colony base, past Herman still bleeding out amongst his boomalope meat, over Sprinkles' now armless body, by his master's gangrenous corpse, through the three dirt piles and into the freezer. Farter laid down. His frozen body was the last they found, behind a crate of strawberries.Good boy, Farter. Good boy.			"

Early Access Review
								Do NOT be fooled by the ""Early Access"" header on this store page. This game has more content than most full releases.This is the ""Dwarf Fortress with a user-friendly interface"" that you've been waiting for your whole life. Let's get the flaws out of the way first, since those often have more of an impact on whether you buy than the pros:1. There is no Z-layer. You cannot dig downward or build upward. To be fair, this would be impractical for people in the situation the game's plot takes place in, but the Z-layer is a big part of Dwarf Fortress and certainly bears mentioning.2. The world is somewhat less complex than Dwarf Fortress. There are obviously no elves or vampires or demons. Enemies are limited to humans (tribal through futuristic) and robots.3. The graphics only get about a C+ or B- in the current state. It's reminiscent of Prison Architect but with slightly less polish. Excellent for an early access build, however.That said, I was a KickStarter backer and have at NO point been disappointed with the game's releases or pace of development. The game has never once crashed on me, even in the very first builds I played. There has been at least one update every month, sometimes multiple. Even the very first initial alpha build released was a fun game, albeit with very little content and that was only entertaining for a few hours, and there has been a massive amount of content added since then.Mod content is already available, and has been since a very early alpha build.If every KickStarter game got this good this quickly, Early Access wouldn't have the bad reputation it has today.Bottom line, if it looks like fun to you, it will be. This ""Early Access"" game is better than most indie game final builds. Tynan (the creator) could have easily sold it as ""Early Access"" last year, and the fact that he's waited this long says a lot about how he plans to approach development. He didn't go for the quick cash grab, and made sure to have a complete and entertaining product before he sought any money from non-KickStarter backers. I have a great deal of confidence that this game will continue to receive significant and exciting content development for a long time to come.			"

								Takuya wasn't anything special.He spent his days troubled and mostly upset, his outlook on life being rather bleak. The other colonists didn't really get on with Takuya, oftentimes picking on him and mocking his clothes. When not working on his favorite hobby (gardening), he would often be wandering around, taking in nature. He was also fond of the dog - Freud.Takuya struggled with mental health. On one occasion, he simply lost all faith: abandoning his clothes and food and taking to wandering the fields at night. The others didn't really pay it any mind.Takuya decided to start making sculptures after he regained his sanity. Although not of the highest quality, they were admirable. He named them after his fellow colonists, in the hope that he might make them happier about his existence. He managed the gardens for some time, keeping the crops and flowers in best condition. No one was ever without food when Takuya was there.One night, the colony was set upon by brigands. Being chased across the land, a criminal had arrived seeking asylum, with a raiding party at his heels. Takuya propsed to let him in, so they did.Much fighting ensued - many blows were dealt. Much of the base was damaged by fire, and the battle ravaged into the early morning. By breakfast, the field was littered with corpses.Takuya never finished his last, grand statue. The gardens which he once tended so dearly lay neglected; overgrown.In the corner of a fertile field where Takuya used to visit so often stands a quiet, unmarked grave.The grave of the lonely gardener, who never found his place.I never in my wildest dreams thought that a game like this could have such an impact. I often scoffed at survival games, assuming that they could never leave a meaningful impression.I'll never make that mistake again.			"

								From the very beginning, we had a dog; his name was Jed. Jed was loyal, he followed his daily master, retrieved resources and fiercely protected the survivors. Then came the battle, far larger than any previous ones. Those damned heathen barbarians with their clubs and bows. We shot and shot and shot, yet still they came. Until finally our fortifications were overrun. One of our number was surrounded, with no chance of running. Jed being the brave companion he was, rushed in to rescue the now prone survivor. He was a roaring fury of teeth. But damn them there were so many, and they set upon him with their clubs. We covered him as best we could and finally their spirit broke and they fled, cowards that they were. The man Jed had defended was still alive, barely. Next to him lay Jed. Fierce Jed, whimpering from his wounds, we brought him back to the compound, not the shed with the animals; no, he deserved better. The doctor treated him as best he could, and we went about the necessary tasks of repair an reclaimation. THe next morning, when most of the animals would normally go outside to graze, Jed was not with them. He lay, panting on the bed in the room we had constucted just for him in the night; his spine crushed from the clubs of the horde. He lay there looking up at us with happiness, and sorrow, he licked our hand when we put our hand on his head. Covering our eyes, we left his room and went to the prison cells. The attackers had swarmed in large numbers, so naturally our artillery and machine guns had wounded many, rather than kill. Of the initial 7, 3 had succumbed to their wounds in the night, as we did not have adequate beds for them all. As for the remaining 4, we had a decision to make. They were murderers all, and they had reveled in the blood they had spilled, at least while they were free. Now, as we approaced them, they were less certain when seeing the hard look in our eyes. Winter was approaching fast, and we were in no mood to share what food we had with their ilk. And then there was Jed. Jed who had been with us since our ship had crashed on this forsaken world. Jed who had done more than one could ever ask of any companion, human, animal or otherwise. Jed. Those prisoners did not survive another night. We burned their clothes, if one could call such scraps clothing. The next morning we came to Jed with a special meal. His last meal. In many heathen cultures among the stars, the blood and hearts of one's enemies is thought to give strength to he that consumes them. We supposed that is was a fitting end for the ones who had attacked us and broke our community. We gave Jed his peace that night as he slept, and from his pelt our tailor made a coat of insurpassable craftsmanship. It now has its own stand in our armory among our other great works, a reminder of a warrior, a friend, a good boy. The barbarians now come again, and we are waiting. 10/10 FOR JED!!!			"

Early Access Review
Welcome to your new home! Good luck not getting killed. RimWorld is a colony-builder/survival simulation game from one man dev team, Ludeon Studios. In RimWorld you're presented with a scenario and using the group of people and resources you get, your aim is to survive on a randomly generated rim world. There are three basic scenarios but the game has its own scenario editor as well as workshop support which helps contribute to the game's huge replay value. Your main goal in the game to research and build a spaceship capable of getting you off what is usually a very dangerous world.   One of the key parts of RimWorld's gameplay is its AI Storyteller feature, effectively one of two difficulty levels. Your choice of Storyteller dictates what kind of events you'll see in the game while a second, traditional difficulty level, decides how tough these events will be on your colony. The most common events include the Mad Animal event (an animal will become very aggressive and target your colonists) a Raid event where a local pirate faction will attack you as well as positive events such as Cargo Pod drops or Escape Pod drops. There are also several different environmental events which add a new level of challenge to the game. They range from Solar Flares which temporarily disable all of your colony's electronics to Toxic Fallouts which will cause a Toxic buildup in a colonist (which can be fatal) if they aren't indoors. You also have colonist mental break events which occur when a colonist's mood becomes very low and stays that way for a long period of time. Sometimes a colonist will simply lock themselves in a room but serious mental breaks can lead to going berserk in which case the colonist will become hostile. Your colonists can also randomly get serious diseases such as malaria or the plague as well as common illnesses which are usually caused by combat-inflicted injuries.  Depending on your Storyteller and difficulty level these events can be very difficult, and will often be the downfall of your colony. Surprisingly, this isn't at all frustrating, in fact what I enjoy the most about RimWorld is the stories you get from your playthroughs and the most interesting stories come from the death of your colony. In my second attempt at the game, one of four colonists and the pet dog were killed during a pirate raid. The colonist who had developed a bond with the dog became incredibly unhappy and went beserk. He was equipped with a rifle and easily took out the two remaining colonists while the pirates worked on destroying my power supply. When my beserk colonists finally went outside, the pirates turned their attention to the poor sod, they peppered him with bullets and carried him back to their base. With that my colony was destroyed.   Generally when I'm utterly destroyed in a game I get frustrated and take a break from it, not RimWorld. Each time I've lost a colony I've restarted instantly and the reason behind this is the replay value the game has. Even if you're playing the same scenario, the colonists you 'choose' (you have no customisation options but you can randomise to get a group of colonists you'd prefer) have a huge impact on how your game turns out and how you manage your colony, even if you build similar structures. Your colonists will have varying skill levels for the different types of work in the game. To some extent these are random but they're also dependent upon the colonist's background (type of childhood and profession) and the character's traits. A doctor or vet will always have a high medical skill level while a torturer or hunter will have a good melee skill level. Traits often have more of an indirect impact on the colonist's ability. A beautiful character will be better in social situations and a psychopath is incapable of social interaction and only cares about things that directly impact them.   Colonist traits also influences how characters interact with each other and what consequences those interactions will have. If a character with the beautiful or pretty trait attempts to romance another character it's far more likely that the character will be successful. This might not seem like an important gameplay feature but interaction with other characters is one of the main happiness modifiers. Anything from having a nice chat to making love with another colonist gives a bonus to happiness but getting rejected or being insulted will make the colonist unhappy for quite some time. There are of course plenty of other happiness modifiers. Taking part in social or recreational activities gives large boosts while executing an innocent prisoner or eating human flesh give massive negative modifiers. The severity of the modifier dictates the length of the modifier. Having a rough night's sleep on lasts until the next night while getting rejected can last for an in-game week. There is some balancing that needs to be done for some of the modifiers, the modifier for getting rejected is particularly lengthy.  Being a colony survival sim, building is obviously a very important part of the game. If you're familiar with Prison Architect then the building mechanics will be fairly easy to grasp. You'll be designing and ordering your colonists to build different structures as well as furniture for your colonists to use and enjoy as well as production items such as butcher tables, cooking tables and research benches. You'll also have zones at your disposal to help run your colony. You can set up stockpile zones (and choose what's stored in any given stockpile) for storing resources, growing zones to grow food and other useful crops such as a plants for herbal medicine and cotton to use in the production of clothes. One of the things that RimWorld is missing compared to similar games such as Gnomoria is RimWorld doesn't have Z Levels, I.e. the ability to build up or down, you're stuck on the ground floor. This isn't a huge issue as the maps are very large (depending on what size you pick) but it's still worth mentioning. Tynan Sylvester hasn't ruled out Z Levels being added in the future but it requires a lot of work and so if we do see it in RimWorld it’s a long way off.  Verdict  RimWorld is not only an excellent, highly entertaining colony sim, it's also one of the most polished and content rich Early Access games I've had the pleasure of playing. It may seem like its priced a little high but RimWorld is absolutely worth every penny.  Lone Ranger Reviews.  El K.			"

Early Access Review
								At the start of my game, I picked up a wanderer named Big. The man was a huge slab of muscle, and looked like the man who could get stuff done. Except... he couldn't. The poor guy was too clumsy for his own good, except when it came to his hands and his eyes. All he could do was be a warden, handle animals, hunt, and make art.When I first saw him I was horrified at how useless he seemed. I built a small shack into the mountain with a small carving bench for him to spend the rest of his days just to be rid of him. However, Jude saw something I didn't. She saw a man with a heart of gold, even if he wasn't the best or the brightest bulb of the bunch. They started hanging out, and eventually Big, or Jude (not entirely sure which) popped the question. Jude was my main gal, I had given her the best of the best, and she earned it. She did everything in the long hours of the night while everyone else slept, and only took her rest as everyone else woke up. But she seemed to do all their work by herself.Tragedy struck, raids happened, and soon enough there were just 4 people out of 8, in the dead of winter, forced to cannibalize those who fell in raids. However, even after being infected with Sensory Mechanites, forced to endure excruciating pain, and watch her friends die, Jude didn't break. She appreciated those nights with Big and the art he had made. The others did too, seeing hope in the art carved into grains of wood.Winter ended, things were looking good, until a raid blindsided them while Big was on a hunt (even though he wasn't able to lift the kill, his aim was great enough that he was the safest hunter). Big went down, but he was a fighter and held on. He watched as his friends, NO, his family held off the raiders with the help of turrets Jude had made. 1, 2 went down. The third decided to cut their losses and ran home, but not without grabbing Big first. The others fought to save him, but none could quite match his skill with a gun.The raiders called for a trade, silver for him. Sadly, they had just used the last of their silver to finish sterilizing the hospital floor. With heavy hearts, they were forced to decline the trade. Not even a day later, they got the news. Big died of infection from his injuries, not quite able to hold on as they scraped together every scrap of silver they could to try and save him.This was the tale of the witling watcher. (He usually carved in the prisoner room, and watched the prisoners while doing so.And thats the tale of how I save scummed for the first time ever for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pawn.EDIT:  Tacking this on since this kinda exploded. I never played pre-steam release, and went in blind. My best advice for new players is to do Casandra Rough with Permadeath. Your people WILL die, but this way you can figure out how to start instead of trying to fight an uphill battle. For those who are confused by the UI and how to use it, just experiment, try just double clicking stuff or just randomly hitting buttons, its much better to laugh at your own failure than to follow an online guide.

It made me realize that all I really want from life is to be a muffalo taming colonist, eating pemmican, repelling tribal raids and stomping my wooden foot to the rhythm of my prisoner's heartbeat while I harvest his organs to sell for silver.I'm also looking for a wife to take with me to the lands we're going to settle. Must be fine with being legless from time to time.Edit2: No worries, people, I'm still alive!... I think... Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?			"

								Ran a sweet little colony called 'Haven'. This random brawler joins us called Bowman, turns out he's awesome with a spear so I give him hunting duties. Bowman fearlessly defends the colony on several occasions from tribals and pirates. Anyway for some reason a bunch of beavers show up and start eating all the trees - this is unacceptable because wood is a key resource for me, so I dispatch Bowman to go and deal with them. The situation gets the better of him and unfortunately both his arms are torn off by beavers. I send another colonist out to go and rescue him and he's in a hospital bed just in time to save his life. This is annoying that I've now lost my best melee defender, but whatever I'll just buy some new arms for him and turn him into some sort of cyborg hunting machine.As luck would have it a passing trader just so happens to have a single bionic arm so I snap one up and schedule an operation to install it. My resident doctor (a criminal surgeon) is enjoying a few beers in the community centre and decides to head down to surgery because he's dedicated like that, and besides it's not like there's any laws on this planet against surgically installing bionic implants whilst under the influence.I watch the surgery progress with a bit of blood being splashed around but I have full confidence in my drunk, skill level 6 surgeon. But then things take a turn for a worse and I am notified that, regretably, Bowman has not survived the procedure. Devestated I go and inspect the colonists health panel and discover that my semi-competent, semi-sober surgeon has accidentally surgically removed his heart. I have never in my life laughed so hard whilst playing a computer game.Long story short, in the days preceeding a ton of pirates show up, kill the vast majority of my colonists, enslave the rest and then burn my colony to the ground. That in a nutshell is the story of 'Haven'.			"

								My Story....My top dog Rick, 14 shooting skill, 15 construction and a bunch of other high skills was the king of my colony, he built the entire place from nothing to the fortress it is today, every raid, he was at the forefront of battle destroying people with his sniper rifle, he was the rock everyone relied on.Then one day something terrible occurred...We had just decided to take in a new survivor who was being chased by 4 pirates, it was a tough fight but we won, Rick was the only one unharmed, as he was fixing up his fallen comrades we were struck by another raid so I had no choice but to take them on alone (there were 6 of them)Rick was hunkered down behind a wall just in-front of our compound, taking shots but nothing he can't handle. One of the other colonists was able to walk at this point so I got him to join the fight.In the heat of battle I forgot to check what weapon this guy was wielding, HUGE MISTAKE, he stood just behind rick as the remaining 3 raiders closed in, he then proceeded to throw a frag grenade which took 2 of the raiders out but also completely mangled Rick to pieces.I had to run back to the armory and grab a rifle while the remaining raider was smashing Ricks brains in, I came back and finished him off.Anyways Rick is now brain damaged, has no ears, no nose and only one leg.He has gone from being the Rock of my colony, the destroyer of raiders and the guy everyone turns to in times of need to now only just being able to manage the cleaning role.I thought about ending his life but I couldn't do it, it saddens me every-time I load the game up to see the strongest and most reliable member of my colony resorted to cleaning up dirt and needing to sleep more than half the day.I just hope and pray one day I can get him back to normal....

								Got a colony going after countless failures and got a bit lucky. Things are going good. Figured out how to prioritize, and they're working like a well-oiled machine together. Start to spruce up the place; colonists are not neutral, they are happy! They're liking their lives under my direction. A raid comes to assault my base - I send my best shooters out and they dispatch the offenders. I capture them, and lock them in prison. Start convincing them to join the cause. One converts. This is amazing. One left to go, a loner. Doesn't seem very receptive to the idea of joining us. A new love blossoms! While one gal keeps rejecting a fellow colonists' advances, one of my doctors successfully woos my lead surgeon. They are married in front of the pond, and they party and drink the night away. Prisoner still isn't taking to our recruitment pleas. Probably upset because the power has gone out, and I didn't priortize my colonists' job list to haul wood to the generator.Escape! Try to sweeten the pot for my prisoner by adding some sandstone tile. Fancy! As I'm building, my colonist is overpowered and the prisoner runs out the door. In an attempt to escape, he begins assaulting my surgeon, and phenomenal chef. Her husband takes him out and puts him back in his cell. Things are going well, and I've built up a stockpile. Everybody is wearing cowboy hats and dusters, they look like cowfolk. Poison ship lands near my base. What's a poison ship? It kills everything? I can't deconstruct it, and I can't shoot it. Hmm. Build a wall around it. Looks like the pollution is subsiding. Things are good.Fire! A lightning storm lights a blaze outside my home area. Oh well, it's so far away. Oh no, we have a serious problem! Half of the map is ablaze. Expand home area in a desperate effort to put it out. It is futile. My former prisoner-turned-colonist is surrounded by fire. I desperately order my colonists to extinguish the blaze near her. Rain! Oh, refreshing, fire-snuffing rain! Fire's out, but my colonist is hurt. Bad.  My surgeon takes her to the hospital, and tends to her wounds. 3 days later, she's still incapacitated. Check medical tab. Right leg ... BURNT OFF?!?My surgeon attempts to attach a peg leg. First operation is a complete failure. She's bleeding out! Tend to her wounds, and try again. Success! She's up and working again. My colonist finally succeeds in wooing another, and now I have two couples in my colony. Does this mean children?Dig out underground storage. It's nice and roomy. Install air conditioners, set for grain storage. It fills up fast. My farms are doing very well. Traders arrive. Trade a bunch of rice for some animals. Get another dog ... they mate! Yay, puppies on the way!Bugs form a nest inside. My surgeon falls in defense of her colony. Her husband puts her in the medical bed, and tends to her wounds. They are too great. She succombs. The entire colony is affected, with her husband taking it the hardest. He has a mental breakdown, strips naked, and wanders. The other colonists leave him be. Nobody is happy anymore. I am not happy anymore. Rest in peace, Myrna. 10/10, would be depressed again.			"

								The older I get, the less I like violent games. Instead, I find myself drawn to games I used to scoff at as a youngster: Simulations and city-builders. I have no explanation, honestly. One'd think that I'd be in love with shooters since adulthood has introduced me to whole new levels of disappointment and frustration, but, somehow... it has also been very pleasant. Maybe that's why I like to build and micro-manage. I don't know, man. What I do know: I like ""RimWorld"" a lot. It is a base-building game that is best described as an accessible ""Dwarf Fortress"". You guide a bunch of characters (e.g. space-farers who have crashed on an alien planet or a tribe already living there) and help them survive by building a base and managing food and energy sources. You have to trade with other settlements and spaceships that occasionally enter your orbit. You have to make sure your guys and girls are happy and productive, but you'll also have to fend off pirate raids - ""RimWorld"" is quite fierce if played on the higher difficulties. There's a lot of fighting, if you want it. For those of us who just want to relax and build - you can do so by choosing one of the lower difficulties. The game offers three different AIs that control the ""events"" which occasionally hassle your settlement (like raids, solar eclipses, meteorogical catastrophes etc.). Some of them are REALLY dangerous and can wipe out your base, if they catch you unprepared. Toxic Fallout, I'm looking at you. The AIs differ in their predictability and the severity of the events they choose to unleash.""RimWorld"" is quite complex, but perfectly accessible for anybody in my opinion. You don't have to be a simulation buff to play it. Then, again, if you are a buff, you might find ""RimWorld"" a bit underwhelming compared to ""Dwarf Fortress"", since it lacks Z-Levels (underground layers you can dig to and build on) and its multitude of creatures. After approx. 20 hours with ""RimWorld"", I find myself gravitating back towards ""Dwarf Fortress"" which I find beefier. However, ""RimWorld"" is by no means a bad game and I keep coming back to it. The developers have been updating it regularly and I hope they'll be adding some unexpected stuff soon. I propose magic flutes that let you guile tribesfolk into lethal traps.			"

								My first experience with RimWorld!  First hour of play Decided to start off by enabling permadeath mode, since I want my ♥♥♥♥-ups to actually punish me. Get 3 decent colonists, find a nice location, everything fine so far!   2nd hourGot a very primitive base set up, survived the first raid consisting of one drugged-up raider with a shoddy club. She was easily dispatched of. A 4th colonist named Donovan arrives, his skill in growing enables me to grow Healroot. This is looking better and better! 3rd hourA stockpile for food with proper refridgeration is set up, several workshops created, built a spacious rec-room with a chess and a billiards table and several plantpots, refurnished the bedrooms in order to increase their size due to complaints from colonists. First harvest of corn and potato is harvested and stockpiled, the colony can now survive the winter season. At this point and time I confident, my base defenses have been fortified and food is plentiful. Even managed to build a specific section for medical needs. As I am caught up in my planning for further expansion, I fail to notice a rogue boomrat that aparently snuck into my rec-room. This ♥♥♥♥ing rat is quite hungry aparently, as it collapses on the floor. Seconds later it dies in a decent-sized explosion that sends fire all across the room. Which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that my entire base is built out of wood. Panic spreads in the colony, only two colonists are able to fight fire and one of them quickly dies due to the house burning too fiercly. The other one retreats outside. The death of the first colonist, Collins, sends his trusty labrador into a rage-fit and the mongrel decides to attack my sleeping colonists. It shreds the throat of two colonists before it makes it's way outside, shame that those two were the only ones armed with guns. My last colonist manages to vanquish the foe before passing out due to her wounds.  4th hourMy last colonist is unconscious outside of the base, which now looks like a reinactment of a scene straight out of Dante's Inferno. A lonely raider decides to pop by, destroys the solar panels for some reason before he decides to kidnap my wounded colonist. He picks her up and runs away with her. And so ends the tale of New Haven, a mighty encampment defeated by a single hungry boomrat. I don't know if I should laugh or cry so I grab a beer and decide to create a new colony.TLDR: Don't let hungry boomrats into your base which is built out of wood, it will end in fiery doom and hilarity!100/10.

Early Access Review
The Short of It: Don’t let the Early Access tag put you off. RimWorld is as good as finished, but still expanding, and it's an engrossing and captivating colony sim, a labour of love that offers hours upon hours of playtime and is a must-buy for people who enjoy building a community from the ground up and watching it thrive in the face of adversity… or wither and die because of a few poor decisions.The Long of It: RimWorld puts the player in charge of a few crash-landed settlers, stranded on an unknown world after their ship crashed, because of course it did. After the player makes sure the colonists’ immediate needs are met, such as food and shelter, the real work commences, and in order for the colony to survive, it will have to evolve, expand and research, as well as trade with neighbouring settlements for the resources it desperately needs, or desperately defend against them.What sets RimWorld apart from other colony sims is its colonist system. Colonists are all unique, and the player will have to make sure to keep an eye on what they’re good at, what they like and don’t like, and which colonists need to be around – or avoid – each other. Occasionally, enemy factions will attempt to raid your settlement, and you will need to keep evolving in order to withstand their ever strengthening attacks. Meanwhile, your colonists will be busy crafting items, constructing buildings, tending to the animals, hewing stone, researching new technologies, sowing the fields, hauling lumber, and countless other tasks, which they execute more or less automatically according to the priorities you give them. A player who sets his priorities carefully, can take up a monitoring function as the colonists take care of everything that needs doing, if (s)he decides to.The Right of It: RimWorld has many very strong features, and one of them is the personalities it gives to your colonists. They are semi-randomly generated, with a diversity of looks, skills and traits, making them all unique and possessing an actual personality, and they develop social relations with other colonists, sometimes good, sometimes bad, and these social relations can lead everywhere from joining another colonist in marriage to starting a fistfight at someone else’s marriage. Keeping them all happy is involving without ever becoming a chore, and you just can’t help but care about every single one.RimWorld’s gameplay is very solid, and the priorities and areas function lets you automate work, but still gives you a lot of control, eliminating the tedious parts of managing a colony but keeping the interesting ones. You can manually command colonists whenever you want, or even take full control of them when you need to give them detailed orders, for instance when they need to defend against a raid. Even better, while RimWorld is by itself already very polished, the game is fully modular, with an active modding scene which constantly delivers all kinds of content, ranging from small quality-of-life tweaks to big content-adding mod packs. Another nice touch is that instead of simply choosing from a shortlist of cookie-cutter difficulty levels like “Easy, Medium, Hard”, RimWorld also offers you several narrators to choose from, who don’t really make the game harder or easier, but different. And yes, the narrators too, can be altered or expanded upon by mods. Tynan Sylvestre and Ludeon Studios regularly update the game, often incorporating mods or acknowledging their ideas and including them in the base game, and so far, it seems like the influx of content, both official and from the modding community, is showing no signs of stopping anytime soon.The Wrong of It: There is really very, very little that is wrong with RimWorld, but the one thing that I did notice was that in the late game, you’re often forced to remain mostly static as you wait for opportunities to get a hold of some of the resources you can’t grow or craft yourself, like plasteel and uranium, and that’s a bit of a shame. But honestly, even static time in RimWorld is enjoyable.The Last of It: RimWorld is well-deserving of all the gushing reviews. It’s one of those rare jewels: an indie game crafted by a developer who kept going strong and never lost interest in the project, made with pure love for the craft. It really is one of those games you sit down to play ‘just for a half hour’ and before you realize it, it’s three in the morning, your tea is cold and payment of your taxes is four weeks overdue.

								Take Dwarf Fortress and Banished, blend together until smooth.Spread liberally onto a thick slice of classic Lost in Space themes.Sprinkle lightly with Prison Architect, for flavor.Serve with a generous side of Spaghetti Western.Comes with an intriguing AI and hypnotic soundtrack.***  I've played Rimworld for many months in the pre-Steam alpha, and it's about as engrossing as they come. Can't recommend it highly enough; it's the game that makes losing fun!  ***			"

								Day 1 - Crashlanded on strange alien planet. Low expectations, tons of joy - this is looking up!Day 4 - We have individual bedrooms finally.

Thanks, crazy boar.Day 13 - Crazy boar ate Charolette.Day 24 - Traders stopped by, I bought all their food. Should probably figure out how to grow my own.Day 36 - Potatoes planted! Let's make this colony a town!Day 38 - We've struck compacted machinery! THAT MEANS SOLAR PANELS WHOOOOOOTTTTTDay 42 - Dave is much more chill thanks to the air conditioning.Day 56 - Dave is too chill, thanks to smokeleaf. Seriously, Dave, go sow the edible* crops this time.Day 62 - A neighboring faction stopped by with a few items to trade. Instead of buying their wares, I took them all hostage.

								Day 1 - Wick, Adam, & Amber are flung onto the unknown grasslands of a strange planet. Adam & Amber, being lovers, clutch on to one another for safety. Immediately all three, under the influence of a cursor, carve their way into a mountain that has only one entry point and make some beds from the poplar trees they found nearby. A stale survival meal gives them nourishment for the night.Day 3 - The food supply cannot sustain with the eight survival meals remaining. Adam becomes the farmer for the group and begins planting potatoes, wheat, and rice. Amber begins hunting nearby game and making a freezer for the meat. Wick is still digging into the mountain. Wick is found to be the rival of Adam. No wonder he looks at him with disdain!Day 7 - A week has passed. Wick has recovered steel, components, and other materials from mining. He begins researching a new form of crafting for the group. It seems like Wick is doing all of the work. Adam and Amber are happy that they are still together. A caravan from another group comes by. They exchange an assault rifle for some of the group's rice and potatoes. Wait, was that all of the food? Wick is furious.Day 12 - Amber has killed nearly every animal (or things that even move) in the area. The freezer is full of meat and potatoes now. There are enough meals to last the group through the winter for sure. The group decides to name the town ""Myro"". They also decide to call their group ""The Black Sun Empire"". Pretty lofty for three space dweebs, but it has a nice ring to it. Defences are made. A vistor, Sheckly, decides to stay with the group. He takes the place of Wick. Wick is now in charge of defences (and planting flowers).Day 26 - The settlement has grown into a small village. Pigs and boars have been tamed. A Llama wanted to stay in Myro. An entire farmhouse/pigpen has been created for the new domesticated animals. Life is well in Myro. Everyone smokes Smokeleaf and is at ease. When raids come, the settlers close the main gate and send out the three guards, with Wick at the helm of the town's defence. The town has an election. Adam is chosen as the leader, as most people connect with him since he is a farmer and populist candidate. Wick becomes jealous.Day 31 - It is a quiet day in Myro. The total population of the town is now 19 citizens. The farmers are out in the fields harvesting and planting. The tailors and smiths are crafting away. The lone artist, Zeko, is sculpting another wacky statue. However, Wick and Adam get into an argument outside of the gates. Adam lands a punch on Wick, but Wick draws his pistol and puts a bullet straight through his head. The town guard come out and see Adam's head blown open with Wick standing over him. They do not arrest Wick. He buries Adam in a shallow grave outside of town. Everyone asks where Adam has gone when he isn't back in town by nightfall. Wick says he has no idea, but that he knew Adam was becoming very stressed by leading the entire town. The citizens want to wait a few days before they have another election. Amber knows what really happened, but is too afraid of Wick to say anything.Day 38 - A week has passed since Adam went missing. The town decides to move forward with the election. Wick is the new leader of the town. He immediately has Amber framed for the murder of Adam, since she thought he was seeing another woman. Probably Elise, the nurse who always takes care of his wounds. Wick throws her into the town's jail, which is located out of town for some reason. There is to be a trial, but no one comes in defence of Amber. The town needed a scapegoat, and Wick knew just who it should be.Day 43 - Amber has been found guilty. She is to be executed. Wick is waiting in the center of town with the rest of the citizens while Amber is dragged by the guards. Wick proclaims that Amber needs to confess her crimes, but all she does is spit on his face. Wick smiles, wipes it off, and pulls out his pistol. Wick looks Amber in the eyes and pulls the trigger. Now the true era of The Black Sun Empire has begun..._____________________________________________________________Overall, this game is one of the best I have played in a long time. If you use your imagination a little, rich stories can be crafted during every play-through. The mechanics are fairly simple and the characters are amazing. This is my first review, so...FINAL VERDICT: 9.5/10The devs are working very hard to bring more content to the game. Hopefully it will be enough to better the score I give it! :)			"

								I live in a 3rd world country so i gotta be careful how i spend the little money i have.For that reason i only play free games. The only bought game i have is cs:go.  But this game i bought.That says a lot.    Don't mind the hours i've played, i hit up the game on daily basis at work with no steam on.  Love all the ways you can fail in this game, can't believe i'd ever enjoy failing in a game more than winning it.   For me it's easily 10/10, i personally predict that upon release it should be bigger than Stardew Valley and compete with it for indie game top. All the mods potential and generally the potential of the game is big.			"

								This game, Simply Terrific.I love this game. Because i've tried to get into Dwarf Fortress but it's not my thing personally and the only 2 reasons for this being are the graphics and the hud. Otherwise the game would be amazing and amongst the best of all games, but we're talking about rimworld here not dwarf fortress. So let me tell you some pros and cons for this game and the reason why you should really get it because it is definitely worth getting it.Pros: - Now i'd bet most of you found this game through other similar games like as i had already mentioned before Dwarf fortress or banished. There is a Genre for these type of games which i'd like to call: Colony management [Now not only is this game fun for all the people who played similar games but also for new people, which in my opinion is a pretty big Pro]- I might be wrong about this, but i've experienced absolutely 0 bugs about this game and i think that for a especially an Early Acces game this deserves a Pro.- It's incredibly Unique. I actually like that Tynan(The main game developer) didn't copy too much from games like Dwarf fortress which he based this game on.- Challenging, the game keeps you at a constant pace of difficulty to keep you satisfied and not bored, although there is an option to change that for example the Randy random mode.- [Last words]To top it off the developer of this game is amongst the best i've ever seen, because not only does he listen to the communities ideas and suggestions, but he also involves into it! Though that might change because the game is getting very popular very fastCons:- This may sound ridiclious but can't think of any at the time i'm writing this.Suggestions:- Some big suggestions i had that everybody would love to see probably,- Vehicles and Rideable horses, this could really make the game interesting and with the new chemfeul added to the game (alpha 16) it may even get added soon.- y - levels Could not only be strategicly cool but also more realistic AND in Buildings.-  Multiplayer, This is probably the biggest thing. I mean the game could be so fun if this was added here's why and how i think it could be implented:So with the recent update (Alpha 16) Tynan has released your colonist being able to form caravans and form colonies on other maps, he also made it possible to have a spherical world map and litteraly look around on this map!The way i think multiplayer could be possible, is if players would just find a colony on the planet and play, it would be kind of like the game Rust where you make bases and the objective is to raid other people to become ""The king of the hill"" (Not originally called). Some incredible unique features to the game:- To top this post off entirely i just wanted to list a few features that were definitely worth mentioning- a Spherical map. This feature has been recently added and is one of the big things the game has you can see it in the pictures on this very store page!- Multiple colonies being able to play on multiple maps is something i'd never thought would happen and it's amazing.- Drugs, lol this is kind of a funny one, you can litteraly drug your people and make them stoned some of the descriptions in their "" Needs menu""  where you can see your colonists thoughts and need are sometimes hilarious. Also you can create drugs yourself which is also very cool.- The health system is very well made Not only those it conclude Illnesses and infections, but it also lets you perform surgeries for example. The health system is also very realistic as doctor colonists can fail them or that a room has to be clean to have a higher rate of succes.Official Final Words: Would i recommend you this game? Definitely is it worth the money? Yeah it's a decent priceIs it for arcade players? See here's the problem, this game might not be for all people. Same goes with the game Dwarf Fortress if you are not willing to learn the game mechanics, or you can't quite cope with loss i wouldn't recommend you this game. Rimworld is trying its best to make it appealing for everyone , which in my opinion Dwarf Fortress fails alot in.Thank you for reading everyone have a great day :)			"

								So after quite a bit of playing I finally won a play through and I feel good about myself. It all started with three colonists. a builder, a hunter, and a farmer. Thanks to rng they had a beautiful valley surrounded by mountains. they set up a very easily defendable choke point at the opening of the valley and it goes from there. more people show up along the way and this colony thrives. with little threat from raiders and limited spots for bugs to spawn they grow and grow. Then the diseases hit. progress completely halts for days at a time as everyone becomes a doctor in order to survive. Eventually everyone save the janitor has 7+ skill in medicine. Once the plagues let up the colony gets going again. the hunter eventually becomes more robot than man often singlehandly taking out raiding parties with trusty sniper. The colony starts enjoying their riches and builds and builds and builds until 21 people are swimming in silver and carpet. Not even the robots can touch them.  Finally the colony is at a point where shipbuilding is a very real option and start the ground work. getting 21 people into space isn’t exactly easy on the steel bank. Eventually people start dying. First to go die to a massive raiding party of over fifty pirates. Just their luck to have two separate factions attack at the same time. The next two were caught outside when a pack of man eating boars ran between them and the valley. our friend the hunter was also with them, but he survived his injuries with only requiring a new eye to match his other bionic one. After that came the bugs. They had grown in a new spot this time, one where they werent easily removed. Our brave hunter shot a hive full of fire and ran to wait out the aftermath. The fire spread, it spreaded too far! It felt like it was everywhere and it took the efforts of everyone just to limit the damage. People were fighting both fire and bugs as well they could trying to protect the nearby hospital and medicine stash. One by one colonists fell, only to be pulled out of the fire and rushed to the medical beds they were trying to protect. Our humble builder ran through the fire trying to save his friend only to be attacked by one last vengeful bug. Their dual shall be talked about for ages. Punch after punch, blow after blow they fought until the fire surrounded them. With no way out our builder downed the megaspider and grabbed his fellow colonist desperate to make it through the flames. But alas, his wounds proved to much and he collapsed surrounded by fire, his last deeds in vain as they went up in smoke. The heavens themselves cried at his passing, putting out the flames that had claimed three lives that day.  Desperate to forge on the remaining colonist realized that if they dismantled their power grid they would have enough materials to finish the ship. working as fast as they can all but two of the cryosleep pods were complete before raiders attacked taking advantage of the now seemingly defenseless colony. seven raiders fell to well placed traps while seven more made it to the no longer functioning turrets. Time was running out and one colonist knew what she had to do. Calling all five of the colony's pet boars and their one turtle she charged into battle unbeknownst to the rest of the tribe and its supervisor. With fire in her heart and steel in her soul our farmer tore into the remaining raiders dropping three of them in short succession with her bare hands. She drove the raiders off buying the builders plenty of time to finish the ship. Ignoring her wounds she climbed into her pod saying goodbye to the brave boars and turtle that gave their lives that day. With nothing left in the valley but the two remaining boars and enough food to last them till they die of old age the ship took off never to be seen again. 10/10 would ride a herd of boar into battle again.

								This game....I started playing back in the early alphas and I have been playing it for the year and a bit since. The amount of time and attention Ludeon puts into this game is staggering, they have listened to our feedback at every step and the result is the glorious thing you see before you. Those that know me know I love modding so this game was pure heaven for me, so much so I have spent the last year of my life solidly modding this game and nothing else. The game is robust, the simulation of things like bodyparts, health and relationships is crazy, the gun fights are epic, the diseases, the insects, the farming I dont see my love for any of it waning anytime soon. If you do finally get bored of all that, theres a healthy modding scene with a enough content to make 4 or 5 more games. So yeah.For the stories it creates to the giggles I get from the community, for the happy feeling i get everytime i hear Als guitar, great work Tynan, Ison, Al and others at Ludeon.Thankyou. Now, Randy, No squirrels this time.			"

								I have two questions, why is this game early access and is it the best game ever made ?  108 hours and I only installed it a week ago, obviously I've not slept much and had to take 3 days off work. Dont buy this game, it will wreck your life as it has mine.I installed it at the same time as doom and mad max and I've not even looked at those, this game now controls me. I will say the first 5 minutes I almost rage quitted as couldn't make anything do something, I'm glad I made it through those first few minutes although it came at a cost of insomnia. So I normaly play games on a hard level, no reason to be any different here with a cutsie looking game, WRONG, I chose hard setting and permafrost mode, things went well for an hour or so was just building rooms, thinking this is  nice, then a small raid turned up, i killed those got some weapons and I'm thinking I'm great. Then a flash flood, with lightning, nothing bad happening with that or so I thought, the rain stopped but the lightning carried on for a few more seconds enough time to start 3 small fires miles away, I figured I'd leave the fires to do their thing then a couple of days later ( ingame days)  I was surrounded by this wall of fire, my 4 chars are doing their best to stamp out the flames but 4 people with no water dont stand much of a chance and so it turned out, a few minutes lates my whole building is burnt to the ground and my people are dying, I quit, chose an easier setting and kept permafrost mode ( wrong again ) . Had to quit again, I'm now playing on the second to easiest setting with no permadeath and I specialy chose my survivors before starting this time. This game is incredibly fun, but you are only seconds away from dissaster and having everything erased right before your eyes. My advice is save regulary, dont select permafrost, or atleast until you know what you're doing. I'm not sure the 3 storytellers make any difference , they all seem to throw anything at you.This game is hard but very rewarding, you will care about your colonists and even their slightist injury, the enemies are not clue dead either, they will look for cover to shoot from, forcing you to do the same.So is this game better than Rome, my favourite game of all time, hard to say ,been so long since I played rome but if I had Rome installed, I would still be playing rimworld.

Early Access Review
								 I generally do not Leave reviews for a game. Least of all for one in Early Access.First and biggest issue and perhaps the only gripe that I have with this game is the instability of your saves between builds.PRO TIP: If you are planning to have a modded playthrough(and you should ; totally revamps the gameplay) make a vanilla Save prior to adding any modsNow for the actual review of this game.I have spent a total of 128 hours in this game. making it my 4th most played game ever and that time is split between two playthroughs (the first one I had to end because of the aformentioned reason).I generally do not admit to save-scumming,  but in this game, I did so shamelessly. Not because I was afraid of losing valuable members of my Tribe, but because I couldn't bear to continue without them. Spend enough time in this game and their patterns become yours. The ""One more Day"" rule applies here way more than your would first believe and soon  enough, the Sun in rising and even the Real World clock that you can enable in the HUD does little to nothing to stop this complusion to continue.Now for the reason to Buy:This game is Hard and random and gets harder and randommer the more you play. every decision you make creates a snowball and before you know it you have created this monster of a settlement cleared out one small tile at a time.Reason Not to buy:The level of involvement you get out of the game is based on the amount of time you invest in it. Seeing as the game is in early access, any update to the core Build or any mods that you might add could end up wasting hours of progress. Making that save unplayable (as in the save will not load). I went 3 months without playing pricesely for this very reason.Final note.Make sure you are willing to live with the decisions that you make in this game. The Following is the Story that unfolded in my Tribe that led me to get to the end game.I was happy to keep on playing the game with no real end, even though I had my spaceship built. But my hand was forced.I had 3 married couples in my tribe. One guy( I had named him The Miner as he was good at mining) started an affair with another female in the tribe ( causing destress to him and his wife and the female he was having an affair with). A few days past and the Miner's Wife started an affair with another Male member for the tribe. A few Bedroom Re-assignement later> The wife and husband are sleeping in different rooms with their lovers.But the writing is on the wall. This can't continue and soon enough the relationships will keep on getting too complicated to the point where it would be just utter chaos.So I load everyone except the Miner's Mistress into the pods and then right before lift off, I extract the guy Who was having the affair with The Miner's wife. I Didn't want for all of this effort to go to waste and thought it would be a good ending in paper atleast.The last two members of the tribe, deciding to stay behind, with bountiful food and farmland and animals to take care off.I though I would Imagine them living in this Rimworld, Providing sanctuary to those that need it most.Only the game does not end with the launch.The credits roll begining with list of people who made it out in the ship and who were left behind.The usual thanks and what not continue.The music keeps playing.Then you are taken back to your settlement.The game keeps on going.And you are faced with your decision.The stupidity of mine did not occur until I saw the two go into seperate rooms.In my haste to get my first launch going, I left the two halfs of a Broken marraige that had nothing to do with each other.They had little to no relationship with each other.I check their social and see the name of their respective lover with (Dead) next to their name.The realization dawn on me. For the ones who were left behind, the ones who left might as well be dead.I quit the game. I need a Break from this. Don't even bother saving it.09/10 : Broke my heart into a thousand pieces and I love you with all of them.			"

								I made the wise choice (After reading other reviews) to not go with a Permadeath scenario on my first build. In the end, I chose Cassandra Classic and left it set to Base Building. What follow is the thoughts and events through my first ten hours.Day One: Dear god what the hell do I do? Complicated! Agggh! Oh wait...Building stuffs is here. Let's see if I can't make a house over by this mountain?Day Two: Why aren't my guys doing the things I need them to? Oh. There's a thing for priorities. Sweet! Lets see if I can't force them to mine into this mountain so I can have a cave fortress!Day Three: OH GOD NO IT'S TOO EARLY TO BE RAIDED- Oh wait it's just one person. Alright! Big burly shooter bloke, up you go! Time to shine! Oh. You didn't kill her? She's stunned on the floor bleeding to death...We-ell...I suppose I can take her captive and have my Doctor look her over. At the very least, good practise for the future. Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ How do I make a prison?Day Four: Captive resting up. Doctor successfully handled all the wounds...Wait a minute...Infection? In her leg and torso? ♥♥♥♥. What do I do? Just let the Doctor handle that I suppose? Day Five: ""Immunity 96% - Torso."" ""Immunity 94% Right Leg""...Does this mean the infection is becomming immune to my medicine?♥♥♥♥♥♥ I better get the Doc to amputate her leg. At the very least, it's more practise...Waaaaaaaait. Immunity is at 100% and infection is going down? I'm a fblooming idiot... Can we reattach the leg? No? Well.♥♥♥♥♥♥ Let's stick a peg leg on her...Uh...Sorry to get off on the wrong foot there...Day Six: Despite shooting her four times, serious infection and a...Less than needed amputation...She's survived. Now, she's laying there captive with a peg leg, probably thinking she's been captured by a bunch of cannibals or something, since she clearly didn't need to have the leg off...I'm going to recruit her. Should be simple right?Day Seven: Prisoner doesn't want to co-operate? I can't imagine why...My hospitality has been impeccable! It'll have to wait, because my land is being ravaged by a pack of...Hyper intelligent beavers? Uh... Okay? I hope the colony likes beaver meat.Day Eight: Figured out how to tame a boar. Beavers are all dead. The prisoner has finally decided to join us...Riiiight as a dry thunderstorm hits and sets half the map ablaze. In the ensuing chaos of frantic firefighting, our newest recruit, Tail,  gets inadvertently set on fire. So she's back in bed again, recovering.Day Nine: Fires are all out. Given everyone a full day of freedom to do with as they please...Aaaand another raid. Lovely. Hang on...Are those -grenades- that caveman is lobbing at me?! There goes my Hunter. Thankfully he scares them off before having to be hauled off to the impromptu medbay.Day Ten: Just as I finish making a bedroom for everyone and a spacious walk in fridge for my food, a trading caravan comes in. Oh! They have a prosthetic leg! I'll take that and replace that awful peg leg on Tail. That'll make up for removing her leg, right? Maybe...And now the caravan members are fighting each other...One killed the other with her fists? Impressive. My hunter couldn't even kill someone with his rifle. Remind me not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off ""The Town In The Cave"" faction. And they didn't even take their fallen brother's weaponry and armour? Excellent! Time to give my Hunter a nice shiny new sniper rifle and armour set!Day Eleven: My poor tamed boar just got attacked by a Grizzly. My hunter attempted to save it...But it perished regardless and the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off bear is rampaging amok! And...Oh. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Tail's just had her arms torn off...Day Twelve: Tail can't do anything anymore. She has no arms and only one leg. Her mental state is dropping rapidly now that she's bedridden. I don't know what to do.Day Thirtreen: The batteries keeping power to my cave area just blew up. They were right beside my hurried Medbay area. The problem with Tail was resolved through fire.Day Fourteen: Buried the mutliated body of Tail. Everyone's mood is down the pan. My hunter has taken to wandering naked and cloud watching all day. My heart is broken. I failed that poor pirate girl. It would have been kinder to just let her die in the wake of her raid.At this point, I called it a night. What I anticipated to be a couple hours game time turned into an entire day. Despite all the feels I have right now, I fully intend to pick it up again tomorrow and start afresh. Now I know how the game works, I pray I can make my colony something worthwhile. If you're on the fence about buying this...Seriously. Do it. The first half an hour is a nightmare to pick up all the mechanics and functions of each and every button...But once you go past that point, it becomes a glorious mess of emotions. I've never felt regret like this over a one legged depressive former pirate in my life.10/10 would maim my potential recruits again.			"

								Three colonists crash land in a forest. ""Young"" and ""Walsh"" hit it off immediately and get engaged. ""Hun"" is a hard worker that gets things done.Compound slowly expands over time, including steel buildings completely surrounded by a steel wall. We are invincible.Get a distress call from an old woman running from some angry tribals. We save her and kill/capture the tribals (their bow and arrows are no match for our rifle and pistol). She joins us and becomes our charismatic chef.Get another distress call from a big geologist. Prepare to fight tribals, instead put up against trained soldiers in nano armor and energy weapons. Find out that we are, in fact, not invincible. Hun is killed, Walsh is downed (but rescued by Young), and the old woman disappears without a trace (seriously no idea what happened to her, no corpse or anything).We managed to down one of the soldiers. Young equipped his armor/weapon and killed a second soldier causing them all to flee. Walsh gets better and both he and Young are fully equipped in nano armor with energy weapons. Now we are definitely invincible.Another group of tribals attack. They are pathetic and quickly killed outside the walls by my new energy weapons.Wait, what is this? The energy weapons set the corpses on fire? Wow that fire is spreading quickly...**5 minutes later**The entire compound is lost and half the map burnt down before it finally started to rain. Apparently those weapons run on jet fuel because my steel walls and buildings were no match for that blaze. George W Bush would be proud. RIP trapped prisoners and that group of visitors from the other colony sleeping on my floor.I guess sleeping on the floor in the ruins of the compound was bad for morale and the geologist we saved earlier snaps and starts stabbing Young. We put him down with energy weapons. Thank god there is nothing left to burn.Young eventually snaps too and starts attacking her fiancee. She is downed but survives and is healed up by Walsh (thankfully he is a doctor).Deciding that staying in the compound ruins is probably a bad idea, we move on to find some shelter elsewhere. What's this? Some kind of ancient structure? Well we have nothing to lose so maybe it will make a good temporary shelter.Break through a spot in the wall, get attacked by giant bug robots. Run around the back and draw them out, then swing back around to enter the structure. Hah, stupid robots. There is something on the ground, looks like it does something to animals...maybe it will tame the ones nearby, I could really use the help.Activate device, animals go into a man-killing rage. Every single animal on the map rushes to the structure. Young and Walsh go down in a literal blaze of glory as the swarms of animals attacking them are set on fire by the energy weapons.10/10. Now I understand why the alien races in movies never trust humans with advanced technology. "

								JUST BUY THE GAME ALREADY, SERIOUSLY.So, in my first experience with this game I played the game for almost 10 hours straight on permadeath mode. Decided to take the Randy Random storyteller as an option.Here's my story. ..3 crash landed survivors. 2 brothers, in a spaceship, and then a meteor hit...err...Yeah so they landed on the planet in the far northern reaches, and built a sweet settlement. Had some visitor’s quarters that could house like 10+ people (ty mods). As our three adventurers went along, they recruited another 7 wanderers to join their settlement. In the first year’s winter, the old lady of the group lost her mind and decided to walk nude into the wilderness...everyone was sad when she died and a few settlers visited her grave for months after. Many raiders attempted to steal what the settlers built and grew, but through blood and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kiting tactics, they survived. After the first full year, there were now 11 people in the settlement. Traders were a common sight, and the raiding had cooled off through the second winter. There were squabbles here and there, and the occasional rampant animal or man hunting pack of wild beasts. Overall it was quite peaceful; the settlers were able to create a life on this wild planet. They had gardens, electrical systems, defense grids, and even a hydroponics farm being built...and then it happened...They came from the sky, 3 of them. These monstrosities in metal armor crashing through the roof of the home. They started with the scientist, gutted her right in front of the youngest one. She lost it and ran into the woods. Then the settlers banded together. They waited outside of the laboratory doors. Those steel encased doors that can hold back even the wildest of beast or raider. 9 people fully loaded with every ounce of firepower they had to offer. Even some EMP grenades they had scored off a few raiders who were unlucky enough to catch a few settlers hunting. They didn't stand a chance. The doors came down like butter. The trade caravan that had been there, fled as soon as the fire started. There was nowhere to run. The metal beasts shrugged off every round fired, even the heavy machine gun couldn't penetrate their armor. They barely scathed these monsters. 7 people went down in the melee. Only two escaped to run to a safer place, maybe the doors of the freezer would hold them out, and they would leave with some goods and let them live? That's when the beeping started, ......... has burned to death, .......... has burned to death. It kept saying it, over and over until they were gone. All but two, but the monsters weren't done. They broke the freezer doors down, knocked the final two unconscious and lit the rest of the encampment on fire. They all died, slowly. First from stab wounds and power fist wounds and then they were burned to death...that was it...game over...maybe someone else will find use of the ruins of this place...?Seriously though, I was stuck for 10 hours almost playing this. I couldn't step away from this crazy story that was unfolding. If you are even considering it, buy it. You can return it if you play it for less than 2 hours. BUT, I doubt you will be able to put it down.			"

Text Summary:I used to love dwarf fortress, but never could get used to the control scheme. This game has the foundations for the same scope and scale, but it's not there yet. But what is here is a solid foundation, the core loop for the building, expanding, relationships and the foundation for the various aspects of progression, i like the entire scale and way trading works and the way crafting expands the abilities and scope of the game.Sadly the assets and abilities are not there yet, and it needs massive expansion - but the base assets are great and core gameplay is VERY well put together.currently a very solid gameplay experience, but gaps in both story and world are readily apparent, and are logical instead of abrupt. Clear places where content is waiting for the developers to add and the modding community to expand.I personally am not a fan of the sound design and assets, as i feel they are very sub-par in conveying information. The UI and general Graphics also need a ton of work, between displaying alerts and positions (especially on higher resolutions) and character animations.Where i am a fan of is the enticing pull of one more try when your colony dies of starvation and when you get eaten by a mystic horse or when you get killed by raiders or when....but... I still restarted my next colony after starvation killed my previous and i already cannibalized half my people and had them eat their loved ones.... and that is pretty damn good for a little indie game just hitting Early access.tl;dr : the foundations are solid			"

Well, ain't such a bad spot for a colony after all, I guess. Been here for a year and a half, having enough food, electricity, even a bunch of nice houses an' a little hospital place for me to work and take care of our people, as you see. Three more joined us after we crash landed, uhh... weirdly enough, one of those is the sister of my friend Matt. What's her face... A yeah, Yoko. Then we got Sullivan. Ugly, poor guy... Ain't good for much, but at least he's having fun sweeping the floors. And then there's Lynch.That lady got by us, because she was chased by some tribe folk. I don't know what she did, but those guys sure were mad at her. Well, whatever. She's got the aiming, was a scout before, she told us. But no use getting much out of her, anyway. Seems like she doesn't like man that much, always giving us that nasty stink eye... When she arrived, she had constant, terrible pain in her chest. Turned out she had lung cancer, growing. Not good.You gotta learn to deal with that. But you also gotta learn to deal with those darn tribe idiots, trying to raid our little home sweet home again an' again! That one time there were five guys, with clubs and bows. I don't know why they're still trying that... but our rifles and pistols sure get the job done. Maybe my aim was a little off or something, three of these savages survived. So, we pick them up off the ground, pack them in our little prison cell and start the medical treatment, because we're good folk, we ain't killing for fun just because they're hostile and so on... However, that one poor boy, only seventeen I believe, Matt made a fine swiss cheese out of him. No way that boy's gonna make it, I said. But weirdly enough his chest was still ok.I know... You're not supposed to talk about stuff like that but... whatever. I mean, one of our girls was in dire need of a new lung, y'know what I'm saying? Nobody really liked the idea, that's a given. But nobody stopped me either, when I prepared the surgery. Someone's gonna do the dirty work, Wilson, I say to myself all the time. And so I did.Surely enough, a few days later Lynch approached me because of that lung. Even if she doesn't like man, everybody know's here that I'm the doc and I know what I'm doing. And getting her a new, healthy organ was my intention after all. I'm telling you, it was like some Frankensteins movie or something, a storm outside, thunder clapping, as I prepared everything. But I ain't some crazy scientist, I got the job done, clean as it gets. Seems like I have the hands for it, ha.When Lynch awoke, I never saw her smile like that. That horrible pain she felt from that nasty cancer, well, it was gone of course. Surgery was a full success, no problems at all. Wilson, she said, seems like you're not such a weirdo after all. And we laughed, everybody was relieved. Good, hard times, I'm telling you.Well... But, whatever. I'm not really sure why I'm telling you this right now, sedation should've hit you hard enough by now. Sullivan told me he has this weird itch in his gut, sooo...... Where did I put my knife?Based on true events. That's RimWorld for you. "

								Rimworld could simply be described as a mix of Dwarf Fortress, Prison Architect, and Firefly. But it is so much more than that. Let us go through a standard day in rimword.Buying a hospital computer from a caravan who decide to let their animals eat all of your crops.Finding out that one of the raiders in the next attack is the brother of your colonist.Train an army of squirrels to attack you colonist's traitor brother.Too many attack squirrels died, so now your animal trainer colonist freaked out and went crazy and is now lighting EVERYTHING on fire.Trigger your fire suppression system to keep your hospital from burning down.Fire supression foam covers your entire hospital treatment room, makning everything dirty.All the dirty foam gives my sick colonists infections in their legs, forcing me to amputate them.10/10 would have colony of cripples again.That sounds made up, but crazy stuff like that actually happens. Remember, losing is common, but it can be really fun! Pick up this game for sure in you are interested, you won't regret it!			"

								In lieu of writing a detailed review where I pick apart what makes this game a work of pure genius, I'll get right to the key points that I feel make playing this game such a special experience.Rimworld is a game of imagination. Everthing in this game lends to painting a picture in your mind's eye of what your colony is experiencing. The graphics are minimalistic, with characters/animals/mechanoids represented with simple, vector ""pawns"" that move on a 2d grid. Most of the depth Rimworld provides is through text in menus and alerts. The true brilliance in this representational model is that you are free to visualize with your IMAGINATION what each scene of desperate survival looks like. Its almost like reading a book, and more akin to P&P D&D, or those old text based adventure games like Zork.In an age of hyper-realistic. AAA video games that leave nothing to the imagination. Rimworld seeks to cultivate the long lost art of creative thinking. It does so in a way that is both compelling, and (in many cases) emotional. You become attached to your pawns, colonist and animal, as well as the wellbeing of the colony itself. You are sad (or at the VERY least perturbed) when a Scyther takes your favorite colonist's head off in one shot, or your dog gets eaten by a wandering couger. The stories of Rimworld write themselves, and come to life in your mind.Pros:Simple aesthetic lends to imaginative interpretation of gameplay.Highly in depth-gameplay with micromanagement that is (largely) optional until you need it.Music is great and reminds me of Firefly (even though there are only a few tracks, I don't get tired of hearing them).Updates about the time you finish a few runs with lots of new content and bug fixes (thank you Tynan).TONS of replayability, custom modes, settings, mods, etc.Mod support through the workshop that adds to and fixes base content.Variation in difficulty with the storytellers, permadeath mode, and tradition difficulty as well as custom scenarios.Cons:Bigger maps aren't (yet?) optimized well, and can lead to lag on higher playspeeds and long load times.Some bugs and oddities affect gameplay adversely.Medical operation success rates and (inevitable) failures.Your game does eventually end, and you are always sad to see the pawns lauch off, and the colony abandoned...I just realized that this is possibly my most detailed review yet, RIP my opening statement.I know this review largely focuses on the ""deeper"" aspects of what makes this game great. The reason for that is you can always watch a ""let's play"" or a streamer or something to see what the game actually plays like. This review is simply my impressions after dozens (hundreds?) of hours crafting stories of adventure and survival in the Rimworld....Thrumbo/10			"

17.07.2016 : (EARLY ACCESS)Alpha 14Highly recommended!!This is my review after 20 hours of INTENSE gameplay.RimWorld is a sci-fi colony simulator where you've to survive in an hostile stranger planet. Everything is managed by a fantastic A.I. storyteller who creates dynamic events during the gameplay, simulating interpersonal relationships, psychology, trading, climate, biomes, diplomacy and a lot more..A typical scenario you can have in your first game: ""Your colony is formed by three mans, everyone of them with positive and negative traits. You're on a stranger planet, so you've to start to build a base, or at least a refuge for your colonists. There are a lot of dangerous things out there, such as wild animals (snakes, bears, wolves and many more) or bandits.Once you've finally your base, you've to survive, and mantain your colony happy, otherwise they'll start to fight each other, and it's not the easiest task of the game, believe me.""Gameplay and graphics is very similar to PRISON ARCHITECTS and DWARF FORTRESS (who ispired the devs).Actually is EARLY ACCESS, and probably someone of you could be scared of this, but there is nothing to worry about. The game is FULLY playable and BUG FREE, or at least I've not encountered a single bug in 20hours of gameplay. Very stable and light.Scenario is procedurally generated by seed, and events are ALWAYS dynamically created, so it will never happen to have a game like the previous one, not even if you load a previous savegame! Well, in the end, it's very rare to say in a review, that I can't find a single bad thing in a videogame, and this is one of those very rare cases.Absolutely recommended to anyone of you who loves games like DWARF FORTRESS, PRISON ARCHITECTS, and simulation games / base-building / strategy games.9.5 / 10 (waiting the rest of the content during the early access).

								RimWorld is a gritty base building / colony management game.It's similar to dwarf fortress, if dwarf fortress was gritty,and had guns and canabalism. Rimworld has a realistic healthand firefight model. Colonists can get plagues, tapeworms,malnutrition, limbs blown off, shrapnel stuck in them.Blood loss, Infections.There's also social relationships between your colonists.They all have opinions of each other. They can fall in loveand get married, and have children (if straight).They will hate their lover's killer.The game is brutal though. The AI storying telling is designedmake the best story. So as a general rule a colonist won'tsurvive more than a few weeks. Maybe I'm just a bit terribleat this game. You can harvest a prisoners organs, or yourown colonists organs, and sell them on the black market.But your colonists will get a negative buff unless they're psychopathic.But your colonists will get a negative buff unless they're psychopathicIf a colonist gets too unhappy or stressed, they can wander around anddo nothing, or more likely they'll go on a murderous berserk and attackeveryone and every animal in sight.This is one of my favourite games. I've spent many hours playing it.I've been following the development of this game for a long time,and have seen it change a lot.Tynan is a very capable developer, and one that listens to his players -he's often found on the game's subreddit.

								I own this game since mid-2014 and been playing it for hundreds of hours, again and again.Overall impression is it's such a great sim. game, per se! These are the core mechanics I particularly like in Rimworld:- Task management - Observation- Combat and survivalEarly game: you will want to survive and experience many of the things proposed by the story teller (new colonists joining, opportunistic events to help you start or that might kill you straight...)PS: starting difficulty must match with what you are looking for and able to do... Pick and choose carefully.With Alpha14, there are scenariis, so starting a new game is even more of a time, where you can plan on what your starting conditions will be.Mid game:The day 2 day job is to maintain a sane environment for your colonists to train and survive. Many events are there to make you fail at that, so make sure to plan, observe, research and develop skills to compete in your arsh worldLate game:The possibility is given to you to build a spaceship to evade from your colony, but this is nowhere mandatory. You might feel a bit bored (after quite a while and many runs), but nothing forbids you to try again with a different setup, in a different biome with other challenges.At one point, you might want to consider getting some mods as well, to enrich your experience in game.Conclusion and notes:The development process, which has not stopped during the while, made it so that I played numerous restarts, trying to get my brain around new mechanics, items and stories I could play with. Many mods have also been developed around it and it's accessibility in that regard made me love it more and want to participate.I found a great community of modders and persons loving the thing too, which in return gave me some more great moments to experience with, discovering new technics or facts I did not know about.For these reasons and even if only for playing, I would recommend this great piece of entertainment to anyone who likes simulation/tactical games.

								I like to base my purchases on how complex, challenging, and re-playable a game is.  Typically when I am looking to spend money (especially games upwards of $30) I want to know I'll get my money's worth.  I like to read other people's reviews to see not just that they rated it up, but that those who do rate it up have more than a handful of hours in the game.  Looking around at the reviews here, you can clearly see people are getting their money's worth out of this gem of a game.Having played ~30 hours I've been having an amazing time.  Rimworld is a unique blend of base building, resource management, tower defense and likely a few other genres that manages to engage you where you actually care about your colony and colonists.  Coupled with a RNG event system there is always excitement around the corner - maybe a blight will destroy 75% of your crops, or you'll be attacked by a group of rampaging bunnies (or elephants!), or a toxic fallout will sweep across the land forcing you to adapt to survive.  Even if RNG may scare you away, the difficulty ramps over time so you'll never be unfairly challenged, although you will be alerted to your weaknesses time and time again.The customization this game allows is also what makes it potentially fun for just about anyone, and the gradual increase in difficulty keeps things interesting. With a plethora of mods available and a scenario editor so you can play exactly the game you want - you can create a colony with superstars and top tier gear in a lush environment, a small group of desolate tribals trying to adapt to below freezing temperatures, a group of psychopathic cannibals, etc..  your imagination is the limit.In my latest game I had to abandon my best colony yet because of poor planning - instead of the typical raid of pirates charging into my fortified defenses (consisting of traps and gun turrets) they decided to blow open a back way into my base and decimated my infrastructure, overpowering my brave colonists (it didn't help that one of my ""smokeleaf"" addicted colonists decided to go smoke himself silly as they were tearing down the wall).  As annoying as some of these defeats are, you always learn more for next time.  I've just now started as a group of five tribals with no technology and it completely changes the way you play the game.Don't let the ""Early Access"" tag fool you - this is a complete game with a massive amount of depth, and great communication from a competent developer.  I can't wait to see what else is in store.  If this does sound interest watch a few let's plays to give you an idea of how Rimworld plays out.One other note - the soundtrack is absolutely stellar and really sets the theme.Highly recommended!

								Day 1: Three survivors crash land on an unknown planet, build a small shelter and huddle for the night. During the night a lightning strike lights the emergency rations on fire. The three shiver in the dark reliving the events of the past day in their dreams.Day 2: With no food supplies our intrepid Markus 'Seedlings' Grave takes his trusty hunting rifle and searches for game. Seeing a hare he fires a shot and hits a timber wolf who proceeds to maul him. Jannet 'Joker' Coben dashes to Markus' aid with her trusty plasteel knife and manages to wound the wolf. Jimmy 'Swan' Camble catches up to Jannet and levels his pistol at the wolf and pulls the trigger. Jannet takes the round in the head and dies instantly. The timber wolf seeing new prey sprints towards Jimmy. Fortunately; Tugboat, their yorkshire terrier comes to the rescue! With Tugboat distracting the wolf Jimmy takes another shot and shoots Tugboat in the head killing him instantly as well. Unfazed by the distraction the wolf takes Jimmy down and begins eating him will Markus slowly bleeds out only able to watch as he knows he'll be next.Day 3: Debris continues to rain down on the planet.

								I know what your thinking, ""look at the graphics, and 30 dollers wtf""I said the same thing for a year looking at this game. But here is the Lowdown on RimworldIt is absolutely Epic.The depth of this game is unprecedented.In its vanilla form it truly is a vary great game,but with the workshop? which has a huge active community The sky is not even a limit anymore. If you like colony building, a bit of exploration, tower defense,and survival games this has great big bits of each in it.you will not be disappointed. My one major Con.... pawn AI. they truly are stupid as Hell sometimes.The UI does provide ways of dealing with their bad choices but it is a bit clunky in that respect. I give this game a 9.5/10 and its still in alphaalso, its a must have for any brown coats out there.It is not in the Firefly universe but it harnesses its amazing spirit very very well.			"

								I started my colony as a lone, rich surgeon who had crash landed on the planet. I named him Boris. He wasn't a violent man, and shunned fighting whenever possible. One day a strong brute joined the colony after he crash landed on the planet and I used my medical skills to patch him up to perfection. Lovely! He did the heavy lifting, Boris did the research and looked after his sniffles.Things were going well.Then she came. She was perfect. She could shoot a gun like she was ex special forces - she could mine like a nutjob on meth and her construction skills were second to none. Boris was in love. Over time he tried to woo her, but she always rejected his advances. One day, Boris noticed the other two colonists had developed a little relationship, and wanted to share a bed together.Boris felt the rage. In the night he arrested the smart, talented lady. He strapped her to the surgeons table. He removed both of her arms.At least they will never cuddle in bed.Boris was not a violent man - but he was a ♥♥♥♥ing good surgeon.			"

								RimWorld is a game of survival and management where you are stranded on a foreign planet post-shipwreck, with limited supplies and only a few survivors to work with. You don't control your colonists directly (except during combat), but rather provide jobs for them to do and you set up what jobs each colonist is allowed to do in the ""Work"" tab. You will need to build shelter, find food, defend yourself against hostile tribes, and keep your colonists from going insane. The amount of crazy mishaps that can happen in this RW are what truly keeps things interesting. Similar to Dwarf Fortress your colonists can go insane after being put under extreme loads of emotional stress, causing them to snap. RW was initially released in 2013, outside of steam, and has been steadily improving ever since. The game feels very complete and is already packed with enough content to keep you entertained for weeks. There's already a decent modding community too, which is one of RW's strongest selling points at the moment. I've put over 140 hours into this game at the time of writing this review, and I've still not seen and done everything.GameplayYou begin the game with all of your colonists standing around in a pile of resources. The first steps to survival are building houses for your colonists to live in and growing crops or hunting for food. After covering the basics, you must decide what you'll do next. Will you create some storehouses, maybe a freezer to keep your food from rotting? Will you set up some defensive walls or traps to keep your crew safe from invasions? Or maybe you'll decide that crafting a masterwork-quality chess table made entirely out of marble is more important than anything else at the moment. After awhile, you will begin to experience raids from outsiders. This can be anything from a few guys with clubs and bows, to a heavily-armed force of armored, gun-wielding pirates. Characters in this game benefit from cover around corners of buildings or behind objects like sandbags, rocks or trees. During combat, you will usually ""draft"" each individual person and control them directly, otherwise your colonists will generally carry out their normal tasks rather than actually go out and fight the raiders. You can just move a character behind some cover and let them fire away, or control their every action and micromanage them like you would in a real-time strategy. If you're not a big fan of intense micromanagement, you also have the option to throw down turrets and watch the raiders get torn to ribbons while you kick back and relax. It all depends on how difficult you made your starting scenario, really, since primitive tribesmen don't really have access to automated gun turrets. The raids will continue to grow in size as your colony's wealth increases, making the game steadily more challenging as you play.Your colonists don't just lose HP when they're hurt either, individual parts of their body are wounded. For instance if a colonist is shot with a gun, it might wound their torso or permanently shoot off one of their fingers. Your men can lose eyes, hands, legs, and even organs. Don't worry, after installing a few peg-legs, hook-hands, and golden eyeballs your colonists will be as good as new. Diseases have immunity rates, characters can develop permanent psychological conditions like dementia, and they can even start off with old battle-scars or health conditions like asthma or clogged arteries. This level of depth can be seen in virtually every aspect of RimWorld, and is one of the main draws to the game.Currently the game's primary objective is to build a spaceship to escape the planet for good. You actually get to build the ship piece by piece, too. However, leaving the planet is ultimately up to you to decide. In RimWorld, you make your own objectives, you decide what it means to ""win"". Maybe your goal is to survive endlessly and build a huge, impressive, impenetrable fortress that will last for decades. RimWorld is moreso a sandbox game than one with a strict, singular goal. As gameplay updates comes out and modders get more creative, I imagine there will be more goals as well. Compared to Dwarf FortressRimWorld takes a lot of inspirations from DF, but it is by no means the same game. First of all RW does not have strata (Z-Layer), everything occurs on a single elevation, which means you cannot dig underground or climb on top of mountains. DF is an incredibly complex experience with virtually-bottomless gameplay depth, while RW is a lot more basic by comparison. RW has plenty of depth and content to keep you entertained for potentially hundreds of hours, but comparing RW to DF is like comparing an Olympic swimming pool to the Atlantic ocean. Both are fun, both have depth, one is just on an entirely new scale. I don't think it's a fair comparison, because RW is not trying to be DF, it just took inspirations from it. It is also worth noting that RW is fairly easy to get into compared to DF. People often find DF daunting due to it's cryptic interface and vague visual style. However even without watching tutorials or reading guides, an absolute beginner will understand the basics of survival in RW.Unlike DF where huge droves of migrants regularly come in from out of the blue, RW expects you to use it's prisoner system to obtain more colonists. Sure there are a few random events that give you a new colonist here and there, but if you really want a big crew you'll have to take prisoners. Opponents who fall in battle can be captured and taken to a prison cell that you build. From there, they will need medical treatment and food. Once healed up, one of your colonists will act as a 'Warden' who can chat with the inmate and attempt to recruit them. Recruiting can take a long time, and is harder for some than others, during this time your prisoner will use up valuable time and resources. You may also choose to release them, execute them, or just ignore them and sell them off to traders as a slave later on. This system is very cool, as it allows you to sort of pick who you recruit rather than just getting handed a completely random colonist you may not even want.AestheticsWhen I originally checked out RW on steam and saw the artstyle, I was immediately disgusted. Everyone looks like hideous blobs of flesh, everything and everyone is ugly. It's like Prison Architect but worse in every imaginable way. Even as someone who doesn't really care about graphics, I legitimately find the artstyle to be both disturbing and distracting. I understand that it was designed to be simple, but there's a fine line between low-quality graphics and zero-effort visual garbage. The developer has said the artstyle is final, sadly, so don't expect the game to get prettier overnight just because it's in early access. Thankfully the game is very mod-friendly, and there are already mods to alter the visuals.The audio on the other hand, is great. RW has one of the most beautiful and cozy videogame soundtracks I've ever heard. I absolutely love RW's music. It's got a really good cowboys-in-space feel to it with some nice tribal beats to fit the uncharted-planet-survival theme, and a few of the tracks remind me of Earthbound or Faster Than Light. The music is dynamic too: relaxing and calm while you're building and managing your colony, then switches to a more upbeat track during combat sequences. The sound effects are decent as well, nothing stands out too strong aside from the occasional alert sound of a colonist dying from an extreme infection from an improperly treated gunshot wound, or the sound of a party ending -- which both use the same exact alert sound, because apparently the developer has a twisted sense of humor.Rating: A			"

								Well, you'd say, ""30 dollars for a singleplayer game, just out of early acess? Never!"" Well, let me tell you, Rimworld is the most amazing, indepth colony simulator out there. Birthed from the ideas of Dwarf Fortress (except with updated, Prison-architect-like graphics!), both the game, its creator(s) and the community surrounding it since early alphas is superb. It will have you go through an entirely different storyline of colonists every playthrough, in every enviornment you can throw on your poor three crash landers. Although its gone through its array of bugs, unbalances, and old graphics thrown out, this is very well the current peak of it's development -- With even better to come. If you're looking for a game you could play for hundreds of hours, investing in events ranging from blissful peace to pure destruction and insanity of your colony, this is it.			"

								So I had my colony of Fawge Town thriving. Technology was good, chokepoint was good. But then something happened that at the time i didn't believe was a big deal. Toxic Fallout. Stay inside otherwise you and your animals will get sick over time, collapse and die. Anyway I didnt give it much thought. However only 4 days had passed when I realised the food was running out. And the only food source I had left were my three huskies and pet Panther. It was a hard choice but I had to slaughter one of my dogs and prepare her meat so that the rest of the colony could survive.. for two more days.Day 6 I had run out of food again and this time I had to slaughter another Husky and my pet Panther which had helped me defend the colony from many raids. The day after their sacrifice was made the toxic fallout ended.. And their deaths were in vain. I have not played a game that made me think so hard on a decision. I seriously thought my colony was going to starve to death. If I make it - It's going to be for those poor huskies and pet panther =(			"

								Rimworld, the 2D colony-building simulator by Tynan Sylvester is justifiably one of the most anticipated releases of July 2016, which had a huge following way before it arrived on steam. Boasting a rich gameplay that you can mold to your liking – be it tougher, easier, or just plain sandbox where you get to build a pretty base, it is sure to please the fans of the colony management genre easily. I know I am one – I bought the game from the site in August 2015 and easily DROPPED OVER 300 HOURS IN IT before it launched on steam.If you hate reading, these are my 15 mins of honey-mouthing the game on youtube (and for a good reason at that!): 


YouTube™ Video: Rimworld Alpha 14 and so on and so forth - well worth the buy! 

			Views: 117		

			Yeah... just listen to me honey-mouthing a game for 15 minutes... Because it deserves it!		

So, in true fashion of my reviews, let’s take a look at the GOOD and the BAD.The GOOD:1. The gameplay – I will never get tired of saying that, to me, the gameplay is everything – and the gameplay of Rimworld is downright amazing. The developer has made the best Colony Management sandbox game and let the player mold it to his or her liking.2. Selectable storyteller – I would like to make it clear that “Storyteller” is a rather vague term in Rimworld. It simply represents the dangers that the game will throw at you and thus create a “story” about your colony. Phoebe allows for easier base-building (although on higher levels the dangers are just slightly weaker than Cassandra), and Randy just does whatever he feels like – including early poison/psychic ships.3. Selectable difficulty – depending on the chosen storyteller, you have 5 difficulty levels that will shape your adventure, including a permadeath option that saves the game at regular intervals, and if your colony dies, that’s it.4. Selectable starting position – since Rimworld creates exactly that – an entire world, you get to choose your starting position from a plethora of tiles, ranging from tropical forests through deserts or tundras, to ice caps. Every single square of the terrain is generated for you to play on – and all of them have their specific climate, flora, fauna and geography.5. Selectable scenarios – the game gives you three base scenarios and THE FREAKING ABILITY to MAKE YOUR OWN – you get to select how many people will start with what, under what conditions and so on and so forth!6. Selectable playing map size consisting of the exact terrain you chose to land on – ranging from fertile plains to desert wastes and  impassable mountains. You may also find some abandoned buildings to claim and thrive in!7. The map of the colony is dynamic – you are not set in a static environment where nothing changes. The map is teeming with life (unless you are on a polar cap), and can spawn various events based on the climate, the storyteller, or the weather – like dry thunderstorms, flashstorms, heavy rain, heat waves, cold snaps, and so on and so forth.8. A plethora of resources for you to exploit and use to improve your base, ranging from mineable ores to harvestable trees and tameable animals. Want to have a chicken farm? Sure! Want to have a turtle farm? Yep! Want to have a kitty or a doggy? Or both?! Or many of those?! YOU CAN!9. Meaningful research tree consisting of lots and lots of techs, adapted to the scenario you selected, or made up for yourself – in of itself, this adds another layer of management to the game, because based on what you research the game will take a certain shape. You can choose to forego early good clothing and brew beer and make your colonists happy – or rush electricity and geothermal power to give them early boost to electricity and have them live in more pleasant conditions. It is all up to you.10. Meaningful interactions between the colony and the surrounding world – the game generates a number of tribes, outlander towns and pirate bases, with which you can develop relations – be it good or bad. Sending gifts and releasing people belonging to a faction will raise their opinion of you, which in term can have them send help when you need it the most – or you can just plain anger them, kill them, and sell their flesh and skin (read: leather) for lots and lots of silver. And if that wasn’t enough, there is even the ability to TRADE with these people or even signal passing spaceships and buy or sell wares to or from them!11. Very deep strategic layer – everything from selecting your place in the world, through your starting colonist skills, to how will you play the game involves a huge amount of thinking and strategical planning. Every single aspect of the game ties so well together, it is insane. A single oversight may cost you a valuable colonist, or maybe even half your village. The game actually rewards good play, and punishes mistakes – and to its credit, not unfairly.12. Lots of ways to create an awesome looking base with lots of colors and beautification items constructed by the colonists – you are only limited by your imagination!13. Awesome value for the money – even at its price tag of 28€/30$, this game is an awesome experience, and an awesome value for the money. I dumped over 300 hours in this game and I see multiplying that play time by a ton.14. A lot of heart – last but not least, you will feel really attached to your colonists, and be happy for them when they thrive, or sad when they die or get badly injured. That is, unless you like seeing your minions suffer, in which case you can start counting the amount of limbs, noses and toes that they will lose throughout the game…And now, to take a look at the BAD.1. HUGE learning curve – if you are just starting Rimworld, I would suggest you play at a low difficulty level and get used to the game as much as you can. You really need to set a good system of farming, security, joy and safety going and improve it as you progress through the higher difficulty levels. Rimworld is a game of pain and suffering, in which the smallest oversight can wipe out half your colony.2. The soundtrack, while very relaxing and pleasant to listen to, needs to be expanded, as themes will often repeat – to the point where you may simply opt to reduce the volume to 0 and play your own music.3. No diagonal structures – hardcore builders may be rather♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the fact that they have a square grid to play with, and no diagonal walls and structures, which make some shapes look kind of weird, blocky and quirky.4. Very late game needs optimization - you may experience some game lag on very big maps with lots of items (be it animate or inanimate) on them. To its credit, the game does warn you of that, but it clearly needs more optimization.5. On a more jovial note... Torch lamps are OP man - you are really hitting 2 stones with 1 bird - not only your colonists lose the ""in the darkness"" debuff, but the temperature in the room gets raised by a few degrees. Nerf em! NOW!CONCLUSION:Grab this game without a second thought if you are a fan of any of these genres: colony simulation, colony management, base-building, city-building, or are a fan of games that allow you to get very creative in a sandbox environment. Even in its current alpha state, you will get a great value for your money, and I expect it to receive glowing, and well-deserved recommendations from both reviewers and critics. You owe it to yourself to try it and experience it.			"

								My most resent set up of Rim World was my best and my worst. I started out great. Got electricity. I had plenty of food. I had two cash crops “corn that became simple meals and herbal meds” that I was selling to the traders. Even got up to 7 people Everything was going great. Till one day. It was like every other day. Just a normal day. I just got through the hard summer and now in the fall with no heat injuries, which was a first. Everything was looking up. Then a Raid came. I have already been through a bunch. So, I knew the drill. I had sandbags already lined up in a defensive positon. I posted up all my people. All in the right spots. They all had great weapons for that point in the game. Snipers, and LMG. What made this raid different was something I did not see till it was too late. I normally check the enemy’s weapons to know what I a dealing with. But I missed one enemy, and guess what that mother f**Ker had. “FRAG GERANDES”. We starting firing. I got two of the three down. I had this in the bag till that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ threw that grenade and killed two of my colonist. It was now a bad day. One was a best friend and a fiancé. The other was a best friend to the whole group. I was also upset. I lost a great builder that day and a great craft’s man. I had to re-group the rest of the team to prepare for the big mood drops. I had to hold them together. After the hard winter and three colonists going bezerk. The winter was finally over. We hit the spring with the colonist were almost done with their mood drops. I was getting happy that we made it through with no more people dying. Plus, we even had a new couple get married. But what I learn is that Rim World is not for happy endings. The first heat wave was setting in. the problem is that this one was the worst. I had two coolers for the colonists, but it was not enough. They were going down with heat strokes. I was getting worried. But I kept my drive. I quickly threw in that new cooler, but it was not fast enough.  With only one to two more days left on that mood drop. The heat wave took out 3 of my last 5. My last two were pushing, but then the worst came. One of my last two ran out to mine something. She went down. I made my last guy go save her. I was lucky too. He knew some medical skill. I thought I could first save my doc then the rest. But then that red flashy box drops down. “MAD F**KING AMIANL.” I was like RUUUNNNNNN!!!!!, but that animal caught up to him. It bit him and he went down. All my colonist was unable to walk. I watched in shock for 10secs before I turned off my computer. I was hurt that my best colony ended up with the worst ending. The moral of the story is to f**king check every enemy, because those freaking FRAG GRENADES ARE NO JOKE. :’’( "

Early Access Review
								It's Dwarf Fortress for those of us who were always interested in its concept, but couldn't get through the ASCII wall and the learning curve, in a space setting that's heavily inspired by Firefly (so there are a multitude of worlds with varying degrees of technology advancement, and you're going to see people from all sorts of backgrounds). You're in charge of guiding a group of colonists through their trials and tribulations in one of the titular Rim Worlds; distant, isolated planets lacking in strong central government and low in population density, and your job is to get them to stay alive long enough to... do whatever you want, really. There is a clear ""end game"" goal here (build / access a ship and escape the planet), but the real fun of the game comes from developing your base in whatever way you want, for as long as you can, while surviving the ever-escalating threats that the AI will throw at you.Both in art style and construction-oriented gameplay, the game is immediately reminiscent of Prison Architect, but Rimworld is much more than that, as it's also packing a surprisingly deep combat system that demands careful planning, both while building and during combat itself, if you want your colonists to live to see another day. The AI ""storytellers"", a concept not unlike L4D's ""director"", ensures that you meet a level of challenge that, at the very least, will give you a memorable tale to share after your colonists' demise.And when the time comes and your colonists die, you WILL feel it. There are many, many easy / dumb ways to die in this game, and learning about them is part of the experience; you'll just HAVE to tell your friends about the one animal handler who died in combat, only to have one of his pets go mad from grief and butcher one of your colonists, or the colonist that sacrificed his life so you could learn about cave-ins the hard way, or the dangers of running a drug operation in a colony full of stressed people fearing for their lives...If there's one negative aspect about it, it's the fact that its tutorial is simply not good enough. Many important mechanics are barely mentioned or not even touched upon (setting work priorities manually is one such glaring omission); losing colonists because of mistakes you're aware of or gambles gone wrong is fine, but having them die because you didn't understand a part of the UI is frustrating, and there may be a lot of that if you don't go looking for tips before diving in too deep.Overall though, it's an amazing game. It's in Early Access not because of it being a buggy mess, unplayable or imbalanced; it's simply there to let buyers know that there's still more content being added to it, and the end of early access will mean the end of development for the game. I can't recommend this game enough, it's absolutely worth it at full price!			"

								So, I just realized I've had this game for 4 weeks and as a result, have a ridiculous amount of playtime on record. I regret nothing. I am absolutely, head over heels, 100% in love with this game. If you like city builders, if you like management and simulation, if you are anything like me and like games that you can play while you binge watch Parks and Recreation -- this is the game for you.The depth of this game surpasses first looks - its mechanics are similar to Prison Architect - people, moods, needs - coupled with the resources and supply lines (like Banished) that need to be overseen in order to complete tasks. At the same time, the breadth of the game creates the charm and engagement of Stardew Valley - skill trees and backstories of the tiny characters create another layer that you can dig into.... or not - one of my characters was paralyzed/braindead after to a gun fight and I tirelessly searched for a brain implant so he could return to work. It was amazing. It can be an epic colony, extravagantly decorated with all desired amenities or it can be a derelict barrack built for war. The base game is still early access, but everything in the game is smooth and there is plenty to do.If you enjoy additional control over the creation of your colony, or if you would liketo add in more options and asthetic possibilities - the mod community is very active and I have added 40+ playtime hours and counting with the ones I've downloaded.I'm excited to see what the developer includes in the future - this is a wonderful game, and I would recommend it to everyone.

								 Dingus...  Dingus was a great shot and he loved to spend time in the garden. He had a sister named blackhat. One day the battery room exploded leading to a terrible fire that spread out of control quickly. The other 2 colonists (good friends who we've had from the start) heroically fought the blaze and both died doing so. We had 2 prisoners in a small outbuilding at the edge of the settlement, seeing that the fire would soon reach there building and either burn them to death or set them free    blackhat executed them.  Not being able to stop the fire We prepaired for the end. Suddenly at the last second just before the last few buildings went up, it started raining, saving what was left.  With a few small buildings left, brother and sister were still alive but starving. In desperation dingus and blackhat to my utter disgust grabbed the executed prisoners(the fire never did reach the prison building) and set the corpses on the dining table and ate them raw.   After that it got really bad...  Blackhat , already upset at seeing her friends burn to death and executing 2 people that in the end, did not need to be killed, snapped. She just couldnt get over eating raw human flesh to survive.  She took off into the hills with her knife killing every little critter that crossed her path leaving a bloody trail of rampage and little corpses. dingus takes off after her. She aproaches 2 panthers and headlessly attacks them with her knife. dingus is almost to her. Blackhat is ripped apart by the 2 panthers just as her brother reaches her, forntunatly she badly crippled them both. Dingus finishes the job, digs a grave for his sister, but because of his absolute refusal to haul things,has to watch his sister slowly rot mere feet from her grave..  I knew this would be the end.. No human mind A I or otherwise could cope with all this trauma. The death the cannibalism, the horrible irony of watching a loved one rot because of your own lazienes.  Sure enough Dingus's mood was done in. had had a full mental breakdown  tore off all his clothes and just walked away from it all. Close to the end now soon he'll starve to death or get mauled by a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of turkey or somthing.  ..  but .. whats this?? a crashed crate full of.. DRUGS!   crashed right as I came out of my stupour. right in front of me.  well ♥♥♥♥ it lets smoke some.               1 year later 6 ppl in the colony now and things going well   dingus (while stoned out of his tree) saved a girl being chased by raiders and we've made new friends from there..  mostley dingus has come back from his drug addiction and is leading a full life.  Only thing is.. we cant get medicine,  we cant grow healthroot (no one has skill high enough) and past few traders to come through maddengly dont have any.                  Dingus catches malaria and dies in bed.   buried next to his sister in the grave he could never finish... Would be saved by last minute drug addiction only to die of malaria a year later again... 11/10			"

								I'm not really sure what I'm doing, food is running low, people are getting depressed from how bad the accomodations are on this planet. I mean, what do you expect? We are living in a small alcove carved out from the sheer mountain wall in a desolate alien planet, it's no Ritz Carlton... My main hunter got sad from sleeping on the hard rocky floor for too many nights in a row. He threw his rifle on the floor, took off his shirt and pants off and started wandering outside, eventually fixating on a wild turkey and followed him around for days. I wonder why he decided to do this?Rimworld is an attempt to replicate a semblance of Dwarf Fortress's complexity with actual GRAPHICS. I've always felt DF was one of those games that was much more fun to read about rather than play, somewhat like Eve online. From what I understand Rimworld doesn't come close to emulating DF level complexity, but it is extremely intricately detailed in its own right.Injuries are simulated all over the body(To the level that a guy can have his right ring finger bitten off by a beaver), colonists have their own personalities and wants/ skills, as well as unique traits. These make all the colonists feel more like real people as they have a semblance of personality, for example some of them won't really mind living in squalor, while others want an extravagant bedroom or nice chairs or something. You can assign tasks but not all of them can do everything so optimizing job priorities is a large part of the game's challenge. Colonists will develop relationships with one another, ranging from falling in love alll the way hating one another and starting fights. You really get the sense that yes, you can tell them what to do but they are their own self contained entities with wants and needs that require management or else on day they'll decide, ""♥♥♥♥ it, I'm out"" and start stabbing and eating everyone else or something.Combat is more interesting too, with cover based shooting, melee combat, automated turrets, traps, etc. It is much more complex than the standard ""Right click on someone and go hit him"" of other similar games.Rimworld's graphics are the simplistic, charming Prison Architect style, with similar mechanics in ""zoning"" and construction mechanics. This game has been in development for years and it shows, there are plenty of features and mechanics in this game, as well as a distinct lack of bugs (so far).My one complaint is that there isn't much of an in game tutorial, but there is a helpful advice message system which helped me out a lot. Still, I would've preferred a small mini campaign like in Prison Architect so I can at least get a general idea what I should prioritize and what I should work towards, but I'm sure this information will come with time as I mess around in the game more.Highly recommend this if you like colony simulators, it's amazing!

Early Access Review
								This is a long review, so I'll start by jumping to the conclusion:Rimworld is a graphically appealing colony management game, set on a distant world, with a strong 'wild west' vibe. If you enjoy colony management games with a good balance between strategic depth and fun, then this is a game worth checking out!Now for the wordy bit of the review:To be clear, this game was given to me over a year ago by the developer, and again, recently I was offered an opportunity to play the steam release a few days ahead of the official unveiling (Alpha 14) That being said, I'm an avid fan of the colony management genre and judge the game against the likes of Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Prison Archetect, and even the oldies like Startopia and Dungeon Keeper. First, let's get the comparison to Dwarf Fortress out of the way; Rimworld is not as complicated as DF. But then, what game could ever claim that? But Rimworld does an amazing job of distilling the fun from the complexity. You will find yourself building traps to blunt raider attacks, large industrial areas, prioritising research and even delving into animal husbandry. Whatever you do, it'll focus more on being a game, than a complex world simulation.That said, there's a lot of strategy involved, it just never feels like fun is taking a back seat to it!The visual aesthetic closely resembles Prison Architect, so if you're familiar with that game, and enjoy the art style, then you'll find a lot to like about Rimworld's clean, sometimes cartoony graphics. Rimworld also boasts some amazing audio assets and impressively atmospheric music that really helps to set the mood in the game!The difficulty is highly customisable, and combined with the detailed scenario editor, allows you to tailor each game to suite your particular skill level. Want steadily rising levels of tension and challenge as you play? Then pick an AI storyteller that will emphasise dramatic pacing and adjust in game events to match your situation, keeping you on your toes but never throwing truly impossible odds your way. Want a relaxed experience where you can focus on learning the game? Pick (or create) a scenario that affords you a generous set of starting conditions, and an AI story teller who will give you plenty of time to prepare or recover from each event... the game can be as brutal, or as gentle as you want it to be! :)Finally, as for longevity, without even touching on the topic of modding (Rimworld has one of the most rich and active modding communities I've seen in these kinds of games!) the base Rimworld experience offers enough potential to adjust your game and starting conditions that I find it unlikely that anyone will grow bored. There's enough strategy involved in making a successful colony, and enough difference to be found in the various events that might occur, that you're virtually guaranteed a different experience each time you play.In my opinion Rimworld is a solid example of a colony management/simulation game, where the raw fun of the game has not been hidden beneath the complexity of the simulation, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any fan of the genre.

								This game is best described as either a casual version of dwarf fortress or a hardcore version of the sims.  The style of the game is very similar to Dwarf Fortress.Like in DF, losing is fun.  It's how you learn.  While it's not nearly as ""deep"" (i.e. convoluted) as DF, there are certainly a lot of things to learn.  But unlike DF, the GUI does a good job of communication and everything is pretty much self explanatory.  My favorite resident so far was a 81 year old bounty hunter who was the best sniper I've ever seen.  We rescued her from a band of pirates.  She eventually went deaf, but never really minded it.  My least favorite was a belligerent pyromaniac who hated everyone. I don't allow pyros in my colonies anymore.			"

								I rarely write reviews and most of them are just for fun, but this is probably the best sandbox game I've ever played so far. If you played Banished, Timber and Stone, Factorio, Dwarf Forest, Prison Architect you're gonna like it.What's inside it: Lots of replayability. Scenario System and difficulty settings makes every colony(or tribe) different from each other, thus providing the player with ability to customize the game as you want to. You can even create and download scenarios from other players in workshop. Tons of content. And I mean it. Game will never get boring even in the mid and late game, especially if you'll choose challenging difficulty to spice up the gameplay with some action. If you want to have more content workshop has it all. Alongside with that you have Interactive World, which will be harsh, just like the real world, but that what makes this game even more interesting.So don't let the Early Access scare you! Even if the devs will stop releasing updates it's already in a very good shape and the community makes it even better.TL;DR Just buy it already, you won't regret it			"

Early Access Review
								I think it's valuable to have a review from someone who just bought the game and not just those who have been hooked on it for years- and I can say confidently that this is one of the best games I've played in a long time. Full disclosure- I'm a long time Dwarf Fortress player, so:1) If you like DF, you will love this game.2) Don't let that scare you if you couldn't get into DF, see the accessability section below.ACCESSABILITY / DIFFICULTYComing from zero experience, it was easy to learn the game (if you don't mind losing a couple times, which I found fun). The UI is very intuitive and easy after a bit of clicking around, there are helpful pop-ups to guide you. Those complaining about a lack of a tutorial must just want everything spoon-fed to them.GAMEPLAYIf you like simulations, colony builders, that sort of thing, this is for you. It is deep, but I really think this game could open the genre to new audiences. If you don't like having to try more than once, twice, three times to understand how to be successful, this is not for you.GRAPHICSThey're good. Not the game's selling point, but suffice to say they're better than they need to be. SOUNDRimworld has a very space-western vibe, and that comes through especially in the sound. I love Firefly, so it was very appealing to me. DEV SUPPORTAgain, I just bought the game, but the developer seems very committed to his players. There are suggestion threads on Reddit that he browses.EARLY ACCESSAs stated in the description, there are little to no bugs. I haven't noticed any, at least.OVERALLIt's #1 on the Steam Top Sellers (at time of writing) for a reason. It's amazingly well-designed. It has great replayability for those second, third, fourth attempts. What are you waiting for?			"

								Rimworld is a complex story driven colony survival simulator with (pausable) real time tactical combat, which needs more than 2 brain cells to play. It's also a proof of concept that a good game doesn't need good graphics. Don't get me wrong it's not ugly, but it's not a beauty either.Instead it draws its immersion and credibility from simulating a lot of things that most games would ignore. It gives you freedom of choice, with lots of (moral) decisions. It has a huge replayability by telling a unique story with different events each time you play.Every colonist is unique, based on childhood and adulthood stories they will have or lack skills, traits and enthusiasm in certain skills. Each colonist can have his/her own customised priorities for tasks, daily schedules and outfits. Making it possible to specialize people for specific tasks.Every colonist has a simulated psyche. Certain events will improve or worsen their mood. Having a good meal and all basic needs fulfilled will boost their mood. Seeing a person die or many corpses lying around will worsen their mood. This however is also based on their traits. A psychopath will not mind the death of others, while someone with bloodlust will even like it. Masochists will enjoy pain. A ""Green thumb"" will get a bit of happiness for every crop they sew. And it's not always the enemy attacks that will kill you. Often the most critical times are after fights when your colonists are wounded and about to break from the mental stress. Mentally breaking can lead people to going crazily wandering around, leaving the colony or even going berserk. There are so many things to take into consideration, like the beauty and space size of an area, or the quality of beds and furniture which will all affect the mood of colonists.Every colonist has a body with simulated limbs and organs. Each part can be damaged or destroyed. Each part is responsible for either manipulation, movement, consciousness, eyesight, hearing, blood filtration, blood pumping etc. Those abilities are bound to the colonist's performance. A cook with only one arm and one eye would be terribly slow at cooking. An old person with only one kidney will most likely not survive an infection, or a sickness. Luckily there are (expensive) implants and bionics to compensate in the mid-late game. You can also take the morally low road and harvest needed organs from prisoners, which will negatively influence the psyche of every non-psycho in the colony. It is also technically possible to build a bionic superhuman that has most abilities improved, for a very high price of resources.Had a nudist woman once who felt constrained by her cloths so I let her run naked. She got an instant mood boost for that. Got into a fight and took a bullet to the right lung. Survived the fight and got stitched up by a doc, but left with only one lung she was permanently slowed down afterwards. I took one lung from a pirate prisoner and implanted it into her. Had the whole colony mentally on the edge for days for having harvested organs from people ...This and many other stories derive from the game's wonderful complexity. It produces more immersion than most other games which just look great, but are simply dead inside.Im playing this game since 2 years now but it never gets boring. The storyteller will trigger events every now and then, which will force you to adapt to new situations. Be it a sudden solar flare, a sun eclipse, a pack of manhunting animals, a toxic fallout which will kill everything outside not under a roof, a pirate / natives / mechanoids attack, or a fallen chunk of ancient spaceship sending out psychic waves, driving every colonist crazy the longer you wait. The game gets constantly updated with new events which will keep it exciting for a long time.Had an ancient spaceship fallen into the map, started to screw my colonists mentally. Shortly afterwards a group of natives entered the map and prepared for an attack. I sent my fastest colonist with a gun to the crashed ship and shot it. From the damage it spawned it's mechanoids, which angered some of the natives nearby. I retreaded my colonist and just watched the show. Part of the natives were fighting the mechs, the other part was on their way to my base. At that point a pack of manhunting boomrats also entered the map and started to attack the natives. Also one hare turned crazy and ran to my base (monty python anyone?) It was an epic fight, seeing all my enemies neutralizing themselves. In the end I just had to shoot the hare, while the remaining natives were fighting exploding boomrats and retreating in the end. Got a lot of loot for free. It was a good day.The difficulty is customisable both by choosing a different story teller & hardness but also by choosing a biome. Each biome plays like a different game. In a tropical area you have a lot of wood, food and animals, while possibly getting malaria and sleeping sickness. In a tundra or desert environment you have to worry about the temperature. Too cold and you can not plant anything and people might freeze to death, while most things won't spoil quickly. Grow your food in hydroponics (which are expensive and have to be researched first)  inside a warm room. This overall consumes a lot of energy. Too hot and people might get heat strokes and foot will spoil quickly when not cooled. A freezer room is required to keep food cooled here. This also defines the outfit to wear. Parkas and toques in cold biomes to keep warm, while cowboy hats and leather coats in hot biomes to keep cool.Gears and weapons are degrading, especially when stored outside. They are also craftable and the quality will depend on the crafters skill. Different gear will protect different body parts and are based by their quality values. However, research is needed for most technologies before they can be build. Trading with other factions or space traders will get you the other stuff you need. It is also possible to tame animals with a high enough skill. Those can be bred and herded for meat, egg, milk, fur, wool or leather production. The building mechanics are fairly simple, closing off an area with walls/and a door will generate a roof. (house) Mining rooms into a mountain with no support in between will let the roof collapse. For those comparing it with prison architect, it is a lot easier to build rooms or add to an existing room. I would even say it delivers a way stronger game experience with just 10 colonists than prison architect with its 100-300+ inmates & staff.It is possible to micro every colonist whenever needed on daily tasks (unlike in Banished). During attacks colonists are able to be drafted and controlled directly. Fights have a cover based system where positioning your pawns behind walls, sandbags, trees, or even stone chunks will give them more or less cover. The only thing that is bothering is the amount of friendly fire. So make sure nobody is standing in the line of fire. In every fight there is a possibility that enemies are not killed, but incapacitated. Those can be captured and taken as prisoners. What you do with them is up to your moral compass. You can either treat them right, heal their wounds and try to convince them to join your colony, or you can simply sell them to a slave trader, or harvest their organs.However bare in mind that it can be a slow game at times (fast forward is possible) and may not be easy to understand at first. But if you give it some time to learn it you will be rewarded with a great experience.Rimworld is by far my favorite game since 2 years. It gives the player a lot of possibilities, with a love for details. It is kept interesting for a long time thanks to the event storyteller system. If you like games like Dungeon Keeper, Startopia, Dwelvers, Evil Genius, Dwarven Fortress, Prison Architect, War for the Overworld or Space Colony, you will probably love Rimworld.			"

City building/clan management is my absolute favorite genre, and RimWorld is one of the best out there. Easily in the top three of all time. While the asking price seems steep - it's really not. In fact, if I wouldn't have recieved a Steam key, I would have repurchased, no questions asked. It is that good.There is so much in this sandbox. Everything is just butter and works together so well. The user interface is crisp and everything is so intuitive. The way the whole system works together allows for so many layers of complexity that you could play this forever, and it wouldn't really get redundant. The developers have somehow pulled off this amazing trick of keeping in-game options fairly generic as to decrease having to sift through layers and layers of menus, but also somehow not making it boring by only having 2 or 3 styles of chairs. The replayability is sky high. It's crazy.Of course there is a learning curve - you have to expect that with any game that is going to really be worth it. You invest some time and trust me it pays dividends in pure entertainment. It is a shame that so many people (I was one of them) think this is associated with/ripping off Prison Architect because of the art style. Yeah, it is similiar, but that is where the comparison ends. So just get that out of your head right now.With each colony I create, the experience is surreal. The music and events and dialogue all really suck me into whats going on. The night and day cycles create these great shadows that remind me of amazing summer evenings. They just did this really right.Pros:+Honestly, this game is close to perfect as far as being a clan management sim with a procedural story that is drastically different everytime+Music is some of the best I've heard for a game like this+Graphics are super crisp+User interface is awesome - great balance of everything being very functional without clutter+Metric tons of content and replayability+Very much worth every penny of that thirty bucks+Fairly easy to learn considering the depth and possibility+Artwork and graphics overall and top-notchCons:-I hate that it is confused with Prison ArchitectIf you are into clan management games - don't worry about the high price tag - get this game as soon as you can! It will probably actually save you money because it will consume your gaming time instead of buying new titles lol.			"

								I've heard so many people say that this game is like Dwarf Fortress mixed together with Prison Architect. Is that true? Probably. But having played both those games, I would have to say this is more like something else altogether. I've had this game for a long time; much longer than it has been on Steam. If you're looking for a game that delivers on the Early Access promises then stop here, buy this game, and go have fun for hours on end. Watch as your settlers fall in love. Cry as they get mowed down by raiders. Laugh as the pyromaniac sets fire to your kitchen. Chase elephants off your medical crops with a light machine-gun. Start it all again when the sun sets.			"

								It is hard to tell that this game is in early access because there is already so much content and it is so much fun! The Firefly aesthetic is simply brilliant, the music is cool and the game-play is so addictive. As I play the game, I frequently find that I have difficulty in finding a good point to stop playing. I'm always thinking to myself, 'just one more day'! After 100+ hours, I still feel like I am learning the game and haven't experienced everything. Just to remind you, this game is supposed to be early access and in alpha! Rimworld has various ways to customise the difficulty, which I really appreciate, so you can set the level of challenge that suits you. By adjusting the AI storyteller personalities and the difficulty setting, you can take your pick from relaxing base-building game to super hard permadeath experience and, indeed, anything in between. It is worth noting that the game is absolutely ruthless in higher difficulties so if you are looking for a challenge then you will find it here!The major strength of Rimworld is that it creates awesome stories and addictive game-play that will keep you coming back for more and more. I can't recommend it enough!			"

								I think the best way of describing RimWorld is Prison Architect with more going on and less control. If this game appeals to you solely through that sentence, buy it. You'll love it. If not, then let me go into more detail.First, let's take the assumption you have seen what Prison Architect is, a top-down view with people wandering around and surviving in a realistic way, you overseeing them. This game stays true to that, just with many more hurdles.Think of it as doing a 200m Hurdle Dash. Except there is a hurdle every three steps. You could get over most of them, but a lot of them you're going to stumble through, until eventually you trip up. That is this game. Struggling through an onslaught of challenges, just making it through, until one gets you.There is room for improvement. Tutorial is non-existent, luckily I am a souper-jenius and managed to understand it from messing around, but it could require some learning to get started.The game is viartually bug-free. Which is a bonus.I'm struggling for bad points, but it's really just the Anti-Beginner Missiles. Lots of people compare it to Dwarf Fortress. I am not one of these people.			"

								It's taken me a while to write this review, because I've been (and still am) split very much 50:50 on whether to recommend this title, but on balance in the game's current state unfortunately I cannot recommend it.Certainly there are some good things here, I have over 40 hours logged because the game's world and mechanics are intriguing; the graphics have a certain charm, they are more than adequate for a game like this, and it is set in an interesting and well thought out sci-fi world. Unfortunately I kept finding myself underwhelmed by the content and options that the game actually presented me with.I should state that I have played and enjoyed Dwarf Fortress, and I am a big fan of permadeath and Roguelikes in general - I have ascended in and even contributed to Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, which by the way is a free and awesome game so go download it now if you haven't played it :)The problem for me with RimWorld is that while there is a really interested structure of a game here, that structure has not been fleshed out with enough meat. For something that has been in development for nearly 3 years this is quite worrying, especially with the apparent pace of updates released by the developer. I really do hope to eventually be able to change my review, what needs to change for that to happen is that the mechanics need to feel rounded out in the core game without relying on mods. Certainly there are mods available that fix many of my concerns with the current gameplay, but £23 is rather a lot for a title that then requires mods to turn it into something resembling a complete experience.I'll conclude this review by listing some specific things that I think badly need addressing; going through this list it becomes apparent just how nearly every single mechanic in the game feels majorly lacking. Warning, some spoilers ahead, though they are very minor.1. Some bits of furniture can be ""uninstalled"" and moved to a different location, but it seems completely arbitrary which furniture this can apply to. It doesn't apply to workbenches, so if you want to move one a single square to the right you have to completely deconstruct it and rebuild it, *wasting* resources. There is a mod that makes them all movable. This mod simply switches some flags in the xml files, no more, so it would be incredibly easy for the devs to enable this (like a 10 minute job) and there doesn't seem to be any logical reason why they don't.2. Many of the workbenches have only a single option for what you can build. Would be nice to have a bit more variation, when the build queue for each bench technically alllows building many things of different types.3. Research is too expensive and makes much too big leaps. Would be nice to see a proper research tree with smaller increments of unlocking different builds, rather than typically unlocking an entire bench with all the things it can build. Weirdly there is one research option that unlocks a new type of seed to grow, but *all* the other seeds start unlocked. The research just overall seems bizarre. I can right now research (among not many other things) ""carpetmaking"" or ""ship antimatter reactor"" ... the latter only takes twice as much research as the former ... this just seems like not the right decision to be making.4. Not enough options for surgery and implants. I can harvest someone's heart or kidney but not their limbs or their eyes. I can implant bionic legs, but I can't repair a broken spine. I can't construct these bionic implants myself. It seems like half the options there. Again there is a mod that provides a whole extra set of technologies to enable all this but it just feels the vanilla tech is unfinished.5. Variation of enemies. Particular the mechanoids, there are only two types. Surely mechanoids could be even more varied than humans or critters?6. GUI. There are all kinds of odd bugs and inconsistencies and awkwardness in the GUI. Sure it's a massive improvement on DF but It *really* needs some love. There are also some basically usability things missing, for instance being able to compare the stats of two items or two characters side by side, or see a grid overview of the skills of all my colonists. When setting work priorities there is a grid where you have to hover over each cell to see the value of that specific skill, it's really awkward.7. Combat. The sometimes continual raids that the ""storyteller"" throws at you get really tedious to defend, you have to micromanage every unit, which is really jarring next to the normal gameplay which is the antithesis of micromanagement. Combat should be set up by giving colonists rallying points or patrol areas, so during a raid they will all go to those locations. Take away direct control of the units, and make the raids a bit easier to compensate. This would much better fit the gameplay of a ""colony builder"" game and be a lot more fun. Currently the best way to defend against raids is to abuse gameplay mechanics and pathing logic to direct the enemies into killboxes, which to me feels like cheating. Things need tweaking A LOT to make these firefights enjoyable. Also if you have trained any pets then they will get immediately slaughtered, probably by friendly fire. You can’t really mix melee and ranged combat at all because everyone (even those with high shooting skill) aims so badly they will just shoot your own melee dudes and pets instead of the enemy.8. Balance. The game is very hard, and switching to easier difficulties doesn't seem to change much. The ""storyteller AI"" basically decides when it wants you to die and there doesn't seem much that can be done about it. Apparently this is the point of the game. I would find these stories much more interesting if my colony had a chance to develop a bit further before inevitably getting decimated by overwhelming forces. It doesn't help that it's extremely slow and difficult to recruit new colonists, so usually losing even one or two (which is very likely to happen in any raid) is a serious detriment to any progress. Maybe I'm missing the point, but I was just not finding it enjoyable.9. Size of map, travelling to other sectors. The default map really isn't all that big, so resources are strictly finite. When you start the game you pick a spot on a *huge* world map but then you can't visit anywhere else on that map (even though factions from elsewhere can visit *you*).Well ... I think those are all my biggest gripes, I could probably think of more, but this demonstrates the scale of the problem. I could see past one or two of these flaws because there is a really interesting game underneath struggling to get out, but with this many barriers to me enjoying it I just keep not wanting to carry on with my game. I'm not sure how long it will take the devs to fix all of this, if they ever do, but we could be waiting another 3 years.			"

								Straight up, I was put off buying this because the graphics don't look that great.A few days ago, after a few drinks, I was checking my steam queue, spotted it and thought I'd give it a try - I can always refund, right?I've now played it for 28 hours in the last 3 days... DAMN! This is a really fun game, with depth, but it doesn't get massively time consuming in the resource management category.So ... my first game - this is the story of Mike, Inumi & Dave & Trixie, who is Dave's pet dog. They're the suriving crew who have crashed on a planet and need to survive.Well, other than Mike & Dave arguing over Inumi, who isn't interested in either of them, which makes them both sad, it's going ok. They even have a rifle, which Dave knows how to use.Inumi is a nudist, so prefers to run around with no clothers on. I'm not sure this is helping the community, but she's good with plants and has researched how to do stone-cutting.Mike is a vet. He's great with animals and medicine. Luckily for Dave, after he gets badly wounded by taking on a pirate raider, people are just another animal, so Mike is able to patch him up well. Oh, except for his right arm, they was shot off during the fight.Dave? He's a sherriff. Doesn't like people or fancy things, just wants to get his job done. Trickier now he only has one arm, but not impossible. He loves his pet dog, Trixie, or rather he did. She got killed in the crossfire with the raider attack. This makes Dave even more sad.Whilst I was worrying about Dave, I took my eye off what the other two were doing and then realised Trixie's corpse was gone. Huh, odd. I'm pleasantly surprised that the food situation isn't as bad as I thought though. Then I spot the ""Yorky leather"" in the stockpile. Inumi is a bit of a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥ tbh.But it's ok, another lifepod has crashed near our survivor's base and, on investigating it, it contains Dave's mother! She's wounded, but Dave carries her back to the base and Mike uses his vet skills to help Dave's mum recover.On only a few hours, Dave's mum is feeling better and gets up from the bed he loaned her. Dave is still fast asleep on the cold floor, having not got a spare bed. Dave's mum though? She goes and eats the Yorky stew for breakfast and then heads to the stockpile and helps herself to clothes and a gun, then leaves out the front door.Mike & Inumi are kinda upset, but Dave goes to deal with it. After all, he's the sherriff and, it's his mum.His mum is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about being called out and draws a knife and starts stabbing Dave. I can see why he left home now! Dave panics, and blows his mum's head off with his shotgun.This makes Dave even more sad, like really, really sad.He gets back to the base, to discover that Mike & Inumi have been chatting each other up while he dealt with killing and burying his mother. Mike & Inumi are now lovers they tell him.Dave didn't think he could get more sad. He was wrong.Still, at least Inumi has a present for him ... a nice Yorky skin cowboy hat.Dave snaps.I'm now running a single-person base, populated by a guy who is going to starve to death because is massively sad & guilty and won't come out of his room. Also he can't cook.----------This game comes up with some great and flawed characters and plays the interactions against each other beautifully.Very much recommended! :D			"

								My favourite activity to do in this game is to mine into a mountain near, or in my base. Create a very small wing in the farthest area, and put colonists that have drug addictions in there, one at a time. Of course, I give them a handfull of rations, a hydroponics tray, lights, bed, TV, and sculpting desk. Steel included, and furnish the pad. Claiming the bed as their own, I lock them behind five doors. I check on them every once in awhile, to see how they're doing. Slowly they drive themselves mad, screaming and banging on the door to be let out just to get one more hit of yayo, wakemeup, flake, or booze. By the end, they've changed. Like lobotomized patients, they leave once clean. Their hell's over. But everytime they look at the drug, they run the risk of going back in this ""decontamination"" room I made. A person named ""Ceti"" is a prime example. My place has wakemeup all over it, and, unfortunately, my favourite cultist, Levi. Is a hardcore addict of it. He NEEDS this stuff to do his godly work of research, construction, and gun-fu. But Ceti here has a chemical fascination. Every ♥♥♥♥ing night he'd go berserk because he couldn't get more Yayo, so he relied on taking Levi's wakemeup. This proved a terrible move, as every night I'd see him wasting all of my ♥♥♥♥ing drugs on overdosing himself, while levi had a strict schedule. Ceti didn't follow his. The poor ♥♥♥♥. He got locked up in my decon room. He loved it at first, a great isolated place to himself. But he quickly learned, the hydroponics tray wasn't for drugs. Oh, no. It was for cotton, for him to be a valuable member of the colony and to help grow some clothing fibres. He started to binge out on food to cope with his crippling addiction to drugs. This proved a terrible move, as he slowly fattened himself up, and then slowly starved himself as a result. The crippling pain was intense, as his only things to do were sleep, watch TV, or make grand sculptures from steel. But, he made it. Malnourished to nearly fatal levels. His drug addiction got cleared. Just as he hit the floor with his bones showing. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lived, but the next day.. He got angry because ""Oh, why is levi's room better than mine!"" and the first thing he does..? Get back on wakemeup.Poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ won't make it out this time. Freeloaders get the Decon room. Get those nasty lazy thoughts out, fill them with productive, happy thoughts. Lazy trash.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  RimWorld Status:  Early AccessDeveloper:  Ludeon StudiosPublisher:  Ludeon StudiosGenre:  Survival StrategyRelease Date:  16th of July, 2016Type:  Single-player General ImpressionI grew up playing Starcraft and Startopia. PC games which shaped the strategy genre at the turn of the new millennium. Both games portray Sci-Fi colonial ambitions and Startopia does take it further into detail than Starcraft which focuses more on the initial defense of settlements. More than a decade and a half later, the prospect of simulating humanity’s colonization efforts are still a captivating subject in both the film and gaming industries. RimWorld may not look as flashy as Startopia, but it has surpassed it by far in sheer complexity and freedom of choice. A pleasant surprise being only enhanced by the fact that its dev team has just debuted onto Steam. I did notice that some compare RW with Dwarf Fortress or The Sims series, but c’mon just take a look at those and you’ll find more complexity in Prison Architect (which shares even the visual style with RimWorld). All in all, the game I’m reviewing today is unique enough to fit into its own subgenre. So let’s focus on the colony survival strategy at hand!I strongly advise you play the game’s tutorial first since even if it barely scratches the surface, it will set you on the right path. RW does prefer the teaching method involving as much freedom as the situation warrants it. And those instances shall be plenty and quite random. You will have to learn from this game while actively playing it and through the many mistakes you may commit. Not entirely the player’s fault but no one said that founding and maintaining a colony in a more or less inhospitable environment, would be easy. Much of the RimWorld’s appeal stems just from how unpredictable it can be, thanks to procedural generation on a widespread scale. No playthrough could ever be similar, even with the exact same starting supplies and terrain which to settle. That may also have contributed to the lack of a storyline per se. You get to spin the tale, so to speak. In real time (with the excellent option of pausing the action whenever you please) and as a direct consequence of your activity.With trial & error taken into account, you can at least influence the severity of the events which will put your management and survival skills to the test, through the game’s Storytellers. Think of it as the Artificial Intelligence governing the less predictable part of this strategic simulation. HAL 9000 throwing the dice for you. You can choose the more relaxed nature of a storyteller which will allow you to build up your base, see your colony prosper unchallenged by raids or cruel weather effects and once you feel like you’re ready to up the ante, switch to a storyteller of increased difficulty and more random behaviour. RimWorld is first and foremost, a game about variables. It is not easy and it was never meant to properly cater to more casual strategy fans. But at least you are given a fair chance to adapt and overcome the odds stacked against you. Real life is never as kind.The gameplay when you hit that “New colony” button, allows you to choose an origin for your first “lucky” few colonists while also simulating the scale of your planet’s forced exile. Players are free to pick the location of their colony, in regards of proximity to AI-controlled settlements and terrain type. The latter will certainly influence the game to a large extent since the resources you may harvest and make use of, are dependent on soil, presence of animal and plant life as well as the temperature itself. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out just how much of a great idea would be to settle near deserts or frozen wastelands. At the very least pick arid or tundra, if you desire a decent challenge. For most players wanting to grasp RimWorld’s mechanics without the feeling of accomplishing a chore, pick locations within a temperate climate.Once you pinpointed the colonial foundation it is time to build, survive and prosper through constant expansion on the map and especially through trade with the neighbouring settlements. I’ve yet to reach that final stage, since it’s obviously a time consuming process which also involves careful planning. But I shall definitely never surrender without a fight. Against the savage pirates/slavers which gleefully stare at my colonists and even against the forces of nature, you have to firmly stand your ground. RimWorld’s also tackling more mature themes than its similar counterparts on Steam. Touchy subjects or even taboos, such as true gender equality, sexuality, slavery, tyranny and last but not least, cannibalism. You didn’t expect an idyllic colonial life, did you? Much like the Overseer within a Fallout Shelter, how you treat your subjects/employees/friends is up to you to decide. Extreme circumstances may or may not warrant equally extreme measures to be understaken just for the survival of your settlement.If only such complex strategic simulations could be rendered within a fully 3D game engine. I’m never one to shun a game just for its plain looks, but RimWorld certainly deserved more than just a 2D bird’s eye view. From a pure gameplay perspective, it accomplished its intended purpose but it can still hinder the game’s appeal to new players, as if the overwhelming variables and sheer amount of displayed information wasn’t enough. Sounds are also just decent enough while not standing out in any way. Alas, the game has plenty of merits which are sadly not accompanied by Achievements and Trading Cards either. Perhaps in a future update. RimWorld’s ambitions need to reflect themselves in a price tag that is most appropriate. So far you’d best wait for a Steam Seasonal Sale, before picking it up. I’m curious what can Ludeon Studios implement in the base game from the many additions that the Steam Workshop features already. Will your colony thrive or fall prey to a cruelly random event? Only time will tell…Strong Points+ Complex colony simulation.+ Freedom of choice and replay value from procedurally generated assets & events.+ Massive third-party support through the Steam Workshop.Weak Points- Slightly overpriced for an Early Access title.- No Steam Trading Cards nor Achievements.Rating 80/100  This review was submitted for ReviewExperts, through the generous contribution of Daniël - REX ♥ Gaming.

								Best top-down 2D colony management game. I played it a lot before it came to Steam, but now, with the Steam Workshop it even more convenient to get a mods which makes the game much better.Positives  Various factors which affect colonist mood.  Complex medical, surgery and damage system.  Very good and atmospheric music.  Pleasant graphics and smooth animations.  Interesting game universe, combination of sci-fi and western. I prefer sci-fi setting much more instead of regular medieval setting like in Dwarf Fortress.  Steam Workshop and  lot of complex mods which improves the game significantly, and actually which makes the game great and not boring to play for a long time. NegativesLack of multiplayer. The game created on Unity Engine which is extremely flexible and allows to create multiplayer game easily, but for some reason author don't plan do it. With multiplayer this game will be even better, because there is no other ""DF like games"" with multiplayer.			"

Ate them, then fallout stopped the next day, morale was low. Animals started to reappear and i started getting food, then few days later BOOOM SIEGE! I panicked and started deconstructing everything to build a spaceship, colonists tried to mine compacted steel near the siege camp and by the time i realized they were all dead or kidnapped except for 1 man. I was like ok i can handle this alone, kept building the ship but the guy got crazy cause all his friends and his wife were dead. He decided to start burning up the house. My game died with him.			"

								Jen was a good person. She was one of the 3 to make it off the ship, her father being another. In fact Jen and her Dad were a good hunting team. The colony needed food and we saw a bear so Jen and her Dad went out fearlessly. Jen knew her Dad was a better shot so she lured the bear out and danced around only getting a few scratches. On the way home we saw raiders getting ready to assult us. Two with guns and one with a club. Jen, even though she was wounded, bravely took up arms to defend the others. Again she was hurt in the assult and so was nearly everyone else. It was not battle that took her brave life, it was infection. Got in her blood and she died in the night. I'd like to say she was peaceful but truth is she was in a lot of pain. So in honor of such a horrible loss, we built her a tomb. Jen was in charge of tending the fields and she loved it. She was always chipper and happy without a care in the world. So brave. As a memorial Jen's Dad agreed to take over her fields. But its not going to be the same without her.October 9, 2016 - October 10, 2016... Beloved daughter, survivor and friend. I'm sad now. She seriously wasn't ""GOOD"" but she really made the colony a better place.			"

								Started a colony with a guy named Frank. Had him for a long time and somehow went completely unscathed through countless battles. I thought to myself, ""Wow! This guy is superman!"". Next fight: loses both of his arms. Somehow he is still able to do research for me, so I decide to keep him around. After about a year in game I give him 2 bionic arms. A while later there is a massive raid that kills one of his best friends and his wife. Completely depressed, he continually goes berserk and keeps putting my other colonists in the hospital (those bionic arms helped him with that). I end up having to euthanize him. As one of my doctors kneels by his bed after his latest berserk rampage that needed to be stopped with a shotgun to his face, they have a farewell chat and then the doctor ends his life. I now have a shrine built to him in the center of my colony. He will always be remembered.On a more technical note, the storytelling AI is a genius feature that I have never seen in another game. You really get the impression while playing this game that there is a story that the AI is taking you through. It controls the stream of events your colony experiences to create a certain experience for you. I don't know exactly what is happening behind the scenes, but it really does feel that it is doing much more then simply sending you random events depending on the size of your colony.If you have any interest in colony/town simulation games, then this is a must buy.

								Up there with Factorio in the sense of replayability and joy. Has totally altered the way I think and do things, even in day to day life. Priorities, my friends, priorities; unfortunately that priority is playing Rimworld. This is a game about colonizing, so that means there is a lot of work to be done. Lucky for you, there are colonists that are there at your beck and call in order to fulfill that long lost dream of living and building your very own colony. Far... Far... Away.			"

								My only cook (Grub) got gut worms somehow and now hates everything and constantly goes beserk trying to kill everyone, so the solution was to remove his stomach. For some reason though, he wasn't happy with that and began to attack all my colonists during a raid attack. The next day he got a disease. Which I believe he spread to my hunter. We now have no source of food or anyone to cook it. Then Grub went beserk when my doctor was trying to heal him. My doctor couldn't heal Grub in time since he was injured himself, and Grub died to his severe illness and my colony soon died of starvation.I hate Grub, but I love this game.			"

								I had a well established colony. I had 9 colonists equipped with sniper rifles, assault riflles, pump shotguns and kevlar vests and helmets. Then the unthinkable happened.A maddened elephant started attacking my colonists. I got the firing squad together. Elephant charged my colonists and managed to nail 2 of my lads before dying. Both incapacitated.Get them to the medical ward only to discover the bad news. One had literally lost both feet due to the attack and the other his entire right leg.Decided that instead of two food draining incapacitated potatos laying in bed all day, I would rather human beings that contribute to society. Decided to start operating and installing peg legs.I tried twice on the man with no feet and both times only managed to stab the lad twice in the torso aswell as giving him a scratched ear. No dice.I tried twice on the man with one leg and both times only managed to stab the lad once in his good leg, three times in the torso aswell as a bruised arm. No dice.Decided to give it one more go to the man with no feet and he encounted ""Minor problems"" during surgery which ultimately ended in his death. Death by being crushed. In a medical ward. With no furniture other than the bed on which he laid upon. Riddle me that.Gave the other guy a crack and he too died due to unforeseen complications.Would recommend to friends who want to experience the thrill of wild foot eating elephants.			"

Also floating dead buffalo. Man liked dead buffalos.Woman sleeps alone at night.4 people left and a captured injured man from earlier who's restrained in a bed.Tear down metal outer walls and order people to replace them with wood because we need the metal.Tear down walls then get tired and go to bed.4 raiders attack through holes in walls while everybody sleeps.3 settlers move to defend.The bear puncher gets wounded. The other 2 die.Lonely woman is incapable of violence, so she runs to where the prisoner is kept.Torturer carries off bear puncher. Dude was big. The torturer probably works out.Lonely woman is now very lonely woman.Stuck with very lonely woman and tied up prisoner and neither are capable of violence, hunting, or farming.Looks like the end Scroteville.10/10 would never punch bears again.

								It was going so well. Fall was coming to an end and we had a larder filled with food that would last the winter. We were set. We might even have gotten one more quick harvest before the cold killed all our crops. Then the raid came.I set up a defensive line and focused on killing the raiders that were attacking... I'm sure there were six of them... why are there only three here? Oh.OHHHHHH.The other three had gone around my defensive line and were in the process of lighting massive fires all over my farmland. They shot and kidnapped one of my pacafist colonists and left. The fire however raged on, and spread from the crops to the larder. Months of work up in smoke. No Food. Fire extinguished we set about salvaging what we could. A barely grown harvest, and the only source of meat we could find on short notice. The dead raiders. With only a handful of meals could we survive the winter? No.Shortly after the cold set in a rogue herd of boomalopes entered the area hungry for manflesh. Maneating Boomalopes are a bit like maneating Antelopes, except when they die they also explode. Hense the boom. They can't open doors though.I locked my colonists inside, and hoped the threat would pass. They'd get bored and move on. But the Boomalopes could smell our desperation and lack of food reserves. They could wait. By midwinter the temperatures outside were -10 degrees and the food was gone. We needed to get outside. We needed food. With little option my best fighter stuck her head out the door and shoot a boomalope, hopeing to wound or kill the beast. It mearly drew its ire. It charged headlong at the door, was shot at mellee range, died, and exploded. The explosion blew the door off. The herd had found a way in. My colony burned a 2nd time, as rampant boomalopes flew towards me and exploded, lighting fires all over my base. My hunter was in bed desperatly trying to recover from explosion related injuries while my other two survivors were putting out fires. Then the raiders came. again. They shot my two remaining survivors (one died outright, the other they left bleeding in a corner) and they kidnapped my hunter who was dying in bed. The Boomalope fires had destroyed most of the roof, and as my final colonist lay bleeding, it would turn out hyperthermia would be her eventual death, in that frigid winter of death. I had lost, and losing was fun.  "

								Obviously I have become addicted to this game, much like my entire colony's psychite addiction. I managed to tame a male and  a female panther, now i have like 30 panthers trained to maul any raiders.   I also had about 30 cats which i had to sell to a trade group because they were eating all the raw meat. My most profound moment, tear to my eye, was when the pet elephant was trained to haul items.   Finally researched some serious stuff, like making components, and drilling for steel, thats when it gets interesting.   The last raid (about 10 dudes) was completely obliterated by my new mortars.  It took me many tries and the learning curve was very steep, but the last colony i built has been going strong for a long time. Key: make sure you start making stone bricks and replace all your wooden structures because its just gonna burn down. And put batteries inside.   Enjoy.			"

I was not sure if this game was worth the 30 bucks, well, the amount of hours I've played and enjoyed, I say it was well worth it. There is so much into this game that will make you loose track of time.It did not take long for me to get the basics down, and I was doing pretty well too. Watching some tutorials will definitely help you, and after that, you'll have an amazing time building and maintaining your colony. There is so much content to this game, it's amazing that there is more content to be added!There are castastrophic events that you would have to deal with, such as raids, toxic ship, etc. And there are good and crazy ones too, like getting invaded by 30 muffalos, and boy did we stay comfy throughout the whole winter season! Also having to raise chickens was a crazy experience, I created a farm for my chickens and later they laid eggs that hatched to chicks, worst mistake of my life to create a farm for them because I had over 100 chickens and my food supply was diminishing lol. I'm not doing that again...I really recommend this game, every colony has its own story, and there's so much to it that will keep you playing continuously and entertained! "

While it doesn't have quite the same depth as Dwarf Fortress it still has an amazing amount of systems and options for the player to explore. Rimworld also has a far more accessible learning curve, but that doesn't diminish from the experience as the game does get very hard as it goes on, especially if the player chooses a hard AI Storyteller. If you feel any interest towards this genre of gaming then I highly recommend buying this game. If you're a veteran of games like dwarf fortress then you may find its depth lacking, but the game still has its charms and you may find that its still an enjoyable experience. Though the game doesn't have a modding community the size of the likes of Skyrim, it still has a fairly dedicated one that produces high quality expansions. I have found that the content these mods add help to shake the game up a bit, and I hope that some of their features are added to game officially.Overall Rimworld is a great game. I have been following it since its first alpha and seen all the changes it has undergone. While the updates have been slow they have all added significant features and I have never once felt regret for supporting the game. "

								This game is glorious and heartrenching at the same time. Excellent way to forge stories!In my first game, my group of survivors had crashlanded in a grassy, open plain. Their lovely fuzzball of a Husky survived, bonding nicely with the oldest member of my motley crew who had lost much in the crash. Three weeks in, the bandits attacked. It was the husky that saw them first, and bounded into action. The others quickly noticed something awry, and grabbed the few weapons that were at hand, charging after the valiant pup. Sadly, in the panic, the failed to shoot straight, and our noble canine took a serious thrust of a spear before the raider fell in a hail of poorly aimed bullets. We had no way to treat the pup, and with a heavy heart, her companion, trainer, and friend, through tears, had to end her suffering. She was a good dog.NEVER FORGET, ALWAYS REMEMBER!Excellent game for forging stories, would highly recommend!			"

								 If I had the intelligence and programing ability (and the numerous other aspects that go into game design), this is the game I would make. As I am a sociologist (boo hiss) watching how my colony devolves/evolves is a fascinating experience.  Yes, of course the emotional experience of crash landing on planet can never truly translated to a ‘game’, but this, this is truly a world I can believe in.  The ethnographer in me wants to ‘see the world through their eyes’ but the human in me, of course does not let this happen. I want to intervene in the community and direct their world.  This translates to a beautiful and awe inspiring in all aspects.This is truly unique game; all comparisons are truly of the table. Yes, it’s a bit like ‘Dwarf Fortress’, yes it’s a bit like etc., but none, and I mean none, truly do this justice. Looking at screen shot will never encompass the emotional attachment you have with your colony, the sheer genius of the game is this emotional hook. Within the game things actual matter life and death have consequences. This blocky, almost primitive graphic take on a far greater significate when you are actually involved in the minutia of the ‘game’ (I hesitate to use that word!). Truly remarkable, and I hope the author(s?) are richly rewarded for such a unique experience. Recommended without a doubt.			"

								This is my first ever Steam review, which is testament to just how much I love this game. I've been playing Rimworld for nearly two years now and am happy that it has finally made it to Steam!I'm 31 and there are very few games I have ever encountered that I have sunk as many hundreds of hours into as Rimworld. The variety of each game and the challenge of the story-tellers is actually staggering. As a game still in its alpha stage, it is more stable and has more content than most triple A games. The updates are frequent and make significant improvements to the gameplay every time and the developer communication is excellent on the ludeon.com forums.The real strength of this game is the modding community, which continues to add amazing content to the solid core gameplay on a nearly daily basis. I can only hope that the addition of Steam Workshop will help make the modders life easier as the game continues to evolve.The game itself is the most fun in its early to mid stage, reaching something of a plateau towards late/endgame. However, the developer Tynan is more than aware of this and will address it in a coming update.I can't recommend this game highly enough.			"

I love dwarf fortress, but Rimworld actually made me care about the people I command.Especially that one woman that wasn't told to fight off the scyther invaded the camp, she got shot in the back, spine broken.I kept her in the hospital, incapable of walking, for I wanted to find a way to save her, since she was my best colonist, I owed that to her. Maybe if I got advanced enough I could replace her spine?Alas, a flashtorm told me otherwise.Here they were, fighting a loosing battle against the flames. I had to make a decision and packed everything I could into one single caravan. They couldn't carry her with them.Abandon settlement, rebuild. The lost tribesmen got chased off their camp once again.Everything is good again. Except the burns on my hunter got infected, and got the better off her.Fast forward to the end, my colony was populated only with domesticated wolves that outlived their master.Rest in peace; Komodo, Val, Hunter, Meat and tribesmen who met less glorious ends.Except you, ♥♥♥♥ you Arroya, I always hated you.

								I personally think that Rimworld is a great game. It takes a more indepth approach to the colony and/or city simulator, not in comparison to dwarf fortress but in the genere it is in a different league than the sims or banished. Instead of giving you a boring population that is without traits and addresses tasks and goals given by you or the game, you are given individual colonists with a large reliance on efficiency, and are governed completely by you (if you want to go through the work to micro your colonists). You have the opportunity to create/generate characters prior to entering your custom or preset scenario. Once you begin gameplay you adress colonial needs and assign priorities and jobs to your various colonists that all of individual skills that better suit different tasks.Throughout the growth of your colony you will be presented with challenges and opposition wether by hunger, weather, space pirates, aggressive tribes, or mystical space robots with sword arms. provided your colony survives long enough, you will eventually have the opportunity to begin mechanizing your colony with prosthetics and implants through research and commerce. The world is generated prior to entering your first colony with a map of the entire artificial world covering either 30%, 50% or, 100% of the planet. The world is divided into hexagonal territories which, for some odd reason are square in colony view, are uniquely generated every single time a new initial save is created peppered with friendly, neutral and hostile factions and settlments.Positives-Detailed-Challenging-Several methods of playing-Challenges are presented based on narrator (for lack of a better term)-Infite possibilities-Randomly generated landscapes and world-Personalization of colonists and pets-Complex disease, injury, and addiction systems. (i once saw a turtle kill a bear by biting its eye and giving it an infection, turtle still died. RIP Lawrence)-Stil in development-ModdableCons-It can be really hard-AI narrators will punish relentlessly-Hard to create colonists that are effective without negetive affect on the colony or themselves (not really a ""con"" it keeps the game balanced but some may not like it)-Still in development-Costs moneyTl;dr: Hard colony sim, lots of customizability and funny/infuriating gameplay, still in development, comparable to dwarf fortress.

								The best way to review a story driven survival colony game, Is to tell you a story.3 survivors of an unknown accident, crash land on a random planet.Unknowing how to play the game, progress was slow, but eventually we had a cosy little settlement.3 beds, table, heat, light and stove. Everyone was happy.This is when S### hit the fan. I misjudged how big my farm needed to be, so hunting was the only way to keep the colony going. Raider attacks, eclipses and shared living was starting to take its toll.The final straw was when the food ran out and Earl (My hunter) couldn't catch anything. Tim (My handyman) had a mental breakdown. And Earl's Son (Ivo) was injured in a gunfight.A few weeks later, my colony was up to 5 people and 1 prisoner (which i took pity on). I accidently sent Ivo out hunting on his own to fight a Grizzly. Earl came to the rescue, but it was too late.Ivo was alive but very badly wounded, Earl was worse off as his arm was completely ripped off. And to top it all off, i ran out of medical supplies and Earl is the only trained doctor i have.The next day, Ivo's wounds got infected. Earl decided not to amputate his arms as there was no medicine.But then a trader came by and sold some medicine, Earl gave it to Ivo and he started to recover, but it was too late. Ivo died 1 hour later.The depression, the lack of food, the occasional cannibalism and winter was setting in. My colony was doomed, but with every great story there came a twist. A cargo pod just came out of nowhere filled medical supplies. The farm finally yelded a decent amount of crops. Also a trader came by and sold me a bionic arm which was then attached to Earl during a extensive operation.2 escape pods landed on the planet only a few days later, It was Roslyn and Masaru, Earl's wife and other Son.That is were my story must end. As there is yet so much more to see and do.10/10 Would decimate the Turkey population again.UPDATE: A lot of things have changed since this review. My colony now has 15 colonists. A nearby mine shaft got infested with alien insect thingys. 2 colonists got married but it rained during the ceremony. Raiders continue to get tougher each day, luckily my turrets and perimeter wall are still holding up. 90% of the buildings in the colony are made out of Plasteel.

								After 19 hours I can say this game is pretty awesome. I would ignore the EA tag as this game fells like anything but an EA title. There are 3 different scenarios to choose from: the standard of 3 people crashing on a planet and trying to survive, the rich explorer on his own looking for adventure, or 5 surviving tribe members trying to rebuild after a catastrophe. If none of those tickle your fancy they have added an editor and you can make up your own scenario (it is pretty epic what you can do).Once you get everthing set up then you choose a map size and a location on a planet. Make sure to pay attention to the times you can grow crops, you don't want to be stuck somewhere you can only grow crops for a limited amount of time, and also pay attention to the average temps as some people like certain temperatures. After you selcect your planet is when you get to pick your crew of people. I suggest trying to find people without any injuries (scars included), and make sure to be diversified in the peoples abilites. It's funny some of the quirks these peopel have :)Launch your game and immediately pause so you can scope it out, plan how you want to build and set your people to working. I recommend watching some videos before hand as there is a learning curve, but once you get the basics down it's a ton of fun. I can see me investing a lot more time into this one for sure. Good luck and have fun!!			"

								I've been playing videogames for more years than I will admit here, a lot of them through Steam, but I've never before  felt the urge to write a review. Well, I can't think of a better game for my first one. In my humble opinion it is a revolution in the genre. Yes, some can argue that alot of the mechanics and concepts were there before, but they are put in such a great way that makes it one of the best games I've ever played. It does have a lot of innovations on its own.  The depth of the simulation is HUGE, specially regarding everything related to the colonists: mood, health, addictions, etc. I've had  to face some very interesting ethical dilemmas while trying to make my  colonists survive. For example: Should i feed and spend my precious medicines on this prisoner which I may not be able to recruit? or do I want his organs to heal my only firefighter? Some of them even kept me thinking about it hours after playing the game after extrapolating them to real world scenarios. That adds a lot to the replayability, not to mention the customizable start settings and the different storytellers.You can play a peaceful (not THAT easy) colony builder or a hardcore survival blood-fest game depending on your mood. Harder difficulties and 'unfair' storytellers are great for epic histories of battles and heroic deeds, but also for  sad while amazing  stories. Like the colony that was lost after a sinister incident (involving serial killing) that started when someone's yorkshire terrier died. A minor incident can lead through a cascade of disasters that will ruin your settlements if you don't notice and correct it while you can.The artwork is simple but great and the music ...WOW..seriously, spot on. One of the few games where I keep the music on after all this time playing.EDIT: Rimworld was available through the official website years before it was added to Steam, don't trust the hour record.10/10 Definitely recommendedRuffus we will always remember you !!

								I've been playing this game since the early alphas and the thing i like about it the most, compared to the other colony sims, is it's RTS-based battle mechanics.there are plenty of great colony building sims out there and there are plenty of great RTS games out there, but rimworld was able to seamlessly combine these two genres quite beautifully.this is the kind of game where a raider can chop off one of your colonist's legs and then the player would be able to operate on that colonist and give him a peg leg.this is also the game where you can butcher that punk raider who chopped off your colonist's leg and turn his bloody carcass into a lavish meal or feed his corpse to your pet warg and her babies.and then loot that raider's cool jacket.-----yes random reader, you read all that correctly. what are you waiting for? go buy it.

								Extremely steep learning curve but also extremely amusing.My first game lasted just shy of 3 days.  My ship wrecked survivors started building a small habitat to share and sleep in near what I thought was an abandoned structure, as there tend to be a few on every map.  The structure was made of steel walls, and my survivors wanted a steel house.  They tore down one section of wall only to discover ancient slumbering death robots which poured forth and quickly filled my survivors full of holes.  Did they kill my crew?  No... they blew off limbs, punched holes through torsos, and then let them slowly bleed to death as the robots systematically destroyed everything they had built.  The one creature they did kill outright?  The pet dog.  And they made sure to do it in front of the crew before any of them had bled out.10/10 Would unleash sadistic murder bots again.			"

								There are plenty of reviews and let's plays out there that will let you know if this game is for you or not.That being said, this game certainly scratches an itch. It's solidly built, maintained, and consistently enhanced by an honorable and respectable developer, not to mention the modding community.I'm not that good at video games these days and was worried that this one would be too complicated for me.

								I have always loved this game and its contunual updates.  I love to see that this has finally made it to steam.  If you are on the fence about it, watch some game reviews.  This game starts off very basic.  It may look simple, but it is extremely complex.  That being said, it is on a learning curve that you will pick up swiftly.  The different biomes provide different challenges, so this game is never static.  It has a little bit of everything that you need in a Basebuilding game - farming/combat/management.The goal is to survive on a planet, build your spaceship again, and GTFO.  Can you survive?			"

								Owned Rimworld for a long time before it was steam released.By far the cloest thing to dwarf fortress that isn't incredibly hard to get into.This is another top seller for a reason, gameplay is challenging and fun, worth a try if your into sim games.. Has a great potential for steam workshop support although curse has a mod page for it already.I feel bad for anyone who didn't buy it earlier for the early development price but it's actually worth the money. Far more content then most triple A titles and you'll expirience no bugs what so ever from anything upto this patch now.			"

								A team of expert scientists crashed on the Rim World. The first of which was Ian. Ian was a Female Botanist but was also a psychopath for some reason. Second was Mishly, our colony leader. She had a high skill in shooting however she was a geologist, which didnt really make sense. Finally, Fox, she was in charge of building and taking care of injured patients, she was a computer scientist, which also didnt make sense. We also had a pet named Genius which really fit the team of expert scientists.We began the constructing the colony, slowly but carefully. I proceeded to create 4 8x8 growing areas of rice, corn, potatos and hay to feed Genius. After 2 days, our colony began to be large enough to be named. I named the colony... Potatoville. After that a colonist named Kim, proceeded to join the colony. She was the MVP, cooking food and collecting resources all night while everybody else was sleeping.Kim saved us from a forseeable food shortage. This all fit her occupation of being a servant. Finally something that made sense. After constructing a powergrid, of 1 solar panel and creating individual bed rooms for each colonist and a workshop/joy section things started to look pretty good.Then a foolish raider named Jonathan appeared. He attempted to take down 2 of my colonists which had a pistol and a rifle. He then fainted. I felt sorry for him has he laid seemingly dead in the front of our main house. I then put him on prisoner status. I made my wardens try to convince him to join the colony. We cured all of his injuries, creating a nice little bed, allowed him to go nude since he was a nudist. Yet it wasnt enough, he still couldnt be convinced to stay. I figured that I would be better off executing him. Middle of the night. Ian, proceeded to murderur Jonathan. I constructed a grave to memorialize Jonathan. RIP Jonathan - Useless Prisoner 2016 - 2016You thought it would end there didnt you? Well everything turned into havoc a day 3 days later. A turtle. This mad turtle... He proceeded to trap 3 of my colonists in my tiny ""research shack"" even though they were all fully armed, they werent able to shot the turtle or hurt it. Mishly tried to shot the turtle, but to no avail. The turtle killed all 3 of my colonists then ran towards Mishly. Genius attempted to protect Mishly, only for both of them to die seconds later. The turtle killed all my colonists. 10/10 - Would lose the game to a turtle again.Proof the the Horrifying Event: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107995368/screenshots/ "

								Ben, the quiet loner who mines and occasionally sculpts, had a mental break down and attempted to bludgen himself to death because his pet Husky Asphalt died in an angry turtle attack. This is Rimworld.Sasquach, the pascifist nurse who can build a room like nobody's business, got heat stroke and went a little nuts, shedding her clothes in the living room and running for the hills in the middle of a heat wave. This is Rimworld.Inga likes to beat people with a stick. This is Rimworld...Rimworld is a strategy game masked as a top down colony sim with a unique aesthetic and an emergent, complex AI system. Yes, you have to build and manage a base like most sim, sandbox games. However in Rimworld there are complex factors that are super important to the success of your colony.Stories are generated by ""simulating psychology, ecology, gunplay, melee combat, climate, biomes, diplomacy, interpersonal relationships, art, medicine, trade, and more"". Key word ""and more"". Your sims can go insane and it will completely ruin your entire colony when Bert decides to strip and run out into the tundra and pace around in an unresponsive daze! Factions can attack but when taken prisoner can potentially become part of your colony, but only if you have someone with social skills that can chat em up. This is what makes Rimworld so fun and addictive. I have started over about 6 times, sometimes because of updates but also because I am super curious about how colonies will end up in tundras, or jungles, or if I choose 3 men or 3 women, or 5 tribal members or 1 rich loner. No two stories are ever alike! It's hard to tell that this is even an Early Access game. It could be balanced a bit more, especially in Cassandra Classic mode, however it is very enjoyable.I would highly recommend this game if you love simulation, strategy, humor, survival aspects, and if you enjoy replayability. 10/10 I'm totally obsessed and can't stop playing. It's summer and I'm always inside playing this game, dammit! Look what you've done to me, Ludeon Studios!!			"

								Seriously awesome.  This little game even in early access is truly captivating.  I find myself re-starting over and over to see what random things I can encounter.  This game seems to adapt, creatively, to whatever it is you try to do and try to opress your motivations creatively.  It's an amusing game I can't seem to put down.Example Stories:1. Built a mountain bunker with only one tiny ingress point, made some impressive defenses.  I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off all my neighbors on purpose, killed every one that came by.  Eventually one of them sent a large group and half of them came and mined their way into the back of my base in two different spots, while a third group setup mortars to destroy me from afar, while a few also rushed my front gates.  That's some impressive and entertaining AI right there, I wasn't even mad at losing like 8 hours worth of effort into my community.2. Built a cute trading village in the woods, pleased all my neighbors the best I could (always one pirate group though, unfortunately), grew lovely crops, trading my way up, had bionic parts for a few of my sims, loving it.  My two main gunmen were recovering from injury from some raging animals and could not fight, only to get raided from enemies.  Barely fought them off with choke points, traps, and running around the map like an idiot as my base was being destroyed and my two fighters were killed.  Only traders/craftsmen left.  Expected to die at the next major raid, but that never happened, instead some insane storm came and blew all my crops away, and since my food storage area / fridge was partially destroyed with a collapsed roof from the raid, the storm blew away most of the food in storage right as winter approached.  Ran out of food in the dead of winter, couldn't afford to buy more via trading, as sim after sim died off, the others turned into canibals eating the dead.  One after one, after eating human flesh my sims all went mad and then died off, some just wandered out into the cold and died, some just sat in their room died of hunger, one set his room on fire and went up in a blaze.I'll add more soon  :P			"

								I've been playing Rimworld for about a year, and it's easily one of my favorite games of all time, which is saying something because I've been playing video games for about forty years! The best part of this game is the stories that it generates. Here are three of them (some games heavily modded):PSYCHOThe first game of Rimworld that I ever played was going great until the raiders came. My colonists put up one hell of a fight, but after driving the raiders off all of them were incapacitated except for Sally, the neurotic brawler. As her compatriots were bleeding out on the ground, she decided that she wanted to go play horseshoes. Nope. I ordered her to rescue her companions. Then she wanted to play chess. Huh-uh. I ordered her to bandage their wounds. After that, she wanted to go grab a bite to eat, but I ordered her to feed her fellow colonists first.Finally, when she was able to tend to her own needs, she found that she had fed all of the meals to the other colonists, leaving her with only a few raw potatoes. She ate them and went to bed.Great, I thought. Crisis averted.Then she woke up in the middle of the night. One by one, she killed all of the other colonists as they lay helpless in their beds. Then she went outside, stripped off her clothing, and wandered around in the snow until she died of exposure.The moral of the story: Mass murder in Rimworld often begins with eating a raw potato.HARVESTIn another game I played, we managed to capture a raider who had a great set of skills, but a really high recruitment difficulty. We kept him around trying to recruit him for over a year, but when food became scarce I had to consider whether to cut him loose, or cut him up (y'know, for food). I hadn't come to a decision yet when the colony was raided again. We fended off the raid, but one of my colonists lost an arm in the process.At that point, my choice was clear. I tried to recruit the raider one more time, and failing that, I sent in the doc.As my colonist admired his shiny new arm, I realized that I now had a use for the stubborn raider: spare parts!Years later, when the raider finally hobbled out of our compound on two peg legs, he had only one eye left, no limbs except the ones we'd made for him, and his nose was gone. Oh yeah, and he was naked, too... we took his clothes before we let him go.The moral of the story: Recycle!THE EPIC OF LEMMYIn my most recent playthrough, the colonists walled in a large area soon after they landed, trapping a few animals in the process. I soon ordered one of the colonists to hunt these animals for meat. This was no problem until the colonist tried to hunt the tortoise. As soon as the bullet penetrated its shell, the tortoise flew into a rage. The tortoise was on him like lightning (that is, if lightning moved really, really slow) and bit his toe off.As the tortoise chewed idly upon the aforementioned severed toe, I took a closer look at him and found that this wasn't his first rodeo. He'd been shot and stabbed before. This was a tortoise that I could respect.I left him alone after that, adopting him as a kind of mascot, but not really bothering to tame him and make him a part of the colony. But Tess, the colony's warg, was not as impressed as I was. She considered the tortoise as a snack to be consumed at a later time.So it wasn't long before they decided to rumble. Tess got the short end of that encounter, and for her trouble she got three shattered legs that had to be amputated and replaced with peg legs (remember, mods).At that point I named the tortoise Lemmy. Because he was a bad♥♥♥♥♥Lemmy spent the next few years wandering around the compound (Tess, meanwhile, got a fourth peg leg after an unfortunate incident with a cow).But eventually as the compound developed, there were fewer and fewer dandelions for Lemmy to eat. Afraid that he would starve, I decided to tame him. It was easier than I thought it would be, and the first thing that Lemmy did was to head outside of the compound (as a member of the colony, he could open doors now).Not long after, as Lemmy munched on dandelions, he was attacked by a group of tribals. At 191 years of age, Lemmy wasn't as spry as he was when he was in his seventies, and he was cut down before he could fight back. As he lay bleeding out in a patch of his much-loved dandelions, he would have given the tribals the finger.But he didn't have one. Because he was a tortoise.The moral of the story: If you spend fifty years as an underappreciated musician, some nerd will eventually name a turtle after you. But not a real one, though. A fake one. On the computer.tl;dr: Learn to read, lazy♥♥♥♥♥ And buy this game.This is Rimworld. Welcome to it.			"

								This game is phenomenal. I don't think I've ever gotten as lost in my own imagination with a game as I have with Rimworld. My roommate had a hard time understanding how I had become so invested in the world and story represented on screen in the game's Spartan graphics.If I can add anything that's not in previous reviews: don't test drive this game on the easiest mode. The pure base-building mode almost turned me off until I came back and gave it another go on the harder difficulty. The threats are all the fun and give your compulsive building a purpose.Also, beware! This game is unbelievably addicting. When one game can run you 12-30 hours (or more), you should prepare accordingly.			"

								Rimworld is one of those few games that does what it does unbelievably well.  Rimworld is a base-building/colony management style game, but these genres it takes to a whole new level in complexity.The game itself is considered an 'early access' title, but don't be fooled by this, there is a breath and depth of content here that goes far beyond a $30 price tag.  You can easily get hundreds of hours of play time in Rimworld, as there is so much depth that even after almost 150 hours of play time myself, I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface.  There are always so many new things, new mechanics, new items, new ways colonists interact with things that I'm learning about that things can stay fresh for a long time.  Rimworld is one of those games that takes a short amount of time to understand, but a lifetime to master.Part of the replayability is the sheer variety in any given game.  You can choose a difficulty, a biome, a storyteller (the style of AI when it comes to how challenges and boons come to your colony), and you can even generate your colonists.  Everything, right down to those very colonists have such depth, it's difficult to explain in a review.  One colonist might have an excellent skill with firearms and cooking, but might be incapable of dumb labor and like to eat human flesh.  Another colonist might have a bad back and cataracts, but might be an excellent researcher and particularly strong willed.Another part of the replayability is the extensive and highly active modding community, which have created amazing mods to keep the gameplay fresh and fun.  Everything from mods that reduce micromanagement, to mods that allow you to play in H.P. Lovecraft's Call of Cthulhu setting.  Mods that allow you to engineer organs, or mods that add additional weapons and enemies.  There's truly a mod for just about everything.The graphics and sound effects are simple, but the true value in Rimworld is the story that gets told as you progress through your game.  When raiders come, will you defend yourself and then set the raiders you capture free?  Will you try to convert them to your side?  Will you tear their organs out to sell on the black market and use their skin to make arm chairs with (yes this is totally possible)?  Will you tame wild animals and breed them for food and materials as a farmer?  Will you simply slaughter them as a hunter?  Will you grow and concoct drugs to enhance your colonists abilities and keep them happy?  Or create these drugs to sell and make a tidy profit?  Do you prefer a simple, defendable base?  Or a beautiful, symetrical base?  There's really something for everyone in Rimworld.I could say so much about Rimworld and I really feel like it wouldn't be enough.  I know videos aren't always the best way to communicate the experience of a game, but in this case I think it's approrpiate.  If you ever want to see the depth a RImworld campaign can get, here are two modded ones I'm running, along with all of the insanity that happens in each:The start of a Playthrough of 5 Psychopaths that slaughter, remove organs, and sell off all that cross them.

								Best in class right now.Dwarf Fortress meets Firefly(minus the ships).Complex yet simple.The difficulty is adjustable somewhat.I cant stop playing it.the Devs are really on top of the developement cycle, and add new stuff constantly.Very well thought out, very good sense of humor throughout.If you are even slightly interested in this genre, do yourself a solid and buy this game.

								I have never played Dwarf Fortress. I watched people play this for a few days before trying it and even then I was unsure about it. I can't stop playing it. It's possibly one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I've owned it for literally 108 hours and I have played for 58 hours.It is incredibly satisfying and challenging. I am not a big fan of micromanagement but since you can pause the game to issue orders it completely negates the need to focus on tons of stuff at the same time. It is easily the best $30 I've ever spent and that includes donating to charities. This game is so good it could be called ""Complete"" in it's current state and it would still be worth it. The fact that it's in Early Access and we can expect more features in the future is amazing. Plus the modding community is great and will be another huge source of content and features.I have not encountered any bugs (or at least if I did, I didn't notice them). There's only a couple small complaints I have about the game and they're just minor user-friendlyness details.10/10			"

TL; DR - Amazing game, recommended for fans of micromanagement. Greatest strength is its modability. 100% worth the asking price.Watch my Let's Play RimWorld here.StoryThis game has no story, beyond the simple seeds given to you at the start, depending to the scenario. In the most traditional scenario, you start your game with three people crash-landing in on a planet on the rim of inhabitable space. Your ""objective"", which you are in no way obligated to pursue, is to build a spaceship that will allow you to get off the planet. Emergent storytelling is the name of the game. Your people, pawns, have 'unique' personalities which interact with each other and the game mechanics in a way that creates chaos or peace, success or failure. No two playthroughs will be unique.GraphicsRimWorld has simplistic 2D graphics which are nonetheless thematic and charming. The art style seems mostly consistent and there's nothing that seems to be out of place. Despite the simplicity of the graphics, the movement and interactions of the pawns with their environment invokes the same idle interest as watching an ant farm.GameplayIn the vanilla game, gameplay is mostly tight, with some elements being clunky. For example, commanding several pawns at once in combat, or expanding zones, have seemingly simple and straightforward interfaces but both offer features that take experience to discover, as they are not obvious. Most of the game will be spent interacting with the tabs Architect, Work, and Restrict. These allow you to build, set job priorities and assign schedules to your pawns so that they will develop and take care of the colony in an efficient manner. While you are capable of giving the pawns direct orders the game obviously intends for you to use the scheduling and priority systems.SoundThe sound effects in RimWorld are nothing to write home about. Doors woosh when they're opened, animals make a variety of noises and guns make satisfying bangs whenever they fire. Where RimWorld's audio shines is in the soundtrack which, even though it contains only a few songs, is stellar and evocative of the whole 'space western' theme of the game.OtherWhere RimWorld has a huge advantage over similar games is in its mods. There is a huge, active, community of modders, both here on steam and on the Ludeon forums. Mods allow changing the game in radical ways, completely overhauling the way you play the game. While the vanilla game is already almost great, mods definitely push it there.RimWorld is an ""early access game"" but I think this is wrong. If development stopped now, I would consider this a great game worth the asking price. As it is, the game is still being actively developed and is subject to change.Score5/5 - Great "

								I started the game with 3 people. A husband and wife with their daughter and her doggie.I finally figured out how to hollow out a cave and make a living. I named the cave Bates motel. I had our group haul all of our supplies and things were going okay at first...In the beginning everyone slept in the same room. Colonists started having mental breaks because of room sharing and horrible living conditions however. So I moved the daughter out thinking she hated being stuck with her parents in the same room. I figured the 2 in the other room might benefit from a bit o love making perhaps make me some new colonists.... Surprisingly this only made them more erratic and depressed. Especially when I put them in the double queen bed to sleep together.About 2 hours in the main guy snapped and shot the lady I thought was his wife and then shot the daughters dog. Turns out it was his mom and girlfriends dog. After he shot his GF (the 22 Daughter) too I realized my mistake. I had separated them for 2 years. Eventually the GF had broken off the relationship. Apparently the son slowly went mad stuck with the mom night after night when he was supposed to be in the room next door re-populating the colony with his sweetie. He then went psychotic and killed everyone. Afterward he went into the field next door and punched a boomalo until it exploded and injured him. With nobody to rescue him he sat there and died in the field.10/10Would play Psycho sim again.THRILLING.Oh and don't mess with the Alpaca herd. They will !@#$ you up!			"

								Kimmy lost it.. I mean she really LOST it...  maybe it was lack of food.. maybe she was tired and finally FED up with all the dirt.. why wasn't anyone cleaning??  Maybe it was a recent infestation of creepy-crawlers.. (what WERE those things?).. that we barely just survived.. I don't know.. but she LOST it and went NUTS..  before that.. she was great!.. one of the best colonists..one of the first...  unfortunately.. she lost it.. and went Beserk!  Now, normally we'd just get a couple of us together..  grab her and punch her silly then haul her to the med bay.  This time it was different..we didn't get there in time.. because  you see Kimmy decided to lose it... RIGHT in front of our pet Grizzly Bear!  ( You don't start punching a Grizzly Bear.. I don't care HOW freaked out you are. )  Kimmy didn't win that fight.  I think she was dead before she hit the ground.  We buried her in her own custom sarcophagus.. she will be missed.. and occasionally one of us goes over to visit her when we need to remember how great she was.  The rest of us made it off the planet.  She didn't.  We'll miss you Kimmy.Yes.. like others (true story by the way.. courtesy of RimWorld!)..  I have played about 300 hours of RimWorld since Alpha  9.. it only gets better and better.. make sure you have about 6 hours free for starters.. because this is one heck of a ride.. every time!  Would tame Grizzlies again.. (but keep them out of the house this time)..  {grin}  ENJOY RimWorld!!  It is fan-freekin-tastic!!  ---SHD  (Now to start Alpha 14!  Woo HOO! YAY Steam!)			"

								Never before has a game made me say. ""How in the hell did you manage to cut someone's head off while removing a kidney?!?!? Whatever, I'll just forbid the room and leave her corpse in there.""  That's pretty much a summary of what this game will be like.                        Rimworld is kind of like building a skyscraper. You have to make sure the structure of your colony is stable, anticipate and create solutions for problems, and pray to whatever god will listen that a 50-tribal raid doesn't swarm your kill zone. You will suffer serious blows as you build a colony of whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the prime target of pirates, mechanoid hives, and rabid squirells. That isn't a joke. Squirells can actually be quite dangerous if you don't treat all of your colonists squirrel bites. The main part of this game is resource management as well as colonist management. For convenience, me and the rest of the Rimworld community will refer to colonists as ""pawns"". Your pawns our whiny, greedy, ungrateful, psycholigically sensitive, and fragile bags of meat who will complain about anything that isn't stylised perfection. Because of this, you need to accomodate their needs so they won't go insane while building your colony. Pawns will require a small list of items in order to be satisfied with life. They are:-Food-Shelter-Clothing-Good health-Comfortable furniture-Spacious surroundings-Nice looking surroundings-a random need that will be given to them with a trait. You can view a pawn's traits on their character screenAs you can see, providing all of these and possibly more doesn't look easy. And it isn't. However the main ones you should focus on are the first 4. However, Pawns don't gain a mood boost from being well fed or rested. They get the opposite if those needs aren't being fulfilled, but they won't be grateful when you do give them those things. Because of this, try to give your pawns 1-3 of the last 5 items at any given moment. That way they won't go insane and kill your only doctor.                   Speaking of doctors, after you have fulfilled your pawns needs, they will work. Each pawn has a special set of skills that can be strengthened with doing tasks. For example, say you have someone with a construction skill of 10 with no interest in construction and someone with a construction skill of 8 with a burning passion for construction. If you set both of them to work, at first pawn #1 would do a better job, but pawn #2 would learn how to construct better around 5 times faster, thus surpassing them. Overall, try to assign pawns to tasks they are good at or interested in. If you want to view a pawn's stats, check th character screen again.                  Now finally, I will talk about raids. Raids are events that occur where raiders from other factions ( or mechanoids ) will come with weaponry to try and raid your colony. This is where combat kicks in. The top 2 skills on the character screen for each pawn are Melee and Shooting. Assign pawns who are good at Melee to smash tournaments and give your skilled shooters guns. When a raid comes, get your combat pawns behind cover and let them fire. if you want to make a pawn perform a specific action to a person or object, then right click on the object. In combat, this can be used to target specific raiders or order your Melee people to target Kirby. You can also build security turrets to automatically target raiders from a distance. However, these do blow up when they take too much damage. I once had an extremely successful colony get wiped out when too many people stood near an exploding turret.                 Remember, these are just the basics. You probalby would have been better off had you just looked up a tutorial vid for the current version of rimworld.			"

								While Rimworld isn't necessarily a bad game, it does quite a bit of wrong and rather strange things.  Steam doesn't really give the capacity with a simple ""recommend"" to explain that but that's why we have this text area.  After 109 hours I'm still unsure if I like it or not.  It is a fantastic game to chill out and listen to podcasts with, but there’s so many issues that I feel more like I'm fighting the game than actually playing it.  Modding the game to fix my issues just brings new issues to light.I probably won't stop playing the game, but I can't recommend it in this state.  I just hope I can later.We'll start with my biggest issue by far, the whole ""happiness"" system.  I like the idea in concept but it really REALLY doesn't work out well.  Some debuffs stack twice over with other debuffs (Friend died, Spouse Died) for what should really just be compressed into one.  Colonists seem to prioritize the strangest things (Best friend in the whole world died, -8. THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ EMMIE WONT GO OUT WITH ME -20) so there really doesnt seem to be a whole lot of consistency.  Dead bodies give a stacking debuff even after the colonist has shot the 500th raider to death with his sniper rifle.  This seems poorly thought out, considering that 30 man raids can happen by year 2 and you need to deal with the bodies.Mental breaks happen far too frequently and give the impression that your colonists all have the mental fortitude of a 5 year old.  The minor breaks (threshold events that are supposed to tell you bad things will happen later) almost never happen.  Instead you have a person go instantly from OK to ohgodheskillingeverything in one snap.  Or if berserk rages aren’t your thing, how about that colonist that moved dead bodies for the 500th (They really should know this is normal by now) time suddenly going into a daze in -40 degree temps and stripping off all equipment, forbidding it, and then dying in the snow.  These events really need to have a higher threshold, and allow the minor events to trigger more frequently to blow off some steam.The next issue I have is the combat.  The damage system specifically.  It doesn't seem right that a person with a short bow can slice a guys arm off with his first shot and kill him.  In general the limbs seem to have the durability of a wet noodle, constantly flying off colonists whenever there’s a chance.  This doesn’t even touch on the issue that every enemy seems to be a god at shooting, hitting 100% of all shots from behind 2 layers of granite wall, but I digress.On a related note to combat, the way raids work removes the ability to make bases that aren’t one giant building.  You absolutely must make it that way, surround it by walls, and then abuse AI pathfinding to make the raid come through killboxes.  The whole experience feels like cheating because you're relying on faults in the AI and not skill.A funny thing to note is that raiders don't actually follow skill logic.  A raider incapable of violence will still be happy to snipe and a raider incapable of mining will be happy to be a sapper.The storyteller forces you to play mediocre, but not in a way that makes it feel you're fighting impossible odds.  It goes easy for awhile and then smacks you with a raider drop into your main base, setting everything on fire.  Not only that but the difficulty gap between the “Some Challenge” (AKA Easy, first difficulty is accurately named “Base Builder”) and “Rough” (Normal) is absolutely massive.  At no point in the “Easy” playthrough was I threatened in any way, but on my “Normal” playthrough everything got set on fire in Year 2 Summer, due to a volcanic winter making it impossible to grow crops and raids coming every day.Research level for scenarios seems a bit vestigial.  You can be researching spaceships while still having a neolithic tech level, but I expect that to change eventually.Colonist job priority even with manual priorities seems to be all over the place.  Set cleaning to below main job priority means they never clean.  Set it to equal and they run back and forth between the job they are doing and cleaning, not actually finishing either of them.There's a number of other issues with the game but they are minor.  Things like arbitrary furniture moving, research gaps, and events with no counter besides not playing.  The issues with the game currently are so numerous and so glaring that I have to wonder if they'll ever get fixed.  The concerns are further compounded by absolutely bizarre decisions by the developer (Passive aggressive modding support, steamworks DRM despite being proudly displaying the DRM free version on the main site) and makes me think that all of these things are intentional.I just hope I'm wrong.

								Though I haven't played this game for that long, I can give a good retelling of a colony I built which was pretty fun. Rimworld diary; Colony 2: Things are off to a great start, Dragon & Shepard are constructing the base, John is growing, hauling♥♥♥♥♥♥and generally being a good dogsbody. The base grows and everyone is happy, production is starting to roll and I have plenty supplies, meals being cooked, potatoes being harvested, trees being chopped, ect. Somewhere a week or two in, after a couple of small bandit raids, I rescue this little prick Wallis. He's alright at the start; a male model, only interested in Art and incapable of intelligence, and any kind of labor. After giving him the task of making a few sculptures he just sits the ♥♥♥♥ around all day. Eating, puking and making a ♥♥♥♥ing mess. So I euthanize him and harvest some organs. Great, I think, problem solved. No. Problem not solved. It starts the beginning of the end. The one thing he could do was shoot and after a big raid and my main doctor going down. Things begin to descend into madness. Everyone is in a bad mood and it's a struggle to get them out of it. I buy beer from traders and make them nice things. Psychic drone. Everyone is teetering on the edge of mental breakdowns. Gamble, an old lady who likes to brawl and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things gets successfully saved from being chased by a group of tribes people. Still. Things are bad but looking up. Oh no. Another raid. John gets ♥♥♥♥ed in an explosion, my two pets, a husky and a terrier die defending the colony, Gamble is severly injured battering the crap out of some guy. The bandid raid ends in many casulties, how do I fix this? ♥♥♥♥! Shepard has a mental breakdown after trying to save everyones lives. Gamble is in bed starving. She has a mental breakdown and Shepard and Gamble battle it out and ♥♥♥♥ each others♥♥♥♥♥♥up. The colony eventually dies with Shepards confused mutterings echoing the now silent walls of a once thriving community. 10/10 "

								I will be reaching 100 hours played soon so i thought i should go ahead and give my review.Rimworld is one of the greatest games i have ever played and will be the template,or always be the comparison for the upcoming Colony Simulators.The amount of detail and depth put into the game is overall impressive,you forge a emotional attachment to your colonist and colony as you learn and build.I do believe that this is not a game for everybody,most new players consider it overwhelming,but i assure you its simple.My roomate who does not play video games at all has gotten into the game,watches me play and has created their own colony.The game is very similar to Prison Architect,but on a much more massive scale,instead of building for profit you are building for survival.Rimworld randomizes esentially everything,your starting colonist,their quirks and the map that it generates along with the story teller.The Story Teller is very interesting and tries to fit all different playstyles/difficultyTheres a Story Teller that makes it more of a BUILDING game,theres still dangers but you get alot of time in betweeen events to build.Another Story Teller gets progressivly more and more difficult as you buld and become more wealthy.Lastly,the ""random randy""Story Telller,anything can happen at anytime,no matter what you have or are currently going through,you're at the mercy of Randy.The Story Tellers generate a ""story""as you play,this is done by having random events or introducing new colonist,that may have ties to existing colonist.Colonist are able to fight,marry,form freindships and make enemies or ""RIVALS""Always changing your colonies ""story""and never truely being the same.I would like to share my first Rimworld colony story,teh story of man named Grunt:  https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/5nzjcd/the_ballad_of_grunt/My current colony has now been ongoing for 60 hours realtime,i believe that Ealry Access Colony Sims are now the new Early Access Survial Games,and Rimwold will always be held in the highest regardi cannot even begin to list the amount of things possible in this game,you can be a Intergalactic Yayo producer and salesmen,or you can even harvest Humans/Organs and be Slave/Organ trader,Ontop of all of this is the Steam Workshop support.Anything is possible in this game!It is fully worth the $30 price,this is coming form somebody who has bought 3 copies of the game now at full price.

								My time in RimWorld...so far.  There were 3 people, one named Grandpa, one named Dahl, and one named Connie.  Connie was a miner, Grandpa was a farmer, and Dahl was the fat guy from lost...but he did cook pretty well.  Connie suffered from drug addiction and Dahl was addicted to Wake-up meds.  Everything was going great, They built a nice little house, set up a medical ward, built defenses, and got the rice field planted.  Their storage was piling up and Connie and Dahl were battling their drug addictions fairly well.  It was a peaceful little colony that was becoming close knit.We had another person show up and joined,  her name was Anath and she was a naked tribes woman that excelled at cooking.  Anath pulled her weight and blended in with the community quite well, plus, it was always great to the guys to have a naked 25 year old female walking around all the time.Everything was great....until a rabbid squirrel attacked our colony.  First the squirrel went after Connie.  She shot at it several times but only hit it once,  the squirrel downed her.  Grandpa got behind protection but the squirrel simply jumped over the barricade and downed him,  Anath was the next to be downed as well.  Dahl managed to kill the squirrel but the damage had been done. Dahl rescued everyone and it seemed that Connie was the worse of the others.  Connie eventually gained severe infections and succumbed.  Grandpa had recovered but he went mad, Dahl's addiction messed up his mind, and Kaletha our faithful pet went into manhunter mode after being griefstricken of Connie's death.  Kaletha killed everyone.  A pirate attacked the village while Dahl fell down, Kaletha did one last act of kindness by saving our village before I saved the game and exited.  This game gets deep! Create your own story and please share! 10/10 would rabid squirrel again! "

If you're an imaginitive type who enjoys good stories and action then this game is for you, regardless of any prefernce of genre.  Not only are the story mechanics effective and moving, the strategy is deep and well thought out, allowing the player to experiment with many different play styles without hitting an ""invisible wall"".  Honestly I saw my friend playing one of the first Alphas for this game and didn't think much of it, I got it myself a month or 2 later and took 2 days off school to play.  10/10 buy it and support.  The price is steep but worth it, you will get hundreds of hours out of this game, and Tynan the developer is dedicated and in full development mode, so updates and fixes are montly.

A day or so later Camblar names the Monkey Baldy and he becomes the tribe's best friend/mascot.Time passes and Camblar develops a crush on Trout, a gatherer, and they share their feelings of love as the tribe continues to expand there village. However the tribe failed to plant crops earlier in the year and suddenly the food is running out. As everyone stuggles to survive and find a way to get more food, Camblar is taken ill with some sort of plauge due to malnutrition. For the next few days Camblar can do nothing but rest in bed while the rest of his tribe is scrounging the jungle around them for berries and animals to hunt. Trout tries her best to tend to Camblar, bringing him food and medicine, and Baldy sleeps curled up next to him every night...but he doesn't seem to be improving...As Trout goes out on an ill-advised hunting mission with her friend Scorpion, the healer, her thoughts still dwell on her love, Camblar. Unfortunately her fragile state leads her to sustain a nasty scratch on her leg from a capybara, and soon after as she lies in a bed next to Camblar, trying to recover, she develops an infection. Things are looking grim and the herbal remidy supplies are running out, so Grey does the only thing he can do and builds a statue with some marble they had cleared away earlier. He creates a fair likeness of Camblar and Trout, symmetrically lying next to eachother in bed. In hopes of raising their spirits he puts the statue right next to their beds.But hope is not lost! Camblar's condition seems to be improving, as though he has developed an immunity to the plague! As he recovers he starts to do everything he can to help Trout, who is still bedridden; he cleans, he hunts, he builds, and he brings her food every day. And amazingly, Trout begins to recover as well, surving the infection some how and regaining her strength. The tribe can now celebrate at last as the crops are almost ready to harvest, everyone is in good health, and Baldy the monkey helps keep everyone happy.All is well in the village of Antioch.[...]Until there's a heatwave and everyone dies of heatstroke in their beds because they don't know how to swim, except for poor poor Camblar, whoose heat tolerance and non-violence meant he survived long enough to watch all his friends and loved ones die. Finally, depressed and alone (except for Baldy), went out into the jungle and got bitten by a cobra.A raider comes to the empty village and sets the crops on fire, incapacites Baldy, and leaves.And then a panther finishes Baldy off and eats him.And at last, Camblar dies.The End.9000/10 Would live, love, and die again.(And believe it or not that's pretty much EXACTLY what happened, I had tears in my eyes)			"

								Alright. So i've had RIMWORLD for a good 200 hours, my all time favourite game. AND ITS STILL IN EARLY ACCESS!Theres so many people writing about the in-game experience, so look at those if you want that.. The updates are fun, new, exciting, and come right on time when you're feeling like a changeThe customer service is beyond good, I rasied an issue with receving a steam key and I got help and a solution right awayI would personally pay upwards of $60 (aud) for this game, but if you're really on edge then wait for a sale and then go for itI imagine there is a steapish learning curve, i've had the game for a while now so i've learnt as it upgraded. But I would encourage you to push through and give it a try.AND THEN THERE ARE THE MODS! Everything you wish was in the game, there are in mods! and if there are any super great ones that everyone thinks should be in the vanilla game, it gets added! Fantastic game, one of my favourites!

								I played this before it was on steam all the way back from Alpha 3 as such my actual playtime is SIGNIFICANTLY higher.this is perhaps one of if not the best colony-survival game available, drawing inspiration from games such as dwarf fortress and prison architect combining various technological elements and is made/written VERY well with simply stunning levels of detail.to actually start a game you need to create a world that you like and then start a new colony, form there you roll for your survivors and stats, one of the game packs gives you the option to custom create survivors!!! #jealous form there its completely up to you as you do your best to ride out whatever narrator you chose as they weave the story of your survival, or more likely your glorious failure, each narrator has a difficulty rating and i definately enjoy the harder difficulties most.the premise of the story is that your survivors were in  cryo stasis on a ship which, for some reason, is on the ""rim"" of space but something happens to destroy the ship and only a few survivors escape pods crash land on a planet, hence rimworld, where they then have to fend off dangers form both raiders and nature long enough to construct a ship to get away.the game itself is rich with features and details, many crops top grow, an animal taming system, health and disease, and yes you can harvest organs, many areas of research, prisoner and recruitment system a massive array of ingame events i cna go on.if theres any game i give a perfect score to its this one.10/10			"

Early Access Review
								This game is fun and addictive. The description is spot on. Its like Sims+Dwarf Fortress+Space. Totally awesome. Its dedication to making meaning out of the little things is truely exemplary. Running a colony is not easy and keeping everyone alive despite themselves is challenging. The game gives you a lot of tools and a lot of problems and you have to figure the rest out. Its a lot of fun IMO to do so. Every colony I start has new challenges, complexities, and dies a different way LOL.See, your colonists are flawed people. They have had hard lives and lived through a lot. Everyone has their preferences, quirks, strengths and weaknesses. They are also people, not drones. They want nice things... and get unhapoy when forced to toil endlessly slave labor conditions. Its just as much about the people as it is about progression. To understand, let me tell you a story. This story is mostly about a teenager named Fay. Once there was a crashed colony shop and it had 3 survivors. The other two colonists are Erin and Taya. But Erin and Taya are only important in that they are militantly opposed to cooking for themselves. Perhaps their parents only ever ate out and Erin and Taya deeply believe that they cannot even learn to cook.Fay though, Fay can cook. Not well however. She is in fact, terrible at it and will likely never be good. Despite this, Fay has to cook for everyone. Its largely self defense because Erin and Taya refuse to cook. So either Fay cooks or she eats uncooked rice and boar corpses.And so the colony lived on...or it would have of not for Fay's crucial addiction to alcohol. She is massively alcoholic in fact, but there's no booze at all on the crashed colony. Prolonged sobriety is intolerable for Fay and so, once a month, she has a mental breakdown from withdrawal. Usually this means she just flings off her clothing and wanders in the woods for a while.It also means that, once a month, Erin and Taya have no one to cook for them. I have no sympathy for their week long starvation. The lack of proper work getting done during that time is deplorable however. As Erin and Taya also have mental break downs after a week of eaten raw-rice covered frozen squirel corpses, I start to care less and less about curing Fay's alcoholism and more about just getting the woman a drink.The opportunity arises when a trader comes through with beer. Fay trades generously for said beer and her mental stability improves dramaticlly with every swig. For a while, meals get cooked and work gets done in the colony. I have hope for the winter.Until Taya's mom, Raven, shows up. Injured and crawling to us through the wilds, she is rescued by Taya. Even better, Raven can cook! The colony is saved! Stability at last! And then she promptly dies of a stomache infection....in Taya's bed no less. We tried to amputate her stomach to save her, but the operation failed. Not that success would have been success.Taya is destroyed by this event, understandably. In her grief, she steals all the colony's beer and drinks herself sick. Can you blame the poor lady?Immediatly, a deprived Fay plunges into withdrawal once again. She breaks quickly and runs off naked into the winter night. It doesn't end well. The colony looks doomed at this point. Taya and Erin stare at the stove that puzzles them so as they munch on a mad racoon that is dead on their table.But lucky stars above! A new cook wanders in and wishes to join the colony! It's a godsend. We are saved!Before the new cook can set down her things, Erin and Taya go nuts from eating frozen raw rice and dead bandits. Super nuts. The Shining nuts.Berserk with hunger and probably rabies, Erin and Taya kill their savoir chef before fatally mauling each other.Erin dies atop the corpses of her fellows. Inches from the unused stove and stockpile of food that could have saved them all. If only she'd believed in herself and tried to cook. Just once...So yeah, this game rocks. Its hard but hilarious. You'll be balancing the most ridiculous, yet natural, problems while constantly expanding your abilities and liabilites. Other important facts1. No multiplayer2. No victory conditions, you play forever and just have to roll your own win.3. Combat is simple yet strangly, deeply tactical and statisfying.4. There's also factions and regional politics to manage.5. The UI is a little intimidating, but ultimately its not hard to use once you grok a few critical tools (like zones).I paid $30 for this on early access, which I normally NEVER would do. Its been a great purchase so far. Many lulz and many facepalms. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it Fay, Erin, and Taya. ^_^ "

								I started off in the desert to see how it was as a change. We had 3 survivors, Bellerose, Roman, and Ramyn. AKA Noodles.Noodles was the greatest doctor in the game. He could patch up anybody, with a stick and a block of ice, probably. Sadly, we had few resources. The only steel we got was from steel walls all over the world and wood was not to be seen. We managed to build our homes shotgun style (one corridor with rooms on the left and right) and hoped for the best.We found an ""ancient danger"" which was a large limestone room, covered in darkness. We needed supplies, so we broke it down to see what was in there. It was cyrptosleep chambers. 4 of them. Despite warnings I had read from guides, I opened them.3 guys and 1 female popped out of the chambers, 3 of them in shock. The other one had an SMG. He opened fire at Bellerose, who fled the scene. Due to cyrptosleep sickness, the man started to spew his lunch all over the limestone floor. Noodles, being a brawler, rushed at him with a knife. He managed to kill the man, and we gave Bellerose his SMG since she was the only one who wasn't a brawler. However, during the fight, Noodles got his left foot shot.Since he was the only certified doctor in the colony, we had to put him through amateur care. Meanwhile, a mad animal was running around (Iguana) and was closing in our home. I sent Bellerose out with her Tec-9 and she shot the Iguana, but she got injured as well.While Bellerose was in bed, resting away her pain, Noodles, who got shot in his foot, crawled out of bed to get a medic kit and heal Bellerose. This hero. Sadly, he got a major infection in his left foot. Due to the lack of medical knowledge from anyone, we had to amputate it.When he recovered, we gave him a wooden peg leg. He was fine with it, even though he moved slower. When he woke up, everyone went back to sleep. He continued the freezer we were building at the time for around 4 hours before going to sleep. Around this time, a woman named Minla joined our colony.This man has done so much. But sadly, he couldn't help our food problem. We were running low on food. We had to grab the bodies from the cyrosleep chambers (they were still fresh) and poor Noodles was so hungry, he had to eat the corpses. Raw. Before they were bucthered.This obviously took a toll on his mental health. He asked Bellerose out, and got rejected. This was the breaking point. He stabbed his cat, and chased after Roman, who got cut up. We needed Noodles. He was a great doctor. I decided to make Bellerose melee attack Noodles. This didn't work out well. He chased after a rat, stabbed it, and finally stabbed Minla. He got over his mental breakdown, and rescued Minla. Due to his peg leg and his wounds over his torso, he walked at a snail's pace. This resulted in Roman and Bellerose slowly bleeding to death in the middle of a desert.Minla and Noodles rested. The wounds over Noodles chest got too much, and he got a major infection. Then, Minla woke up, grabbed a knife, and went berserk. She tried to stab Noodles for killing everyone else. Noodles was quick to take her down of course, and went back to sleep with a corpse in his room. When he woke up, he truly snapped. He wandered around the corridor, completely nude, and dropped his knife.Raiders attacked. They smashed the cooler, the solar panels, stole gold and a bunch of clothes, and lit one of the wooden walls on fire before running off. Noodles didn't notice this. He wandered around still, until he got downed from a heat stroke. He couldn't escape.The fire burned everything inside the entire house, except for a couple of human meat for some reason. Including Noodles.Rest in peace Noodles. You may not be thinking right, but you'll still be a hero.			"

								The current alpha (version 16) features several initial starting conditions, three AI storytellers that guide how often hostile units and events occur, a brief tutorial (though in-game hints and notifications are present), and randomized maps on which to settle. Each colonist has a very particular set of skills for cooking, medicine, research, and the like, some of which they are passionate about and will gain experience for more quickly. Colonists automatically undertake tasks (if they are allowed to perform that specific job), including resource collection, construction, crop maintenance, moving goods around, and crafting things. Colonists also exhibit complex moods based on their traits and surroundings. Each settlement can include houses, stockpiles, kitchens, dining rooms, workshops to produce goods, hospital rooms for healing the sick, power turbines to generate electricity, research labs to unlock new options, and freezers to preserve food. Hostile enemies will invade, so defenses must be constructed (the game utilizes cover); prisoners captured after a raid can be incorporated into society or harvested for organs (among other options). Overall, the game is more approachable that a lot of colony management simulations but still features rather deep mechanics in several areas.

								Highly addictive colony management sim that is difficult to put down once you get hooked. The term ""emergent gameplay"" gets thrown around a lot these days and most games don't get it right. RimWorld is an exception as it pretty much excels in this regard. All of your colonists come with a wide variety of traits, skills and personalities which makes for some very interesting and amusing scenarios as the game progresses. This is one of those games where each new game feels different and can lead to various outcomes (and it often includes the violent breakdown of your colony).There are plenty of different difficulty settings to choose from. You could play it as a relaxing colony builder for example or gradually ramp up the difficulty and make life hell for the colonists. You'll have to keep your colonists well fed and taken care of by setting up production chains, defend them from extreme weather conditions, fend bandit and animal attacks as well as deal with their interpersonal issues. As a colony builder it offers you a lot of freedom over how you build and expand. It's extremely satisfying to build a well laid out and well-defended colony. The UI right now isn't the best but it isn't bad either. I'm sure it will be improved with further updates but the game is quite playable and fun.RimWorld is mostly the work of one developer and it's remarkable in that aspect. It contains depth that's rarely found in big budget games with teams of hundreds of people. I am constantly blown away by the emergent scenarios it throws at you and none of that is scripted. One moment your colony may be running like a well-oiled machine, the next moment a single wild animal might start a chain of events that ultimately lead to it's complete breakdown. These failures never feel frustrating and you can always go back to a previous save (unless you're playing on permadeath).The graphics are simple and might not look appealing at first but the game has a certain charm of it's own. You'll begin to appreciate the little details and effects on various actions and items. I personally feel like it's a great looking game and the visuals do grow on you. There's a lot to do in this game and it's impossible to cover all aspects in a few words. For example I haven't even touched upon the deep crafting, farming and work assignment mechanics. Bottomline is - if you like management / sim games and love building stuff it doesn't get better than this. This is probably the best Early Access game I've bought and is definitely a case in favor of the medium.			"

Early Access Review
OVERVIEWNote: RimWorld is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was 0.16.1393.RimWorld is a science-fiction village simulator and survival game from independent developer, Ludeon Studios.In RimWorld, you take control of a small group of colonists trying to survive on a frontier planet. You have to manage not only their use of natural resources while they establish and grow fledgling colony, but also their psychological state and social interactions.GraphicsThe graphics in RimWorld are an odd mix that I wasn't sure about to begin with, but I've decided that I like them. Characters are represented by these funny little 'pawns' with no animations, that just sort of glide across the ground, pausing every now and then to perform an assigned task. They're very basic, but also presumably very low in resource usage, and there's something appealing about them once you get used to them.The world is presented in overhead view, with a useful zoom range, and looks very nice. Map tiles are well textured and blended together. Some of the objects don't look fantastic (for example, the wood-powered generator didn't really look like anything to me), but generally the game looks good. Weather effects and the day-night cycle look very nice, too.The interface took a little getting used to as well, but it's consistent and works well. I'd suggest renaming the 'Architect' menu, though; a great amount of the items within it have nothing to do with architecture. Depending on your screen resolution, you can scale the UI significantly; I played in 1920x1080 and the default 1x scale was fine. There are no other graphics options.SoundThe music in the game is very nice, indeed. I'm not sure about the number of tracks, but they all have a consistent feel to them that really suits the game. It's very relaxing.Sound effects are well normalised, but nothing really jumped out at me as being particularly good or bad about them.There are no voices, or at least I haven't heard any yet.GameplayRimWorld is a village simulator in a science-fiction setting. The game gives you three scenarios, three 'AI Storytellers' (essentially event generators), and a range of different difficulty levels, then generates a planet for you. You select a landing point on the planet based on a number of variables, such as climate and topography, and then you're on your own, with between one and five colonists under your control, ready to start a new life.Colonists are individuals, with individual backgrounds, needs, and psychoses. These are done very well, and there's a great range of variables. You don't have any direct control over your group, though; you can only randomise the variables and hope for a good combination.On Day One, you need to focus on the simple things: shelter, food, defence, and that sort of thing. The game gives you some resources with which to begin, but you need to make sure your colony is self-sufficient in at least the basics before your starting stash runs out.Basic gameplay consists of designating objects or structures to build, lists of tasks to complete (called 'bills' in RimWorld), and setting up 'zones' in which activities are to be undertaken, or from which activities are restricted. You don't normally directly allocate colonists to take actions, but rather you control them indirectly through the work roster, where you can prioritise certain actions over others separately for each colonist.Defence is handled differently, with an option available to draft each colonist individually to a defence activity. In this case, you can take direct control over moving each colonist -- behind cover is a good idea! -- but they will still actively fire on interlopers at will, so there's not too much micromanagement required.As the days pass your colony begins to thrive -- or not -- and your colonists develop happy relationships -- or not! There's a research technology tree and a good range of things to build, grow, and maintain. It all takes quite a while, but the basic time controls let you pause and issue commands (very useful for defence), as well as speed up time by a large factor, so you're never waiting too long for something to happen.It's all very well balanced and a lot of fun.RimWorld isn't perfect, though. It's still in Early Access, so I have hopes for further improvements and additions. It does seem very stable and playable even now, but there are a few issues I'd very much like to see addressed.First, colonists often just ignore their work assignments. I haven't managed to work out why this happens, but often they'll just ignore something I've designated, or I'll have one of my colonists do nothing, with a UI message telling me they are idle, even when there's plenty of work for them to do based on their work priorities. Even creating more new high-priority work doesn't get them out of this state, with the only way I've found to force them to do something being to manually prioritise a particular task. Even then, though, they'll often revert to their idle state afterwards.Second, the behaviour of wild animals is completely unnatural. Bears will happily wander around ignoring other animals and colonists alike, with only random 'aggro' events or failed animal handling attempts causing them to attack anything -- and then they just attack wildly until they die. I'd love to see some more realistic animal behaviour implemented in the game.And third, there's just not enough 'stuff' to make! I don't know if it's because the UI is only designed to allow one row of options in each menu, but the options available are rather limited. Sure, there's enough to keep you busy, but I want more, more, more!The game also has an active modding community and makes use of Steam Workshop, so if you want to head off the beaten track into user-made territory, then that's an option.PROS AND CONSPros:+ In-depth survival simulation in an interesting setting, and it's FUN!+ Excellent game design and balancing+ Great musicCons:- Colonists sometimes ignore work- Animals don't behave naturally- We need more of everything!CONCLUSIONAt the moment, RimWorld is an excellent game. I hope it becomes even better before it leaves Early Access.Super SaveSaveSave for LaterPauseQuitRage QuitNote: I received this game for free for review purposes.

Early Access Review
								I serverly enjoyed this game, and will continue to play it. The rogue like elements wiht survival and emontial needs of your colonists make the game challenging and interesting to play in, along with the satification of a self-sufficiant colony. The delvelopers have been up with updates and bug fixes, and never stop to bring new and innovative mechanics to the game that change it completly. This game is not for those looking to play casually, well, you can, but be prepared for this game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥in and leave nothing but a sad and depressed feeling as you then watch everything burn... But then you find many, many mods that change the game even further and dive back in with a new game!My gripe about this game is that the learning curve to it scares people away, and the UI is scary to those who are used to seeing a freindly one, its a bit clunky and sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. Also, remember when I said that it likes to kick your♥♥♥♥♥in? It does that alot, and fairly often, to a point where this is the only game where I have save scummed a few times becuase of some of the things that have happened that led my colony to wiped off the face of the planet. Finally, my last gripe is that when playing it over and over, over coming hte struggles and problems that face early on makes each game fun and lasting, but when you get to the time of self-sufficiant, decemating all enemies within seconds, and being increadably rich, gets boring and nearly all games I had ended up like that. However, with the newest update likely added very new mechanics and features to be explored, the last bit can be forgotten, and besides all that, the game is great, and I will keep playing this.			"

								First playthrough experience: Standard fare, survivors work hard to set up a camp, a few dangerous events but all in all everything is looking good. Then a massive lightning storm hits and all hell breaks loose. Half of my outer buildings are wooden and as the grassfires rapidly approach some catch fire. My crops are burning as well. I rush my 4 colonists out but I realize too late that one has a trait that prevents him from fire fighting. He catches fire and I return him to the medbay. I also learn that another character only will fight fires in the open and not in buildings. I'm struggling to figure out what's going on and how to save the base when what happens next: A RAID! My one guy who won't firefight (its in his character traits) is recovering alone in the medbay. Where are the raiders headed? Right to the medbay while we are on the opposite side of the base. One of the outside doors has burnt down and is gone, so the medbay is not protected. He gets out of bed and preps his rifle. One raider rushes in, runs by him drawing his fire, and his buddy knocks my guy on the back of the head, he's down. My second guy rushes in with a pistol and gets laid out almost immediately. My warg runs in immediately after, gets bonked, and spends the next 10 minutes wandering in a psychotic daze. I have one man left, the chef who has a knife, but the raiders are leaving. He chases them down with a club, leaving my engineer who refuses to fight internal fires behind. My chef chases down one of the raiders and finishes him off, claiming his great bow. I send him up to fight the building fires while my engineer tries frantically to revive my unconscious drifter and get him in a medical bed. My geologist is dead in the medbay room. My engineer manages to get the drifter up and in bed and runs to get a medpack. My chef puts out the fires which spread into our foodstocks. Food reserves saved (winter is coming). As my engineer reaches the stock room, the reality of it all hits her and she breaks down into a anxiety attack and cowers in the corner while my drifter bleeds out. My chef breaks and goes bezerk, looking for anything moving to shoot with his new bow. The warg wanders aimlessly into the area and gets a final arrow in him and falls unconscious to the ground to bleed out. I saved the game under another name with my engineer cowering in the stockroom and the chef roaming the base in a bezerk state...10/10 would experience the horror again.			"

								100 hours in and I decide to start a new colony by putting 3 folks in their 20's. I like to roleplay so I put myself as one of the colonists.A week later, my in-game mom joins our colony. A month later two straight women, Isodora &  Sweetpea , joins the colony (on separate occasions) and fall in love with each other.Several weeks after the first month, the two madly in-love colonists get married. 2 minutes in the post-marriage party, mom  successfully woo's one of the married couple and starts an affair.Night of the honeymoon, A raid takes place.My in-game dad,  is part of the raiding faction. Dad kills two colonists and kidnaps one of the married couple while mom sleeps with the other one on their honeymoon. In-game me had a mental breakdown and put things on fire. Fire didn't kill me though, it burnt me a bit but it was a maddened turtle that finished me off.10/10  would roleplay again and see how ridiculous my next death would be like.			"

								First day, the planet overheated. All my people died of hearth attack. Second day I said I have experience now. I will name my people. One was my name, one was my girlfriend and one was a friend of ours. I tried to make a romance between me and my gf. I even forced them to sleep together. After one day she felt in love with our friend and I could not stop that. Me and my gf agreed that the right thing to do was to kill him, she could not accept that she cheated on me in the game. I killed him in the game, in his sleep. After, the character of my gf felt into depression and left the group. And after, I was bitten by a rat and poisoned all my body and no one was left to cure me. It was a very sad game. I dont recommend using your name or very close friends.I will definitely start a new story again.			"

								Rimworld is my dream game. When I played RTS's I always made a little town and defended it creating my own game within a game. I tried games like Sim City but it just didn't fit the type of game I was looking for. So when I saw Rimworld on Kickstarter and all of my dreams come true I had to have it.I have played Rimworld since Alhpa 1 and loved every second of it. When I play Rimworld it's not hours that go by but days. I love building a colony the way I want and defending it from raiders. All of the events that happen in the game make up a fun story with laughs, tears and rage.Rimworld got mod support on Alpha 2 or 3 so the community has been very busy and active making fun mods to keep you playing again and again.I know early access games can be hit or miss but trust me Rimworld was total gold on Alpha 1 and has only gotten better with each update. This is one early access game you DON'T need to worry about.			"

								I really wanted to give this game a review yesterday, but I wanted to wait until I had 30 hours so I could give some good input.Let me start off saying that this game is beautiful. Even in a toxic fallout during winter, I still liked the atmosphere.The developer is amazing. You could go on any Reddit post that has a question, and you would surely see an answer from the lead developer.PROS:I usually don't play games like this, but with all the reviews, I just had to buy it. I haven't stopped playing it since I've bought it.Super fun when you get the hang of it.There's always more to do in your colonyMicromanagement is masterfully made.CONS:Can be hard to learn.You'll kill a couple colonies before you learn the game completely...Overall, I'd give this 3 captured pirates and 6.5 colonists that were injured by wild boar revenge out of 10.(9.5 / 10)			"

								Ignore my playtime - I have 1000+ hours since around alpha 7, this game is superb and an absolutely fantastic investment for the amount of time you can get out of it.To start, this game in its purest form is about controlling randomness. The planet is randomly generated. Your colonists are randomly generated. The events that transpire are random.You start with nothing - a few colonists with randomly generated abilities, personality traits, and possibly injuries or other health conditions. You have a handful of building materials, enough food to last a week, and some simple weapons. From there, it's your job to help them survive.However, you don't control your colonists directly. You give them orders, and they will try to carry them out. This isn't an RTS game - at its core it's a procedural story generator, and your role is basically to keep your colonists alive for as long as possible as their lives play out. You are like a mostly powerless god, able to guide your colonists but can never overcome their free will or innate personality traits for long. Things will never go exactly as planned, and that is part of the joy of the game. Traders will visit your colony, you will get raided by pirates and tribals and even mechanoids, colonists will get to know each other better and even fall in love, random disasters will happen, your colonists will get sick... their lives play out while randomness happens all around them.Once you get accustomed to the basic mechanics, the purest and arguably most fun way to play this game is 'iron man' mode - don't just reload an autosave whenever anything bad happens to your colony. When someone dies, they die. In some circumstances, that will mean the end of your colony. But sometimes you will continue, hampered by the loss of a colonist but hopeful for the future, eventually thriving without them. This is RimWorld at its best - a rich simulation that allows for some incredible storytelling. There are few games where you will ever find yourself so attached to what are essentially randomly generated pawns.A lot of people in the reviews are comparing RimWorld to Prison Architect, but it's only like PA in the sense that the art style is similar - the graphics are simplistic and representative. The game does not play the same way at all. It's much closer to Dwarf Fortress, but really it's a little unfair to compare RimWorld to another game because it doesn't really feel derivative of anything else. It's very much its own thing.I think it's easier to say who I wouldn't recommend this game for:- If you like to have tutorials and hand holding throughout, this game is not for you- If you don't like challenging games, this game is not for you- If you want action and constant battles and explosions, this game is not for you- If you like predictability and hate randomness, this game is not for youOverall, RimWorld might not be the prettiest game in the world, but what it lacks in looks it makes up for tenfold in replayability. Ludeon are constantly adding more content, they listen to community feedback, and even though it's Early Access this game has vastly more content and replayability than most completed indie games.I've invested hundreds of hours into this game and will probably invest thousands more. Couldn't recommend enough.			"

								Rimworld is a young and beautifully seductive... yet cruel and exotic mistress with a severe case of “BPD” (Borderline Personality Disorder) that you’ll find yourself running back to night, after night, after night. Once you understand her language, her …ways, endure her pain and suffering inflicted upon you nightly, and start to survive her fiery and destructive emotional outbursts. You’ll start to see the heavens part and the Godrays pour in on the potential that you can have, sharing a life together in a blissful new world harmony.However, if you mishandle her, miscalculate or neglect her needs, or… even say just one wrong word to her… expect everything you have painstakingly endured and built to be torn down in front of your very own eyes in a blaze of uncontrollable psychotic glory. When that moment finally happens, when the realisation that this thing, this… monster, that you once held so close and dear in your arms with all your hopes and dreams invested into, finally breaks free from its mental restraints of care, stability and love… You find yourself dazed and confused … staring into an endless moment of emotionless hindsight. You face your final moments alive on whatever world you have tried to stake out a living on in silence… you watch as your cooks arms are blown off by raiders that have stolen some new GlitterTech incendiary weaponry that is now setting your whole map, base, settlers and outer defences on fire… but its ok you never liked his simple cooked one ingredient meals that gave you food poisoning anyway……. WATCH IN HORROR!!!….. as your newly hatched chickens are beaten to death in melee and your pet house cat “Snuggles” neck is cut in cold blood, just because one of your own settlers is in a psychotic mood that their room isn’t as beautiful as someone’s else’s….. sigh R.I.P Snuggles and baby chicken nuggets. And finally watch as your last settler alive succumbs to extreme heatstroke that your whole base was suffering from, and dies on the floor of his very own room, his last thoughts of wishing that he had laid better quality floor boards… but just never had the time to do it…as his vison fades to darkness… Because, you see, an eclipse has blocked the sun for last 2 days which has knocked out your solar panel farm and drained the backup batteries that was once powering all of your bases air conditioners. Just then a solar flare event takes place that wipes out all electrically powered devices, so those wood fuel generators that you just built over the last 2 days to compensate for the loss of power the eclipse caused… are now useless. Then the left hook comes out of nowhere, that one you did not see coming, oh yes… an epic heatwave just shows up to say “hey, how you doin” …. pushing your global temps to 55+ degrees Celsius even in the shade. Without cooling available it effectively and slowly turns all living things into a sack of sizzling seductive bacon…. Hmmm bacon. In the famous words of Private Hicks “Game over man .. Game over!.“ 9.5/10 - Current Alpha State  Considering that this is still an alpha stage game, RimWorld shows a remarkable amount of polish and potential, however, whenever you do find a shortcoming with a game mechanic you don’t quite like, I guarantee you there’s a mod to meld this game into your style of play or aesthetic pleasure. The modding community on steam and the official forums is also very strong with new mods, updates and tweaks being added almost daily at the time of this review.A big plus for me also is that the developer listens to the modding community, and has quite simply stated that there are certain things he wants to expand in the final game content. And has announced to the modding community to focus creating those elements for it to be implemented into possible future alpha builds.As a student game developer I love this idea and will implement into my own game development plan when that time happens. Also for those that haven’t clocked like 50+ hrs on similar games like “Prison Architect” you will initially struggle. I’m not going to lie there’s currently a very steep learning curve even with the adaptive tutor enabled, but once you get over it, it’s pretty simple and has very enjoyable concepts to understand and master.These are all my reasons I have given RimWorld a Terminator 2 sinking fiery thumbs up.

								This is one of those gems of a game. One of those games that never gets old. A complete diamond.I backed this game a long time ago and its one of the best decisions Ive ever made. I very highly recomend this to everyone.Now the review...Its a colony sim game where your ""pawns"" are stranded on an outlying Rimworld. The game is driven by one of three story tellers that act as your ""rng"" trigering events and helping progress the game as you play. The goals of the game are simple, survive and try to get your colony off of this unforgiving land, but the gameplay and chances to achieve this are complicated.Each pawn has their own traits and moods. You must balance all the survival aspects of the game in order to succeed, however be warned; this game is unforgiving, balancing hunger, hapiness and raids. The depth of this game is beyond phenominal, if a pawn isnt properly taken care of they can break down and go on mental rampages. World events like super volcanoes can force your pawns inside, needing to grow their food indoors in hopes of lasting till the dust settles all while fending off pirates, natives, and wild animals.Pawns can fall in love, divorce, have rivals, hate each other, throw parties, instagate fights inside your own colony and so on.Now this is a colony building game, so there are aspects of building. Walls, defences, art, furniture, temperature controling systems. On the surface this game looks pretty simple, but as you play you will see the depth and complexity sewn into each fiber of this absolute gemstone.The community is 2nd to none, with an outstanging group of modders and mod support.Basically what im saying is why are you still reading reviews and why havnt you bought it yet?

It's sad that with A16 update at the horizon, Tynan has to spend time dealing with this nonsense. Guess this is the weird world we have to live in: Some people next door are calling Mass Effect SJW ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because of their support of homosexuality and such while here we have people whining about only having straight men, gay men, bisexual women and gay women. Personally I'm enjoying this game and I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about those who chose to reject a great game due to its ""horribly biased gender view"" (though, ironically, not due to the fact that this game allows incest and harvesting skin, meat and organs from helpless prisoners.). Maybe one day some kind modders can come up a good solution for you easily-triggered folks. Does uniformly distributed sexual orientation sound good to you?			"

								Alright...So here's the thing.After playing it a bit back and forth, deciding the way i wanted to go, restarting the game due to insane events that occured, i finally completed my first game... 127 hours of playtime for a single completed game ! That's freaking awesome :DNow, the game is in beta, meaning things will change and hopefully for the better.But the game as it is NOW, is VERY playable. There's no bugs i've encountered, a few things might need some tweaks, but besides that, i was very pleased with the game.If you are the kind of gamer that loves indie strategy games, this is JUST the one. I was skeptic when i bought it, but no regrets have been made since. I do however have to admit i needed a few ""gettings started"" vids in order to get a good start. There's just too many things to do in the beginning, that you more than likely to miss a few VERY important ones. With the vids, you get a better start as you will learn the pure basics and important To-Do's...But man, this game is a challenge haha. A great challenge tho :DAnd, as it's in beta, i can only imagine that the game will get better, maybe even a multiplayer part? Perhaps being able to travel on the map rather than in a region? Challenges, steam achivements, campaign perhaps? As it's still in development, i have high hopes ;)Very much recommended to those in doubt!			"

								My first experience with Rimworld last night. Start with 3 shipwrecked colonists. Going pretty good, establishing base of operations. Random person walks up and joins us. The harvests are plentiful. Life is good.  Lone pirate attack. They kill best hunter/marksman. Knockout pirate. Take them as prisoner. Tend to their wounds and talk them into joining us and replacing the person they killed. Life is good.  A group of 9 abandoned cats joins the colony. Little did we know this would mark the end.  Group of 3 pirates attack. Defense turret destroyed by grenade flinging pirate. New reformed hunter dies. A cat dies and one of the colonists thinks this is a good time to go ahead and butcher that cat for meat. While picking up cat a grenade lands nearby. Colonist actually survives blast. 2 pirates killed, other flees. Cat butcher colonist is taken to medical bed for doctoring.  2 colonists that do most of the work come down with the flu. Confine them to their beds. 1 of the flu victims eventually goes berserk, kills other bed ridden comrade in their sleep with a knife. Beserk stumbles into hallway and starts attacking cats. Other colonist is now healed up from grenade and enters hallway to be stabbed by berserk. The colonist that has been taking care of everyone ends berserk with 2 rifle rounds. Berserk's trained dog goes mad upon seeing its master killed. Kill dog. They bury the 2 flu victims. Colonist that survived a grenade! and got stabbed by friend, wound gets infected. They die.  Remaining colonist doesn't bother to bury them, just drags the body off to where it won't be seen. In utter hopelessness I order last colonist to kill all the cats. Instead she heals and nurtures them. Cats multiply. I leave cave dwelling cat lady to her unkown fate.... most likely killed by pirates and then eaten by cats. "

								Alright...So here's the thing.After playing it a bit back and forth, deciding the way i wanted to go, restarting the game due to insane events that occured, i finally completed my first game... 127 hours of playtime for a single completed game ! That's freaking awesome :DNow, the game is in beta, meaning things will change and hopefully for the better.But the game as it is NOW, is VERY playable. There's no bugs i've encountered, a few things might need some tweaks, but besides that, i was very pleased with the game.If you are the kind of gamer that loves indie strategy games, this is JUST the one. I was skeptic when i bought it, but no regrets have been made since. I do however have to admit i needed a few ""gettings started"" vids in order to get a good start. There's just too many things to do in the beginning, that you more than likely to miss a few VERY important ones. With the vids, you get a better start as you will learn the pure basics and important To-Do's...But man, this game is a challenge haha. A great challenge tho :DAnd, as it's in beta, i can only imagine that the game will get better, maybe even a multiplayer part? Perhaps being able to travel on the map rather than in a region? Challenges, steam achivements, campaign perhaps? As it's still in development, i have high hopes ;)Very much recommended to those in doubt!			"

 My Experience with Rimworld  Before I break it down into my personal Pros and Cons, I'd like to preface it by sharing a little bit of my experience with this game. I have been playing  Rimworld  since Alpha 3.  I try to describe this game to my friends and coworkers and I've never felt like I could properly explain the satisfying feeling you get from setting up a successful settlement.  I first heard about it from a good friend and fellow game enthusiast while I was home on leave before celebrating my honeymoon with my wife.  I decided to check it out while we were in the cabin relaxing and I remember feeling myself become enveloped in the game's depth and imaginative qualities.  I hadn't felt so lost in a game since I picked up WoW in 2004.  Needless to say, I continued playing.I played this game for hours and hours while overseas on a little Acer netbook.  I've never played a game with so much depth that can also run on a brick from 2009.  It introduced me to one of the friendliest modding communities and even enticed me to learn XML just to try and give something back to that same community.  Pros:   *Replay Value - You will play world after world, colony after colony and it won't even feel like you've lost when you restart.  *Friendly Support Team - I've had no issues dealing with Ludeon's people and I'm now a huge fan of Tynan.  *Modding Community - Incredibly dedicated group of people who only want to share a positive gaming experience with you.  *Customization - Everything can be changed whether it be with a gameplay mechanic or simple mod, it can be what you want it to be.   Cons:   *Learning Curve - It will take a few hours and scenarios to really get a feel of this game.  The smallest change in the updates can effect so much as well, which is somewhat of a Pro in it own right.  *It's an Alpha - Sometimes you can't get around the fact that it is an Alpha, albeit the most playable Alpha I've ever enjoyed; it can, at times feel a little unpolished.  *It's not for everybody - It really isn't.  Like I said earlier, describing this game and showing to to my friends/coworkers doesn't really work.  You may not know that you're going to enjoy it unless you really knew what you were looking at beforehand. I'll be editing this review as time goes on to update for current Alphas and to correct my formatting.  Thank you for reading my review on one of my favorite games.			"

								Ok so, first of all I have to say I don't usually do reviews but believe me when I say this game deserves all the credit I can give it.Now, you gotta understand something about this game, you can't just buy it, hop in, play it for a bit and beat it, RimWorld will simply not allow you that, and that's good, that means more bang for your buck.When you start playing you'll mess up a lot of things and the game might seem unfairly unforgiving, but trust me, it's all about making for a good gaming experience. You'll lose more often than you'll win, heck I only beat the game after playing over 160 Hours, if that's not challenging I don't know what is, but in the end it still feels good, it feels like taking a punch and getting back up just to take another punch a few days (ingame days) later and get KO, RimWorld has no mercy, yet you know you can do better and believe me you'll strive to do better, the game manages to compel you.Ok so after this introduction let me tell you more or less the pros and cons.Pros:-Challenging-Hundreds of hours of play time-Active community making mods-Fun-New features added continuously, dev is really cool-Good bang for your buck-Adaptive AI that really works for any playstyle-Smooth performance, no lag or anythingCons:-Robs you of your life and sleeping hours-A bug here and there but nothing major-Still in alpha sure but this game is being developed properly so no worries-This game won't have a sale anytime soon so either buy it at full price or comeback in a couple of yearsExtra:Well with that out of the way let me just tell you a little bit of my latest story, which was the one I actually made it to the end!So I start on this planet a bit on the cold side but not too much, 3 guys right, everything starts smoothly enough, an easy raid now and then nothing too bad. Eventually I get 11 colonist, the most I ever had in any playthrough (it's hard keeping these little guys alive), so the AI decides those are way too many and throws down a sort of shipwreck that contains mechanoids inside, I prepare my colonists for the battle ahead and get some (guys with ranged guns) behind nearby sandbags I built near the crashed ship, and some (melee folks) really close to the ship, so the mechanoids come out and amongst all the gunfire, grenade tossing and punching I lose 4 colonists (funny enough I never managed to find one of the corpses, it wasn't anywhere to be found on the map, not in any graveyard or in plain sight, perhaps it was blown to pieces in the midst of the battle) and that wouldn't be too bad if not for in the next day I got 4 colonists with the plague and despite my best efforts they all died, so now I'm back to only 3 colonists. After this nothing major happened, apart the ocasional raid, crazy manhunter animals and infestations inside my base with genetically modified insect like creatures designed to kill, among other small things. So eventually I got back to 9 colonists and started preparing to leave the planet, bear in mind it took me almost 3 ingame years to get here, and you see, it takes A LOT of resources to build a new spaceship. So I started getting what I needed all while maintaining my base operational, and as luck would have it a new infestation spawned but this time was away from my base so I didn't have to fight it off in the meantime, although these bugs keep spreading and multiplying until there's no hope left, I tried using mortars to shell the multiple hives that had spawned over time but they were way too burrowed inside a mountain (and by now it was unthinkable to send my colonists in to fight these buggers), so now I know I have a deadline to get the hell off this infested forsaken planet. Now for the grande finale, as the spaceship was getting finished I got some colonists inside, and when it was finished and I was getting ready to get the last couple of colonists inside their cryptosleep caskets to blast off, and as I'm about to do it this giant raid comes my way with 30 raiders ready to pillage and murder everything that crossed their way so I hastily got my remaining colonists inside and blasted off just as the raiders were getting through my defenses. And this ladies and gentlemen was one story among so many others, the AI driven storyteller does a really amazing job, one of the best, if not the best, AI I've ever had the pleasure facing in any game.If you liked what you read please do buy the game, this developer deserves it and this game sure as hell does too.Thank you for your time.PS: It seems I might have stayed up playing for too long, the sun is rising.

								This game is dangerous.  If you enjoy time with your friends and family you should not purchase this game.  I on the otherhand decided to lay my life aside for many hours of playing this amazingly deep and enjoyable game.  I cannot wait to see what the devs do with this going forward.  As it is this is a stable, full feeling and enjoyable game worth many hours of your time and easly worth the price of purchase.			"

								This is what all Early Access games should strive to be!  Truly lives up to being playable, fun, and generally bug free (except for insect hives).  The developer is active on the forum and subreddit and incorporates feedback into updates.And the gameplay itself?  A great mix of base-building with resource & people management.  A refreshing mix of having colonists with free will, strong controls for optionally setting specific priorites per person, and even being able to ""draft"" individual colonists for extreme micromanagement.  Lots of difficulty levels depending on how hardcore you want things to be, and plenty of big and little things to accomplish.  As a bonus, there are plenty of mods on the Steam Workshop.  All in all, well worth buying in its current state!			"

								One of the very, very few games to draw me in for marathon sessions for YEARS on end. I got into RimWorld the day after the Kickstarter ended and have loved every single iteration of RimWorld. While a lot has been added to the game over the years, it has somehow retained the core of what made alpha 1 an absolute blast. It's a rare game where you grow attached to your pawns, to the home they've carved out of the wilderness, proud of the work you have accomplished and the threats you have survived. And you will get attached, you will holler in rage when one of them dies, or loses an eye, or gets kidnapped. You will rage quit when raiders blow their way through your walls to get to the undefended innards of your base, torching and destroying whatever they see. You may even shed a tear when a beloved pet gets mauled by a cougar. But you know what else you will do? You will start a new colony. You will fight tooth and nail to establish a safe haven for your burgeoning colony. You will learn from your mistakes and become better, stronger, smarter. You will learn how to survive on the Rim, to thrive, and maybe, maybe you will make it off the planet. Whatever you do, you will have fun. This is easily one of the best games I've ever had the joy to play. If you like base building, simulations, 'ant farms', you can only hope to fall in love with RimWorld. I'm glad Tynan waited so long to put this on Steam, I'm not sure I want to know how much of my life this game has devoured. And to think, I still have to load up a mod or two someday, should I ever get bored with the vanilla game. So far, that has not been the case. A very loud and hearty recommendation from me.			"

								Add 300+ hours to the total played as I owned this before its arrival on steam. This is my go to game for some humorous fun. The variation in biomes is excellent. Extreme cold did mean crossing some lines of food choices. Prisoners in these environments should be more co-operative for their own benefit! There are relationships and pets, friends and enemy’s so plenty of dynamics. I’ve had hilarious adventures like starting a new colony with 1 guy, his lover and his ex-wife … (Only his ex-wife could shoot!).One tip for survival is an old video of mine about freezers! Having a stockpile will save your life and your animals! 


YouTube™ Video: Rimworld - Dual Freezers 

			Views: 5,941		

			Currently freezers are better than fridges as nothing spoils. Video contains tips and tricks for building your own freezer. New recommendation for hot biomes to set freezer temp even lower.		

I think there should be a gun safety classroom … you will understand soon! My husband tries to save their lives I work on survival of the fittest principle. Unfortunately the mortar’s are so safe they rarely hit anything!No real tutorial but there are tons of you tube videos. Despite this the game is completely playable and has deep content crafting even though listed as Early Access. The best part is they continue to add more great stuff. This one ranks up there as one of my all-time favorite early access development success stories. Good work guys!For those having trouble ... let them die, learn from their death and then make a nice statue and a hat to remember them by. Fans of Gnomoria and Prison Architect should give it a go!			"

Early Access Review
								If steam would feature a ""neutral"" choice, that would be it for this game. Bare in mind while reading: You can like this game. There are great parts, but since there are many positive reviews, I feel it is necessary to state some of the things that might annoy the potential player and customer. I cannot stress it enough: This review is not meant to convince you that this is a bad game. It is not. But I feel that it is important to list the downsides aswell. If you can bare with the statement of downsides, read on. So, back to the original review:My personal opinion: In the beginning, the game was great fun, because everything was new. But over the time, first issues showed up:Micromanagement: You will basically have to do everything by yourself if you want to see it finished. Otherwise, the characters will find ways to screw up, ignore your orders or in many, many cases, get themselves killed. Hunting for example is one of the worst jobs for the characters, but can be most effective if you do everything on your own. Every time you will have to mark the creatures that shall be hunted and the characters will do it or not and if they do it, you will have many times where you watch them trying to shoot a sleeping hare for half a day. That is not effective. It gets more effective if you let a melee fighter hunt. But, it is still untopped if you simply take a guy with a melee weapon, put him on draft, kill everything you want to see dead and order haulers to get the carcasses. That will max out hunting, but YOU have to do it. There is another method though and that is ... mods. You will read that word alot in this review.Combat: If you do not micromanage the combat to an absurd level, everything will go down the drain. Ranged fighters will not automatically increase the distance to engaging targets. They will not stop firing even if they have already hit the friendly infront of them 3 freaking times and are about to kill him. The enemies however can have a ranged skill of 3 and be dumb as feck and will still manage to throw spears over several obstacles and hit three guys behind the cover of a steel wall. I had a situation where one enemy, completely unskilled, managed to shred off three armes and one leg with 4 attacks. The game was over after that. There is one great answer to this problem: Mods. You can find realistic combat mods to add some logic to a bugged and simply weird combat system.General logic and game difficulty: I play on rough and permadeath because that is the way the game is meant to be played. However, if you decrease the game by one difficulty, you will feel a huge gap. It will be dumb and dull. The game in general is not difficult, no matter what kind of difficulty you play. It only has one mechanism that makes it difficult: Crippled logic. If you present a problem and take away ALL the possible solutions but one, you will automatically have a difficult problem. And the game features tons of problems like this:- Heatwaves. If you play as tribals, early heatwaves will most likely end your game. Why? Because the game does not care about shade, wetness or if your home is build into a deep mountain. There are only two solutions: Micromanagement everything and be lucky or add cooling items like a cowboy hat or a vent. Thats it. - Manhunting packs. Why on earth would 24 boars swing by to attack your steel walls to crush you and your people? Why? And even if you somehow manage to fight off 8 manhunting boomalopes, everybody will be stressed and Roger the dog will go nuts and try to eat Betty the cook, which will make you shoot him which will make Denver, the dog owner, go bezerk. Yes, you are managing a bunch of lunatics and you will have to fight of the strangest things you have ever seen. While it sounds fun and can be fun the first time, it will be a game ender in most cases, causing you to start from scratch, doing the same stuff that was fun once over and over and over again.- Fires. It does not matter if you have a high technology colony, they will not be able to use buckets of water to put out fires. Steel walls will burn and the fire will spred. Steel. Walls. Will. Burn. And when an early dry thunderstorm hits your map, you will have tons of fun micromanaging every single firespot because your beloved colonists will find ways to get them in the middle of a fire and be killed.- Explosions. A power coduit will explode like a ton of super floyd TNT. You will not be able to place fuses. Unless you use ... a mod.- Moods. I had to laugh several times when I saw how this game was MADE difficult with moods. ""Feeling terrible for no reason"" is one of the best. But I also liked the combination of ""My husband Bob died"" and ""my friend Bob died"". One colonist will get multiple mali because of the death of one person. If you harvest the organs of a pirate that killed two of you people in an attack 2 minutes ago, people will be upset because ""innocents"" were harmed. Adding mechanisms like this is cheap if you ask me. On the other hand, you can command your colonists to do tons of stuff, but you cannot force them to do something that would actually bring joy into ther hearts. Like put 4 people at the billard table to have a good time. Well, you could certainly try to change that by ... you guessed it ... installing mods.- Extreme moods. So yeah, Bill has great clothes on, but his pants are down to 14% durability. He will be annoyed and yeah, he will most likely go postal on the others because of that hole in this pocket. That might sound extreme, but it can and will happen. People can go over the edge because of worn out clothes. And yeah, we found Bill in the stables, completely naked, punching the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the animals. At first, this might be fun but it will be frustrating and tedious over the tons of replays one will have.- Enemies. Watch them destroy steel walls with wooden clubs. Watch them break steel doors with bare hands. Its fun.Storyteller: That thing - to be entirely honest - really put me on the edge. Not so much that I dropped all my clothes and punched the innocent dog but I find it kind of dumb and insulting that the game is advertised with an individual and cool AI storyteller. There is none. What is meant is the random event generator. Thats the mechanism that will ""decide"" what random event you will face next. Is that a story? Certainly not! Otherwise, I would be a doctor because I can use a first aid kit. People, ... let me pass, I am a doctor! Boom, heatwave. Yeah, funny story.Mods: While the description states that the game already has alot of content, I would say, that is not true. The early content is neat and nicely done but in the midgame to lategame, there is nothing much to do. Unless, and here we go again, you install mods. Seriously, the game will be boring quite quickly but it will be more fun with mods. So, why is that a problem at all? Because I paid 30 bucks for it! I would not mind AT ALL if it wasn't for the price tag. Because I feel bad about all the modders that invest time and effort to make this game better and get nothing out of it. If half of the money would be distributed amongst the modding community, cool. If the game would be sold for 14,99, cool! But I paid 30 bucks for an early access game that does not feature alot of content, is artificially made complicated and will rapidly be 70% tedious and 30% fun. That is the main problem I have and why I would not recommend it unless somebody really wants to support the developer or simply has a passion for unfinished games that give you problems and take away all solutions but one.So, to sum up: For 15 bucks, sure why not. But 30 bucks for a game that will only be nice if you have 12 mods installed, sorry ... but no. In that case, wait until the full game is being released and check the reviews, especially the negative reviews, for the content.Now, fanboys ... please feel free to insult me and crush my feelings.

								Been supporting this for about 2 years, great to finally see it on steam! These devs are phenomenal the amount of changes I've watch RimWorld go through is mind boggling, it's so far from the game I first played in 2014, and every step of the way it's been non stop improvements. These guys don't mess around! As for gameplay, this is a game for EVERYONE. Casual gamer? No problem, relax and build your base with an occasional interruption of a small invasion or alien attack. Looking for a challenge? Turn up the difficulty and prepare to spend every week in game fixing yourself up from the last attack, only to be hit again by the time you finish fixing up. If you like roleplaying there's an endless world with amazing stories to be had, the characters are all unique and as are their interactions with one another, and how they handle the environments and events around them. If you're more like me and just like to build a huge colony and not worry about the lives of the characters - go right ahead! They are yours and will do your bidding (within reason), just keep them relatively happy and you'll have yourself a massive compound with an unstoppable army in no time. Well, that's about all I have for right now. This game is 100% worth the money, I'd highly recommend looking into it if you haven't already, I've had hundreds of hours of fun adventures on this game and it's never been the same twice. I look forward for many more adventures in the future!			"

								I followed Rimworld since before it was accepted in to the Early Access on Steam and it has come leaps and bounds since those earlier versions I saw uploaded on Tynan's (the main developer) youtube channel. The game is like Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft had a child and that child became an astronaut. When I say it's like Dwarf Fortress, I specifically mean the colony management parts. Minecraft shares the survival themes and it's the closest game I could think of that matched in that aspect. In Rimworld, the three base scenarios are a group of 3 crash survivors, a group of 5 tribesman who have fled their land and a rich explorer. There are now tons of other scenarios (I haven't played any since most of my colonies die out early) and there's a lot of different ways to play Rimworld. After choosing the scenario you go on to choose from 9 different levels of difficulty. There are 3 AIs (in the base game, not in the other ones from Workshop), one that gives you a gradual progression in events, one that sends whatever the heck it wants at you whenever and one that's intended for playes that want a calmer experience. After choosing an AI you get to choose one of 6 overall game difficulties and if you want to include permadeath. There's peaceful if you just want to build a nice large colony that lives peacefully and then there's extreme where the game will try to ♥♥♥♥ing end you. After all those tedious settings, and creating your colonists you enter the game ready to challenge nature and other AI-driven enemies on a Rimworld. The game's great but if your attention span isn't very long you may have issues playing longer saves. It can be a little tedious just like all colony management games.			"

								RimWorld: Losing is FUN! (TM)or... How I learned to stop worrying and love the boomrat.Crazy thing... about an hour in to your settlement, your chest will puff up with pride, a single tear will roll down your cheek, and you'll be filled with an urge to go tell someone all about it. This will be approximately two weeks in to your experience with the game.If you've ever loved Dwarf Fortress, or if you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but wish it was a little more accessible, RimWorld might be worth your time. While it certainly isn't without glaring flaws, I find over all, this game's brilliant successes more than make up for them.The gameplay, which, cards on the table, is the most important thing for me, is on point. I find most of their systems to be well balanced and interesting. Difficulty is extremely modular and customizable, and you should be able to find the right amount of challenge for yourself. Unfortunately, starting the game still feels a little cumbersome. Without downloading mods, you cannot control anything about the survivors you take with you on your expedition, aside from rerolling them randomly over and over until one fits your needs. EDB Prepare Carefully *helps*, but in my opinion, it's too far in the other direction; it allows TOTAL control over your settlers, with zero limits. If the random rolls were a little more playable, that would help, or maybe if you could save certain survivors.Visually, this game is a perfect example of aesthetics vs. graphics. The graphics for this title are pretty simple and plain, but aesthetically, it comes together very nicely. I do recommend some visual mods here- My favorite is one that recolors stockpiles. Excellent for organization!The best part of this game is its accessibility. I can't tell you how many people I've shown Dwarf Fortress, only for them to go ""Oh, that looks REALLY complicated. I mean, cool, but REALLY complicated."" RimWorld has a very well written tutorial to show you the basics, and then an exceptionally designed hint system, that warns you when you're about to shoot yourself in the foot because you don't know what a gun is. For example, I was building a sprawling apartment complex to combine my summer cooling units. The game went, ""Uh, hey boss, I know that LOOKS more convenient, but if a fire rolls through here, your lack of fire breaks is gonna make this place light up faster than the end of Burning Man.""And I was like, ""Oh, that's a good point, tutorial dude! Thanks!""Essentially, after the first tutorial, the game offers unobtrusive tips, tailored around the activity you are currently performing, with suggestions based on what the game thinks you might be doing wrong. I found the tips to GREATLY increase my enjoyment of the game, and it's the best handling of a help system that I've ever seen.So let's break it down.Good: Fantastic ""tribe management"" gameplay, with an emphasis on roguelike Die and Try Again strategies. Excellent tutorial system, and the mod community grabs this game from the ""Good"" category and thrusts it violently in to ""Unmissable"". Bad: While the aesthetic is alright, the sprites do feel a little too similar. I do feel like the difficulty curve ramps up a little quickly on your first couple play throughs, but you'll get the hang of it after a while.Ugly: Character creation. Dear god, just let us express some preferences instead of spamming reroll over and over again.Recommended Mods: Glittertech, Hospitality A15, Recolor Stockpile			"

Early Access Review
								this game was a pleasant suprise.i bought it at full price at the recommendation of reviewers and friends.  i was expecting a ""prison architect"" clone, and at that would have found the game serviceable.  what i got was so much more.the game shares the same art style and basic functions of ""prison architect"" but is a fundamentally different game.  i actually enjoyed playing it more than PA.  hunting, farming, mining, crafting, training animals, trading, basic diplomacy, inter-colonist relations, mood, object quality, random events, an ai ""storyteller,"" and an ""end game"" are what it adds beyond the ""build, plan, manage"" formula of PA; in the setting of a colony stranded on an unforgiving planet.  at the writing of this review, i have completed one colony playthrough on ""hard"" difficulty at around 60 hours.  i could have completed it in about half the time if i didn't go for a ""100% complete.""  i'm looking forawrd to further playthroughs with mods, different start conditions, and harder difficulty at some point, as well as eagerly looking forward to what further content gets added to the game; so can say for me that replayability is high for the game.100% recommend for management/build game lovers, even at full price.

								For me this is one of the games that creates this magical feeling of something special, something new. It manages to create interesting stories again and again. I've played the early access version for years now and I can still get excited to play again. While the core game is pretty solid, where it shines is in the mod building community. Some mods are almost essential while others add a lot of content and flavour. So don't miss out on what you find in the workshop, and if you want to take it a step further, in the game's mod forum[ludeon.com].			"

								This Game is really, really awesome! I was slightly skeptical when i first saw that it looked similar to Prison Architect, but I decided to go for it anyway because the idea of building up a space colony seemed pretty cool. I am very glad I did. It really isnt anything like prison architect except for how the artwork looks and how you build but it plays totally different. Even though this title is still in early access, this proves that not all early access games are terrible or a joke. This is very well put together and each time you play, as the developer intends, it's a new experience, a new story, with different colonists. Since i've purchased this game, this is the only game i've been playing and my steam library contains over 100 games. It is addicting on the levels of Sid Mier's Civilization and the replayability is even higher. If you are unsure on whether to purchase this game but you like Sci-Fi, Tycoon/Management games, games in which you build something from nothing yourself, or if the idea of running your own tribe or space colony is appealing, i'd say one hundred percent get this game. Right now, it's selling for Thirty Dollars, and I think it's actually worth more, I appreciate the lower pricing range for the fact that it is early access and the developer knows that bugs can be found. My experience thus far has been seamless and bug-free at 35.3 hours game time when this was written. In addition to all the greatness in the original game, there is already a very large modding community turning out some great mods and scenarios for everyone to play and there is additional content coming every day! Final Rating for me , Five Stars, 10/10 / 100% love it. Thank you Ludeon Studios and everyone involved for creating such a great, quality game, keep up the good work!			"

Combined with a constant stream of invovative updates and one of the best Modding communities I have ever seen Rimworld is truly a masterpiece that I am proud to have backed near V 4 and spent hours playing and replaying.  Hopefully we can keep this pace up and that the Steam Release will draw new players into our crazy world.			"

								Early Access, my muscular buttocks. I've been playing Rimworld off and on throughout development, and even the very first alpha version I tried was remarkably solid and fun to play. Granted, there's a lot more content now--and I mean A LOT more--but at it's core Rimworld has always provided a smooth and entertaining experience. Tynan Sylvester's work ethic and quality control are unmatched by literally any other developer or game I've followed, and Rimworld could easily have shed the EA moniker a long, long time ago.In fact, Rimworld is one of the rare games--and I'm struggling to even think what might have been the last one--that I've been more than happy to pay full price for. In the era of bundles and Steam sales, that's saying quite a lot.The AI Storytellers and customization options for a new game allow players to tailor the experience to their whims. If you're looking for a challenge, you can pit yourself against the ever-increasing threat of hostile raids. More interested in the opposite end of the spectrum? Virtually eliminate threats altogether and focus your efforts on building your fledgling outpost into an impenetrable fortress. Or a vacation resort, if that's more your thing.But besides all the incredible gameplay mechanics at work--farming, animal taming, base-building, fortification, defense, combat--the most incredible aspect of Rimworld is the attachment you develop to your colonists. Even when the game lacked much of the depth and complexity that's been fleshed out over the past two years, you still got to know them as individual entities--traits, personalities (based on a few key variables), every injury they suffered, every mental break your other colonists had to wrangle them back from. When one dies, you may find yourself scrambling for a recent save file to bring them back. Not because you want to cheat the outcome, but because he or she was there from the beginning and it just doesn't feel right continuing without them.I got into playing Rimworld because I was excited about the base-building aspect, but there's so much more to enjoy here. It's sort of a top-down, base-building, survival, people sim. If that doesn't entice you, I don't know what will. I guess that makes this paragraph the TL;DR.So yes. It's worth full price. On sale, it's practically stealing.			"

								This is the story of how ""M"" murdered ""Engie.""-M joined the colony early on.-M and Engie started a friendship, as they worked tirelessly getting the colony up and running.-However, all good things come to an end.  -Raiders, jealous of my town of ""Freedonia,"" initiated a raid against us.  It was not uncommon, but, in a sick twist of fate,  M's brother was one of the raiders.  Engie had no choice but to gun down M's brother as he charged her with a club. This broke something inside of M.  For weeks later M would have nervous and mental breakdowns.  The colony always nursed him back to health, and with the introduction of beer, we thought all would be well.  But M always held a grudge against Engie.The emergency sirens go off.  Another attack is underway.  A mad elephant has grown a taste for human blood.  Engie and M go to defend the colony at the sandbags.  Engie takes aim, and fires the killing blow against the rabid elephant.  M took aim as well....but he was not targeting the elephant.  In a single shot that resounded from my speakers, M shot Engie once in the back of the head.  I looked on in horror as Engie, my best colonist and leader, lie dead next to the elephant.I knew M did it on purpose, but I couldn't prove it to the other colonists as they hid inside the base during the attack.  Fortunately, a new colonist named Timo joined up and I knew what must be done.  I told M to go hunting for food, but little did he know that he was hunting a Warg.  I made sure he didn't take his gun, as he thought he was going to hunt rabbits.  The warg vicisiouly attacked M, but did not kill him.  As he lay unconscious, Nemo, our doctor,  wanted to rush to the rescue.  I told her ""no. Timo will go get him.""  I gave Timo Engie's old pulse rifle, and sent him to ""take care of M.""  As M lay dying with hands outstretched for help from our new colonist, Timo raised his rifle.  ""For Engie.""  Those were the last words heard by M before the sound of a discharging pulse rifle resounded through the air.***10/10.  If only TV writers would play this game, we would have no end to outstanding drama on television!***			"

								I've been playing this game since it came out of Kickstarter, about two and a half years ago. I keep coming back to it because the of the insanely fun stories that happen. I am not going to regale you with any of them, since they are too many to count and I don't think I could choose. Updates are consistent, adding major new features every 2-3 months. The first Alpha I played back in late 2013 was Alpha 4 if I remember correctly, now it's Alpha 14 so roughly a new major update comes out every few months. The mods made for this is great and the community is nice overall, helping you with base layouts and tips. Downloading a mod for improved defences like trenches and embrasures together with a mod for zombies is probably one of the most fun times I've had with a game. I still miss that fortress town I made a few months ago to withstand those relentless zombies and desperate raiders... Every colonist's home was a bunker and they were laid out in a defensive grid with overlapping fields of fire. It was glorious.In my view, this is the essence of indiegaming and you will support a passionate developer who really cares for the game. So buy it already!			"

								  Rimworld is, essentially, a game in the Dwarf Fortress management/builder genre.  Compared to DF, however, it's much more tightly focused and scoped and a lot more easy to control.  It has a wide array of interesting encounters.  It even manages to serve up some reasonably compelling combat, frequently a weakness in these games, via the expediency of having combat be directly controlled by the player instead of relying on mushy indirect AI orders.  Complaints?  Relatively few and far between.  It's occasionally a bit unwieldy to manually have something moved somewhere, units don't automatically override behavior/location based forbiddances when manually ordered to do something, and getting a unit to manually do multiple related tasks (say, build multiple segments of a wall you want prioritized) is awkward.  Hunting AI is poor- units will stand at maximum range and plink all day at something instead of closing to a range where they have reasonable accuracy prior to firing.  Medicine usage (none/herbal/good/exceptional) is per-character, which can force a lot of micro to ensure you don't waste you entire stock of medicine treating low-risk injuries like bruises.  Etc, etc.  On a meta level, I feel like the endgame could use a bit tweaking- I got to spaceship building before I'd even fully exploited the tech tree, and once I got there the notion of sitting around griding time and resources to build the spaceship was unappealing.  Still, my time with the game so far has been compelling and addictive.  If you like the genre, I'd highly recommend RimWorld.  It is currently my favorite entry one of these kinds of games.			"

								I've played RimWorld for quite a while before the Steam release, but I'll try to keep my remarks focused on the Alpha 14 version.Scenarios are interesting. They offer a fresh experience to someone like me who has played and tested the game to death. They allow you to change the rules of the game and create a unique story.I've played with mods in RimWorld before, but having Workshop support at launch has meant that it's even easier for modders to get their mods in the hands of people. Of course, for modders there is a downside - it's more difficult than ever to get visibility for a mod unless it's advertised elsewhere or it reaches a certain threshold of subscribers and gets into a collection.But I digress. The gameplay itself is similar to previous versions, but a few adjustments have been made. For example, wild animals and visitors trapped within walls will now attempt to dig their way out and leave instead of standing around until starvation and insanity set in. An AI which doesn't react to exploitative gameplay spoils my immersion. So this gets a thumbs up from me.Another small but significant change - roofing is now something which must be constructed, rather than instantly appearing as soon as a room is completed. If I get too ambitious building shacks for colonists, some of them will have walls but nothing above them to keep out the elements.The insect infestations which were introduced in Alpha 13 now occur in a narrower range of conditions. Given that they're intended as a consequence for digging deeply and greedily into the mountains, this means you need only fear an infestation if you've actually mined into the mountain rather than picking at the visible veins.Map conditions can now be permanent as part of the scenario system. If you've ever wondered how you might survive on a planet where electronic devices don't work because of constant solar flare activity, now's your chance. Or perhaps you prefer the eternal night, in which case a permanent Eclipse is right up your street.You can now play as a tribe, rather than a group of crashed survivors. There's a bit of a challenge to be had, initially surviving without all the technological advantages that industrial-age colonists have. Indeed, your tribe learns those secrets at a slower rate - the more advanced the technology, the longer it takes for it to be researched. Great for long-term playthroughs.Tribes do have one ace up their sleeve - they start with the knowledge required to make a long-term food preserve called pemmican. This is a great way of using up meat which would otherwise go bad in warm temperatures.The gun turrets which were a staple of previous alphas now need to be researched. This means that in the early stages of a game, you need to stave off raids with deadfall traps and whatever weapons you can make, buy or loot. It definitely gives you an incentive to do research.It seems that there are a few minor issues with Alpha 14 which will be fixed in a later iteration. For example, there's no real benefit to mining into a mountain if you want to escape the outdoor heat.Overall, I would say that this has been the best update yet, and I can't wait to see what else Tynan and Ludeon Studios are cooking up.

								Like Prison Architect (in art style) meets Dwarf Fortress, but without as much complexity or depth (literal and figurative).Whereas in Dwarf Fortress the UI is a mess and you can dig through many layers and do many many things, Rimworld seemingly decided to start with the bare-bones of making a user-friendly UI and build up from there. The game is in Alpha 14 at the time of writing this but it feels pretty complete in the early-game. There is plenty to do and build for long enough to keep you coming back for days, but as you advance your colony you may realize the game slows down a bit as it goes on. This is likely just a product of Alpha-ness that will be addressed in future updates though, I can't imagine the developer doesn't have lots of plans.That said, when you start installing Mods and Mod-packs is when this game *really* shines. Between the ""Hardcore SK"" mod pack, ""Mega MOD Pack"", or many others, the game turns from a bare-bones almost-Dwarf Fortress into a game truly capable of standing up in its' own right.The mod community for this game is huge and adds a lot to this type of game; From combat ""realism"" overhauls, to new structures/production/technology trees, to even new character traits, mods turn this game up to 11.

One of my favorite games for sure, and the only thing i would really love to see is some sort of multiplayer, whether it be co-op where maybe theres a giant map to make two colonies close to each other. Or possibly a way to link games with other players and be able to trade, by sending caravans of people with what you're selling and calling for help where your game would load into their map so you could control your colonists to help aid other players. Other than that the game is great, it generally plays great with almost no game breaking bugs in my experience.

								Been playing this game for months now. But it has finally came on steam. The game is basically like Prison architect in terms of graphics. But game style is much different and very nice. You have to manage a colony of colonist that arrive on strange new plant.Each time you start the game the map is procedurally generated. Hence, each time the experience is new. Overall the game is must buy. "

								This game is great and has a huge learning curve to it. I haven't played Dwarf Fortress so it was hard for me to know what to do with my colonists in my first several runs. I played The SIMS and Prison Architect so knind of much managenet and free will are kind of similar. I had manage to get one colony with 14 members off a planet already!			"

								I don't normally write reviews but this game is one of my favourites of all time, and I know it just came out on steam so a lot of steam users will not know anything about it.This game is kind of like dwarf fortress lite, it is simpler and better looking than DF, but has similar gameplay concepts. The main thing that makes this game great is that it has a very simple, streamlined and comprehensive modding system. This means that there are hundreds of excellent mods available so you can get the gameplay you like customised for yourself. I imagine it will take a while before all the mods make it onto the workshop, especially given that they probably have to be updated for the newest version. But you can check out what is available on the forum: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?board=15.0If you like squad based tactical games, survival games or resource management strategy games this one is worth a look. If you are turned off by 2d graphics then this is probably not for you.Ignore my steam hours played stat, I have played thousands of hours of this but I uses a heavily modded directory which I will probably never let the steam update system get near. Even just starting the game for 5 minutes in steam overwrote my mod config file. Until steam implements the ability to roll back updates so that you can keep playing your modded version for a while after a patch comes out, I would recommend copying the directory out of steam if you are using a lot of mods.

								I myself dont write these very often. But i do wanna clear a few things up.1. The Interface    It appears that some people are complaining on the complexity of it I had the game since alpha7-8, with that said. The interface may over take you for the first few min or so. Its all layed out in easy to understand format. 2, Hours    Weather youre just starting or have been here since alpha 1. The game its self is VERY easy to understand, and if you have any questiong or need help everone on the forums are a huge help and a bit smartassy.3. Game knowledge    I wanna say its very simalar to any survival game, but with an rts twist. Survive. Grow. Prosper. Repeat.Now i myself have well over 2000 hours in this game i play it almost everyday before the steam release. Like ive said ive been here since alpha7-8. I can assure you that youre gonna get what you payed for and then some! Tynan takes care of this game like his own kid. Update come around for bug fixes pretty regulary unless he goes on vacation. But that happens once in a blue moon.If you still arnt sure about it watch me play it here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWMQWWk_yMUkHvQESKyPisgThe forums: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php    I will happily accept your friend requests if you have question before buying this game.I do appologize for any misspellings as it is 3 in the morning for me and worked all day			"

								Rimworld is currently one of my favourite games to date, and I've been playing it for 2 years before it launched on steam. I can only say; GET IT. You can easily sink hours upon hours into Rimworld. You get attached to your colonist. You share their joy, feel their pain and mourn when they die. Don't get me wrong, Rimworld is not without its flaws, but it's being constantly updated and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. So do yourself a favour and buy it!			"

								Here's some things you can do in RimWorld. Amputate someone's limbs and replace them with prosthetic Tame anything from elephants to wild boars to defend you and carry supplies Watch your settlers interact and form relationships, maybe even have affairs Transplant organs, and harvest them from unlucky prisoners Cook luxury meals from space insects and potatos Fight robo-centipedes Craft anything from uranium swords to charge rifles Hunt explosive ""Boomalope"" Have base burnt down by said creature Capture raiders as prisoners and persuade them to join your colony Steal from trade caravansEDIT: NEW UPDATE! The game's even better! There's a great tutorial for new players, and a drug system. Now I would recommend the game more than ever. And, 140 hours later, I'm still playing...			"

Luckily before everything got too late it started raining which safed my colony.Some months later he tried to flirt with the married woman of my best colonist, she turned him down. He went full retard and wanted to burn something down - knowing the outcome I ordered my bodyguard to knock him down with a club. The fight made him mad so I tied him up and put him in his room. After a few days he was healed and could move again (my bodyguard really messed him up).I really thought that I have control about Amigo now back, but then that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ goes mad again and ♥♥♥♥ing ignites his own room - while he was imprisioned there (must be really desperate for women, as he tried it with every female he could find), In the proces Merlen the bodyguard went off to stop the chaos, in the heat of battle (literally heat) he knocked him down again.Beeing mad at him I had no other choice than to execute him this time.

								I purchased RimWorld roughly a year ago during the somewhat early stages of its development. And since then I have sunk hundreds (if not thousands) of hours into it before it was finally brought onto Steam. I did not come from a background of Dwarf Fortress of Prison Architect, nor did I believe that I would be a fan of the methodical and careful harvesting, construction and management that RimWorld's gameplay prominently features. I bought into RimWorld because I saw my favorite streamer play it, and it seemed different than the masses of shooters and fighting games that I had invested so much time into.When I first booted up RimWorld, I sat down with a glass of ice water and familiarized myself with its core gameplay mechanics. Each of your villagers is unique, with varying degrees of aptitude in everything from mining to creating artistic masterpieces. Your job as the player is to assign tasks that these villagers will complete based on their intelligent AI system; it is critical that you carefully manage what tasks are prioritized by which villager in order to ensure that your villagers are constantly working to build and improve your colony. However this is balanced by a Mood system that requires that you also manage your villager's health and recreational levels. That's the basic rundown of the system but I could go on for hours and hours and hours about the intricacies of the game. What's important is that you won't find yourself confused by how the game works at all.By the time I was wrapping up my first session of RimWorld, I reached over to take a drink from my glass of cold water and realized that all the ice had melted and it was lukewarm. Somehow, nine hours had passed. I was hooked. When a mad boar gored a good man to death, I wept. While my men and women fought with raider scum, I shouted with rage and frustration. And when even in the midst of surviving in a harsh and unforgiving new world, my survivors still found time to find love, I celebrated. There is something beautiful about RimWorld's complex (yet simple) gameplay. It manages to reach out and grab you, to really make you feel invested in the tiny pixels that mill about on your computer screen. It's very appropriate that the game's AI systems are labeled as storytellers, because RimWorld tells a story - your story. How it develops and ends is entirely up to you, and that's what makes RimWorld so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fun. All you need is a playlist of your favorite music and a nice glass of your favorite refreshment and you're ready to create a beautiful new world.Buy this game. If you have even the slightest interest in base building or city building simulations, or have any sort of history in games of those genres you will enjoy RimWorld thoroughly. It's also incredible how amazing RimWorld's developers are at building and expanding upon the game. These are people who refused to release the game because they felt like the game ""needed more features and depth,"" though I can say with certainty that at the time it had plenty of both. These devs are committed to making this game an amazing one, and I'd recommend you get behind it. Also boomrat infestation ♥♥♥♥ed my best colony, please send help.

								I've played RimWorld for the last 2 and a half years on and off. Through the whole time Tynan put a lot of work and effort into the game. It has grown from a litlle towerdefense game to a full fleteched simulation game,  which you can slowly begin to  compare to the big dog DwarfFortress. It's still not as complex as DF (but which game is?) and it maybe never will, but it's the closest thing you get. Love this game, the community is great, and you can mod the sh*t out of it. If DF just frustrates you, but you still got that hardcore simultation game itch you wanna scratch, BUY IT!			"

								This is a great game. It says early access, but I have never encountered any bugs that I can recall. There are regular updates and improvements. It has Steam integration.The developer seems to be absolutely invested in improving and expanding an already great game. You can run it on a non-supercomputer (see: laptop) just fine. One impression you may get from it, is that it's one of those hard games that keeps coming at you until it destroys you. This is not the case at all. You set the difficulty in the begining. You can set it to a hard level, but I like to set it on ""base building mode"", which is just the second hardest difficulty level. It provides some challenge, but allows you to build up your community.I'll tell you one thing that happened to me. The mood of your colonists is important. I had one guy that was very talented but a bit neurotic, and one day he went nuts. Unfortunately he went nuts homocidal style, and started attacking his fellow colonists. Of course the colonists returned fire and killed him. Unfortunately, he had bonded as the main handler for a pair of fully grown bears. They didn't like when he was attacked; like not at all. You can imagine the bloodbath that ensued.The potential for unpredictability and unforseen consequences in this game is really high. It's an indie title that I cannot recommend enough.

There's so much you can do, manage and think or act fast for the safety of your colony, in this case it depends on the type storyteller you choose from/game-mode. -Challenges:                  The game offers three types of storytellers, each with a different perspective. Either you are a hardcore player or peaceful/dislike challenges. The game also have season, these are; Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. Keep in mind tempetures are very important for farming. Of course, all this depends on how you play or customize your gameplay, endless possibilities to start from.-Colonist:              Each colonist have their own traits, likes, dislikes, relationships, friendships, opinions, gay, straigh, lessbian, cold blooded, nudist, night owls etc... you name it. Each, trait will have an impact against others as in real life of course. However, those personalities will affect and cause rage and fights and even lead to serious injuries. If not dealt with as best as possible for the good of your colonists/happiness.-Biomes:              A variety of biomes are offer to play on. Each one of them provides with differents kind of wild life as well temperature and natural resource to use at your avantage. - Research and Craft:                               Research is very important to craft great gear, weapons and many useful utilities to enforce your colony and their survival.--------------------------------------TO BE UNCONTINUED-------------------------------------   There is more than you can think of.

								Ok so I have been playing this game since August of 2015 (pre-steam release) and I'd say I put about 400+ hours into the game. I feel I can comfotable give a decent review. From me, this game receives a  9.2/10 . This game only gets better with its constant stream of updates. Some say it feels unfinished but in my opinion this could ship as a finished game now. Pros   High  replayability. Fun combat mechanics. Open building system with tech trees (Building is similar to Prison Achritect). Indepth health system. Many different play styles. Lots of mods available. Cons  Some bugs. Can be hard to start off / mildly steep learning curve. No solid end-game.  PLEASE KEEP IN MIND RIMWORLD RECEIVES REGULAR UPDATES AND IS IN EARLY ACCESS!   "

								I would estimate the time I have put into Rimworld to be something along the lines of several hundreds of hours. To me, Rimworld is a game one can never get tired of. It becomes great fun, especially in later stages as you progress and develop your colonies, both internal and external conflicts will arise and with the latest updates there are a plethora of possibilities present. You tailor a scenario to your own liking, which means you can choose how you want to start, what traits your characters start with, what clothing, how old they are, and much much more.In short it seems like a watered down Dwarf Fortress, but it still remains a damn good game to this day.

								I very highly recommend this game!It's a truly unique game, and very well designed. It can be a little tough starting out, but it's not dwarf fortress. The mechanics are simple, but the game has so many features and interactions between them that there's a lot of depth. The fact that your colonists are mostly automated lets you sit back and make decisions rather than micro-managing.The randomized events, map generation, and different biomes give the game a lot of replayability. I actually have about 100 hours more than steam says, because I had the game before it was on steam.Make sure to look into mods after you've learned the game! This game has amazing mod support, and there are dozens, maybe hundreds of good quality mods out there. Steam workshop makes it really easy to search and find them too.			"

All of a sudden we notice a Timber Wolf nearby, is it friendly or hostile?  Our resident Hunter would rather not take a chance, so breaks out his rifle and fires a number  of times.  Out of 6 shots, 2 hit their mark, but sadly all this seems to do is♥♥♥♥♥♥the wolf off, who comes charging at our Hunter, he fumbles reloading and ends up having to take off at speed to try and avoid getting eaten,  obiviously the Wolf is faster than our Hunter so he's constantly being nipped at the heals.ANOTHER ALERT!!A Squirrel has gone nuts and is attacking one of the other colonists, chasing her down until she collapses from her wounds far from base.  She needs rescuing, so I send out my final colonist to bring her home.  In the mean time our Hunter is looking a lot worse for wear and is slowly making his way back to base with wolf in tow.  He just makes it inside in time.  Wolf starts banging at the door trying to get in.Cut to the other 2 colonists, they're now helping each other back to base, after the Squirrel attack, unaware there is a Timber Wolf trying to get in.Oh no, he's seen them, just before they get through the door to safety he pounces, killing one and severely injuring the other.  Wolf passes out due to his injuries from the Hunter.Hunter heres the commotion die down and begins to head towards the door, completely unaware his pet cat, enraged by the smell of blood, attacks him and leaves him immobile on the floor.So now I have 2 immobile survivors and absolutely nothing I can do, but wait for the infections to set in and kill them.Just when I had given up all hope, a native comes to our area to join our happy little colony, he carries the injured to their beds, treats their wounds and feeds them, before going to bed himself.and that my friends is where I have left this story.  I can't wait to see what happens next.What will your story be? "

								As you can probably tell, I've put a few hours into this game.This is one of those games where you'll lose a day in, an entire day. You'll wake up in the morn, open it up, and the next thing you know, your colony is being assaulted by exploding rats and it's 7am the next day. Not saying that happened to me, but still.It has a lot of mods, some that are really good, some that are necessary, some that are ""Well, that's a cool idea, but I don't need it"". There's also a series of Lovecraft mods that allow you to be assaulted by Eldritch Abominations or make your own cult. Neato.The game has problems in a few areas, but what game doesn't have problems? The most recent patch of A16 nerfed drugs a bit too much to be used, but can still be sold by the dump truck load easily. Never used drugs with my colonists, so whatever.The game doesn't have multiplayer and honestly, it doesn't really need it or I can't see how it would be implimented anyways. Multiplayer is something that should honestly be added last, after everything else the dev Tynan adds.Anyways, enough rambling, back in I dive.TL;DRGame is gr8. 10/10 Would make Human Leather Cowboy Hats and Dusters again.

								Incredible. That is how I would describe this game if only permitted one word. The gameplay, while not groundbreaking, is unique to each playthrough and provides great stories of heroism, comradery, and the inevitable downfall of your colony. The modding community for this game is amazing, considering the relatively short time since it's availability. The game is still in the alpha faze yet provides more entertainment than most major releases have been able to. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys sandbox gameplay with little or no goals other than prosperity. Truly one of the better games on Steam.			"

								Been playing the game since soon after it was released, and I've kept coming back to it.Rimworld is a 2D, top-down, science-fiction, story-driven colony basebuilding game. If you've played Dwarf Fortress, you'll find it pretty easy to pick up. If not, your colonists are probably going to get shot, frozen, eaten, burned, and so on before you get the hang of it, but its tutorial system is quite clever and generally makes sure you're on the right track.The game takes place 3500 years in the future, where humans have colonized the stars and so on. Because there is no faster-than-light travel in the game, some civilizations have regressed without contact with other civilizations. You crash-land on a world on the edge of colonized space and are given three survivors, two guns between them, and a few supplies that didn't burn up in the atmosphere. On the rimworld with you are indigenous pre-agricultural tribes, medieval feudal kingdoms, modern city-states, post-scarcity transhuman roboticist spacers, and any number of pirates trying to take your♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you have to survive by trading with, kidnapping, or slaughtering them as you try not to die of ♥♥♥♥ing malaria or hypothermia or get eaten by wolves.It's pretty fun, well worth the $30.

								Rimworld is a mix between dwarf fortress, banished, prison architect and kings of dragon's pass. Strangely enough, I never got into one of those games, but this one is very addictive.Creating your colony from scratch, watching all the different characters interact is fun indeed, even when everything goes wrong. And it will go wrong sooner or later. Stories are created this way and you really feel invested in them.Replayability is through the roof and a lot of mods enhance it even further. Highly recommended and it's even early access!			"

								Unbelievably addictive and fun.In many ways, it resembles the ultimate simulation game that I've always wanted, a realistic simulation of surviving in a different world. Every aspect of living is simulated, Temeperature Jungles settlements need aircons to prevent heatstroke, iceworlds need heating. And those two need electricity, so if a solar flare knocks out your generators, you are in trouble, neccessatting good insulation and wood supply to outlast the solar flare.Most food will spoil in a few days, so construct a cooler to freeze a room and store your food there (this can be easily automated)! But freezers like in real life merely transfer the heat to another room. So this freezer needs vents connecting outside to prevent overheating the other rooms! This of course is unneccesary if your biome is freezing yearround, just build it outside to benefit from the environment.Food You can farm, keep animal husbandry, or hunt. Its possible to survive on just one source, but meat+veggies gives mood bonuses. If a wave of toxic fallout comes, or the outside terrain is too inhospitable, then you may need indoor farming with hydroponic farms and sun lamps. Cannibalism is always available for the desperate, but that gives severe penalities to mood (unless they have the cannibal trait, which gives a huge boost instead!).Mental stateYour colonists/pawns do have emotions, they may breakdown in stages if their mood is too low, making mood an extremely important part of the game. Brew beer, make sure the colony is tidy and clean without corpses, decorate with art, wear good clothing, etc etc.HealthYour colonists have detailed health stats, from fingers to toes to each major organ, they can all be damaged in combat. A good doctor can treat them, but sometimes wounds are so severe lungs, legs, eyes can be destroyed, so now you should either buy an expensive organ from traders,  or capture a prisoner and harvest their organs instead! (This gives a mood penalty unless the pawns have the psycopath traits)Depending on the biome, they can get a variety of infectious diseases, malaria to flu to sleeping sickness, then they are bedridden for a long time, you'd have to prepare for this eventuality if you are living in a jungle.CombatCombat is tactically simple but strategically deep, the positioning of your base, preconstructed defenses and traps, weapons and armor, will determine the result long before it begins. Enemies are affected by the same stats as your own pawns, so playing in iceworld biome with -90c temperature outside during winter means your enemies will just freeze to death while they attempt to bash down your doors!ConstructionYou can build your base outdoors or inside mountains, the first is faster but the latter is safer (can't have droppods penetrating mountanis), Strategically design it for work efficiency, thermal insulation, and defensive capabilities. Your pawns don't like sharing bedrooms or being disturbed in their sleep, organically pushing you to make seperate bedrooms with a hallway connecting them.PawnsEvery colonist is different, with different personality traits, different skills, different prohibitions, different health conditions, they really come alive and ensures you care (or hate) each individual pawn. You can assign the types of tasks they can work on and they automatically do so. But they also need play, need food (and a table to eat), and may be distracted. You merely guide them, not dictate them, which makes them more alive than the sims in my opinion. In combat though you can control them 100%, which prevents frustration in these critical momements, with just enough micromanagement to feel fun but not tedious.See the multitude of dimensions a player has to consider? This means there is always something on your mind, always something you can do better, driving you to play for hours and hours, I bought this game without much expectation (didn't like prison simulator), but it has proven incredibly addictive.

								Day 1: Three soldiers two being AWOL brothers Pvt. Loco and Sgt. Jenson and supervised by a super neurotic general “The Spear” that tends to babble concerning things, his squad will follow him unconditionally though. After landing on a strange planet all three-set out upon to find a good place to lay low for the night as temperatures reached to around -4 degrees. The three stumbled upon a derelict building with no structural damage so they built a door and bedded down for their first time in this unknown place.Day 2: After waking from their cramped place Jenson walked outside and in the morning sunlight now noticed the huge bay area was completely walled in on every side, leaving just a small opening leaving little area for an ambush.  The rest of the day was spent building a central outpost building inside the cove.Day 3: The Spear awoke hearing a far-off sound of gunfire. He stumbled through the darkness of the new home they had built outside where he sat and listened…… two minutes go by and all seemed well, Spear hadn’t heard anything but had a very uneasy feeling, a shot rang out and smashed into the wood wall next to Spear he without hesitation ,due to his Veteran background, wheeled to his left and shot his rifle through the darkness, a yell rang out and he knew he had hit his mark, at this moment Jenson and Loco were out the door. With the spears eyes finally adjusted he noticed that they still weren’t alone. Hiding behind the sandbag fort they had built that day Spear began to tell Jenson and Loco that he had seen two figures in the darkness. Loco without hesitation leaped over the sandbags and went off into the darkness. Jenson knew Loco had always bore a bloodlust ever since he was an orphan as a child and both were forced into gang life. Jenson slaughtered a 17-year-old boy and 23-year-old girl. They were attempting to flee as Loco got both and stabbed each over 12 times. His bloodlust was filled and he went to bed happy even with the bruises he sustained.Day 12: The three have been through hell and have been joined by a follower by the name of Greer. The fort had sustained multiple raids that yielded one prisoner, Claudia, and had raised considerable defenses. It was this day that the end became a real reality. Jenson ran into Spears room to which he stumbled upon a babbling crazed Spear. He was having one of his flashbacks from the Great war of 5487, these could go on for hours even up to days. A raid was imminent and the spear had been hoarding ammo for the two guns left for the fort. This left no other choice but for Loco, Greer, and Jenson to pick up what melee weapons they had left and set up a defensive position. Raiders outnumbered our combatants 4/3 and our first casualty was Greer. He sustained a shot to the head and died nearly instantly. Loco went into another of his rages and killed two of the raiders before succumbing to his injuries and going down. Jenson also knocked one out with a club causing the last raider to run away. It was this moment Spear ran out the door and one shot rang out through the cove. He had killed the fleeing raider. Jenson meanwhile took Loco to his bed and with closer examination noticed Loco had 3 fingers missing and was a deep gash in his thigh. Jenson tried his best for hours but Loco eventually died of blood loss. Overwhelmed Jenson took out his pistol and began to look for Spear intent on ending his life for getting them into this situation. As Jenson broke into Spears room he was no match Spear unleashed a shot right though Jenson’s shoulder. Spear with the hate of betrayal in his eyes shot once more into Jenson’s chest killing him. Spear began a downward spiral from this point on. Survivals guilt set in and he became depressed. Day 14: Now out of food Spear has begun to starve and being too depressed to gather food was rapidly wasting away. Claudia’s screams from the prison began to grow louder and louder as the hunger pains began to grow worse. As Spear began to bury the bodies left outside he notice it was starting to snow. Temperatures had reached -23 degrees and The Spear knew Claudia must have been freezing and starving, so he grabbed a basket of berries to bring to her, but as he walked by one of the bodies he noticed it was his son who had joined the pirate nation nearby. Spear had planned to leave that night and travel to another village, but he finally snapped. He walked to the storage closet where he took out the IED that he got scavenging after a raid and strapped it under his vest. As Spear opened the dark grisly prison door his life flashed before him. Claudia with little energy she had lunged at the spear as he grabbed her and pushed her into the cell closing the door behind them. Spear shouted “ALLAH AKBAH lol jk” and detonated destroying both of their bodies leaving nothing left of the stone cell just the door. The three Vets had a total of 16 confirmed kills, and were all awarded metal of honors post-Humorously Please get this game it’s one of the best, after putting hundreds of hours into Dwarf Fortress and I can say that this game can one day be as ambiguous as Dwarf fortress and I hope to put hundreds of hours onto this game.

Early Access Review
								After 11 hours of playtime, planning to have thousands this, yet still Early Access Game, is extremely fun. I looked at the game and frowned upon it, but pushed my self to buy it and test it out. I do NOT regret it, I've had so much fun already. The game can be quite challening at times, especially on the higher dificulites, but it's all a learning progress. The funniest, most chaotic moment I've had on this game so for would be during a storm and raid at the same time. I had 4 colonists and a medium sized colony, all buildings very close to each other. Lighting strikes 1 building and fire breaks out everywhere. A lamp also explodes catching crops and another building on fire, then a raid!!! 4 raiders are coming in from 2 different sides and my base is burning down, my AI is scrambling everywhere, when boom, lightning hits again., and we have more fire spreading. We manage to kill 2 of the raiders, and damage a 3rd pretty bad, whom later bleeds out, while the 4th raider gives up and leaves, By this point almost everything is gone, and everyone is bleeding and we have 1 without eyes..... He dies of infection very quickly, a second gets a major infection in his torso from gun shots, another has infection in her legs and the last bleeds out. We have no food, no shelter, and only about 2 things of medicine left, sadly we all died. ): I reccomend this game for a blast!!			"

								Ah Lovecraft mods. No matter what game they managed to slither into they always makes for interesting stories. This is one such story.The planet I ended up with was a desert with a large number of mountains and a huge ♥♥♥♥ing ocean. So I go the rich explorer and give myself a little boost in wood and cloth. I crash land into a tundra. There are pockets of rabbits and squirrels, along with some Elephants. So I build a little♥♥♥♥♥♥shack and get to work building into a nearby mountain. And after a few days my colonist (Wendy) suddenly runs off. I see her go towards this spooky lookin' monolith. She stands there for a second and then goes back to her room. She then makes an Occult Grimoir and takes a huge mood debuff. This is where things take a fun turn. I build into another mountain and mine out a giant church and occult research room. I get it all floored and lighted up and set to work. While researching weird symbols Wendy turns into a Cultist. Nice. She then names her cult the Esoteric Order of Dagon...fitting. I craft her up some robes and a Cthulhu mask. I then end up making an altar and sacrificing some rabbits for power. Then I get the message, two people join me in obsession of joining my cult... alrighty. I craft them up some robes and get them some beds in already mined out rooms.Now we skip to season later. I've held off countless raids from the local tribes and even some Deep Ones. Wendy is now head cultist and everyone has a good life. My mountain base is now a fortress equipped with untold eldritch horrors trapped within the stone. I am now fairly well equipped with some guns and a many melee weapons. My colony is now 7 strong and has no signs of stopping. Sermons are held for Great Cthulhu and father Dagon. But life is kinda boring as while the Lovecraft storyteller can be brutal it doesn't really give you a ton of events to work with. So I gather my cultists find a nearby coastal village. So I caravan up and gather my most loyal followers and set to work. We arrive to what can only be described as a shanty town. I draw a rune and wait. Now when the first thing you research on, on the forbidden research table is figuring out what all those ♥♥♥♥ing symbols are. And when done researching you can then make a rune that attracts Deep Ones. They will defend the rune with their life until they are all dead. The towns people put up a fairly good fight and even managed to take down a Greater Deep One. But that was all for naught as they were then slaughtered by the eldritch tide. Mopping up the Deep Ones was easy for me as Harpoon-guns work wonders against them. I then take all the coastal towns♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥ back off to my colony. A great first raid, and there were still so many more to come. And while raiding coastal towns was fun for a little bit I got bored, but it was mostly because I killed all the coastal towns in my area. But something did come my way as one of the local tribes tried raiding me again, but this time...with an army. My guard of Deep Ones could only hold off the tide for so long before they got overwhelmed. My turrets did most of the killing, along with the more...unstable part of my colony. But they did♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, they killed the co-head cultist and Wendy's lover. Wendy fell into a deep depression and I had to straitjacket her so she wouldn't go off the rails and murder people. This lasted for some time, but Wendy did eventually get out of her stopper and started leading sermons and daily sacrifices once more. But she was out for revenge and as it turns out the tribe responsible for killing Wendy's lover was also the biggest tribe in the world. And thus began the war. It was easy at first as my tide of Deep Ones did most of the work for me, but the farther I pushed into their territory the harder the raids would get...and the wounded count would also get higher. Lucky was I that my underground farms has reaped a bountiful harvest this season and I had a plenty herbal medicine in stock. It did get tricky when a plague of insanity swept through my lands and rendered most of my colony null. It wasn't until Wendy herself died in battle that I was on a real disadvantage. She was there the longest and was friends with most people there. She also had some REALLY good stats. She did die fighting however. Taking many tribal people on her way out. I built her a special place of rest, right beside her lover.Fay the new Head Cultist took over and boy was she good with her social stats (it was the main reason I picked her). She was a non-violent soul however and would never engage in combat. This wasn't a huge problem, but I like a social leader more than one with a huge bloodlust. Our numbers grew greatly as we went from a mere 7 people to now 12, all of them cultists. I also had a pack of 4 people, all of them had the traits of, cannibal, psychopath (I forget what it's called correct me if I'm wrong), and bloodlust. I had them wear black goat heads and differing robes. I called them the Spawn of Dagon and they wrecked♥♥♥♥♥ All except for one used melee and the one who didn't was their leader. His name was Sven and he was a ♥♥♥♥ing monster in both ranged and melee. He also liked getting hurt so...that was a plus...I guess. But I used the Spawn for more ""covert"" operations. They did win me the war when we assailed their fortress of♥♥♥♥♥♥and mud. Well it was properly built for an NPC village, but the faction leader was there and blah blah blah. The final battle was to begin.The best way to describe the fortress is a wooden castle. But that's...slightly inaccurate. I began the siege with drawing 5 runes outside the ""walls"". The first wave of Deep Ones got ♥♥♥♥ing obliterated. I didn't really anticipate the number of arrows they were packing...the short answer is...too many. As the waves of eldritch horrors crashed upon their walls my cultists waited for the right time to charge in. The Spawn of Dagon however took a differing route. They dug into the mountain for a flanking assault. We did get the jump on a few archers held up inside a little shack. And with that we gained a small, but valuable foothold within the fortress. And with that I constructed not 1, not 2, but 7 runes. The tide of Deep Ones was spooky, but it would be worth it as Deep Ones now streamed into the fortress taking out many archers and guards inside their humble abode. And with the storm gate open, but overflowing. The Deep Ones did end up dying, but the damage they caused was massive to the point where I just sent my army to deal with the rest. And with most the damage done I took who I could prisoner including the faction leader. And while the war was won a larger threat came to my colony and destroyed it. An avatar of great Cthulhu came in the night and just ♥♥♥♥ing ganked my colony to an early grave. And with that The Chosen were mushed into the dirt.And thus ends our tale. I will be back with more tales in the future my friends, but for now. I bid you goodbye.			"

								Imagine this: take some of the crisis management of FTL and mix it with some open-world resource-gathering survival aspects of Don't Starve.  Add a research tech tree, enough tools to stretch your creativity with time/resource/task management a little bit similar to Prison Architect, and throw in some hilarious and often tense character interactions.  Make the game easy enough to build mods for that the community runs wild and adds tons of fantastic content.  Then try something totally crazy and have the *story itself* be procedurally generated.  This doesn't sound like a great combination ot ideas to put into a single game, but it works so well it blows me away.  Everyone likes to share the stories they experienced, and below is my favorite.I created the entire crew of Firefly complete with quirks and relationships, then over a few years of game time had them carefully carve out a massive cave in the side of a mountain in the shape of the Serenity ship hull, acurrate in scale and layout to the ""real"" thing.  I was overjoyed when Mal and Inara hit it off right away and eventually got married, and Kaylee eventually found some romance with a wandering native she helped rescue.  They were really unhappy for a while until the crew quarters were finished with double-beds so they could finalle snuggle together at night.  It was a challenge protecting all the livestock from bandits and keeping the forest from burning during those dry thunderstorms.  But in the end, I love my crew.Here are a few of the notes from that game (mostly how Simon is terrible):-Day 4: Jon wanders into camp and joins up, looking for big game.  Over the years he gets his fill while fighting some maneater muffalo and lost his hand, and later while fighting a mad pack of rhinos he lost his nose and left leg, and his left eye later on defending against some raiders.  Poor guy.-Day 17: Jon broke and threw a tantrum because he was cold, because he slept in the freezer, like an idiot-Day 41: The god****ed rabbits are multiplying so fast they are eating all the grass and starving themselves, so we're butchering all that are starving, that'll teach 'em-Day 66: Simon, when rebuffed by Inara, went on a rage streak.  He didn't cause much damage because he's so weak. But he lost his right pinky when he picked a fight with one of my huskies.  Mal came to knock his a** out.-Day 67: Simon showing signs of cracking mostly because he's been turned down by Kaylee and Inara (who is married, what a jerk).  Yep, Simon is a little child and broke because of hideous environment.  He started attacking River, who just recovered from her own mental break and was still naked.  Janye knocked his a** out.-Day 68: Simon, being the bbaby that he is, goes berserk and attacks a husky again.  Zoe has none of his crap, disrespecing Mal's party, and punches him to the floor.  He can heal in bed during the party.-Day 72: Middle of the night some bugs spawned and wrecked the crew.  Booke lost a leg, everyone lost some blood.  Simon, once again, went berserk because he's a stupid child and couldn't handle it.  I hate that guy.-Day 101: Overnight a dry thunderstorm threatened to burn our fodder and livestock, tried putting it out.  Simon is a tard.  He keeps catching on fire while trying to put it out.  He is so damn useless.-Day 131: The crew discovers they can capture bandits and harvest organs from the prisoner to transplant into the crew (mostly Jon) to repair battle damage.-Day 135: We are no longer worried about harvesting organs.  So Wash threw a party.  Too bad we're going to harvest some more.-Day 139: Captured a new victim to harvest organs from, muwahaha.-Day 200'ish: The Serenity cave is finished.  There was a new alpha relesase that broke my save game unfortunately, and that was the end of that story.			"

Early Access Review
								This game will imprint Murphy's Law into your brain forever.As a veteran of Dwarf Fortress, there have been many attempts at cloning the legendary game's masochistic ""Fun"" that grabs you like you just did a line and slaps you in the face, leaving you to beg for more. While I have logged many hours in Gnomoria and Towns, and other such games, they just have not been able to keep my attention for long. Whether it be poor AI, a feeling of general disconnect with the world, or just simply, lack of enough ""Game"" to be interesting, it seems like Rimworld has finally hit the bullseye.Hell, this game might even captivate me more than dwarf fortress at this point. With its absolutely beautiful soundtrack reminiscent of both Prison Architect's (Same composer, I think) and poking a teeny bit at the nostalgia for Firefly, the world feels both alive, and interactive. If you want to and you think you are up to snuff, you can siege an enemy town, picking off bandits with precision down to the finger. But beware, however powerful you feel you are, the game will always, and I mean ALWAYS cut you down to size. While I've found Randy Random, ironically, to be the most balanced, and the easiest of gamemodes, Playing him on rough and above is just as masochistic as picking Cassandra or Phoebe. Beware their lulls, they can and will destroy you without a second though. And you. Will. Love. It.Oh, and Workshop! And mods! Did I mention mods? I probably should have!TL:DR This game is crack cocaine, and in its Alpha state, holds its own against the current king of Colony games, Dwarf FortressYes. Yes. And Yes. This was my best purchase of 2016.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an Alpha 15c review, which isn't code, that's just the version.  Obviously.Yawn, another early access game primed ready to disappoint when the devs decide to go spend their hard earned money on wine and cheap hookers (hold the wine).  I can already feel the inevitable sense of betrayal in the air.I hope not.  I really, really hope not.  This has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time.  Funny, sad, horrendous at times; few games have generated so many unexpected stories while I wasn't looking, and then slapped me round the face twice for not paying attention.  Like the time my bunch of colonists ran out of food in the middle of winter and ate the family dog, then a mad squirrel, then a lonely trader looking for some business.  We drank his beer though.  Like the time my colony set on fire and the internal temperature of the cabin hit over 2000 degrees, roasting my little minions alive while they desperately tried to put it out (please, devs, can we have vanilla fuses?)Graphically, it's reminiscent of prison architect, and you are a benevolent colony god staring down at your colonies burgeoning attempts to survive in this new world.  They cook, grow, mine, chop, and butcher their way across the map; hunting resources to build ever more complex stuff to vomit on when your 17 year old degenerate accidentally gives everyone food poisoning.  Like all sim management games, there is a steep learning curve, so fully expect your colonists to perish a lot in the early game, and quite frankly the end game.  The devs have provided a menu based tutorial helper for basic controls, as well as an opening tutorial, but it barely taps the surface of what can be done.  Learning how to prioritise work is a necessary feature you joyfully uncover for yourself, which is for the best because winter is looming and all your people are running around in pants throwing horseshoes at a wall, while the storehouse is filling with cloth.There are even NPC traders and raiders to deal with.  The former hang around your base and charge silver for items, the latter charge your defenses with increasingly worrisome weapons.  Set up turrets early on.  You won't regret it.  Then loot their corpses and keep the weapons, just don't let your starving colonists anywhere near the bodies (not a joke).All in all, I love the game.  It's fun, weird, and horrific in a fun and weird way.  Do yourself a favour; put on your crash pants and descend into the wilderness.  You won't regret it. "

Early Access Review
								I found this game had a steep learning curve. Thankfully the latest alpha release includes a tutorial and sort of an in-game ""wiki"" for different items. The game itself is beyond fantastic. This game is early access but honestly plays better than most stable live releases. Once you understand the game, you can customize virtually every aspect of your colony by setting gamerules--and the rich modding community allows for some truly epic possibilities.As for the gameplay itself, it functions as a 2D survival/base-builder game. You select a group of colonists who crashland on a ""rimworld"", a sort-of ""backwater planet"" on the edges of space. Your goal is to build a self-sustaining colony and ultimately construct another ship to leave the planet (although you can easily just sandbox this game and you really never have to leave). There are multiple difficulty settings, and there are even built-in debug tools if you enjoy cheating/pure sandboxing it.Gameplay includes building, hunting, combat, agriculture, production lines/crafting, trade, and even medicine. The latter is a particularly interesting aspect because not only can you treat injuries, you can perform surgeries on your colonists such as organ transplants, bionic upgrades--and you can even harvest prisoner's organs and sell them on the black market. Newest update lets you grow, manufacture and sell drugs, as well, if that's your type of thing.There really is no limit to this game. It's a complete time-sink and one of the most entertaining EA games I've ever owned.			"

								Rimworld is an overall fantastic game that really makes you feel like you got your money's worth after all is said and done. The game has a small learning curve when you're first getting started, but with the aid of their helpful tutorial and all of the publicly available walkthroughs and fan-made tutorials on the internet, it should be an easy curve to traverse. If you're on the fence about buying this game, I would highly suggest watching a few playthroughs on YouTube or elsewhere. It really is a ""play your way"" kind of game that is centered around basebuilding and colony survival. The developer continues to release amazing content month in and month out, and I believe he deserves all the support he can get.9/10			"

Early Access Review
								You know, I love Rimworld. After getting to grips with the new engine (used by another very popular game of this genre) and the fact that the people have no feet or legs, (it seemed odd to me at first, but I got over it in the need to plant some corn!), I've clocked up over 600 hours of gameplay and I will recommend the game highly to anyone who asks my opinion of it. However, I have one bugbear that I find very frustrating, and that is, that every time the Dev releases an update, my established colonies are unplayable. I have to keep restarting, and since it is not a 'quick-play' type of game, in fact, it might take you weeks of gameplay to finally get to end-game, ie. building that spaceship to be able to get your colonists off the planet and back home where they belong, I've come to the conclusion that I might never get there. The stability of the framework seems shaky, and I never know when I log on, if I'm going to be able to load my current game or not. That said, I have soldiered on...because the actual gameplay is stable. I'm not experiencing mid-game crashes or other weird stuff happening. The stories that are created, as much by you as by the game itself, are always unique and entertaining. You just cannot make some of this♥♥♥♥♥♥up. :}It is also a builder, crafter and farmer's dream, particularly if you have signed on for a couple of the *choice* mods that extend that content. Lots and lots of equipable items for your little blobbies too. And, if you're a bit of a p*ssy like me, who doesn't like to wake up to find foaming-at-the-mouth hordes coming over the horizon while you stand there thinking 'Oh SH*T!!' then you can play in any number of more relaxed modes too, from 'peaceful' to 'OH MY GOD!'. Suits me just fine because it doesn't exclude me on the grounds of not wanting to have my colony's guts ripped out and handed to me in a bag after two weeks of carefully building my palatial base.  Your environment presents a danger too. I always like that attention to detail in a game. If a polar bear is hungry, he'll definitely be on the prowl for man-flesh. If it's snowing, your people will need warm clothes. If you mine just anywhere, you might hack into a secret cave full of mechanoids who can annihilate you where you stand. Lovely fun. All of it. Just find a way to stop breaking my games with the version updates, please. I feel quite stuck on repeat here, and it gets old eventually.			"

								I love rimworld. Even for being Early Access, in this case it doesn't mean the game is buggy, but could just use a few added features; which are easily added or supported at the moment with the incredible mod support in the workshop. RimWorld is the perfect balance between deep like dwarf fortress, but still usable in terms of UI and options. The UI notably is a lot like Prison Architect, and it is not a bad thing. It definitely serves its purpose. If there is anything I'd like more, it would be more handles for support in terms of mods and custom games. Let's say I'd like to play a scenario that is Star Wars themed; I'd like with that scenario to be included that it would be possible to have a set of characters with the famous names, maybe a visual themepack and custom occurences using the assets in the game. As well as maybe more ""gameplay"" ways. Like it would be possible to send my troops offmap, and load in a new map where I'd actually be raiding other nearby tribes in real time. Maybe a way to infiltrate as a sole pawn in an existing tribe and working my way up in more of an RPG perspective of things where the AI handles the colony. (I'm pretty sure looking at the manager mod could help in creating an AI). Though these are mere suggestions. For as the game goes, it's one of the only games on Steam I bought at full price, without regrets. Certainly the best game ever from Early Access.			"

The game is brutal..... As a fan of prison architect, a game where I build stuff and FIGHT is awesome!			"

								Disclosure: I Kickstarted this game. Therefore I suppose I TECHNICALLY got the game for free? I have played several hundred hours before it was released on steam.The game is great. It is difficult and can murder you and your colony horribly but once you have an idea of the mechanics it can generally be manageable.The standard setup puts you in control of 3 stranded survivors after a horrible space ship crash. Fight disease, raiders, random events, raiders, food shortages, raiders, mechanical androids who want your sweet tasty flesh, raiders and raiders. Oh there are also raiders who occasionally show up to smash up your crap, kill your colonists and/or kidnap them. All in all the game is relatively well balanced if you use the normal AI storyteller (read ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI) but can be more challenging with the more difficult or random storytellers (massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai)Cons: If you do not like the game constantly challenging you. It also hates you and your colonists. Especially the ones you named after your best friends.			"

Oh ♥♥♥♥, This is going to be impossible. 3th colonist: Grehun, Ex-spy, melee skill 16. Oh boy, this is run last probably 10 minutes. 3 hours later: Greyhun is the hero and saviour of the colony, he kills raiders and hunts with only a sword.4 hours later: Our saviour and only hope Grehun goes berserk during a wedding, stabs the whole colony and walks himself into an armed trap, game over.9.5/10 Want to get betrayed again.

								Been playing Rimworld for around 9 months now and I love it.  The latest update (A14) has really smoothed out a lot of the game imo. & the introduction to steam will definitely make using mods easier - not that it was difficult before, but it's nice to have everything in one place and to easily add/update extra features. Even without the mods, it's a great game.  The devs being open and interacting with the players & modders makes rimworld feel like a community, even though you're playing alone. The story you create is always frustrating, heartwarming, shocking, and sometimes downright silly.Currently playing using the rich guy scenario, and as usual, rimworld has a funny sense of humour... My first four peeps are incapable of violence. Always excited to see what comes next!			"

								The One and only! TRUE PAIN SIMULATOR! You think it is about survival? Well, it is, but partly. It is a game about suffering from whatever your new narrator friend Randy throws at you. -Play as a early-medieval tribe, lost in the mountainous jungle-Find a good, spacious cave. Okayz, it is our home now.-Start making all the settlement stuff: rooms, beds, tables, corn farms, chess tables for the most clever of your tribesmen...-A small group of three peaceful travelers passes nearby-THEY HAVE A SHOTGUN, AMBUSH THEM! KILL THEM ALL, THE SHOTGUN WILL BE A NICE TROPHY FOR THE CHIEF!-Your chief now has a shotgun. And a kevlar vest. His tribespeople look at him in admiration-Start digging your cave's walls. Maybe you will find gold!-But you found a hidden, spacious room with two strange things, that say ""Cryosleep casket"" in the description.-And... OH MY GOD, THERE ARE 2 HOSTILE ROBOTS WITH CHAINGUNS NEAR IT! RUN!-Your tribespeople hid behind a corner, waited till the pursuing robots appear and bashed them to death with wooden clubs and spears. Those few blasts from the chief's shotgun have also helped-Found out you can't loot anything from the dead robots, carry them to the dumping area-Also found an ""open"" button on those cryocaskets in that room. All right, loot avaits!-Your chief, with 2 of his most trusted mates, open the cryocasket...-And find an angry, angry dude, with a shotgun, who instantly blast the chief to the stomach! Your chief's stomach is destroyed, but he is still alive, somehow-Chief's mates punch the man to the death, looting another shotgun.-Carry the bleeding chief to your dedicated hospital bed and treat his destroyed stomach. He will keep on living, somehow. Just have to get used to that hole in your belly.-While you were doing that, you find out a bug infestation in your storeroom, along with two bug hives.-The bugs near it were tiny, but were chipping away on the walls. Noone eats your walls and gets away with it!-You are confident. You killed two damn chaingun robots, you surely can deal with a few bugs!-All your tribesmen gathers near the storeroom and open the door. The chief's most trusted mate, now also with a shotgun, makes the first shot, killing one of the small bugs...-WRONG MOVE, MATE! Three huge starship-troopers-like bugs emerge from the hives and, disregarding your two hard-earned shotguns, slaughter the whole tribe-Experience butthurt10/10, shoulda bought some insecticide instead			"

								You know, I love Rimworld. After getting to grips with the new engine (used by another very popular game of this genre) and the fact that the people have no feet or legs, (it seemed odd to me at first, but I got over it in the need to plant some corn!), I've clocked up over 600 hours of gameplay and I will recommend the game highly to anyone who asks my opinion of it. However, I have one bugbear that I find very frustrating, and that is, that every time the Dev releases an update, my established colonies are unplayable. I have to keep restarting, and since it is not a 'quick-play' type of game, in fact, it might take you weeks of gameplay to finally get to end-game, ie. building that spaceship to be able to get your colonists off the planet and back home where they belong, I've come to the conclusion that I might never get there. The stability of the framework seems shaky, and I never know when I log on, if I'm going to be able to load my current game or not. That said, I have soldiered on...because the actual gameplay is stable. I'm not experiencing mid-game crashes or other weird stuff happening. The stories that are created, as much by you as by the game itself, are always unique and entertaining. You just cannot make some of this♥♥♥♥♥♥up. :}It is also a builder, crafter and farmer's dream, particularly if you have signed on for a couple of the *choice* mods that extend that content. Lots and lots of equipable items for your little blobbies too. And, if you're a bit of a p*ssy like me, who doesn't like to wake up to find foaming-at-the-mouth hordes coming over the horizon while you stand there thinking 'Oh SH*T!!' then you can play in any number of more relaxed modes too, from 'peaceful' to 'OH MY GOD!'. Suits me just fine because it doesn't exclude me on the grounds of not wanting to have my colony's guts ripped out and handed to me in a bag after two weeks of carefully building my palatial base.  Your environment presents a danger too. I always like that attention to detail in a game. If a polar bear is hungry, he'll definitely be on the prowl for man-flesh. If it's snowing, your people will need warm clothes. If you mine just anywhere, you might hack into a secret cave full of mechanoids who can annihilate you where you stand. Lovely fun. All of it. Just find a way to stop breaking my games with the version updates, please. I feel quite stuck on repeat here, and it gets old eventually.			"

								I've put in a good 300 hours playing this game since I got it back in Alpha 9 (iirc), and I have one thing to say about this game: brilliant. It may be in early access but I still haven't experience a single crash whilst playing vanilla or any noticeable bug for that matter. The way Ludeon runs this as an early access with the ocasional big feature updates and smashing any and all bugs found inbetween means you don't get the continually festering buginess you find in many early access or even ""fully released"" games like minecraft where the devs just focus on killing the worst of the bugs before adding new features.All in all I would whole heartedly recommend this game to any of my friends or anyone who likes colony/city sims somewhat like what you got with firefly-edit: and if your not quite sold then I suggest searching for rimworld alpha 14 lets play on youtube and see what the game is like			"

								This is basically Little house on the prarie with exploding rodents and automated turrents.If you like survival, base building/management, resource management, crafting, or any of those traits in a game, this is pretty much the best game out now. Think of it like The Sims or Prison Architect except you have to worry everything from growing enough crops to survive to alien bugs with plasma rifles invading. (That and most of your residents aren't in prison cells... Probably...) The type of game I wanted my whole life but didn't really know was missing until I played it. I used to be a fan of RTS games. But apparently, all I really wanted back then was games more like this. I've been playing it for years in alpha, and every time you think it seems done, the next update adds tons of exciting new features and makes it an even better game. Really exciting.			"

								Rimworld is one of those games that you can put alot of time into if you dont mind the trail and error aspect of the game, as while the game tries to teach you both with a tutorial and a smart AI which will suggest tips at ideal times, it still relies on you to understand what is happening and why something went downhill and how to counter it. Overall I would highly suggest this game only give it some time to set in as to what you need to do.			"

								So here I was, capturing a prisoner and putting him in my prison. Later on I add a second Prisoner. I decide to have some fun, Dexter style. What I do next is not for the faint of heart, John Snow goes to the prisoners and replaces one of the guys legs with peg legs, then takes out his kidney. I keep the body parts cold until a trader shows up to sell them. I then let the prisoner go free, while keeping his Kidney and legs. What about the last prisoner you ask? I let him off easy and just sold him to a Slaver for silver. After that happened, the other Survivors got really angry and mad because of my organ removal and selling a prisoner to the trader. Leason learned, You're Colony does not like it when you remove Organs of prisoners or sell them to slavers!Emprace the failure that you will face young jedi :)Enjoy Colony Management? Building and crafting stuff? Think Cannibalism and taking prisoners sounds fun? Like to die alot?  Pick this up!I have over 200 hours on this game before it came to steam (You could get it from the devs website or if you backed kickstarter). For me this is a game I can sit back and relax while I play, even though things get crazy and intense alot, things still manage to be enjoyable and some how relaxing.Reminds me of a cross between Prison Architect, Banished and Dwarf Fortress. You can set up bases, scavenge for things, craft stuff and take other people prisoner! Set up you're colony how ever you want! Allow each character to do only what you see fit.You can tell that the developer has had a blast working on this game and that alot of love, sweat and tears have gone into crafting this special game. The game also has a great AI storyteller that really effects the game, think of Left 4 Dead's game master as it tosses different nastyness at you.Make sure to get some beds up and keep everyone busy! Grab some snacks, create a game and get ready for a real blast! The game also has mod support and has come a long way over the last 3 years.  The main guy making this game has done a wonderful job so far and while some might say it is going to slow for them, for me it is perfect. He is taking his time to do things RIGHT. And every single update I look forward to and enjoy.The good far outweigh the bad in Rimworld, there are a few negatives or things that can be improved though. The UI can use some improvement and for some new players the game can be a bit tough to learn the ins and outs of (aka has a steep learning curve). There is so much good with this game though, the ideas are great, gameplay is fun and you can really be creative in this game if you want to. And lastly, as I mentioned before, I find the game very relaxing, even when I am getting attacked by bandits or animals, or some other crazy thing happening. This is a game worth taking a look at!Wonderful, unique game that I am SOOO glad to see has come to steam! One of the best indie games of the last 2-3 years for me personally and it isn't even finished yet. Support this wonderful game and this wonderful  fellow who has created this great game. Welcome to steam Rimworld!			"

There is tech to be researched, food to farm, booze, exploding livestock, the whole works!The soundtrack is nice, and the effects are mostly fitting.

I think this is the first time I've bought a game twice despite still being able to play it with the first copy. (I bought fallout 3 twice for 2 different platforms).I let my friends play the DRM-free version because in my eyes, this game is so fantastic, that I think everyone needs to enjoy it even those not fortunate enough to buy it, it's an experience everyone should enjoy, even those not a fan of the genre, because I guaruntee, they'll still love it.

								Having bought the game over 2 years ago, I can say that it has improved a lot and has, yet, much space to improve. Needless to say that, in its current state, it is already a solid and pretty good experience. Nevertheless, the steam's early access program will allow a better exposure of the game to gamers and will allow the developer, Tynan Sylvester, to make a great progress towards a final stage, which will, almost certainly, correspond to the players expectations/desires.I can affirm that Rimworld will NOT be one of those games that enter Steam Early Access with no intents of future upgrades, on the contrary it will be similar to Prison Architect (which in my opinion, was a model of what every game should be in Steam Early Access).When discussing what is great I would say:  Great graphics and artstyle;  Complex system interactions between colonists;  Lots of replayability;  The new scenario system;  Great moddability;  The commercial and faction system.Having this said, it is important to remind that this is still an Early Acess which means there are bugs, there will be with each new update and this is an unfinished product.Overall I had a great experience and would totally reccomend Rimworld!

								I don't usually bother writing reviews for games, but I bought this one a few days before the steam launch and many many hours of gameplay later i feel that I have to put something out there. This game is great (although you might end up still awake when the sun comes up occasionally). There are obvious graphical design influences from Prison Architect, but as soon as you start playing you realise that the similarity is really only skin deep. Building your colony can be very satisfying and straddles the gap between a building sim and a survival defense game. If you prefer the more base building aspects, or if you like the idea of dealing with multiple varied threats like diseases, raiding parties, rabid animals etc, both are available. Depending on which 'storyteller' you choose (part of the games difficulty settings), your first colony can run smoothly, gradualy growing and attracting more settlers as you grow food, mine rocks, build up your living quarters and defenses, or ... as mine did, a volcanic winter followed by some sort of nuclear fallout can drive your previously content survivors into deranged idiots, who attack each othr, strip off, run outside in the cold and eventually die.The game is also very complete for an 'early access' title, there is no aspect of the game which feels unfinished and although i'm sure some changes are to come, the game almost could be full release at the moment. If there is any aspect of gameplay missing, in my opinion it would be a little more management ability for your colony, such as the ability to set switches to be turned on / off at particular times etc.There are some decent mods out there too which add or improve various of the games features although some modded aspects have since gone on to be incorporated into the vanila game. Final verdict: Must give it a go. It is definitely worth the £22 / $30, and if you fancy supporting the devs, you can purchase it directly from the website to ensure they get most of your money.			"

								As a long time player of Dwarf Fortress this title piqued my interest.   It definitely is heavily inspired by DF and i think does it justice.   There is a level of detail that is definitely appreciated, and the difficulty can ramp up pretty quick.  There is tech to be researched, food to farm, booze, exploding livestock, the whole works!The soundtrack is nice, and the effects are mostly fitting.  The graphics are basic, but coming from ASCII it is a breath of fresh air. My only regret is letting Horace the yorkshire terrier get eaten by a panther in one bite.   "

								I originally pirated this game back when it first came out of kickstarter.I had it pirated for a good long time before I bought it off its officia lwebsite, I followed every update and every blog post since then and have played it at every moment, made my own mod for it and even modded it to hell (to a point where it would crash, oops).And yet I bought it again on steam. I think this is the first time I've bought a game twice despite still being able to play it with the first copy. (I bought fallout 3 twice for 2 different platforms).I let my friends play the DRM-free version because in my eyes, this game is so fantastic, that I think everyone needs to enjoy it even those not fortunate enough to buy it, it's an experience everyone should enjoy, even those not a fan of the genre, because I guaruntee, they'll still love it.

								Its a great game! In my first game I had 3 really cool colonists. And everything was going fine. I had a few houses made out of wood.And everything was great. I had enough food and weapons and everything.I even had a 4th colonist after a while.Sadly enough I didnt saw that he is a Pyromaniac and likes to set fire. I mean I saw it when he started his first spree setting everything on fire. Wood is burning fast and really good... everything was made out of wood.That was the end of my first colony.10 / 10 ... would do it again. ;) "

								If you don't like Rimworld, I don't think you can be classed as human any more.Rimworld is one of the best possible games, and still it's not finished.It offers much of the depth of Dwarf Fortress, the artistic style of Prison Architect, and the moddability of both.Wraps it all up in a not-horrible User Interface, and then lets you fail spectacuarly.You will lose your colonists, often. It may be to a hoard of bloodthirsty elephants who leave your entire colony splattered with a mix of their blood and the blood of your colonists.It may be to a group of mechanoids falling out of the sky, and slaughtering your population.It may be to a tribal raid, many of whom you manage to slaughter before finally succumbing to their sheer numbers. It might even be to a toxic fallout that leaves your people trapped inside until the food and power run out.It could be to internal politics, or a prision break, or a host of other possibilities.But each time leaves a story, each story teaches you something new, and each new thing helps you eek towards finally building a starship, and fleeing the rimworld.Your wallet might not like it, nor will your girlfriend (unless you get her a copy too).But Rimworld really is a game well worth the price of admission.

								My guy Brawler was married to a ""Pretty"" engineer. I decided to equip him with all prosthetics including dual cyther blades and power armor. She divorced him due to ""disfigurement."" This drove him berserk and lead to the death of his now ex-wife, Doc, and the beloved labradors. During this time, the batteries blew up a conduit which sent the rest of the colony freaking out to put out the fire. I was then raided with no power. The end. Thank you Randy Random.			"

								The best possible combination of Dwarf Fortress in Space with a heavy space-western Firefly element. This game is everything right with PC gaming in one affordable package, and the community workshop is hyper-active even while the game is in early access. It has everything it says on the box, and a unique feel that really hooks you.Just get it, and make sure you don't have to be anywhere important for a few days.On a side note, my little starting survivor band had an aging beauty queen who refused to do physical labor and treated all the others like trash. Poetic justice was served when a rabid wolf bit her nose off and everyone's opinions suddenly dropped due to disgust and hatred. There's that level of detail, and yes, you will insist on telling random strangers about every last bit of it.Seriously, if you've read this far then you've missed the important bit. Go get it and make your own story instead of reading all of ours.			"

Sure you can leave the planet eventually but I almost never do, just building the colony until an large enough event destroys it. Then I create another with different settings and try again.

								This game is simply amazing. Although in alpha this game is remarkable, the graphics are amazing and the way it runs is just brilliant. Rimworld is a survival game where you start with a 2 bandages, a rock and a torch, you then proceed to gather materials and make a house. As the game goes along it gets harder to make items which gives it a longer play time. The PvP aspect is amazing as a half naked man can run over a hill and demolish you which is pretty funny in my experience. I rate it 9/10 just as I feel the updates need to be a little faster.EDIT NEW RIMWORLDThis game just gets better not only are the devs dedicated enough to rework the game completely, they update it every week! The graphics are god like and the PvP is even better than before although a half naked man killing you, usually involves a bow or a spear and you end up crying in a corner. I rate it 10/10 Game Of The Year, Nice work Ludeon Studios	 :D			"

Tynan (the -almost- sole developer) has delivered an experience like no other, and I absolutely recommend this game. He's gone WELL above and beyond what was promised when this first came to Kickstarter years ago, and he continues to add to it.What's even better is the highly active mod community that's developed in the meantime (on Ludeon - the RimWorld website) that is slowly being incorporated here via Workshop. The mods bring this game to an entirely new level.I'd highly recommend purchasing this game.			"

I can't wait to see what they do with it next, as it is hitting a wonderful niche that I didn't even know I was missing until I saw it.Update: Watching this over the months since I purchased it, the game continues to grow in exciting ways. I have every confidence that it will continue to evolve in beautiful ways.			"

Within 3 or 4 days of owning it, I've logged almost 40 hours of gameplay. I never played Dwarf Fortress, so I can't exactly compare it, but it reminds me of an expanded followup to FTL when your crew fails, only now we get to see what happens after they crash land.Community support and culture on Reddit has also made this game a blast.

								The Gods were angry.For thousands of years the gods had watched over the peaceful tribe, when the tribe prayed for rain and good health, the Gods answered, for the tribe prayed to no one but them. And for thousands of years the tribe gazed galliantly upwards, looking to no one but the gods. But one day, the tribe cast their eyes upon a giant metal ship.The sky people brought them machines to guard their fields, weapons to hunt bigger animals, and in turn the tribe gifted the sky people all of their treasures. The treasures that they promised to the Gods.Furious with the tribes betrayal, the gods struk out. Possessing the giant machines the sky people brought, the Gods slaughtered the tribe, burned the village. Killed men and babies alike. The world was cast into a week long eclipse; for the Gods could not bear to look upon those they had once loved so. Five tribespeople managed to escape under the darkness. They ran far away, into the desert. Desperate to escape their creators wrath. As the hopeless survivors fumbeled with broken tools in the quiet of the night, one man rose to the challange to lead his comrades out of their misery. His name, was Val Chief. Under his protective gaze, the few lost soles under his guidance soon began to build a flurishing village. One with a large central hut where all the tirbespeople could laugh and eat in safety. Soon, even the Gods could not ignore their sucess, the eclipse lifted, and the tribes people were free to enjoy the sun once more. As the years went on, Val fell in love with a woman; Seara, the village healer. Their love blossemed like the endless rose fields the tribespeople had planted outside their main hut. Seara had many suitors, the strong warrior Flint, protested his love for her almost every day, but she always stayed loyal to Val. In the heat of the summer, they married. Val and Seara lived happily within the safety of their new tribe for many seasons.And as the village grew, so did Vals generosity. He wanted nothing more than to help all the lost souls he found wandering through the desert, after all, he was a hopeful optimist. So when a man called out, desperate for someone to save him from the vicious bandits chasing him, Val instantly offered him sanctuary. The five survivors gathered their spears and bows, then headed into cover. The bandits soon came raiding, they shot at the tribes people with their metal bows. As Seara bravely charged the nearest bandit with her club, another attacked her. Before anyone could come to save her, she was shot. Dead. Enraged, the surivors charged the bandits and drove them off, injuring many on both sides in the process. The two standing villagers took the injured to their beds, and the dead to their graves.Seara was buried within the field of roses. Every day, many of her friends would come to meditate by her grave. But not Val. Unable to face the dire thuth, that his generisity had cost him the love of his life, Val hid in his room, nursing his pain. Both physical and mental, until he could take it no more. His wife was dead. He was alone. It broke him. One day, blinded by pain, Val grabbed his spear and took to the main hut with a deathly glint in his eyes. He murdered the dog first. Then the turtle. And as he fumed within the walls of the hut he worked so hard to build, his friends gathered outside, bows ready. They waited outside, hoping upon hope that the beserk rage would fade, but Val had other ideas. He charged outside and began hacking his friends. They were forced to stop him. A spear through the heart. Val fell, dead. They buried him beside his beloved wife, surrounded by roses, they were together once more. The tribe lived on, continued to flurish, but the story of Val and Seara was never forgotten.A story told by the scenario system within rimword.10/10 - Made me cry over pixels.			"

								What a great little fun game. This has all the management you could want and it goes for realism. After a few failed games of my settlers dying to heatstroke, pirates, and starvation, I finally had the hang of it. I had one of my founding colonists get her jaw and leg shot off in a pirate raid, she was in bed for days, until I gave her a peg leg and a denture. Now she can walk again! Her husband is a little repulsed by her disfigurement, but at least she's alive. It's pretty difficult, even on the easier settings, but you learn quick how to survive. I'm growing hops to make beer to keep my people happier. You have to hoard food once you have a few extra people, it will go fast. Build a wooden storage room with 2 ACs. Keep it cold so it doesn't spoil. Power is important. There are many ways to generate it.I was finally able to get a leg up on the raiders by building a single Assult Rifle once I had the means. This rifle tore into these thugs like butter, in the right hands. I also had sandbags placed outside of my base to defend. I lost people and had a few injuries and scares, but I survived and expanded into a large compound with steel and stone walls. In addition to the assault rifle, I now had a shotgun, sniper rifle, incendiary weapon, pwd (smg?), plenty of pistols and shivs. Made a longsword for the guy who prefers brawling up close. I feel OK when 4-5 pirates come knocking on our doors.You forget this is an early access game because of how functional it is now. I'm sure they will work out the few kinks and bugs I've seen, but as it is, it's a hectic fun survival strategy game. For now, there is still more to do...			"

								Ahh Rim World. Such beautiful stories you tell. You've earned my recommendation wholeheartedly. The following story is from my first playthrough. I’ve done about 5 now, each with their own beautiful character and story arcs, complete with social challenges. It’s amazing to watch it unfold and I’m excited for the future of RimWorld.Freedom Colony:It was a nice day in Freedom. Hammer the Oaf, freshly stranded had met up with a few lucky other colonists. Silver, the fiery, genetically grown combat medic was the first person he met on this god forsaken planet.. She was a after the war geneticist, and Hammer was in love with her. Unfortunately though, Hammer was ugly. Hammer loved people and animals the most out of anything in the world. His true love however, was Silver. He tried to talk to her almost every day, but his voice was so annoying and he was so ugly, that she became very irritated and would insult him. He felt bad so he went off to find an animal companion to cheer himself up. Hammer, the Oaf that he was, found a playful adult cougar. NOT THAT KIND OF COUGAR KEEP READING. He wanted to be best friends! But the cougar mauled the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Hammer, and his right arm was shredded as ♥♥♥♥.   The other colonists tried to save his life, but because of the severe infection, it was deemed his right arm would have to be amputated. Silver the Combat Medic/Geneticist( and far over qualified to save Hammer), horrified by watching hammer be mauled and also already on the edge of mental breakdown due to Hammers repeated advances, finally snapped. She ran off into the night, leaving all her clothes behind. She took the pistol, however. Hammer the Oaf lay on the operating table. The operation was to be performed by the only person qualified to operate……. José.  José, the agriculture and architecture extraordinaire took it upon himself to save Hammers life. So he got to work. Hammer emerged from the operation to find that somehow his liver had been punctured (wtf José really???) and his torso was badly cut. He soon died, and the other colonists minds broke as well.  It was chaos and for one night, the were all…...free….…. Running off into the wilderness they somehow found themselves, lost out there, among the wildlife. I wept for Hammer. For Silver. For José, you beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For the less important characters without names, many of whom died horrific deaths as they lost their minds snapped like twigs with the weight of the void pressing down on them.10/10 I didn’t know if it would be worth $30.It is.

								My three colonists started off ok, but being new to this game, I was still rounding the learning curve, and times were tough. Vladamir, the least useful of my colonists, was a medieval lord trained in the subtleties of swordplay, gunnery, nobility, and er... not much else. Lumpy was a former slave, and Soarna a fledgling artist. All pulled their weight while vladamir just sorta wandered around a lot, breathing all creepy like (no joke, creepy breathing was one of his traits). One day Lumpy came across a mysterious steel structure, of course I ordered her to take down it's steel walls, and lo and behold behind it was a derelict cryopod and a giant spider for some reason. Naturally I sent in vladimir with his gunnery skill and lumpy to dispatch this beast. It got ugly fast and lumpy suffered a nasty gash on her neck, but even more curiously, during the firefight the cryopod somehow opened and a space soldier emerged to help battle this beast. He was almost immediately mauled, and I tried to rescue him, but apparantly you can't rescue someone who is designated as an 'enemy' by the game. So I just left him in a pool of blood in shock. According to his character profile, he was a massochist and loved pain, so I assumed it was probably for the best. Meanwhile a hungry bear began to terrorize my colony and killed Vladamir's beloved pet fox. Upon return I had vlad kill the bear, but he took the death of his fox pretty bad. Furthermore the colony was very low on food and I didn't know how to butcher animals at this point, so I instructed vlad to eat the bear, assuming he would make the proper preparations, but no, he literally dragged the bear corpse to the nearby kitchen table and chowed down. About 1/4 of the way through he appeared to become disgusted with himself for eating a corspe raw and his mood dropped even further. Meanwhile his friend Lumpy's neck wound became infected and she almost immediately died. All of these misfourtunes, coupled with poor living conditions seemed to be too much for vladamir, so he promptly grabbed his rifle, and went ""berserk"" and ran off into the forest, I can only imagine, babbling incoherently and breathing creepily all the while. There wasn't much I could do at this point, so I shrugged and returned to my last remaining colonist, and attempted to get the colony in order as best I could. Days later I had completely forgotten about Vladamir and went about finding him to make sure he wasn't causing too much trouble in his frenzied state. Well I found him.. or what was left of him.. his corpse was lying in a giant pool of blood, and his rifle was a couple meters away.. using my superb detective skills, as well as the games combat and health logs I was able to piece together what had happened. It seemed that Vladamir had come across the path of a warg.. a very large warg.. and in his berserk stupor, had decided that this was a great target to unleash his fury on. I'm not even sure if he managed to get a shot off because according to his health log, both arms had been ripped off, as well as both of his legs, his torso mauled, his head decapitated, and his actual cause of death was listed as ""massive bloodloss"". I could only assume the warg was probably ok. And apparantly Vladamir was kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥because my remaining survivor appeared to have a mood boost resulting from Vladamir's death. In fact my colony is doing better than ever since Vladamir died.Great game, 11/10, would berserk again.			"

								So it started out alone, just a fancy rich explorer out to site see on her own. After building a rudimentary base she met a wandering mercenary who decided to help her and settle down. Not long after they fell in love and were married. One by one thier little outpost grew from wandering warriors to escape pods crashing down. All was well until one of those escape pods let out a wounded man call Obrian. He was very helpful at first, a very good cook who was loyal and true friend to all. But he had a secret. Lying deep inside his mind was a weakness built in to psychological tremors. A few months go by, rain and heat. Storms and raids. He weathered them all until a mysterious whisper crept into his mind. Slowly after several days of fighting his urges, he finally broke. In a berzerk rage he attack Merc and beat him to death. This lead to his wife Lumi shooting Obrian and incapacitating him. Mourning her husbands death she went to bed that night with another female friend for comfort. In the morning they euthanized Obrian because he was still on the edge of breaking again. Then suddenly Lumi was the one to break. Maybe it was the grave made next to her bed, or the strange friend sleeping next to her, but she went on a rampage and shot everyone. Unable to bear any of it anymore, she went and attacked a boomalope hoping to die in a sudden explosive death, but was instead knocked unconsious as she slowly died to the elements. No I didnt make this up, I was genuinely sad when Merc died :(			"

Early Access Review
								I already had hundreds of hours in this game before it dropped on Steam, so let me just say right away that it's definitely worth $30.00RimWorld is a game about managing the survivors of a crashed spaceship as they land in a hostile, unexplored wilderness.  Similar to a (less detailed) Dwarf Fortress with a Prison Architect aesthetic, RimWorld is a very comfy game, while also being challenging and addicting.  My only real complaint is how easy vanilla is, but the game has a very healthy mod scene and there are a lot of ways to expand the game or increase difficulty with mods.9/10 and gets better with every update.  Pick up a copy today!			"

								As an original Kickstarter backer, I can honestly say this game has dedicated developers who not only care about the community but also care about making a truly great game. They release consistent updates that provide more and more content for a game that even on day one, was enjoyable. I've never experienced a game breaking bug and I've played well over 100 hours (pre-steam). If you enjoy any sort city management or rogue-like (due to perma-death and randomness), this is a game worth buying.Lastly, if you only buy one Early Access Game in your life, this should be one. "

								The best possible combination of Dwarf Fortress in Space with a heavy space-western Firefly element. This game is everything right with PC gaming in one affordable package, and the community workshop is hyper-active even while the game is in early access. It has everything it says on the box, and a unique feel that really hooks you.Just get it, and make sure you don't have to be anywhere important for a few days.On a side note, my little starting survivor band had an aging beauty queen who refused to do physical labor and treated all the others like trash. Poetic justice was served when a rabid wolf bit her nose off and everyone's opinions suddenly dropped due to disgust and hatred. There's that level of detail, and yes, you will insist on telling random strangers about every last bit of it.Seriously, if you've read this far then you've missed the important bit. Go get it and make your own story instead of reading all of ours.			"

								This game is simply amazing. Although in alpha this game is remarkable, the graphics are amazing and the way it runs is just brilliant. Rimworld is a survival game where you start with a 2 bandages, a rock and a torch, you then proceed to gather materials and make a house. As the game goes along it gets harder to make items which gives it a longer play time. The PvP aspect is amazing as a half naked man can run over a hill and demolish you which is pretty funny in my experience. I rate it 9/10 just as I feel the updates need to be a little faster.EDIT NEW RIMWORLDThis game just gets better not only are the devs dedicated enough to rework the game completely, they update it every week! The graphics are god like and the PvP is even better than before although a half naked man killing you, usually involves a bow or a spear and you end up crying in a corner. I rate it 10/10 Game Of The Year, Nice work Ludeon Studios	 :D			"

								My guy Brawler was married to a ""Pretty"" engineer. I decided to equip him with all prosthetics including dual cyther blades and power armor. She divorced him due to ""disfigurement."" This drove him berserk and lead to the death of his now ex-wife, Doc, and the beloved labradors. During this time, the batteries blew up a conduit which sent the rest of the colony freaking out to put out the fire. I was then raided with no power. The end. Thank you Randy Random.			"

								I have been playing this game since alpha 3.   I estimate, at the time of this posting, that I have put over 500 hours into this game if you include all the different alpha versions.  This game has come a long way and I expect there will be even more to come.   As the game is now, alpha 14 as I write this, it could be considered a complete game when you consider the amount of content.   It will keep you busy for hours.   At $30, it's well worth it.Basically you start with a few resources and a handful of colonists and eventually grow your colony into something much more.   The end game idea is to build a ship and escape the planet you are on.   But the enjoyment is actually building up your colony and defending it against exterior threats.  There are many threats including raiders, weather events, and starvation/exposure (in the more diffcult biomes like desert and tundra).  Each threat is unique and has systems in the game to deal with them.  You can play any game type you like.   Meaning, you can deactivate threats you find annoying or unbalanced.  You can choose your biome as well.   Perhaps you want to play an easy biome with more raiders?   Or you want to play on the Ice sheet with minimal raiders?  It's up to you.At the end of the day Rimworld would be labeled a Basebuilder when it comes to genre.   But in reality, there is so much to it than that.  And even if you want to use a mypopic definition like ""Basebuilder"" when classifying Rimworld that's fine.   Because even within that narrow definition, Rimworld would be the best ""Basebuilder"" I have ever played.			"

								Was given a Mother and Son and a fat russian apocalypse survivor. The son couldnt do labor or fight but he could tame animals and was a psychologist.....right. The russian dude was really usefull but he had a eating problem and the mother could only build and cook. After 3 days the son had a mental breakdown and was beaten to death by a lhama. The mother asked the russian for sex was rebuffed then had a mental breakdown because the russian wouldn't share the only bed and made her sleep on the ground. She attacked the closest rabbit and was nibbled to death. Right as all seemed to be lost a a russian female wanderer arrived and they both hit it off. Neither of them can do medical care though so it probably wont last long. 10/10 would watch a psychologist have a mental breakdown again.			"

Early Access Review
								Please note I have played many, many hours of this game from pre-steam alphas.THIS GAME IS DOPE. The basics of the game involve you building a village (I say village because of the new system which means you can play as a tribe rather than colonists) and helping your villagers/colonists suvive by building shelter, making enough food for people to eat and defending your villagers/colonists from the dangers that the game throws at you.There are 3 different 'stroytellers' for you to chose from, Cassandra Classic where the challenge level increases over time in a classic style of games, Pheobie Chillax where the focus is more on basebuilding and the size and wealth of your village/colony increases the difficulty level but you have more time to prepare and recover or Randy Random where most of the rules don't apply and the RNG gods have free reign to massively p*** you off by swamping your village/colony with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pirates that somehow manage to cut off the arm of my best colonist by punching them. (How does my best colonist get her arm punched off? HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN???????) However there is still an aspect of difficulty increasing overtime, just it can happen really suddenly.Tame animals, kill other animals, build up a city and unlock all of the researches with the intent of flying away on a spaceship you build (except most people don't do this unless a new alpha is due to be released and they want to finish their current game) all whilst surviving the cruel and harsh worlds and also the cruel and harsh raiders. Take them prisoner in order to recruit them or slaughter them where they stand in order to minimse injury. One thing with the game though is that a lot of people (myself included) would mod this game a lot because the mods add soooo much to the game which can be good or bad depending on your opinions on moddingBut I promise if you like games like dwarf fortress you will like this and even if you don't this game is a load of fun "

								Just found out that Rimworld is on steam now, Played the game since alpha 11, Never a dull moment in this game, its a fantastic game with a very immersive gameplay that punishes everything you do and bearly ever rewards you. A perfect colony simulator. So many injuries, illnesses and things that resoult in a colonist getting a mental breakdown or going berserk. I never played such a detailed game ever in my life. All I can say, The game is worth every single cent you pay for it, you really get what you pay for. Even if I try I can't find any major drawbacks of the game, or any cons at that. This game is just perfect, streight 10/10. I must've spent like few hundred hours in this game already before it came to steam. And remember kids, Bloodlust, Psyhopath and Abrasive (On one colonist) is the best way to get your colony destroyed. :)			"

								I dont know how much hours i put in this game, it must be a few hundred.Rimworld has slowly become my favorite game of all time. It is my go to game when i dont know what to play.Usualy it is very relaxing, the game speed can be controlled and even paused.I cant tell you exactly what it is that i love, for me it hits all the right spots.Designing a base, manage all the goods, get tru a winter, raid or illnes.Than there is so much detail in everything, all the stuff that can be build and has a effect.And the in depth social system, yes you can ignore this and all is fine. But it it there and when the time is right you wil notice.This game could be a bit much at first, how do i build this, how do i place that, why does this work or not work.But there is a wonderfull community who can tell you everything. There is also YouTube with its hundreds of hours lets plays. Espacially Blitskriegsler has some good play vids.And there is always the pause button, So if you need to look something up or want the time to sort stuff out. This is the best of both real time and turn based.Never are two play thoughs the same, The creative proces of building and taking care of your collonists is amazing.But €30,- is that to much for such a game?Not for this game it is not, dare i say it, this game is diferent. This game is a product of vision and love, not making money. The game is practically bug free, it never crashes. All the little details are wel balanced. It runs on allmost any pc.And if you want a change you can start with a different scenario or put in a mod. The devoloper of this game love mods. He likes it that people like his game and develop for it.So give it a try and i hope you see the same magic sparkle that i see. A rare thing now a days, i'm 35 and have become a bit of a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to games. All the games do the same and have the same things that make me go meh.			"

								Been playing since Alpha 2, and this ""early release"" is much farther along and very playable, unlike many others who hit Steam.Maybe you'll build your batteries outside. When they blow up in the rain, and you watch colonists die in the fire trying to put it out, or run screaming away only to return to desolation, you'll know what you did wrong.Maybe your colonists just aren't skilled enough to farm and mine basic subsistence, and you watch them slowly go mad as they refuse to do the work necessary to survive.Maybe you got too lax with the squirrels in your camp, and one goes rabid, biting your best medic, which is the last straw for her - what with the bedroom being too small and the food being too boring - and causes a psychotic break. In her rampage, she gives your best fighters concussions, and you couldn't get anyone to subdue her before they're all bleeding, dying, and the medic is passed out in the wilderness dying of stavation.Maybe a lightning strike happens to hit the one wire connecting your turret bank, right before a bandit assault. Or angry natives bring a rocket launcher, creating a hole in your defenses that you thought were solid. You survive the attack, but the lack of preperation, injuries and death, and loss of supplies are just too much for your colony to recover from.Maybe, maybe you'll lay the foundations for a thriving trade outpost. A Deadwood in space. A Babylon 5 on a planet's surface. A spot of stability in the messy frontier of space.Whatever happens, you will learn what went wrong, what detail you missed, what you can improve for next time, as you watch your colony wrestle survival and sanity, before closing their book and opening another.Difficulty and story style options, along with previewing and rerolling your colonist(s), helps you start off into the game you want to play.

I can honestly say that this game is without a doubt one of the most painstakingly and lovingly built games I have ever seen, you can tell the devs really care about making this game the best that it could possibly be. I could spend hours describing the many reasons why I absolutely love this game, but I don't feel that anything that I could say could really describe how much of an impact this game has had on me over those years. It has become the basis on which I compare most games I purchase nowdays. In a time when most games are barely complete, we have rimworld, a game that could have been put on the market years ago but wasnt just so they could attempt to do the game the justice that it deserves.No amount of praise I give can really describe how much I appreciate this game.11/10			"

								I've played this game for about a year and it's easily tied as my favorite colony sim with Gnomoria. If you have any imagination or tendency for headcanoning things, this is the game for you. Of all the colony sims I've played, this one is amongst the most user friendly and sufficiently detailed without being overwhelming. I look forward to more mods and content as time passes :DLet me now tell you the tale of the town of Hurra...Hurra started as a small crashsite wherin the only survivors were a planetary settler, someone's livein roommate, and the psychotic butcher. The butcher brought in loads of animals, each struck down with a single blow and chopped them into bits, the roommate cooked the bits and kept the settlement clean, and the settler did everything else.The colony grew steadily, marked only with one person of particular interest, a scoundrel by the name of Mickey 'Ye' Huang. Having been a minstrel most of his life, Mickey was drunk, lazy, and incapable of any meaningful labor. But, Mickey was good for a laugh and liked to carve statues from wood that rich people from other worlds liked to buy so Mickey pulled his considerable weight. One day Mickey carved a legendary statue of incredible realism that depicted the death of his fellow colonists and a great fire. Despite how beautiful the statue was, (or Mickey clamed it was anyway) the rest of the colony hated it and marked it for export as it seemed to be an expression of madness. An expression of madness... or prophetic vision?Hurra was a peaceful place, the peace only interrupted by the occasional wistless bandit taken captive and 'convinced' to join or be harvested for organs, and the infrequent mass boomalope chain explosion. Until one day 'it' arrived. It poisoned the land, killing crops and trees, and before the colonists could mobilize to deal with the metal monstrosity, another appeared, this time affecting their very minds. In assaulting the twin metal aberrations, many died, and those who were not killed were badly wounded. Immediately after the great calamity, the bandits whom had made Hurra rich and populous arrived in force, slaying with abandon, and burning that which could not be stolen. The sole survivor of this madness was a terribly old man afflicted with dementia, cataracts, and a bad back who had been welcomed by the colonists only a week prior as a means of trying to alleviate the guilt they had felt in inflicting attrocities upon even those who had meant them harm. For a day or two, the old man, kept it together and dug graves for the original settlers, unil overcome by grief, he beat his dog to death. Now with bleeding and infected wounds from his expired companion, he lay in the viscera covered hospital, slowly waiting to die. But before he could finish Mickey's prophecy, a wanderer came upon the colony and for reasons unknown even to him, he decided to join the colony. That man was former pirate captain, Tater Strahmn.Tater heard the stories of Hurra, buried the old man, and rebuilt. In the years that followed, he lost all of his natural limbs and eyes defending his belief for a brighter future. Now today Hurra is a safe place where most are welcome, where slavery and organ trafficing are illegal. Tater stands above it all as a watchful cybernetic god clad in power armor, armed to the teeth, and followed by a horde of huskies. The only remnants of the old Hurra in the Pax Tatus are the graveyard where many colonists now come for silent contemplation after work, history having been rewritten to make the fallen into heroes, and a slightly burnt but beautiful statue in the primary cafeteria made by a forgotten artist prophesying the end of the world.

								What a great little fun game. This has all the management you could want and it goes for realism. After a few failed games of my settlers dying to heatstroke, pirates, and starvation, I finally had the hang of it. I had one of my founding colonists get her jaw and leg shot off in a pirate raid, she was in bed for days, until I gave her a peg leg and a denture. Now she can walk again! Her husband is a little repulsed by her disfigurement, but at least she's alive. It's pretty difficult, even on the easier settings, but you learn quick how to survive. I'm growing hops to make beer to keep my people happier. You have to hoard food once you have a few extra people, it will go fast. Build a wooden storage room with 2 ACs. Keep it cold so it doesn't spoil. Power is important. There are many ways to generate it.I was finally able to get a leg up on the raiders by building a single Assult Rifle once I had the means. This rifle tore into these thugs like butter, in the right hands. I also had sandbags placed outside of my base to defend. I lost people and had a few injuries and scares, but I survived and expanded into a large compound with steel and stone walls. In addition to the assault rifle, I now had a shotgun, sniper rifle, incendiary weapon, pwd (smg?), plenty of pistols and shivs. Made a longsword for the guy who prefers brawling up close. I feel OK when 4-5 pirates come knocking on our doors.You forget this is an early access game because of how functional it is now. I'm sure they will work out the few kinks and bugs I've seen, but as it is, it's a hectic fun survival strategy game. For now, there is still more to do...			"

								I dont know how much hours i put in this game, it must be a few hundred.Rimworld has slowly become my favorite game of all time. It is my go to game when i dont know what to play.Usualy it is very relaxing, the game speed can be controlled and even paused.I cant tell you exactly what it is that i love, for me it hits all the right spots.Designing a base, manage all the goods, get tru a winter, raid or illnes.Than there is so much detail in everything, all the stuff that can be build and has a effect.And the in depth social system, yes you can ignore this and all is fine. But it it there and when the time is right you wil notice.This game could be a bit much at first, how do i build this, how do i place that, why does this work or not work.But there is a wonderfull community who can tell you everything. There is also YouTube with its hundreds of hours lets plays. Espacially Blitskriegsler has some good play vids.And there is always the pause button, So if you need to look something up or want the time to sort stuff out. This is the best of both real time and turn based.Never are two play thoughs the same, The creative proces of building and taking care of your collonists is amazing.But €30,- is that to much for such a game?Not for this game it is not, dare i say it, this game is diferent. This game is a product of vision and love, not making money. The game is practically bug free, it never crashes. All the little details are wel balanced. It runs on allmost any pc.And if you want a change you can start with a different scenario or put in a mod. The devoloper of this game love mods. He likes it that people like his game and develop for it.So give it a try and i hope you see the same magic sparkle that i see. A rare thing now a days, i'm 35 and have become a bit of a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to games. All the games do the same and have the same things that make me go meh.			"

								I'm not always write a steam review. But when I do it's for a great game!I brought this 3 days ago out of curiosity, it's Friday. I thought I would took 30 mins to skim it a bit.. so I started my first colony of 3 people, Lumi - the Hunter, Andy - engineer and a girl, Rose,  she was a scientist. It was going pretty well at the start.. we found a steel structure and made the main building out of it. Andy was basically a slave worker, he did everything from building to hauling potatoes. Lumi with a rifle hunted small animals but after awhile we realized that hunting is not a reliable meal source so I assigned her to help Rose in farming.One day, the wanderer name Vector came to join. From his bio, he was a kingpin. I was sure aware that he cannot be trusted but at that moment, we need some protections, a guy who can shoot. I also gave him Lumi's rifle, the best weapon we had. He spent most days standing and walking around, not helping at all.We got raid for the first time by a mullet girl name Rani. Vector easily shot her down, she was injured but we didn't want to kill her so instead we captured her inside a 2x3 square blocks room. I asked Rose to take a good care of her, she then convinced and joined us. It's all good, 5 people in this small community. But... Vector, that guy complained about our only one shared bed room. My intention was only to protect everyone, it's the a building!! we simply can't afford the somewhere this strong. He didn't get me and went berserk and hurted Rose so I made Rani shoot him. both got badly injured. It's so sad that we cannot help them, they infected and need a medical care. Andy and Lumi tried but nothing effective.Rose died 3 days after that, Andy buried her on the other side of the hill. Few days later, Vector died but no proper grave for him, not after what he did, we dumped his corpse on the field and let it rot. It's a sad time, the first 3 were close friends, Lumi and Andy often visited Rose grave. Rani was surprisingly good to us, she also not helping the labour works but she was a good friends who dealt with traders and travellers. Our colony was advancing, we got a solar panel, the electric stove and a full set of dinner table. Lumi's not a good cook but at least we didn't have to eat raw foods anymore.The happy period was short, raiders came to attack, 3 guys with bow and rifle. I knew at the start that we couldn't defeat them but decided to fight anyway  because this is our home!!!! We fought well indeed, Rani killed 2 guys, the bowman and the one with a club, another one ran away. But all 3 got injured from the fight. We had no medical supplies and Andy.... died from blood loss.Why him? he was the only who endured all the pains, he lost a friend and yet still keep fighting for the community without complaining. I just...  can't play it anymore.Then I checked the clock (in real life), It has been 14 hours straight.Ok, now let me conclude,The game is so additive that you can easily lost track of time. While playing, I find my myself more and more connected with what I built. I love how the game let you write and enjoy your own story. It's say ""EARLY ACCESS"" but doesn't feel that way, it looks optimized even on the largest map. The devs sure to have future plans for it and I'm looking forward to that.just buy it already!!!!!

								Ahh Rim World. Such beautiful stories you tell. You've earned my recommendation wholeheartedly. The following story is from my first playthrough. I’ve done about 5 now, each with their own beautiful character and story arcs, complete with social challenges. It’s amazing to watch it unfold and I’m excited for the future of RimWorld.Freedom Colony:It was a nice day in Freedom. Hammer the Oaf, freshly stranded had met up with a few lucky other colonists. Silver, the fiery, genetically grown combat medic was the first person he met on this god forsaken planet.. She was a after the war geneticist, and Hammer was in love with her. Unfortunately though, Hammer was ugly. Hammer loved people and animals the most out of anything in the world. His true love however, was Silver. He tried to talk to her almost every day, but his voice was so annoying and he was so ugly, that she became very irritated and would insult him. He felt bad so he went off to find an animal companion to cheer himself up. Hammer, the Oaf that he was, found a playful adult cougar. NOT THAT KIND OF COUGAR KEEP READING. He wanted to be best friends! But the cougar mauled the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Hammer, and his right arm was shredded as ♥♥♥♥.   The other colonists tried to save his life, but because of the severe infection, it was deemed his right arm would have to be amputated. Silver the Combat Medic/Geneticist( and far over qualified to save Hammer), horrified by watching hammer be mauled and also already on the edge of mental breakdown due to Hammers repeated advances, finally snapped. She ran off into the night, leaving all her clothes behind. She took the pistol, however. Hammer the Oaf lay on the operating table. The operation was to be performed by the only person qualified to operate……. José.  José, the agriculture and architecture extraordinaire took it upon himself to save Hammers life. So he got to work. Hammer emerged from the operation to find that somehow his liver had been punctured (wtf José really???) and his torso was badly cut. He soon died, and the other colonists minds broke as well.  It was chaos and for one night, the were all…...free….…. Running off into the wilderness they somehow found themselves, lost out there, among the wildlife. I wept for Hammer. For Silver. For José, you beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For the less important characters without names, many of whom died horrific deaths as they lost their minds snapped like twigs with the weight of the void pressing down on them.10/10 I didn’t know if it would be worth $30.It is.

								by far the best of the genre for the last few years at least. still in alpha but far past towns. There are some downsides like once you land at the start you cant go to other areas on your map which is mildly constricting.you cannon mine up or down... yet. which is annoying.there are traders and slavers that visit often you can buy from or sell to.you can research a great deal many items to make the game all that more epic. personally i like the turret towers on a mountain map gotta love a funnel.it wars that if you go to the biggest possible map there will be slow downs but so far the only slow downs i have is when im building massive rooms and only in that one spot does it even slow down.i absolutly love this game, but playing it can make the day dissapear. start playing at 7am feel a little hungry figure oh it must be noon look at clock... oh its 9pm... hmmmm...9/10 this game is awesome i love it. Hard to get used to at the start but once you do its damn near perfect.			"

								Review on September 10, 2016,Worth every bit of the $30 I spent on this game.I've been playing over 35 hours and haven't even scratched the surface.  It's a huge improvement for Dwarf Fortress fans, and casual enough for the below average dummy to figure out.  It truely is a simcity meets the sims type of game.  Except these sims are trying to survive in an apocalypse type setting, which means they are going to die.  Unless you figure out how to survive.There's rumors that building a space ship and escaping the planet's violent animals is a way to win the game.  I kinda wished there was a way to conqure the entire planet.  Alas, you cannot attack the enemy bases (would be a huge improvement if possible).  What's the point of the huge map anyway?I could go on forever explaing about why I like this, or how big of a nerd I am...Game recommended.			"

								Friends said I'd love this game.  I watched many YouTube playthroughs but they seemed long and boring.  I was not impressed.  Eventually, peer pressure got the best of me so I bought it.  Though I don't have many steam hours, I probably have 300 hours having bought from Ludeon.   It is an excellent game rich with content.  While I enjoy building a strong base with traps and mazes for raiders, What I want to concentrate on in this review is the content.What the videos don't convey well to someone who has never played RimWorld before is the attachment you have for certain characters in the game.  You will rely on your favorites to keep your colony alive.  When the inevitable happens and one of them loses a leg or worse dies, it changes your whole strategy.  You may decide to scrap the game and start over.  You may try to bribe a prisoner to join your colony.  One colonist can mean the difference between success and failure.  As I said, there is content on top of content.  See a statue in a room?  Take a look at it, each one tells a different story.   And that's just a simple example.  Each character feels a certain way about all other characters and vice versa.  Think that doesn't matter?  It does.  What other video game have you ever played where you cared whether two characters hated each other or not?  In this game you will.  You'll celebrate the former enemies who mend fences.  You'll curse when a colonist loses his spouse.  That not enough?  Every action has a reaction.  Is one colonist highly skilled at medicine, but making many mistakes?  Have you checked to see if he's drinking on the job?  Many weapons have their own stories too.  And so do the tombstones.  Many are hilarious.  To conclude, if you are sitting on the fence about whether to buy or not.  I'd recommend it to people who like building games.  I don't know what games to compare it to.  It has alot of the traits of Craft the World, resource management like Sim City, Banished (though it's far more entertaining IMO) and maybe some Age of Empires.  I don't think the let's play videos can do it justice until you actually learn the game.			"

								I just got my key (so the playtime is gonna be really low) but I have sunk an unbeliveable amount of time into this game. Reason being there is always a challenge, the game never really ends. Sure you can leave the planet eventually but I almost never do, just building the colony until an large enough event destroys it. Then I create another with different settings and try again. Alpha 14 is a massive update with more awesome features and it will only get better once all of the mods support it.			"

								Ok, so i have played this game from that first alpha/beta stage, i am actually not sure what it exactly was. Right from the start, i saw the potential this game had. Becouse of this game, i have an account on patreon. I put my money and my trust in this game, and boy, it delivered.While still being in alpha, it offers tons of content, i admit, my last full game was around the 12 version i think, i simply dont have time for it now, but its awesome to watch it grow and becoming better and better with every update, not mention the content made from normal ppl. There is that certain atmosphere when its night and raining outside and you just watch your colonist go to sleep after the day of another hard work. When you plan the working schedules etc. and then you see it work, when you colony grows to be bigger and bigger and then it will get stomped by crazy AI. When you take a prisoner in to the colony who has a brain damage (i think she had literally bullet in her brain) and i in that version of the game, i could not fix it.  So i had to replace all of her limbs by high-tech prosthesis and she could atlest clean the base from dirt and stuff. Its a generator of great stories, that i can tell you.Of course, its not for everyone, so better check it on youtube etc. and make your own opinion.And now its on Steam!!! Hell yea!			"

								My hours is more close to 700 since i've mainly been playing this during its beta phase. I cannot think of a more better colony survival sim. It is very dark as well, many times you will have to decide to harvest your deceased colonists just to keep your crew alive or killing your only dog to feed the belly's of your starving colonists. I mainly like playing in the north pole though since its so hardcore but you can play on easy mode in various other biomes in an entire procedurally generated planet! Pick your seed, colonists and game mode and dive into an epic struggle for survival! If your a puny you will take the easy way out of building a starship to end game. This game has a very complex long game way after that for those willing to appreciate it. Best indie game ever!			"

								I helped Kickstart this game roughly 2 years ago.  While I was a little disappointed with the wait, it has been worth it.  Many will compare it to Prison Architect, but there is not much similarity other than looks.  (the developer is different).Gameplay can be as easy or as hard as you want.  The new scenario mode allows you to make your own starting conditions to make it easier or even more brutal on yourself.  The storytellers make for an interesting way for the AI to control what happens and really does make for a storytelling process. Very fun game, quit reading this and buy it already.			"

								Very good game.If you like games like Prison Architect, Dwarf Fortress and Gnomoria you will also love this one.The basic scenario (there are multiple, including player created ones) is to build a base and escape the planet. While working towards this goal you have to make sure to take care of the needs of you colonists. You have to provide them food, shelter, protection and keep them inspired.This game is still in Alpha so I am not naming everything in detail but here are a few cool things you can do in the game:-) create a coke farm and raid peaceful villagers-) become a merchant, get a small fortune and build a mansion of gold-) create a huge military base and keep elephants as combat pets-) fight alien bug infestions in power armor -) breed cats en masse, let them all bond to one of your colonists and then kill the colonist off. you now have a rage fueled crazy horde of cats that rips apart all of your visitiors-) build a giant wall to keep foreigners out			"

								A tragic story of survival, friendship, and love on an unknown planet... Crash land on a flourishing landscape Begin the grueling task of gathering resources and building shelter Rescue multiple survivors of fallen rescue pods and convince them to join the cause Despite all the hard work, two survivors declare their love and are planning a wedding! A chapel is built specifically for the occassion The wedding night is upon us, and everyone gathers ALERT! Raiders are incoming! The bride, a skilled gun slinger, rushes off with the others to defend their home In a blur of gunfire and smoke, the bride takes a shotgun blow to the chest and is instantly DEAD! The dust settles and one of the raiders remains alive in the dirt, barely breathing The groom quietly walks up to the fallen raider and empties his gun, avenging his would-be wife I stare at my monitor and quietly exit the game - holy sh** what just happened?After only 20+ hours of gameplay, I thought this was just a basic build-n-survive type game. But you start to become attached to your survivors and then it becomes personal. Fiona (the bride) will not be forgotten!8/10 - No regrets buying this game. Will definitely play again! Looking forward to updates/patches that will enhance the game further. "

								The dev team described the game as ""Dwarf Fortess meets Firefly"" and after playing for several hours, I can agree.General Concept:Hands-off unit direction (You give them a task, and someone will get to it.. when they're ready!), as you try to achieve more goals, starting from basic survival, to escaping the planet by building a ship, and dealing with random events that can either help you survive, or make your life hell.Pros:- Random Gen World- Small to Large gameplay areas- Customizable challenge/gameplay settings- Easy Start/Hard to Master- A lot of control over the base building aspects of the game- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires that you need to account for.Cons:- No direct unit control (w/exception for combat)- Random Gen World doesn't always spawn with needed resources (you are limited by in-game trade rng)- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires, and will take care of them in the order they want, not the order that might make the most sense.- Maps are currently only a single 'layer'- Single PlayerGameplay Overview:Dwarf Fortress is a good example of how the game plays, and what you can generally expect.  If you're carfeul about how you assign tasks, you can 'force' the AI to do certain things first, but at the of the day, if the character wants to sit and watch the clouds more than cook their food.. they're going to go hungry while enjoying the view!Release 14 introduces new modes expending on the core game, often increasing the challenge to the game (one scenario has you start with 1 character, instead of the normal 3), but ultimately is just a variation on the core game.  14 also introduces intergrated Workshop support for custom scenarios you build, which allows for much easier sharing of the scanrio with others.Thoughts:Overall, a fun game to sit down and kill a bit of free time with, but with enough to do to occupy a larger block of time if you have it to spare.  While the maps have various playfield sizes you can choose from, it is still only a single layer map (at least form what I've been able to find - I might just be missing something in the UI/game), but never felt 'small' or confined.  The NPC events (even teh bad events) tend to be fun (or at least as much impact you allow them to be, and provide a very real sense of 'Aw crap, what happened this time'.One thing I'd like to eventually see in RimWorld would be a variation of the random NPC 'story' archive you get in Dwarf Fortress.  You don't really see the characters 'story' recorded in the development of your colony/camp, and given the nature of the game, I think that could draw you in to the lives of the characters a bit more while increasing your emotional investment in them.Recommend?If you enjoy 'god' games where you do more influencing than directly control gameplay - Yes!Gameplay Livestream Recording:

Early Access Review
								An astoundingly complex and deep game that suffers from a bit of early game difficulties.Please don't misunderstand me, this is one of my favourite games of the decade - before playing on Steam, I've played every Alpha adding up to hundreds of hours. If you're willing to put in some effort, the rewards of watching your little ♥♥♥♥ed up ant farm of colonists is exceptionally rewarding.But I would be remiss if I didn't point out how excruciatingly difficult it is to learn the early game of RimWorld. You start with very little (in the base version) and have to learn by constant trial and error what's necessary to survive past the first winter. ""Oh, I should probably dispense nutrient paste until I have a way to easily replenish stocks. And I'll need a lot of tuques and parkas if I want to get work done during the winter. And don't skimp on cleaning and hailing, or else you'll find a lot of carcasses go to waste and people go insane from their sorry surroundings (?!).""But I suppose that's also part of its charm, if you're willing to learn the hard lessons the game teaches you.Overall, this game is worth the praise by leaps and miles, but it still needs some fine tuning.

There are so much awesome events, strategies, deep and complex gameplay, mods (they make this game even better as it is!), fun etc in this game that you will completely forget what happenening around you.And not to forget the brilliant and chill music (one of the few games where i dont turn off music).The only downside is that this game has a very high learn curve but there are lots of tutorial videos and the community is awesome.

								I never could get into Dwarf Fortress. The graphics turned me off. After all, I'm not a 14 year old living in 1983 anymore! However, I was always intrigued by the stories I read about in Dwarf Fortress.RimWorld has sufficient graphics for me to get into the stories it generates. So far, the longest any of my colonies have survived is 115 days, with its population reaching six residents at its highest. Many of my colonies start off well, rising to a pinacle of progress that then crumbles under the accumulated weight of my colonists' mental breakdowns. They end with some tragedy, such as the last survivor starving to death, his eyes gouged out by another crazed colonist who succumbed to her injuries first. Or my last colonist lies in the dark, both feet shot off by the jailbreaking raider who then returned and set everything on fire, eventually incinerating the footless colonist.If you like community-building simulations, you should try this game. If you want to play this as a straight-up colony sim, I recommend adding the mods that include fully-equipped space marines so you aren't slaughtered early on. With that said, there is something for playing the unmodded game of shipwrecked random colonists.			"

								I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of this genre. I haven't played much dwarf fortress, games like Towns, Gnomoria and Craft The World usually elicit a single long playthrough that, though enjoyable, usually concludes my time with the game whenever I have everything unlocked.RimWorld has been pretty much the opposite. I've played about 5-6 times already, lost my colony to various things, whether it infection wiping out my people, raiders gunning down all but one of my colonists and leaving the surivor to wander around the compound with crippling depression or whatever...it doesn't matter. I just start up a new colony and go at it again.A little reccomendation: If you play games like Xcom or stuff like that with iron man off, don't do so with this game. Go in the way it's meant to be played, it's surprisingly easy to go through with restarting, and I haven't had any bugs so far. Honestly, I think the best thing this game does is remove character creation. Clicking random until you get people who generally fit what you need kinda detaches you from them, meaning that when they inevitably die, you're fine with just going again (at least for me). I still haven't had any playthroughs that I'm incredibly proud of, but so far, every loss has taught me something and I feel like I now have a really efficient method of starting thte game.One universal piece of advice: Build graves as soon as somebody on the map dies, friend or foe, and get all bodies buried ASAP. Just trust me.			"

								This game is simply amazing. Although in alpha this game is remarkable, the graphics are amazing and the way it runs is just brilliant. Rimworld is a survival game where you start with a 2 bandages, a rock and a torch, you then proceed to gather materials and make a house. As the game goes along it gets harder to make items which gives it a longer play time. The PvP aspect is amazing as a half naked man can run over a hill and demolish you which is pretty funny in my experience. I rate it 9/10 just as I feel the updates need to be a little faster.EDIT NEW RIMWORLDThis game just gets better not only are the devs dedicated enough to rework the game completely, they update it every week! The graphics are god like and the PvP is even better than before although a half naked man killing you, usually involves a bow or a spear and you end up crying in a corner. I rate it 10/10 Game Of The Year, Nice work Ludeon Studios	 :D			"

								Thoroughly enjoyable, I don't generally play this style of game but it has been very fun and entertaining albeit for me personally having a steep learning curve.Just finished my first 'village' and after a couple hours of playing my village had begun to thrive and the first marriage was due to take place. Unfortunately this was abruptly ended by a maneating rhino coming through killing a man and injuring 2 whilst the 4th member of the bunch lay in bed with his legs brocken unable to help and hence starving to death.All together a very enjoyable game.

								Been playing since Alpha 2, and this ""early release"" is much farther along and very playable, unlike many others who hit Steam.Maybe you'll build your batteries outside. When they blow up in the rain, and you watch colonists die in the fire trying to put it out, or run screaming away only to return to desolation, you'll know what you did wrong.Maybe your colonists just aren't skilled enough to farm and mine basic subsistence, and you watch them slowly go mad as they refuse to do the work necessary to survive.Maybe you got too lax with the squirrels in your camp, and one goes rabid, biting your best medic, which is the last straw for her - what with the bedroom being too small and the food being too boring - and causes a psychotic break. In her rampage, she gives your best fighters concussions, and you couldn't get anyone to subdue her before they're all bleeding, dying, and the medic is passed out in the wilderness dying of stavation.Maybe a lightning strike happens to hit the one wire connecting your turret bank, right before a bandit assault. Or angry natives bring a rocket launcher, creating a hole in your defenses that you thought were solid. You survive the attack, but the lack of preperation, injuries and death, and loss of supplies are just too much for your colony to recover from.Maybe, maybe you'll lay the foundations for a thriving trade outpost. A Deadwood in space. A Babylon 5 on a planet's surface. A spot of stability in the messy frontier of space.Whatever happens, you will learn what went wrong, what detail you missed, what you can improve for next time, as you watch your colony wrestle survival and sanity, before closing their book and opening another.Difficulty and story style options, along with previewing and rerolling your colonist(s), helps you start off into the game you want to play.

								Just found out that Rimworld is on steam now, Played the game since alpha 11, Never a dull moment in this game, its a fantastic game with a very immersive gameplay that punishes everything you do and bearly ever rewards you. A perfect colony simulator. So many injuries, illnesses and things that resoult in a colonist getting a mental breakdown or going berserk. I never played such a detailed game ever in my life. All I can say, The game is worth every single cent you pay for it, you really get what you pay for. Even if I try I can't find any major drawbacks of the game, or any cons at that. This game is just perfect, streight 10/10. I must've spent like few hundred hours in this game already before it came to steam. And remember kids, Bloodlust, Psyhopath and Abrasive (On one colonist) is the best way to get your colony destroyed. :)			"

								This game, despite lacking a scripted campaign or story, is the most emotional, intense, and deep game I've ever played. Simply put: it is a masterpiece of emergent storytelling. There is nothing like the ups and downs you experience as your best farmer loses his arm to a stray bullet, the tension as a heat wave prevents you from building those crucial defenses, or the horror you experience when your farm catches fire just before winter hits; the joys of seeing your colony through another harsh winter, or the humor of watching a rabid squirrel try to take down a machine gun turret.I've been playing this game for years now over the course of its development and it only gets better with each update.

								This is a great game, very funny too (doctor with cataracts in right eye and rat ate the left eye gave my other colonist a peg leg but ended up messing up a lung?) but it really feels like a great game, Great survival game and it's not even finished so I'm excited for what's comingPros- 1. CreativeAble to build however and whateverr you want with small limitations.2. Love the detailed information on each character 3. Pets, and wild animals as pets, who doesn't like bears?4. Gameplay as I said above the gameplay is smooth and feels like a survival game thats not too easy and not too hard 5. Emotions, I love how you can't easily just murder bandits for free meat or kill your starter pet for quick food since it effects your colonists mentally and them going on rampages is pretty scary since you can't stop themCons- (EARLY ACCESS GAMES NEED THIS SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO AND WHAT NOT TO FIX)1. CombatI'm sorry but the combat isn't..... good. My male with 12 in shooting ( which is super good) takes FOREVER to kill a bandit/wild animal with a good sniper rifle, guns are a nightmare to use since it seems they have no problem at all shooting an ally but takes minutes to land just ONE bullet on the enemy. Good reason why you should just build a bunch of turrets and hide home.2. Random wipesI know its early access but please... Don't wipe my 1 year base ;_; 3. Maps/ExplorationIt's kind of a let down when you generate a whole world and only see a small square. Just my humble opinionFor now I give this a 7.5/10 Great game.			"

It says that I've only put in 4 hours or whatever it says now that your reading it but I've probably put 100 hours in before I even got it on steam. It's so great when I can easily recomend a game to people. If you ever had fun playing The Sims, or an RTS or anything like prison architecht then you're gonna have a great time. It's complicated at first but the tutorial system is intuitive and gives you information on things that you obviously don't know about becuase you aren't doing them. Have fun!			"

								Great game.  Be prepared to invest some time into learning the mechanics.  Sure you could read a guide, but it is more enjoyable to stumble along and have your colonists die in horrible ways.The game designers have a perverse sense of humor.  I started one colony as the only male with two nubile female colonists - one of them a former sex slave.  Just as things are starting to warm up, my man-hating, ex-wife joins the colony and becomes good friends with the other two female colonists.  In the interests of restoring harmony, I send my ex-wife out hunting for food with a knife against large carnivores.  Ex-wife's body is found by the women and dragged back to the colony causing both to go into deep depression.  Thus begins a downward spiral that ends with the colony starving and then wiped out by raiders.Great game !   Would send my ex-wife out hunting carnivores with a knife again !			"

								This game is perfect if you want to create your own story.I made this beautiful colony with four people in it. Everybody was doing their job, every now and then someone had a mental break down and ran around naked for a while - nothing major. But suddenly I lost control: In order to cool meat (and other food) I placed a fridge thingy in the wall, powered by my battery which is connected to the huge solar panel in the middle of the colony. It worked fine for days until suddenly the battery decided to blow up. Usually not a huge issue but the blast killed the dude sleeping next to it (he often had mental break downs so I placed his bed in the small room next to the battery).Now, because I like to live cheap I build most of my stuff with wood. Explosion + wood is not so good, as you probably know. So suddenly half my colony was burning to the ground while my other three colonists were sleeping peacefully in the only steel building I ever build.When they woke up in the morning the fire was gone - but so was my battery, solar panel, all of my supplies, workbenches and even my crops. ""Thank god I still have some potatos."" I thought. So I started some repairs and decided to bury that one guy who was sleeping next to the battery. The next day I get a message ""Heatwave incoming."". Now, because I had no steel left from the repairs I could not build the fridge thingy again and as a result my colonists had to work at ~55°C. Didn't take long until my best dude fainted. Then the other one. Followed by the elderly lady (who is the only one in that shi t hole who knows how to plant potatoes). One after another died - my precious work of was destroyed in a matter of minutes. If that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battery didn't blow up I could have saved everyone from the heat by putting them in my cooled storage room. But god wasn't on my side this time.Great.			"

At first it was peaceful, there was nothing to fear. Traders came, she freed two men from slavery, built a barracks and a hospital as they gathered supplies. But then came the Federation Remnants - Coming crashing down through the roof of her very home and began blasting everyone. Only Pavel and Limu servived, Garry was dead, they didn't even leave a body behind. By the end of the skirmish Limu was in critical condition and one of Pavel tamed arctic wolves were killed, while Garry's body was gone. While the Federation had lost due to her using their weapons against them, they were ill prepared. Their next meeting on the battle field, may be their last.I freakin' love this game man! So many mods to play with, debugging menu is even better. Starting large raids on small settlements and trying to see if you can get them to survive. Can't even mention the Zombie mod. Thought you were done killing all those tribes men and federation officers? No, you're wrong. Here they come, screaming like wild animals!I recommond this to any friend that loves base-building, supply running, tactics and above all Survival. As long as the content grows, I believe this game will grow. Though I wish you could start a community up directly next to another already made. Starting next to a pirate base in the same region, would be hilarious. Or have a choice to expand and start multiple settlements under the name of one colony, in various regions; even invading other colonies/tribes/etc.			"

								The gameplay of Dwarf Fortress + the graphics of Prison Architect.  It's that simple.  Usually those kind of formulae are unfairly reductionist, but it fits RimWorld perfectly.  If you're one of those tortured souls who loves ""winning"" in DF and have been longing for a version with a slick UI and slightly-less-abstract graphics, stop reading and buy this now.  If you've never played DF but love minutiae and incredible flexibility in micromanagement as depicted by Colorforms, give this a shot.  It's less a game and more of a narrative simulator, but it's no less fun.  Everyone will die, brutally, repeatedly, and it will be fantastic.			"

								This game is perhaps the second greatest basebuilding RTS in excistance. The only thing that comes close to match it is Dwarf Fortress, however Rimworld's UI is much more friendly, and many of the different features are a bit more simplified. I bought this 2 weeks ago, and have not been able to put it down. The little stories it creates with your colonists, and the challenge that it presents is amazing. If you love base building rts style games like Dwarf Fortress, but don't like ASCII buy this now.			"

								Rimworld is both frustrating and fascinating.  I start with the 3 colonist, and currently play on the ""rough"" setting.  I can't make it past 40 to 50 in-game days.... yet.  I'm challenged by raiders, man hunting animals, thunder, electrical explosions, starvation, diseases, mentally broken settlers, hypothermia, and the list goes on and on.  In addition to the threats, and perhaps a bigger challenge, the work load of each settler must be carefully balanced or I risk having too many important task ignored.Here are a few tips and things I have learned that may help a complete newbie:1) A single settler with a knife should not be hunting boar by themselves.2) Make sure you roll settlers of whom at least one has a high skill in mining, growing, cooking, and/or research.  Both cooking and crop farming require a higher skill for some production.3) You want a good miner, because I recommend choosing a mountainous area and burrowing into the rock for shelter.4) Settle near a geyser for eventual geothermal power, but for now skip the solar and just build a fuel powered generator.5) Build walls around all of your areas where power is either generated, or used.  Keep powered appliances seperate from the living areas.  When fire erupts (and it will), The walls will keep the initial explosion contained.6) Firefoam poppers- BUILD THEM.7) Be careful not to choose settlers that lack basic skills such as firefighting or dumb labor.  If you do choose one, make sure the skill you are choosing them for is worth the trade off.8) Automated turrets are great for fighting raiders, but expect that they will break down often.  9) I perfer to melee all combat situations.  Shooting is a pain right now in this game.  If you choose to use a gun or bow, you must first send the settler to stand closer to the target if you want to be accurate.10) If a potential prisoner doesn't have any skills that will signifigantly help you, don't bother capturing them..... unless you want to wait for a slave trader to come buy them.There is a lot more I could think of, but thats just a few things off the top of my head.  This game rocks, it's a lot of fun.  Buy it if you like survival and resource management, you will not regret it.			"

								The Sims meets Minecraft in a survival setting. Gather resources, build your colony and take care of the emotional needs of your people. They will go about their daily business by themselves and have a strong personality, only following your general guidelines rather than being controlled directly by you. They might very well just lie down stargazing when you desperately need that wall built, or refuse to kill an attacking animal due to their pasifist background. You get fond of them over time, and when they die it is like watching your favorite Game of Thrones characters murdered. Managing their mood and keeping them motivated is actually the most challenging part of the game, and you will experience someone going on a psychotic rage killing everyone in your base because they did not care for your decoration or eating without a table, then that broken romance pushed them over the edge. So keep an eye out on those mood parameters, those are your real enemy.There is a lot to take into account in this game, and dangers and disasters lurks around every corner. Heat waves, fires, raids, dangerous animals, food poisoning, disease... And of cuorse you need to keep those mood stats high too, as there is a long list of things that will bring them down. Your settlers are picky and weak minded, the battle never ends. It is still a game that is under development, so I will not give too much criticism of the problems I found. I hope they will be fixed though. The most annoying issue is generally unfair deaths. The game is determined to kill your people and keeping them alive is a constant fight. That is a fun and satisfyiong battle for the most part. But sometimes, they just die of the most stupid reasons, which is super annoying. For example, a pasifist who refuse to protect himself may run away from a slow moving rat that is attacking. Then stop and wait for the rat to bite, then run again and repeat until dead. Obviously the right way for the AI to react would be to run inside and let your traps deal with your problem, or just run and not stop until the animal gave up. Since you do not control your people directly, you cannot override stupid behavior easily. You would have to trick the person into building something inside with a high priority for example, to get him away from the danger outside. But this wont always work well. Fighting a dumb AI should not be what the game is about, there are enogh other dangers to deal with.Another example is a pet I completely forgot about suddenly started to chase people around and kill them one by one. It was allowed to go inside through doors that are usually keeping enemies outside, so there was nowhere to hide. In a matter of seconds my whole colony was murdered. And I was not allowed to kill it. Probably a glitch.Having people or pets go on a psychotic rage and murder everyone gets old, and too often the ones you try to keep alive is the worst enemy. Most of the time when I lost my colony, it is due to them going insane over trivial things and killing everyone. It would be more fun if they were not a bunch of weak minded sissies who turn on you at the first opportunity, there are already a lot of other things to consider in this sim, and personally I enjoyed the other aspects more than micromanaging peoples mood to avoid them going on a killing spree.But generally, this is a interesting game that has a lot of details which will drag you in, and when you succeed it is very satisfying.

								9/10 - Here's why..There’s something more to this game than just the old - shoot that/kill that...grow that/harvest that. This game is addictive because it actually connects to the player on a personal level. Here are three examples of why.....I got raided by a bunch of pirates. I killed two of them, but the third I shot in the leg. He went down in pain, wriggling on the ground. Do I save him and nurse him back to health? Or do I execute him on the spot? .A dog wondered into my base. One of my tribe mates became fond of the dog and tamed it. It became his pet. One day the dog wondered outside the base during a pirate raid. One of the pirates shot it. After the raid it slowly died. I was unable to save it because I didn’t have the right facilities. The tribe mate who was fond of the dog became depressed and stabbed another tribesman to death..A ship crash landed near my base. The pilot of the ship wass gravely wounded, bleeding to death on the ground. Do I save him or leave him to die because I don't have enough food to feed him?.These are three of an almost unlimited amount of scenarios that can occur, that strike the player on a personal level. I really recommend this game. "

								Rimworld. Kept hearing about this game from my friends but wasn't sure it was for me. I'd played countless hours of Dwarf Fortress over the years and I couldn't see anything this game provided that DF didn't already have.Never have I been so wrong.There's a lot of goodness in the way the game plays out. The interactions between your colonists or ""pawns"" as they are often referred to is deep and interesting. Like many other games, you collect resources and build with them but the similarity ends there. There's also a rich faction model and a moderately well-designed combat system. You can expect your colony to be visited by traders, raiders, orbital trade vessels, and even survivors crash-landing in escape pods who need your help to survive their injuries.The modding community is going strong, even though the game is still in early access. There's medieval mods which turn it from a pure sci-fi game (though the sci-fi is admittedly weak on laser beams and high-tech staples) to a deranged Renaissance fair gone horribly wrong. There's even a mod which puts you square in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, as if dealing with raiders, toxic fallout, and the occasional volcanic winter wasn't enough. Sounds too hard? You control the threat level by picking a ""storyteller"", which is a great new thing I have not seen in any game before. The difficulty level also can be changed from where it launches exploding antelopes during a solar flare that destroyed your electronics down to where free food reigns down from space in cargo pods.The game has a lot of replayability already, new mods are being added every day, and the game is STILL in early access. I'm very keen on getting my money's worth out of video games, and with the wealth of choices available today there's no reason the discerning purchaser shouldn't be. However this is one of those gems you will play a lot, particularly if you're a fan of building and colony sims ... or a Dwarf Fortress fanatic like me.			"

								Rimworld is just an exceptional game. Take some characters from ""The Sims"", choose their new homeworld, and shoot them into survival space pods across the galaxy. Once they crash down it is now up to you to manage their daily lives. Some will be better assigned as a hunter/gatherer, and at times, a soldier. Others are your doctors, harvesters, crafters, cooks, farmers, and ranchers. How you go about assigning tasks to these people depends on the needs of the basecamp and the capacity of your community.Some days you may have a disgruntal citizen as he just got dumped by his fellow survivor, had to then sleep on the floor during a heatwave since there was a lack of proper beds and now has contracted an infection because the injury sustained while hunting a ""Muffalo"" never got treated in a sterile environment. Now he may die from the infection. Oh, and his dog died yesterday. Hero to zero in one day. Of course you don't want to lose this survivor as he is the only one skilled with ranged weapons for protection and the raiders are due for an attack soon. So you re-prioritize the day to have the survivor who dumped the guy provide treatment with the medical supplies you purchased from a roaming trade caravan the day before. Luckily when you setup your game you rolled a sweet doc and the infection gets resolved.    Each one of your survivors has a random skill set, relationships with others, past medical history, and postive and negative traits. All of this comes with random rolls when first setting up a game. You can custom any part of the game, from starting technologies, amount of people to start with, materials at your disposal. Everything is customizable and worlds are procedural. Replayability ++.  This game is for those who like managing resource gathering and base building, balancing social and personal needs, and simply combat.  The development is on going and very active so you may need to lose a save game from time to time but ultimately I've found no issue starting over and trying new strategies; Rimworld is that good of a game.  After all, its a whole new game each time. It's a buy.			"

								Ignore my hours in-game, I've had this since around Alpha 5 or 6. However with it now being on Steam, this game needs as many great reviews as possible given how much time, effort, and heart Tynan Sylvester has put into it. I'm not one to write reviews often. I think I have written a total of at most 3 out of my 150+ library, but this game above all others really deserves it. So few games have balanced so many game genres in such an addictive and entertaining way. I've purchased multiple copies of this for friends simply because I can't recommend it enough to anyone who enjoys sandbox, survival, strategy, drama, almost any genre of game. And the modding community (and the support they get) is just as fantastic, along with the community itself. Everyone who plays this always has a few great stories of misery or triumph to walk away with, and then come back for another 4 month binge. Tynan Sylvester has truly made one of the finest games of this generation, and the only real issue I see with it is what little coverage it seems to get. Now that it's on Steam though, hopefully that'll change.10/10, would cannabalize again. Well done, Tynan.			"

A colonist dies because of a weakened immune system from old age, and then their daughter goes berserk and punches someone else.RimWorld is one of the Dwarf Fortress-like games that can actually match the depth in mechanics, but presents gameplay in a much cleaner art style and has a straightforward UI.

								I own and play a rediculous amount of games for the PC. I myself personally do 3d modeling for a simulation company and am working on developing my own games in the wee night after work. And I must say,I have not had this much fun just sitting down and playing a game in years. One of the best purchases I ever bought from steam, and the developer seems very knowledgeable of what works in his designs. Best part is while it's ""Early Access"" it indeed feels more like a full-fledged game than 90% of the AAA titles I own.If that doesn't convince you, I just bought the game a few days ago and already there's an update on experimental that adds in a whole new system of optional drug usage with the possibility of addictions.Succumb to watching your colonists stop themselves from going insane after eating dead raider corpses in the middle of winter to prevent starving, by using highly addictive drugs! Then watch as they crawl around as practical zombies when their supply runs out.11/10 I rate this game up there with my childhood years of first playing Half-life 1.			"

While I might not have the experiance of veterans of the series, I still had a blast playing the game. I did a ~1 hour initial impressions of the alpha 14 version if you want to see it in action:

			Rimworld is a game about survival, adaptation and management where you take control of a colony on a distant world and try to survive against the odds.		

It has a fairly steep learning curve, but not nearly as steep as, say Dwarf Fortress. Playing through the early newbie stages is worth the time and effort to learn the game as it is a deep, rich and fun game full of emergent storytelling and gameplay. Highly reccomend this title and would pay full price for it even if the Devs didn't give me a press key.  "

								I was reluctant to buy this game, being an Early Access game with simple graphics and a hefty price, but i'm so glad i changed my mind.Trying to explain what the game is really hard, due to all mechanics it have, so i'll focus on what i would want to know:This game is what I've been wanting to play my whole life and didn't knew, this is the beautiful son of Dwarf Fortress and The sims, in a very awesome way.The mechanics are deep,but not drag the game down, the learning curve is sometimes brutal, but lovely, the colonist have a lot of ""personality"" and the most memorable stories are created by how faulty they are, as i said, think of dwarf fortress but focusing more in your dworfs as single beings. Also, while this is an Early access game,this development is more like a Don't Starve EA, the updates are very ""feature complete"", you won't get a bunch of features that don't work or need a lot of balancing, you get one or two per version, but they are solid, tested and pretty much bug free, with a  few hotfixes solving the problems, this make the game looks like a complete game that is always evolving.The updates come in a steady way, 2 or 3 months per big update.The modding community is healthy and very active, the developer is very present in both the official forums and in the Reddit subreddit, implementing some suggestions and ignoring the ones that didn't fit the game.

								i've been playing this game from after a few months of its non-steam release all the way up to now. i cant tell you how many hundreds of hours ive poured into this game and into my little colonists lives. if you're umming and urring about if its worth it.. trust me it is worth it. exclusing FTL, this game has and always will be my favourite game, and even after you burn yourself out a little from doing a few too many 12+ sessions you can just chuck 2 or 3 mods in and its a completely new adventure & challanges for you to discover. if you are still reading this then stop! pull out your virtual wallet and grab this game and set a few hours aside to discover one of the greatest games you'll ever play. if you get stuck confused or just want a little advice pop over to the rimworld subreddit, official rimworld forums or even the steam forums and give us all a shout, we're a proud community and would love to help a fellow gamer out			"

								This game is incredible. I could tell you a hundred stories from my time with the game so far. Perhaps of the time that my tribe of spear-wielding warriors had no choice but to ambush members of a neighbouring township for their clothes, so they could survive the -40ºC winter. Or maybe of the time that an escape pod survivor, Ezra, single-handedly held off a pirate raid while his allies were laid in bed with malaria. He lost an arm for his trouble, but he eventually made it offworld with his friends.This game creates these stories in a fantastic way, as well as being immensely satisfying to play & learn. It's so exciting that it's still in Alpha, so potentially even more interesting things are on the way!Get it!			"

								Don't let my hours fool you, I have nearly 300 hours in this game before the steam release. When I stumbled across Ludeon Studios, I thought they'd end up dropping the game eventually. But I didn't care! So I spent my measley savings I had at the time and bought it. And to this day I have no regrets. Whether it be my best shooter getting killed by a crazy boomrat or a fire from a battery short, I will always love this game. The amount of depth Tynan has put into this game blows my mind. Buy This game! There's workshop content and so many updates to come!			"

This is Dwarf Fortress Lite, but damn if it isn't the same fun. If you like a game that's an ocean wide and an ocean deep, this is well worth your money.			"

								Poor pepper. We cut down all his mates when they tried to raid our base . He was lying there missing a leg and his lower jaw, slowly bleeding to death. I captured him, nursed his wounds, and after a time managed to convince him to join us. To be a productive member of society. We gave him prosthetics to replace his leg and jaw and he soon became a valued member of the settlement. Then he got shot in the face by robots and died. Such is life in Rimworld.10/10 would weep over the corpses of my beloved colonists again.			"

								I started out with 3 ship survivors. Spider, my chef and construction worker, Lumi, my hunter, and Carry, my paramedic. A monkey names Angus also came with them. Life was good for a time. Everyone was happy, a raid came from time to time with little to no affect on colony. A nurse called Dawson comes, who hates violence. Another adventurer comes, (can't remember his name, we'll just call him Bill) being chased by pirates. I fight them off easily with no casualties on my side. Bill, it turns out, was not worth it. He was totally worthless in everything. But that didn't matter, I already had a colony with 4 good pawns and a monkey, so I was good.Boy was I wrong.Eventually a raid comes, with 3 pirates. But what is one of them holding? What do I spy in one of their hands? A mother ♥♥♥♥ing molotov. I sent 4 of my pawns to stand ready to go and fight them (Dawson was just doing his own thing). We kill 2 of  the pirates before they know what hit them, but who survives? The mother ♥♥♥♥ing guy with the molotovs. He snuck up behind Bill and set fire to everything. Bill was set on fire, Dawson too, all of my colonists were set in flames. Molotov man decides this is enough and heads off. Carney stops, drops and rolls and rescues everyone but Lumi and Argus, who go with the flames. All because of motha♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Bill. But fate decided ""Ya know what, lets just keep being a ♥♥♥♥♥ to this guy"" so another pirate raid comes by. Luckily with no molotovs. Spider, who is bedridden, also decides to go insane at this time and to eat anyone she sees. The fight was intense, but we won in the end, and are still thriving.But pirates burned my god damn monkey.11/10 would hate Bill again. "

								When I saw this game for the first time, I was like ""How the f**k this game has 10/10 ratings on steam with over 4,5k votes"". I decided then, to download an illegal, pirate version of the game (yes, I commited a crime!) to check it out, because I thought it's impossible for this game to be worth 30$. Boooy, I was so wrong! I've spent over 8 hours straight playing old pirate version of that game, I've started my colonies several time, and everytime my colonies died, instead of being angry at the game, I was even more motivated to start over again from the beggining to create another ""unperfect"" colony that will die sooner or later. On the next day, I went to work and I was thinking about this game much more often, than I think about sex (and I do think about sex a LOT!). I came back from work, and I immidiately bought this game from Ludeon site, registered it on steam and started another 8-hour game session, leaving my naked girlfriend alone in bed...Conclusion: This game has stolen my life, it's by far best game I've played in 2016, it has literally unlimited potential and It's definitely worth 30$. I recommended this game to few of my friends at work, they've played pirate versions as demos, and on the next day they've also bought this game. So, if you're not convinced by the old school graphics, download older version, and If you like it, show some appreciation for developers and buy this game, because it's get better with every update!.

								Best early access survival game on the market. Constant progress, really game-changing updates and mod support from the get-go.(Un)fortunately also the probably best salt-generator. Prepare to rage when your hunter accidently shoots another colonist instead of deer because his aim is terrible, or when your designated surgeon amputates a leg instead of installing a bionic arm because he is stoned as ♥♥♥♥ and on a drug binge and you didn't lock that stuff away save enough..

								This game rocks! It is approaching a very polished and beautiful level, one that rivals major development houses and publishers.  It does have a very steep learning curve - however the latest release now includes a non-linear concept training tool which has really helped to make aspects of the game easier to grasp and understand (particularly for newly added features which keep coming :)  )Highly recommended for anyone who loves the Dwarf Fortress genre.

								9/10 - Here's why..There’s something more to this game than just the old - shoot that/kill that...grow that/harvest that. This game is addictive because it actually connects to the player on a personal level. Here are three examples of why.....I got raided by a bunch of pirates. I killed two of them, but the third I shot in the leg. He went down in pain, wriggling on the ground. Do I save him and nurse him back to health? Or do I execute him on the spot? .A dog wondered into my base. One of my tribe mates became fond of the dog and tamed it. It became his pet. One day the dog wondered outside the base during a pirate raid. One of the pirates shot it. After the raid it slowly died. I was unable to save it because I didn’t have the right facilities. The tribe mate who was fond of the dog became depressed and stabbed another tribesman to death..A ship crash landed near my base. The pilot of the ship wass gravely wounded, bleeding to death on the ground. Do I save him or leave him to die because I don't have enough food to feed him?.These are three of an almost unlimited amount of scenarios that can occur, that strike the player on a personal level. I really recommend this game. "

								A game that can only be described as a work of art.Rimworld is a stunning game that takes the familiar art style and ease of use of a game like Prison architect and blends it with a similar complexity and AI intelligence of a game like Dwarf fortress, All this and it also mixes it with the feeling of Firefly or a similar sci fi!. I initially brought into rimworld Febuary of 2014 and was stunned by the game playing it with and without awesome mods up until now, The dev has taken some of the best mods and ideas the community thrown at him and implemented them fantasticly. I have nothing but praise for this game and how far it has come, It's early access done right and is worth the money easy. The game already feels more complete and full then pretty much any other games of a similar genre ( other then the big daddy Dwarf Fortress ). I love the game.The dev has the communitys trust.if this is your sort of game then GO AND BUY IT!.Also buy it from the website as it will give you a steam key and give the Developers more money to support this project for longer.Thank you Tynan and co you guys ROCK!BUY THE GAME			"

								The Sims meets Minecraft in a survival setting. Gather resources, build your colony and take care of the emotional needs of your people. They will go about their daily business by themselves and have a strong personality, only following your general guidelines rather than being controlled directly by you. They might very well just lie down stargazing when you desperately need that wall built, or refuse to kill an attacking animal due to their pasifist background. You get fond of them over time, and when they die it is like watching your favorite Game of Thrones characters murdered. Managing their mood and keeping them motivated is actually the most challenging part of the game, and you will experience someone going on a psychotic rage killing everyone in your base because they did not care for your decoration or eating without a table, then that broken romance pushed them over the edge. So keep an eye out on those mood parameters, those are your real enemy.There is a lot to take into account in this game, and dangers and disasters lurks around every corner. Heat waves, fires, raids, dangerous animals, food poisoning, disease... And of cuorse you need to keep those mood stats high too, as there is a long list of things that will bring them down. Your settlers are picky and weak minded, the battle never ends. It is still a game that is under development, so I will not give too much criticism of the problems I found. I hope they will be fixed though. The most annoying issue is generally unfair deaths. The game is determined to kill your people and keeping them alive is a constant fight. That is a fun and satisfyiong battle for the most part. But sometimes, they just die of the most stupid reasons, which is super annoying. For example, a pasifist who refuse to protect himself may run away from a slow moving rat that is attacking. Then stop and wait for the rat to bite, then run again and repeat until dead. Obviously the right way for the AI to react would be to run inside and let your traps deal with your problem, or just run and not stop until the animal gave up. Since you do not control your people directly, you cannot override stupid behavior easily. You would have to trick the person into building something inside with a high priority for example, to get him away from the danger outside. But this wont always work well. Fighting a dumb AI should not be what the game is about, there are enogh other dangers to deal with.Another example is a pet I completely forgot about suddenly started to chase people around and kill them one by one. It was allowed to go inside through doors that are usually keeping enemies outside, so there was nowhere to hide. In a matter of seconds my whole colony was murdered. And I was not allowed to kill it. Probably a glitch.Having people or pets go on a psychotic rage and murder everyone gets old, and too often the ones you try to keep alive is the worst enemy. Most of the time when I lost my colony, it is due to them going insane over trivial things and killing everyone. It would be more fun if they were not a bunch of weak minded sissies who turn on you at the first opportunity, there are already a lot of other things to consider in this sim, and personally I enjoyed the other aspects more than micromanaging peoples mood to avoid them going on a killing spree.But generally, this is a interesting game that has a lot of details which will drag you in, and when you succeed it is very satisfying.

To make it short, you have to rebuild everything. You are able to research and learn better things, Like television or other things. Your colonists has random attributes and skills and you are able to order them around to build and work. They could be connected to someone else or a pet. If something bad happends to the person and it may die, then the colonist will get a penalty debuff. There are alot of ways to make the mood high and low. But whenever they are too low, they will go nuts and might end up killing your colonists or destroying things. You could get attacked by mad animals or raiders. The higher the wealth of your base, the stronger the raid will be. You have to gather food, getting resources defend and do whatever you can do to survive.You can put a Seed or choose a randomized Seed.You can change the size of the world.You can choose your starting location.You are able to name your own character.You are only able to randomize a character and you can't choose their perks.Very Addictive.Game has Random things.

But I have checked some videos and this game got my attention. They update and they are still active. This game has a huge potential and super entertaining and it is worth any penny. -------------------I Give this game a 9/10 "

								If you like this type of RTS/Survival type game (Dwarf Fortress, Banished, etc) GET THIS ONE. You will not be disappointed.Basically it's Dwarf Fortress with a far more intuitive interface, making it much easier to pick up and get into. Yes, the graphics are very simple but the gameplay is rich and I don't find the simple graphics to be a distraction.Unlike DF, this game does not have layers of levels. There's just the one. But don't fret over that -- you'll find there's plenty of space. You don't get nearly as many citizens (getting 1 new recruit in this game is a big deal) but your management of those people is far more intense and individual. The game also features different AI modes which give you a measure of control over the challenge, with the default being that it will challenge you without simply throwing totally random ""and now you're dead"" events at you (mostly...) So overall it's a lot more approachable than DF and I would argue it's actually superior overall -- very similar depth to the game, albeit not necessarily with the same focus, and better control and oversight.My one pro-tip: your #1 concern in this game is not food or combat, although those are very important and you will do a lot of that. The #1 concern is keeping your people happy and therefore sane. Pay attention to what makes people happy and unhappy. Enemies MIGHT kill you and starvation MIGHT wipe you out and a lack of body armor MIGHT be bad but colonist unhappiness will be what ends your colony most of the time. Manage that and you just...might....live. Longer.			"

								One of the most accessible community management sims out there. Beginners to the genre can easily pick up this game and get into it without hours of watching youtube tutorials. The UI is mostly user-friendly and it shouldn't take long to really figure out what you're doing. Compared to other games of this type I find it hard to not recommend RimWorld over all the rest, and RimWorld is only in alpha! Despite the game being in ""alpha,"" it feels complete. I haven't encountered many (if any) bugs and there's loads of content to enjoy at this stage in its development. The story that you create for your colony can go in many different directions. You could have one colony thrive while another one is ravaged by a pack of man-eating rabbits. Tons of replayability and enjoyment!			"

								1. Crash land on planet with three colonists (one being Troy, a professional counselor).2. Troy goes about setting up a base camp with the other colonists.3. One day, Troy accidentally trips one of the defensive traps, surviving but requiring amputation of his left arm. He presses on.4. During a raider attack, a grenade explodes near him, shredding his right arm entirely off. He survives.5. Good thing he's a talker; with no arms he keeps busy monitoring the captured prisoner raiders and thinking up new technologies for the camp.6. One day, he's had enough of this life, and starts screaming and breaking things in the camp.7. Fellow colonist Svaad, who is a bit psychopathic with no patience for this sort of thing, beats Troy to death.8. Riker, the other colonist, walks in, loses his mind at the sight, drops his load of wood, and proceeds to attack Svaad. They beat eachother unconscious.9. While lying there unconscious, raiders come to the camp, kick down the door, see the two of them, and decide to kidnap them.10. Svaad and Riker are sold into slavery.10/10 would do it all over again.			"

								At first glance, this game might seem a little frightening. I mean, the expansive UI and numerous orders and structures awaiting your command are no problem after a few minutes. But what's REALLY scary is watching in horror as your colonists starve, go insane, die off one by one, and freeze to death. Once you get over the ethical dilemma of eating your pet cat and dumping all the corpses behind your house, you sit back find yourself with an immersive and enjoyable game. "

Early Access Review
								Four guests visited my colony. One of them went berserk and attacked its nearby faction mates.His friends incapacitated him, then one of them took him and left the colony through the open main gate. The other two guests in that moment mined their way through my walls to leave after him, ignoring the opened entrance.After they left, i got a message that the faction blames me for their berserk friends injuries, loosing some goodwill with their faction.10/10 Now for the serious part ---> EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - described content may change in the future <---Welcome to the deepest sci-fi colony-builder game, i ever played. Rimworld offers hours of gameplay over just a single colony. You control your colonists in form of job priorities - you pick your best constructors to focus on constructing houses, cooks to prepare meal for others, artists to produce sculptures to make envinorment prettier for colonists. You will have to help your colonists survive through tough challenges game has prepared for you, including occasional enemy faction attacks trying to capture your colonists, surviving the sudden heat waves or dealing with some weird space ships crashing next to you... Colonists form stories Colonists always come with stories, that are interesting to watch as time passes. Everyone (even enemy attackers) have their ""backstory"" which informs you what the person used to be before landing on rimworld - these backstories may sometimes affect their skills levels and traits.All characters have traits that change their behaviour. You can have ""lazy"" colonists, that work slower than others, ""slowpokes"" moves slower than the others, you can have ""pessimist"" whose mood is always a bit worse... During the game, your colonist form a friendships and enemies among themselves, colonists may decide to get married to the ones they like or to insult the ones they dont like, which may lead to some injuries as well... (I had one colonist ""insult"" another one, which led him to cut his middle finger off - yes its THAT detailed!) Easier said than done Game starts in the empty land with some mountains and trees around. Your first colonists arrive and youre ready to start building. Game offers frequent ""hints"" during first few days telling you what to do, but there is no actual tutorial - which makes the game hard to learn. Prepare to have your colonies wasted during first few playthroughs, as surviving in wild is harder than it looks - unless you look up some guides, be ready to learn from your mistakes (and to restart few times). Official goal of the game is to survive long enough to research and build a ship and leave the planet. This will hovewer take few ingame years and even if you manage to build the ship you may not want to leave the colony and you may just want to keep expanding. Community adds a lot of variety Did you finally had a succesful run and done everything you wanted to? No problem - game offers three different ""storytellers"", which differs in the way random events appear. There are also 5 difficulty levels to beat.And if you feel like you want to see something new, check out steam workshop - community is currently very active with mods, that adds a lot of new unofficial content. You may decide to try out Hospitality mod, which adds interactions with guests or Zombie Apocalypse mod, which will unleash zombies against you.+ Long playthrough+ Insanely detailed information about everything (e.g. you know EXACTLY where colonists was hit..)+ Active community in workshop- No Decent Tutorial - Learn from your mistakes- Official end-game goal is not interestingGame may seem a bit overpriced on the first look, but the hours i spent and going to spend in this game (and i have much more hours off-steam) makes it worth for me even more!9/10			"

Early Access Review
								The trailers and screenshots of this game do not fully do it justice. What follows after the review is my experience with my first full game.The game is played very similarly to games like ""prison architect"" where the majority of your time is spent building infrastructure and economy with only minimal control over your autonomous denizens, only it adds multiple layers on top of the formula. The game is part base builder, part ""sim city"", part ""the sims"", and part ""factorio"" to compare to other games. Failing at any aspect of this game (villager happiness, resource management/logistics/crafting, combat, infrastructure) will end in the death of your settlement. Life holds on by such a thin thread that you might even say it's part roguelite. Add on top the concept of a ""digital AI storyteller"". Instead of the game throwing random disasters at your efforts, you choose a type of story teller that will progress your story with various events. These events are everything from visits from other villages, space ship parts falling from the sky, wanderers who join your village, to complete disasters. My experience:My three villagers landed on the planet, and were able to quickly build a small functioning village. Despite a few easily put down raids life was good. There was potatos, rice, fresh turkies, and hobbs was a gourmet chef. One day Eryl noticed a steel wall and felt it was dangerous, thanks for the heads up Eryl! As the fledgling colony grew so did its power requirements, and the villagers ran out of steel building a powerline to the freshly constructed walk in freezer. Well, there wasn't much steel on the map, but that ominous steel wall had plenty. The villages were dressed like cowboys, high on smokeleaf joints, and had an assortment of guns and maces, what's the worst that could happen? Senthia went down to the steel wall to deconstruct a chunk VWORP VWORP, immediately exposed and enabled were three ancient war robots. First they killed Senthia, then they started making their way to the village. The bullets fired on them did no good and were no match.  As the villagers fall one by one, a pirate raid happens at the same time. The pirates rush in with torches to set the village ablaze until they see the ancient robots. The ancient robots kill one of the pirates and the rest of the pirates flee. The village is in flames, the villagers scattered on the ground. The game ends with robots destroying every chunk of the settlement chunk by chunk.This game is amazing. 10/10. Would suffer sci-fi apacolypse again.			"

								Having spent hundreds of hours playing already since A12, I can say I recommend this game. Having come from dwarf fortress this game really scratched that itch only with a much more presentable UI and a working tileset. (DF is ascii or fanmade tiles.) The modding community has already produced some really great work for earlier versions and I can't wait to see what they will have for us in the future giving us tons of extra stuff ontop of the already good  vanilla baseline.

								This tale begins with a small colony of three as they start building their base. Within the first 20 days of their perilous journey they recieve a notification that a lone woman is nearby running away from some pirates and is looking for protection. Not only that, but she is the mother of Alice (one of the three colonists!). The colonists gladly accept her plea and valiantly give her solace in the base while they manage to fend off the pirates with their shoddy weapons.Alice is sent to tend to her mothers wounds hoping her mother will join the colony. As her mother wakes up she is startled and begins to run away. Alice begins chasing after her mother desperatley trying to convince her to stop but with no avail. In a last desperate effort to stop her mother from running away Alice attempts to arrest her mother and bring her back to the base. This breaks out into a fight and now Alice is fighting her mother with her bare hands. They exchange punches but Alice gets the better of her mother and gives her one last punch which ends up destroying Alice's middle finger. Her mother lies there...dead.Alice now finds it difficult to do any tasks which require her to use her hands... every time she does... she is reminded of the horrific tale which destroyed her finger.10/10 - would send Alice to arrest mother again.

								What a gem amongst the Early Access. Been playing long before its stream arrival... And NO this is not a Prison Architect clone (that however is also a good game check it out). Think more Dwarf Fortress.Build a colony after crash landing on a planet, with very limited provisions, AND SURVIVE. Theres so many aspects to this game - base building, tower defence, resource management, exploration... I'm really underselling it here, theres really not enough room to go into all the little intracacies and nuances that make this such a fabulous game. Some of the things your colonists will get up to will either make you cry or wet yourself laughing... like when Bob couldn't get any more luciferium so took it out on the other colonists by murdering them in their sleep and then going on a rampage against nature.... in the nude.. before getting mauled by a bear.*QUICK EDIT*I also forgot to mention the brilliant soundtrack - ear candy.

								I start a nice little colony and work my way up to 5 settlers.  For the first few months, everything runs like clockwork: a freezer full of food, a nicely decorated home base, a plethora of resources, and good morale all around.  Everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt.After a few seasons, I start getting bored with the beginner setting.  So, stupid me, I decide to up the difficulty by one level.The next day, four pirates invade, two of which are armed with explosive ordinance.  They kill 2/5 of my colonists and burn 2/3 of my settlement down, along with 90% of my food.  My yorkie also bites the dust after bravely attacking an invader wearing body armor and wielding molotov cocktails.  I send one of the survivors to dig graves and take my attention off the dog's corpse for 20 seconds, and when I come back to order his burial, my resident psychopath has already butchered the yorkie's remains and cooked him into a simple meal for future consumption.  Waste not, want not.  Luckily, the next morning, a wanderer shows up out of nowhere and offers her services.  Unfortunately, she is a pyromaniac, but we'll get to that later.Another two days go by until the next pirate attack.  They've gotten smarter, deciding to bypass the locked doors by blowing up my walls.  No one dies, but I have several nice holes that I decide to take care of later.  Big mistake.Three days later, all hell breaks loose.  I send my hunter out to bag some deer.  That night, they [the deer, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not] decide to get revenge, and they launch a coordinated assault of my compound, coming in through the holes in my walls that the pirates from the previous day left.  My colonists are scattered, and the deer kill one settler and cripple the three remaining.  They politely show themselves out while my colonists writhe in agony on the ground.After starvation and exhaustion start to set in, the pyromaniac's mother coincidentally crash-lands in the area.  This gives my pyro (also a doctor, go figure) the motivation to heal up, enslave her mother (I was short on colonists, sue me), and start to treat the other injured (who cannot walk).  Unfortunately, she's been in agony for so long, she suffers a mental break in the middle of surgery and begins torching everything.  She collapses almost immediately afterwards, and the rest of my colony goes up in flames, because I'm stupid enough to build everything out of wood.  In summary: everyone I ever loved burned to death.10/10 Would play Space-Pirate/Deer-Invasion/Pyromaniac-Mother-Enslavement-Genocide Simulator 2016 again.			"

								vs Minecraft: I just enjoy managing and building a base in the third person way more. There are incredibly more complicated and detailed gameplay you can accomplish with this camera shift and I love the increased depth.vs Factorio: The conveyor belt sim is mechanically deeper with a narrower focus, but Rimworld brings better theme, story progression, and broader gameplay experiences.vs Stardew Valley: Stardew is cute and loveable. RimWorld is nerdy and brutal (in a good way). Both are excellent games in two different subgenres.vs The Sims: I actually really enjoy the Maxis game. Rimworld is a more combat focused and survival themed simulation, built by nerds, so everyone gets cool guns. But I still care about social relations, food, and the decor of my building.on Difficulty complaints: There are gameplay mechanisms that address all the review complains I've seen. However, there is no tutorial nor easy way to discover them. For example, intelligent resource hauling can be managed with clever programming of the work priorities, but no one will ever tell you this.			"

								I only learned about this game a few days before Steam release. I watched a few youtube videos of others playing to learn the controls and basic fundamentals. I absolutely adored the concept and idea behind this game, and I have to say I am not disappointed.I love all the weird, sad, funny, violent, silly things that can happen to your colonists. I like how it is down to a more personel  level of play, being able to get to know each and every member of your little community. I've played many other games like this before, but really none of them I can say equal it in enjoyment.You'll get to love and hate your little pixel guys and girls. I purchased the game and in one day I had a 14 hour marathon. If that doesn't say how much I like it, nothing else can.100 hours played mark update: Yep, still love this game. And with mods, particularly things like Aparello, it gets kicked up to a new level of awesome. I am officially declaring this the best game on Steam.			"

								Year 12.  While hunting a wild boar, Sabine is gored in the torso.  This becomes infected.  After weeks of struggle and being a burden to the team, she dies.  Later, a starving crewmember gnaws on her frozen body, then goes on a berzerk rampage in which he kills the third crewmember in her sleep.His toes are infected and he has frostbite.  In the midst of his starving madness he's attacked by three bandits.  In desperation he blows a hole in the wall of an ancient building and giant insects come pouring out, killing the bandits.He later succumbs to his infection, and dies face down in the snow.  The base, now abandoned starts to deteriorate.  Raiders and vandals come, fires break out.  There is little left but a shell, metal debris and bones.  The walls and floors are spattered with blood.  Some time later, a lone spacer running from pirates finds the place and takes refuse.  Laying on the floor she finds the grenade satchel left by the murdered engineer.  She runs to the door and waits - and when the pirates arrive she throws the grenade at the door - blowing it open and killing two of them.  The third runs off in a panic.She strips the pirates looking for anything valuable, and heads to the back of the abandoned outpost.  Claiming one small storage room as her own, she sets up a desk, bed and candle - cleans the floors and repairs the door.  Fast forward 6 months.  She sports a peg leg from where her leg was shot off by friendly fire.   Her two main fighters are both snipers.  One of them got his ear shot off, the other one has a facial scar from a fight with a raging elephant, incredible as that might sound.  The doctor just finished cutting off the cook's toes to stop an infection from frostbite.   His wife has a shattered jaw, and can no longer speak.  Solar panels are up and working, and the radio is online.  Time to find out who else is out there, and what their angle is.10/10 - Would desperately hang on for my dear life again.			"

								So after playing this game for quite some time now I decided I should write a review for it aswell, so here we go:In Rimworld you are controlling a small group of persons on a hostile plannet and your goal is it to greate a working settlement. The game will increase the difficulty over time, so you better waste not to much time.The Style is very nice in my eyes, but If your looking for HD hyperrealistic Textures this may not be the game for you.The game is often compared to Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architekt and it certainly can hold its ground against these great games.The game offfers a variety of diffrent Difficultys, so everyone can have Funn and its not gonna get boring because of a lack of challange. The Developers are adding an amazingly big amount of new stuff with every Update, and so far I never encountered a single bug or crash. (no hammering ALT F4 after killing my own mans by accident does not count here)There is a quite active Modding Community, with several diffrent Mods you can pick (the Lovecraftian Horror stuff could be worth a look for example)The Music is great and did not manage to go on my nerves so far.Just be warned, this is a game with many things to keep track of and you will fail often before you can build a working settlement. But it never feels like the Game is cheating you. (In the worst case hammer down ALT F4 if something unexpected happens and you are a whinny coward like me)One thing I wanna mention is the Humor of the game, it ma not be obvious at first but this is quite a commedy heavy game but in a very morbid and dark way.My personal Higliths are things like my Doctor getting utterly drunk before an operation and aputating the wrong leg, or things like giving shelter to someone who was chased by some tribals including his own Grandma.If you wanna see some gameplay I got some (oudated) Videos where you can see me utterly failing at building a good settelment:

Start building and watch it go sideways only to find you missed something earlier and were ignoring it the whole time.  I've had colonies weeks in the making destroyed, and success as well.Easily this is a 39.95 to 49.95 game, the price tag is very low for what you get.

								There's no wrong way to Rimworld.  There is no one way to Rimworld.  There is no way NOT to Rimworld.I was initially put off by the comments about how impossible the game is to win - even if the ways you lose can be hilarious.  I like a challenging game, but life has enough fail in it already - I need something I can destroy.  I bought the game anyway, and so help me, I think this game was built FOR ME.  The settings, challenges, and modes seem almost infinite in combination.  I can start a map on sandbox, switch it into a crazy challenging mode for a bit, and then settle somewhere in the middle.  I can play permadeath.  I can be torn apart by mad squirrels.  I can train squirrels and release them on my enemies.  I can use God Mode and strike down all my enemies.  Don't be put off by someone telling you that Rimworld only plays one way.  There is no one way to Rimworld.Highly recommend.			"

								Bought this and Arma 3 at the same time, expecting to put more time into Arma 3. But RimWorld is just so much more than I thought it would be. The customization options are great and with the mood swings and all the characteristics and personality traits of the colonists it's never the same. I was slightly annoyed you couldn't pick traits but actually having them totally random is much superior in terms of stories. It's hard to grow attached to perfect characters, but this makes you care for all their little quirks. Very enjoyable. I just had my first colonist die of a heart attack and it was awful.The game feels quite complete but I'm happy to see that the developers are still thinking about adding content. I paid full price for this and I can say it was totally worth it already.			"

								So it starts off and your little band of randomized colonists crashland on a space-wild-west-frontier Rimworld, with few supplies and lots of problems. And you as they player plan out how these plucky colonists are going to try to survive. Different colonists have different strengths, weaknesses, and skills. Exploit them, and have them each prioritize the work that they are best at to get everything done around the colony. Someone's gotta sow and reap crops. Someone's gotta hunt for meat and leather, and others have to cook, or tailor parkas for winter weather out of that leather. And when the enraged beasts come, or the pirate raiders & slavers come, somebody's gotta shoot them dead.    Build a sick colony and hope your colonists prosper. Hope they don't become addicted to drugs, or terribly depressed, or maimed and wounded and sick. Let them bond with their pets, let them marry each other and learn true joy and live in a beautiful place filled with art and billiards tables. And watch in horror as everything you built is crushed by the unforgiving Rimworld they live on. And then pick yourself back up, start a new colony, and do better next time. Don't let them starve. Prepare for winter. Have a plan that'll kill the raiders.    It's addictive as heck.			"

								I love this game, although anymore I play it with a lot of mods to add more content.  There's a lot about the game that you can tweak yourself too, similar to Xcom 2 it's pretty easy since all you have to do is edit some text files.  I would also say it's generally easier to understand than the Xcom 2 files too.  A lot of content for the base game is still coming and is released on a fairly regular basis.  I can say that because I've had the game for a long time before it was on Steam.  I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes Dwarf Fortress or Stonehearth.  The game can be something of a time sink, but you can definitely have a lot of fun with it without ever escaping the planet.			"

								The dev team described the game as ""Dwarf Fortess meets Firefly"" and after playing for several hours, I can agree.General Concept:Hands-off unit direction (You give them a task, and someone will get to it.. when they're ready!), as you try to achieve more goals, starting from basic survival, to escaping the planet by building a ship, and dealing with random events that can either help you survive, or make your life hell.Pros:- Random Gen World- Small to Large gameplay areas- Customizable challenge/gameplay settings- Easy Start/Hard to Master- A lot of control over the base building aspects of the game- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires that you need to account for.Cons:- No direct unit control (w/exception for combat)- Random Gen World doesn't always spawn with needed resources (you are limited by in-game trade rng)- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires, and will take care of them in the order they want, not the order that might make the most sense.- Maps are currently only a single 'layer'- Single PlayerGameplay Overview:Dwarf Fortress is a good example of how the game plays, and what you can generally expect.  If you're carfeul about how you assign tasks, you can 'force' the AI to do certain things first, but at the of the day, if the character wants to sit and watch the clouds more than cook their food.. they're going to go hungry while enjoying the view!Release 14 introduces new modes expending on the core game, often increasing the challenge to the game (one scenario has you start with 1 character, instead of the normal 3), but ultimately is just a variation on the core game.  14 also introduces intergrated Workshop support for custom scenarios you build, which allows for much easier sharing of the scanrio with others.Thoughts:Overall, a fun game to sit down and kill a bit of free time with, but with enough to do to occupy a larger block of time if you have it to spare.  While the maps have various playfield sizes you can choose from, it is still only a single layer map (at least form what I've been able to find - I might just be missing something in the UI/game), but never felt 'small' or confined.  The NPC events (even teh bad events) tend to be fun (or at least as much impact you allow them to be, and provide a very real sense of 'Aw crap, what happened this time'.One thing I'd like to eventually see in RimWorld would be a variation of the random NPC 'story' archive you get in Dwarf Fortress.  You don't really see the characters 'story' recorded in the development of your colony/camp, and given the nature of the game, I think that could draw you in to the lives of the characters a bit more while increasing your emotional investment in them.Recommend?If you enjoy 'god' games where you do more influencing than directly control gameplay - Yes!Gameplay Livestream Recording:

								This is a great game, very funny too (doctor with cataracts in right eye and rat ate the left eye gave my other colonist a peg leg but ended up messing up a lung?) but it really feels like a great game, Great survival game and it's not even finished so I'm excited for what's comingPros- 1. CreativeAble to build however and whateverr you want with small limitations.2. Love the detailed information on each character 3. Pets, and wild animals as pets, who doesn't like bears?4. Gameplay as I said above the gameplay is smooth and feels like a survival game thats not too easy and not too hard 5. Emotions, I love how you can't easily just murder bandits for free meat or kill your starter pet for quick food since it effects your colonists mentally and them going on rampages is pretty scary since you can't stop themCons- (EARLY ACCESS GAMES NEED THIS SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO AND WHAT NOT TO FIX)1. CombatI'm sorry but the combat isn't..... good. My male with 12 in shooting ( which is super good) takes FOREVER to kill a bandit/wild animal with a good sniper rifle, guns are a nightmare to use since it seems they have no problem at all shooting an ally but takes minutes to land just ONE bullet on the enemy. Good reason why you should just build a bunch of turrets and hide home.2. Random wipesI know its early access but please... Don't wipe my 1 year base ;_; 3. Maps/ExplorationIt's kind of a let down when you generate a whole world and only see a small square. Just my humble opinionFor now I give this a 7.5/10 Great game.			"

								This tale begins with a small colony of three as they start building their base. Within the first 20 days of their perilous journey they recieve a notification that a lone woman is nearby running away from some pirates and is looking for protection. Not only that, but she is the mother of Alice (one of the three colonists!). The colonists gladly accept her plea and valiantly give her solace in the base while they manage to fend off the pirates with their shoddy weapons.Alice is sent to tend to her mothers wounds hoping her mother will join the colony. As her mother wakes up she is startled and begins to run away. Alice begins chasing after her mother desperatley trying to convince her to stop but with no avail. In a last desperate effort to stop her mother from running away Alice attempts to arrest her mother and bring her back to the base. This breaks out into a fight and now Alice is fighting her mother with her bare hands. They exchange punches but Alice gets the better of her mother and gives her one last punch which ends up destroying Alice's middle finger. Her mother lies there...dead.Alice now finds it difficult to do any tasks which require her to use her hands... every time she does... she is reminded of the horrific tale which destroyed her finger.10/10 - would send Alice to arrest mother again.

								What a gem amongst the Early Access. Been playing long before its stream arrival... And NO this is not a Prison Architect clone (that however is also a good game check it out). Think more Dwarf Fortress.Build a colony after crash landing on a planet, with very limited provisions, AND SURVIVE. Theres so many aspects to this game - base building, tower defence, resource management, exploration... I'm really underselling it here, theres really not enough room to go into all the little intracacies and nuances that make this such a fabulous game. Some of the things your colonists will get up to will either make you cry or wet yourself laughing... like when Bob couldn't get any more luciferium so took it out on the other colonists by murdering them in their sleep and then going on a rampage against nature.... in the nude.. before getting mauled by a bear.*QUICK EDIT*I also forgot to mention the brilliant soundtrack - ear candy.

								When I saw this game for the first time, I was like ""How the f**k this game has 10/10 ratings on steam with over 4,5k votes"". I decided then, to download an illegal, pirate version of the game (yes, I commited a crime!) to check it out, because I thought it's impossible for this game to be worth 30$. Boooy, I was so wrong! I've spent over 8 hours straight playing old pirate version of that game, I've started my colonies several time, and everytime my colonies died, instead of being angry at the game, I was even more motivated to start over again from the beggining to create another ""unperfect"" colony that will die sooner or later. On the next day, I went to work and I was thinking about this game much more often, than I think about sex (and I do think about sex a LOT!). I came back from work, and I immidiately bought this game from Ludeon site, registered it on steam and started another 8-hour game session, leaving my naked girlfriend alone in bed...Conclusion: This game has stolen my life, it's by far best game I've played in 2016, it has literally unlimited potential and It's definitely worth 30$. I recommended this game to few of my friends at work, they've played pirate versions as demos, and on the next day they've also bought this game. So, if you're not convinced by the old school graphics, download older version, and If you like it, show some appreciation for developers and buy this game, because it's get better with every update!.

Smart and rich with theory, filled with that old-school complexity, seasoned with simple graphics (which were never required for this type of games).All you needed from old-glory stategy games of the past, plus some new age survival feeling enveloped in a modern, very promising project.

								Having spent hundreds of hours playing already since A12, I can say I recommend this game. Having come from dwarf fortress this game really scratched that itch only with a much more presentable UI and a working tileset. (DF is ascii or fanmade tiles.) The modding community has already produced some really great work for earlier versions and I can't wait to see what they will have for us in the future giving us tons of extra stuff ontop of the already good  vanilla baseline.

								The trailers and screenshots of this game do not fully do it justice. What follows after the review is my experience with my first full game.The game is played very similarly to games like ""prison architect"" where the majority of your time is spent building infrastructure and economy with only minimal control over your autonomous denizens, only it adds multiple layers on top of the formula. The game is part base builder, part ""sim city"", part ""the sims"", and part ""factorio"" to compare to other games. Failing at any aspect of this game (villager happiness, resource management/logistics/crafting, combat, infrastructure) will end in the death of your settlement. Life holds on by such a thin thread that you might even say it's part roguelite. Add on top the concept of a ""digital AI storyteller"". Instead of the game throwing random disasters at your efforts, you choose a type of story teller that will progress your story with various events. These events are everything from visits from other villages, space ship parts falling from the sky, wanderers who join your village, to complete disasters. My experience:My three villagers landed on the planet, and were able to quickly build a small functioning village. Despite a few easily put down raids life was good. There was potatos, rice, fresh turkies, and hobbs was a gourmet chef. One day Eryl noticed a steel wall and felt it was dangerous, thanks for the heads up Eryl! As the fledgling colony grew so did its power requirements, and the villagers ran out of steel building a powerline to the freshly constructed walk in freezer. Well, there wasn't much steel on the map, but that ominous steel wall had plenty. The villages were dressed like cowboys, high on smokeleaf joints, and had an assortment of guns and maces, what's the worst that could happen? Senthia went down to the steel wall to deconstruct a chunk VWORP VWORP, immediately exposed and enabled were three ancient war robots. First they killed Senthia, then they started making their way to the village. The bullets fired on them did no good and were no match.  As the villagers fall one by one, a pirate raid happens at the same time. The pirates rush in with torches to set the village ablaze until they see the ancient robots. The ancient robots kill one of the pirates and the rest of the pirates flee. The village is in flames, the villagers scattered on the ground. The game ends with robots destroying every chunk of the settlement chunk by chunk.This game is amazing. 10/10. Would suffer sci-fi apacolypse again.			"

								Im here to tell the TRUE, tragic tale of Family Uno, the greatest, most f*cked up family to have lived.It all started with a woman named Ryan, a man named Lyso, and a girl named AmarylzThey were a happy family. Ryan and Lyso watched over their daughter Amarylz well, and kept the family alive and happy. Ryan was prone to starting fires however, and Amarylz had serious mental issues. But Lyso didnt care. Even being shot 2 times by an old gun when he was young, he still cared for his abnormal family.So as the family is adjusting to their new life, a naked test subject comes wondering into the home of the Family Uno, named Feeb.Feeb is a great scientist, though she liked being naked, but no one really cared, except for Ryan. She was a jealous old woman. Amarylz was gay, so she loved it.Despite the ever occuring rades and house renovations, time moved on as it did.However one day, an 82 year old raider attempted to sack Family Uno's home all by himself. Ryan took her rifle and instantly downed him with a shot in his right lung. This unfortunately spelled disaster for the old geezer, so the family took him prisoner, removed his right lung, and patched him back up. You can't let an old man die! So two days go by, and it's announced that today is the ol' geezers birthday! Hooray! Not for the geezer, cause on the same day, he lost his hearing! The family decided that integrating him into the colony would spell nothing but trouble, so they let him off, wobbling to his demise.The days go on, with everything being nice and calm...oh no! Ryan has gotten into a beserk and started fires all around the house! Fear not, Lyso was used to this, and would easily pat them away behind her as she had her fun. As the days trudged forward, things were looking up! They had plenty of food and a ton of meds. But selfish amarlyz didnt like the fact that she didnt even have to work at ALL, being given Joy time 15/7. She went made, and started attacking Feeb! Feeb took a tumble and fell onto the ground, as Ryan and Lyso, guns in hand, hid inside the storage closet! She bursted in, and they opened fire, blowing her right leg clean off! Quickly after maiming their own daughter, they rushed her and Feeb to the med bay to stitch them back to health. Many days after the incident, the family partook in a game of chess, when suddenly, a woman by the name of Ladane came running into the house, trying to escape to murderous bandits following her! At the same time, the village of Cool Time Fishing were in the yard visiting. Seeing the raiders, they sprang into action, and killed them in a matter of seconds. Afterwards, Ladane joined their group as thanks.Ever since that day...things started to take a turn for the worst...constant diseases, thunderstorms, raids! No one was safe! It was so stressful on the family, that Lyso and Ryan got a divorce! Poor Amarylz! Then...one horrid night...it begun. The end of a life. Lyso sick as a dog, died in his bed from a horrid torso infection. Nothing was the same anymore. Being the only man and leader of the group, the girls had little motivation to work. Their mood was always poor, and they would constantly fight and bicker. And on a night like many other, a thunderstorm cursed the family greatly...only this time...it was the end times...a lightning bult struck the freezer that Feebs was in, and she was instantly incapacitated, and on fire! Amarylz, as quick as could be, joined with Ladane to put out the fire, but it was spreading too fast! They too have succumbed to its horrible fate, as they fell on the ground, hopelessly burning to death! Ryan could only watch, for being a pyromaniac, the sight was just too beautiful to destroy. Ryan had nothing left. No ex husband. No daughter. No naked friend. No clothed friend. Not even a working freezer room. She snapped! She lit sections of her house ablaze! Running behind a sandbag, she watched as the flames engulfed her entire house. She had no reason to continue...as she was exploring what was left of the world, she found an ancient temple. It was all or nothing! She only had this left for her as a saving grace! She slowly deconstructed one of the walls, two find two Cryogenic sleep chambers. What could be in them?! She walked over to the one nearest her, and slowly opened it up......Where ""Hobo Bob"" and ""Janitor Mary"" toating machine guns mowed her down.10/10 best family simulator "

								At first glance, this game might seem a little frightening. I mean, the expansive UI and numerous orders and structures awaiting your command are no problem after a few minutes. But what's REALLY scary is watching in horror as your colonists starve, go insane, die off one by one, and freeze to death. Once you get over the ethical dilemma of eating your pet cat and dumping all the corpses behind your house, you sit back find yourself with an immersive and enjoyable game. "

								The first time I booted this up I have to say it was really overwhelming, the tutorial didn't do much except show you how to use the basic camera movements and such. I would perhaps like a bit more hand holding so that you aren't left figuring things out by yourself.That said, once you get into it it's really fun and quite addictive.For an ""Early Access"" game, it looks and feels like a full release. Devs listen to the community and are constantly looking at things.Beware of flash storms!! It ruined my first colony :(			"

								I couldn't possibly know where to start when talking about this games tredmendous quality.  It is the best survival simulation I've seen and played.  If you liked Banished...this is better.  Basically, if you've ever played Oregon Trail on an Apple II and liked it,   buy this .  There are many degrees of difficulty incase you find yourself struggling to learn or if you grasp games like this well, then you can turn up the heat.  Every game (seed) is different.  Replay value is through the roof.  Spent 50 hours on the first week.  Not sure when the euphoric state of happiness from playing this game will wear off (1 season and 9 days...you will get the joke after you play it), but right now it's not going anywhere.  If I had to be critial, the tutorial is fairly short and leaves you not as informed as I think you should. Overall, this game is well worth the money and you could call this game more complete than some AAA titles already on shelves.			"

								This game is life.  It's one of the best Early Access games I've ever played. The Early Access tag is only there to signify that the dev is still working on this game, but it's got all the planned features done and it getting new stuff added pretty regularly.  But the best part, is the mods/workshop.  There is everything for everyone and it adds a lot to the replayability.  Each game and set up with vanilla is different and could take thousands of hours to play all the permutations, but with the workshop/mods that number grows exponentially.  There's a Mars Colony total converstion, a H.P. Lovecraft mod, and everything else.The game price has never been discounted and will likely be raised when it exits Early Access.  I put it off for a while but am so happy I finally bought it.			"

								I personally enjoy this game a lot, have started a  new colony so many times and it's always a new experience. I usually end up getting a pyromancer in my colony that has a meltdown and burns everything down :( :D.The updates are nice so far, you can add mods with the steam workshop, there is some really nice addons out there ( Customization of the people, more food, more furniture....)! The design is special, like prison architect, but that is for me not important if the game is fun. What is a game that is no fun at all but has the best graphics , anyway? Also, keep in mind that is is ealy access, so the design might change.It is a little hard to get into, you will have to figure out how to make a good start etc. but there are a lot of guides that can help you :) I'd say it is worth the money! Look up some gameplay videos on youtube, eventually a guide and then decide :).			"

								RimWorld is a fantastic game. There's a lot of obvious surface similarities with Prison Architect, but that's no bad thing and it's also absolutely its own game doing its own things. Every game is different thanks to the complex relationships between colonists that range from hilarious to utterly tragic, and the random events that occur on your colony world provide a constant challenge, so there's a lot of replayability here. It's also very well supported and it is being actively developed and improved upon. I can definitely recommend it highly to anyone.			"

								9/10 - Here's why..There’s something more to this game than just the old - shoot that/kill that...grow that/harvest that. This game is addictive because it actually connects to the player on a personal level. Here are three examples of why.....I got raided by a bunch of pirates. I killed two of them, but the third I shot in the leg. He went down in pain, wriggling on the ground. Do I save him and nurse him back to health? Or do I execute him on the spot? .A dog wondered into my base. One of my tribe mates became fond of the dog and tamed it. It became his pet. One day the dog wondered outside the base during a pirate raid. One of the pirates shot it. After the raid it slowly died. I was unable to save it because I didn’t have the right facilities. The tribe mate who was fond of the dog became depressed and stabbed another tribesman to death..A ship crash landed near my base. The pilot of the ship wass gravely wounded, bleeding to death on the ground. Do I save him or leave him to die because I don't have enough food to feed him?.These are three of an almost unlimited amount of scenarios that can occur, that strike the player on a personal level. I really recommend this game. "

								This game is incredible. I could tell you a hundred stories from my time with the game so far. Perhaps of the time that my tribe of spear-wielding warriors had no choice but to ambush members of a neighbouring township for their clothes, so they could survive the -40ºC winter. Or maybe of the time that an escape pod survivor, Ezra, single-handedly held off a pirate raid while his allies were laid in bed with malaria. He lost an arm for his trouble, but he eventually made it offworld with his friends.This game creates these stories in a fantastic way, as well as being immensely satisfying to play & learn. It's so exciting that it's still in Alpha, so potentially even more interesting things are on the way!Get it!			"

								The Sims meets Minecraft in a survival setting. Gather resources, build your colony and take care of the emotional needs of your people. They will go about their daily business by themselves and have a strong personality, only following your general guidelines rather than being controlled directly by you. They might very well just lie down stargazing when you desperately need that wall built, or refuse to kill an attacking animal due to their pasifist background. You get fond of them over time, and when they die it is like watching your favorite Game of Thrones characters murdered. Managing their mood and keeping them motivated is actually the most challenging part of the game, and you will experience someone going on a psychotic rage killing everyone in your base because they did not care for your decoration or eating without a table, then that broken romance pushed them over the edge. So keep an eye out on those mood parameters, those are your real enemy.There is a lot to take into account in this game, and dangers and disasters lurks around every corner. Heat waves, fires, raids, dangerous animals, food poisoning, disease... And of cuorse you need to keep those mood stats high too, as there is a long list of things that will bring them down. Your settlers are picky and weak minded, the battle never ends. It is still a game that is under development, so I will not give too much criticism of the problems I found. I hope they will be fixed though. The most annoying issue is generally unfair deaths. The game is determined to kill your people and keeping them alive is a constant fight. That is a fun and satisfyiong battle for the most part. But sometimes, they just die of the most stupid reasons, which is super annoying. For example, a pasifist who refuse to protect himself may run away from a slow moving rat that is attacking. Then stop and wait for the rat to bite, then run again and repeat until dead. Obviously the right way for the AI to react would be to run inside and let your traps deal with your problem, or just run and not stop until the animal gave up. Since you do not control your people directly, you cannot override stupid behavior easily. You would have to trick the person into building something inside with a high priority for example, to get him away from the danger outside. But this wont always work well. Fighting a dumb AI should not be what the game is about, there are enogh other dangers to deal with.Another example is a pet I completely forgot about suddenly started to chase people around and kill them one by one. It was allowed to go inside through doors that are usually keeping enemies outside, so there was nowhere to hide. In a matter of seconds my whole colony was murdered. And I was not allowed to kill it. Probably a glitch.Having people or pets go on a psychotic rage and murder everyone gets old, and too often the ones you try to keep alive is the worst enemy. Most of the time when I lost my colony, it is due to them going insane over trivial things and killing everyone. It would be more fun if they were not a bunch of weak minded sissies who turn on you at the first opportunity, there are already a lot of other things to consider in this sim, and personally I enjoyed the other aspects more than micromanaging peoples mood to avoid them going on a killing spree.But generally, this is a interesting game that has a lot of details which will drag you in, and when you succeed it is very satisfying.

								I was reluctant to buy this game, being an Early Access game with simple graphics and a hefty price, but i'm so glad i changed my mind.Trying to explain what the game is really hard, due to all mechanics it have, so i'll focus on what i would want to know:This game is what I've been wanting to play my whole life and didn't knew, this is the beautiful son of Dwarf Fortress and The sims, in a very awesome way.The mechanics are deep,but not drag the game down, the learning curve is sometimes brutal, but lovely, the colonist have a lot of ""personality"" and the most memorable stories are created by how faulty they are, as i said, think of dwarf fortress but focusing more in your dworfs as single beings. Also, while this is an Early access game,this development is more like a Don't Starve EA, the updates are very ""feature complete"", you won't get a bunch of features that don't work or need a lot of balancing, you get one or two per version, but they are solid, tested and pretty much bug free, with a  few hotfixes solving the problems, this make the game looks like a complete game that is always evolving.The updates come in a steady way, 2 or 3 months per big update.The modding community is healthy and very active, the developer is very present in both the official forums and in the Reddit subreddit, implementing some suggestions and ignoring the ones that didn't fit the game.

								Rimworld. Kept hearing about this game from my friends but wasn't sure it was for me. I'd played countless hours of Dwarf Fortress over the years and I couldn't see anything this game provided that DF didn't already have.Never have I been so wrong.There's a lot of goodness in the way the game plays out. The interactions between your colonists or ""pawns"" as they are often referred to is deep and interesting. Like many other games, you collect resources and build with them but the similarity ends there. There's also a rich faction model and a moderately well-designed combat system. You can expect your colony to be visited by traders, raiders, orbital trade vessels, and even survivors crash-landing in escape pods who need your help to survive their injuries.The modding community is going strong, even though the game is still in early access. There's medieval mods which turn it from a pure sci-fi game (though the sci-fi is admittedly weak on laser beams and high-tech staples) to a deranged Renaissance fair gone horribly wrong. There's even a mod which puts you square in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, as if dealing with raiders, toxic fallout, and the occasional volcanic winter wasn't enough. Sounds too hard? You control the threat level by picking a ""storyteller"", which is a great new thing I have not seen in any game before. The difficulty level also can be changed from where it launches exploding antelopes during a solar flare that destroyed your electronics down to where free food reigns down from space in cargo pods.The game has a lot of replayability already, new mods are being added every day, and the game is STILL in early access. I'm very keen on getting my money's worth out of video games, and with the wealth of choices available today there's no reason the discerning purchaser shouldn't be. However this is one of those gems you will play a lot, particularly if you're a fan of building and colony sims ... or a Dwarf Fortress fanatic like me.			"

								Rimworld is just an exceptional game. Take some characters from ""The Sims"", choose their new homeworld, and shoot them into survival space pods across the galaxy. Once they crash down it is now up to you to manage their daily lives. Some will be better assigned as a hunter/gatherer, and at times, a soldier. Others are your doctors, harvesters, crafters, cooks, farmers, and ranchers. How you go about assigning tasks to these people depends on the needs of the basecamp and the capacity of your community.Some days you may have a disgruntal citizen as he just got dumped by his fellow survivor, had to then sleep on the floor during a heatwave since there was a lack of proper beds and now has contracted an infection because the injury sustained while hunting a ""Muffalo"" never got treated in a sterile environment. Now he may die from the infection. Oh, and his dog died yesterday. Hero to zero in one day. Of course you don't want to lose this survivor as he is the only one skilled with ranged weapons for protection and the raiders are due for an attack soon. So you re-prioritize the day to have the survivor who dumped the guy provide treatment with the medical supplies you purchased from a roaming trade caravan the day before. Luckily when you setup your game you rolled a sweet doc and the infection gets resolved.    Each one of your survivors has a random skill set, relationships with others, past medical history, and postive and negative traits. All of this comes with random rolls when first setting up a game. You can custom any part of the game, from starting technologies, amount of people to start with, materials at your disposal. Everything is customizable and worlds are procedural. Replayability ++.  This game is for those who like managing resource gathering and base building, balancing social and personal needs, and simply combat.  The development is on going and very active so you may need to lose a save game from time to time but ultimately I've found no issue starting over and trying new strategies; Rimworld is that good of a game.  After all, its a whole new game each time. It's a buy.			"

								Ignore my hours in-game, I've had this since around Alpha 5 or 6. However with it now being on Steam, this game needs as many great reviews as possible given how much time, effort, and heart Tynan Sylvester has put into it. I'm not one to write reviews often. I think I have written a total of at most 3 out of my 150+ library, but this game above all others really deserves it. So few games have balanced so many game genres in such an addictive and entertaining way. I've purchased multiple copies of this for friends simply because I can't recommend it enough to anyone who enjoys sandbox, survival, strategy, drama, almost any genre of game. And the modding community (and the support they get) is just as fantastic, along with the community itself. Everyone who plays this always has a few great stories of misery or triumph to walk away with, and then come back for another 4 month binge. Tynan Sylvester has truly made one of the finest games of this generation, and the only real issue I see with it is what little coverage it seems to get. Now that it's on Steam though, hopefully that'll change.10/10, would cannabalize again. Well done, Tynan.			"

I sat there in amazement that my entire heard just died from a freak accident in less than a second, as my colonists enjoyed their last pork dinners for a long while.

								One of the few Kickstarted games that lives up to the hype, meets literally every single one of its stated goals, and is actually a fun game.There's a ridiculous amount of depth in RimWorld: shooting people hits body parts, body parts can get scarred and infected, a dirty hospital increases the chance of diesease and infection plaguing your colony. A colonist dies because of a weakened immune system from old age, and then their daughter goes berserk and punches someone else.RimWorld is one of the Dwarf Fortress-like games that can actually match the depth in mechanics, but presents gameplay in a much cleaner art style and has a straightforward UI. For those worried about the amount of content: there's a metric ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of mods. Mods as far as the eye can see, and the game is really easy to mod.			"

								I have less than 20 hours in this game and I can tell you that I really love it! It has taken me this long to start getting an understanding of what all I need to look for (and what to avoid) in potential colonist. That's the first step. The second thing is to use their abilities to build shelter and storage that they won't end up hating and eventually enjoy life.Some amazing things happen at random including my pet Warg bonding with a colonist, only to murder my entire colony when said colonist dies of a heart attack.One thing I can count on is that any character I start to depend on or really enjoy will die before anyone else to any number of reasons including an Alpha Beaver attack, revenge Deer attack, fire outbreak, etc.One final note for any beginners: When the game tells you there is an ancient evil behind a wall.... DON'T BREAK THAT WALL DOWN.			"

I make fields upon fields of haygrass...but this is not enough. its never enough. Before I know it the chickens amass larger numbers. Chicken 57 starves to death. Soon I own 187 chickens. They are too much. I release the locust  horde known as chicken unto the lands, wreacking havock to all vegetation in its path. my colonists run out of food for there is no food to be found. I begin slaughtering the chickens, first tens then hundreds. It becomes too much and I desperately begin working on my ship. I need to get off this godforsaken rock before it is too late.

Early Access Review
								I have played this game from way before the steam release, it is the greatest game ever and even better if your a cold hearted♥♥♥♥♥who will kill his 15 cats to feed that guy on a food binge I once had a colony where everything was perfect and somehow everyone started re!ationships with each other and I was like ""great that will be good for social"" until after 2 days of no progression I realized the only thing anyone ever did was **** each other and then a day later a raid came by and I found that 4 of my 5 colonists were incapable of violence against a 7 person raid, I had no gun turrets and no defences, I was using a self made mod that allowed anyone coming to the colony to join if they felt our place was better, half of their team joined us and slaughtered their friends for me, 3 days later no more progress once again, the new recruits have joined the sex fest, 7 days of watching horny AIs running around doing nothing one had a mental break and ended up burning the entire map to the ground . . . . . . people are not wrong when they say this is not a game for a tryhard because no matter what, your gonna die, also if your one of those sentimental people that get attached to fake animals and people, try doing a cannibal only colony you'll it (evil laugh)Alright alright I'll do an actual review for those people wanting oneRimworld is a colony simulator that has an AI story teller that unlike traditional games it calculates your situation and gives you an event based on that situation such as a raid, or trade group visit, it has many MANY traits and characteristics that tell what a character is good at and what their incapable of, thier is also a very in-depth social system that allows marriages, break ups, and even MURDER over simply being insulted, along side that their is THE MOST in-depth health system you will ever find, you can get cut , shot , infected , hurt , anywhere on the body, I once had my best colonist get his kidney shot, spine shattered, and both eyes GONE after a single unlucky raid, you can also take organs out of colonists and put them into another, missing a leg?, give them a peg leg or a prosthetic leg and if you got the money give them a bionic leg and they will be the fastest runner in the galaxy, and all those features without even mentioning the slightly more in depth combat system, it allows for colonists to duck around corners and shoot, sand bags and rubble can be used as cover and if the enemy is laying down their harder to hit, everything in a battle is calculated to where the shot hits, and if it even does, if your shooter is missing an eye they won't shoot as good as they did, give them a bionic eye and they'll be deadeyed, the game has an amazing building system that allows for beuty of the room they are in to affect colonists mood, give them a big room with slate tile completely clean and a few grand sculptures and they will love it, give them a 4x4 with rock rubble, steel ore walls and no floor, they might go on a murder spree over it.I have no idea if I missed anything but I assure you this game is the GREATEST thing you can buy, but I recommend going to their website and buying it because steam gets a massive cut and buying it from ludeons website gives them it all and helps further development making the game even more enjoyable.What are you waiting for STOPREADIN AND GET TO BUYINGstill reading are we? Your a rebel I see.I like you.			"

								Four guests visited my colony. One of them went berserk and attacked its nearby faction mates.His friends incapacitated him, then one of them took him and left the colony through the open main gate. The other two guests in that moment mined their way through my walls to leave after him, ignoring the opened entrance.After they left, i got a message that the faction blames me for their berserk friends injuries, loosing some goodwill with their faction.10/10 Now for the serious part ---> EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - described content may change in the future <---Welcome to the deepest sci-fi colony-builder game, i ever played. Rimworld offers hours of gameplay over just a single colony. You control your colonists in form of job priorities - you pick your best constructors to focus on constructing houses, cooks to prepare meal for others, artists to produce sculptures to make envinorment prettier for colonists. You will have to help your colonists survive through tough challenges game has prepared for you, including occasional enemy faction attacks trying to capture your colonists, surviving the sudden heat waves or dealing with some weird space ships crashing next to you... Colonists form stories Colonists always come with stories, that are interesting to watch as time passes. Everyone (even enemy attackers) have their ""backstory"" which informs you what the person used to be before landing on rimworld - these backstories may sometimes affect their skills levels and traits.All characters have traits that change their behaviour. You can have ""lazy"" colonists, that work slower than others, ""slowpokes"" moves slower than the others, you can have ""pessimist"" whose mood is always a bit worse... During the game, your colonist form a friendships and enemies among themselves, colonists may decide to get married to the ones they like or to insult the ones they dont like, which may lead to some injuries as well... (I had one colonist ""insult"" another one, which led him to cut his middle finger off - yes its THAT detailed!) Easier said than done Game starts in the empty land with some mountains and trees around. Your first colonists arrive and youre ready to start building. Game offers frequent ""hints"" during first few days telling you what to do, but there is no actual tutorial - which makes the game hard to learn. Prepare to have your colonies wasted during first few playthroughs, as surviving in wild is harder than it looks - unless you look up some guides, be ready to learn from your mistakes (and to restart few times). Official goal of the game is to survive long enough to research and build a ship and leave the planet. This will hovewer take few ingame years and even if you manage to build the ship you may not want to leave the colony and you may just want to keep expanding. Community adds a lot of variety Did you finally had a succesful run and done everything you wanted to? No problem - game offers three different ""storytellers"", which differs in the way random events appear. There are also 5 difficulty levels to beat.And if you feel like you want to see something new, check out steam workshop - community is currently very active with mods, that adds a lot of new unofficial content. You may decide to try out Hospitality mod, which adds interactions with guests or Zombie Apocalypse mod, which will unleash zombies against you.+ Long playthrough+ Insanely detailed information about everything (e.g. you know EXACTLY where colonists was hit..)+ Active community in workshop- No Decent Tutorial - Learn from your mistakes- Official end-game goal is not interestingGame may seem a bit overpriced on the first look, but the hours i spent and going to spend in this game (and i have much more hours off-steam) makes it worth for me even more!9/10			"

								This tale begins with a small colony of three as they start building their base. Within the first 20 days of their perilous journey they recieve a notification that a lone woman is nearby running away from some pirates and is looking for protection. Not only that, but she is the mother of Alice (one of the three colonists!). The colonists gladly accept her plea and valiantly give her solace in the base while they manage to fend off the pirates with their shoddy weapons.Alice is sent to tend to her mothers wounds hoping her mother will join the colony. As her mother wakes up she is startled and begins to run away. Alice begins chasing after her mother desperatley trying to convince her to stop but with no avail. In a last desperate effort to stop her mother from running away Alice attempts to arrest her mother and bring her back to the base. This breaks out into a fight and now Alice is fighting her mother with her bare hands. They exchange punches but Alice gets the better of her mother and gives her one last punch which ends up destroying Alice's middle finger. Her mother lies there...dead.Alice now finds it difficult to do any tasks which require her to use her hands... every time she does... she is reminded of the horrific tale which destroyed her finger.10/10 - would send Alice to arrest mother again.

								Not sure I can say enough good things about this game.  If Caesar 3, Civilization and Stardew Valley had a menage a trois, whoever the chick is, Rimworld would pop out of her.  For anyone who insists that 'graphics make the game, dude', screw you, and you're wrong.  The quaint sprites and animations are fantastic and perfect for the platform.  The creators thought of everything when it comes to simulation the human condition, and it's executed very well.   You love to micro manage a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of things at once? This game is DEFINTELY for you.  Buy this game. You won't regret it.			"

								This is a great game, very funny too (doctor with cataracts in right eye and rat ate the left eye gave my other colonist a peg leg but ended up messing up a lung?) but it really feels like a great game, Great survival game and it's not even finished so I'm excited for what's comingPros- 1. CreativeAble to build however and whateverr you want with small limitations.2. Love the detailed information on each character 3. Pets, and wild animals as pets, who doesn't like bears?4. Gameplay as I said above the gameplay is smooth and feels like a survival game thats not too easy and not too hard 5. Emotions, I love how you can't easily just murder bandits for free meat or kill your starter pet for quick food since it effects your colonists mentally and them going on rampages is pretty scary since you can't stop themCons- (EARLY ACCESS GAMES NEED THIS SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO AND WHAT NOT TO FIX)1. CombatI'm sorry but the combat isn't..... good. My male with 12 in shooting ( which is super good) takes FOREVER to kill a bandit/wild animal with a good sniper rifle, guns are a nightmare to use since it seems they have no problem at all shooting an ally but takes minutes to land just ONE bullet on the enemy. Good reason why you should just build a bunch of turrets and hide home.2. Random wipesI know its early access but please... Don't wipe my 1 year base ;_; 3. Maps/ExplorationIt's kind of a let down when you generate a whole world and only see a small square. Just my humble opinionFor now I give this a 7.5/10 Great game.			"

								Shot an Alpaca, all it's Alpaca friends got angry and swarmed the hunter, knocking him out. They then knocked out 2 out of the 3 remaining colonists, took over my entire base called it home. My last survivor was holed up in a doorway slowly picking them off one by one with a shotgun. After a while she remembered a colonist who died a few days previously, went berserk and decided to instead punch the alpacas to death, which backfired when they quickly killed her. The other survivors still couldn't walk so it was game over.Reloading a autosave from 10 minutes earlier, I avoided the Alpacas and had my first colony relationship. Almost immeadiatly raiders came, gun fire was exchanged and one of the couple was hit in the head and killed instantly.I cri evri tim </3			"

								I've played this game for quite a while, and i've loved every minute of it. What really impresses me with this game is it's attention to detail. For the ability to tell what each room you built is used for and labling it as such, to the description of the artwork your mooks create that's based on real game events. Plus the ability for shananagins is pretty good too. You built a stripe mine and it's now full of deadly bugs now? crank those heaters up to 11 and wait for the bugs to pass out from heat stroke then light their lairs on fire. Then watch in horror as the fire spreads to your base and you pray your fire suppresion devices are placed in a good enough possition to stop the damage. not to mention that the sound track is awesome.Hands down the BEST early access game i've ever played.

Whether you wanna micro manage your colony or just laugh at the ridiculous stories that unfold while playing, Rimworld is worth the purchase.			"

								Dwarf Fortress was a game I played a few years back, and one I would like to play again when it 'eventually' gets closer to completion. RimWorld helps to scratch that itch of managing a colony though, and it does it well. As of this review, I have been playing the game during Alpha 15. I can safely say that this is an excellent game that I've poured several hours already without fully mastering all RimWorld's content.For what its worth, RimWorld is a fantastic game in the colony builder genre. Compared to Dwarf Fortress it perhaps dumbs down some things - like having you mine steel out of walls instead of mining iron and working it into steel first. However if you can get past some of the simplification there is still quite a bit of depth in the game. There is a still caring and managing of your different colonists through assigning them all different work tasks and ensuring they are fed and happy; and while you probably won't have failure due to tantrum spirals, you still have to watch out for the safety of your colonists - be it from dangerous predators, roving raiders, infectious diseases, and rather 'fickle' weather.Something to bring up as well is that if you are coming from Dwarf Fortress, or just picking up a colony builder game for the first time, you won't be spending a whole lot of time trying to figure out how to play. The game features a very basic tutorial - and even without the tutorial the game has a sweet user interface which makes it very easy to actually sit down and just play the game.I certainly encourage buying this game, even in Early Access. It does indeed play quite well without much in the ways of irritating bugs, and the developer seems quite busy in continuing to add new content to the game as well. Check It Out.			"

Early Access Review
 Rimworld is	 is a carefully thoughtout survival title and a basebuilding game if you can survive long enough. This is my 1st time playing the game after watching countless Let's Play from YouTubers like Cromulent Archer who has many playlist covering each major update and Yeti who has some interesting campaign twists that are too fun to pass up. I loved the direction the developer was going from the beginning.It should be said from the jump that this is a polarizing title as some people will find it frustratingly difficult to learn while others will see the learning curve as a worthwhile hurdle and get micro-nergasms when they see things play out perfectly. Difficulty -This title will not hand-hold and honestly does very little in building a strong tutorial that gives the player full understanding of some of the extremely in-depth mechanics here. My suggestion: play the game on an easy mode and learn from there before jumping into the game full-on. This will get you to the point that you can make and experiment with all the tools at your pawns/colonist's disposal.-The challenge increases as your base value increases.-Social Dynamics among colonists plays a large role in either succeeding or drunken binges that end in fights that can result in colonists killing each other.-This game is hard. Colonists will die, lose limbs, become depressed, be kidnapped, have affairs etc.... when it's not hard it becomes rather dull in my opinion, as most survival games can be. Fortunately, that's when you drink your beer/coffee. User Interface/Commands -Possibly the most polarizing part of recommending this game or not is the ability or desire to learn how to play the game. Likely, most people, including myself, will treat it like a RTS game and instantly be lost in how to make things happen. I found myself using the  Wiki [rimworldwiki.com] ALOT.-Rarely do you directly control your colonist. You can gauge how well you're doing by how often you need to directly control them. Your goal is to fine tune their priorities and zones to a point that they eventually run themselves a majoritiy of the time. (there is downtime that you can enjoy a coffee or beer while waiting for an event to happen but I like both coffee and beer so not always bad)-There will be times that you do not know where to click to make something happen. I Should say I'm not sure that is avoidable given the amount of options. The developer did a good job of making some command intuitive however I would suggest changing keybinds once you become more comfortable. Not a problem for clicky gamers, however.-You can alter almost the entire HUD fairly easily.-This game is like coding a program without the script.- This game is an Object-Oriented programmers dream. Depth/Replayability -There is information about everything. Want to know how old the tree is you're about to cut down? It's there. Want to know if your colonist has a pirate nephew? Who wouldn't? It's there. This game has depth.-This is not a casual title. Not even slightly. Can't think of anything hear a casual gamer would enjoy. Even starting a new game can take a long time to prepare.-Make your own backstory/challenges/campaigns/colonists. This is a sandbox game that gives you not only the box and sand, but the bucket, shovel, weeds and rain.-Mod Support. Developer encourages it and often does updates that will conflict with them as little as possible. In-Short -Not for Casual gamers-Step learning curve-Insane Depth and replayability-Content vs. price makes this an amazing value			"

								Incredible game. At times it's survival drama where you lose days to sickness, lose animals to predators, limbs to explosions and your companions to attacking tribes. At other times survival horror, executing prisoners while sealing off excavated caves filled with ancient dangers who want to end your time on their Rimworld. Then sometimes it's survival fun, everything is working, your crops are growing and the five people who tried to raid you are lying naked in your courtyard while you consider whether or not to feed them to your pack of Yorkshire terriers or harvest their organs to sell to orbital traders.Menu heavy, and slight learning curve. However the narratives that play out everytime among my survivors in this alpha game are amazing and at times rival AAA storytelling.Randomly generated everything means tons of content and reasons to build another base and keep trying.Perma death is a nice option, and my preferred playstyle. But there is always the option to not turn it on.			"

								The legend of Gareth.Gareth was a rich man, here to start his new life alongside his best friend Olive, a cat. He landed on a strange new planet and quickly established a base in an old ruin, building a farm and beds to ensure the best life for him and Olive. One day whilst farming Gareth spotted a man in the distance, stumbling across the wasteland. This is how Gordon was introduced to Gareths simple but happy life. Gordon didn't have many skills, in fact, Gordon had no skills. He was a nudist and a pacifist, allowing Gordon to deal with any threats that may come to Garethville. He took a shine to the Potato patch and spent his days farming away, rarely getting involved in anything other than his crops.Life went on in Garethville. Olive, Gareth and Gordon lived out many days happily, trading with the locals and establishing their small outpost into something they could love, a home. Things were going well, untill a shadow from Gareths past arrived, Tiffy. Tiffy was Gareth's ex lover from a his old life, determined to reunite with him. She landed badly, broken and unconcious. Gareth almost left her to bleed out in the rain, and she would have done if not for Gordon. Gordon decided potatoes were not enough for him, and with his sweaty naked body he carried Tiffy back to Garethville.Tiffy spent many days recovering, while being tended to by Gordon. Gareth stayed out the way, not wanting to confront his past. He instead occupied his time with the incresed bandits in the area. After a raid, Gareth noticed movement in the corpses. A peg legged man with a mohawk, lay unconcious and bleeding from the multiple gunshot wounds Gareth had just inflicted upon him. Taking pity on the man, Gareth brought him home to Garethville, placing him in the medical ward alongside Tiffy.Everything was gong well, Tiffy was recovering, and the man (whom Gareth had named Peggo) seemed to be getting better. In the end however, it would be Gordon, the nudist pacifist that undid everything Gareth had worked so hard to accomplish. An illness came in the night and took Peggy, causing Gareths crazy ex to eat his corpse as Gordon was late with breakfast. This sent Tiffy even crazier and she started to knock down the door. Not wanting anything to do with violence or fixing the mess he had caused by bringing her here, Gordon went back to tending his crops. As Gareth was deciding how to deal with the situation another bandit raid attacked. Four of them this time, more than Gareth had ever faced alone. Gareth decided to deal with Tiffy first, kicking down the door and attempting to knock her out with his bullets. Unfortunately she didnt survive the fight, what a shame. Gareth made his way past the crops and the ever useless Gordon to fight the bandits alone. The battle was long and Gareth held his own, killing 3 of them. The fourth got a lucky shot, curving round the side of his cover. Gareth fell, knocked out but alive, bleeding in the dirt he had worked so hard to defend. Gordon didnt care, Gordon wouldnt fight. Gordon just wanted to look after the potatoes. He watched from a distance as Gareth was carried from his home over the shoulder of a raider, never to been seen again. Moral of the story. Never trust nudists.			"

Early Access Review
								So, I've been playing this game since Alpha 8(it's currently 14c). I've certainly put in more than 100 hours, and have tried lots of different kinds of mods, but I mostly prefer a mostly vanilla+vanilla-like mods.Rimworld has come a long, long way, and it has been consistently fun. The interface has improved quite a bit, and the features added have only made the game grow in depth. I'd still like to see the game move into the Z-axis(elevation) and thus give us the ability to build upwards, or dig underground, but for now being on a single Z-level is fine.The mental and emotional sophistication of the colonists has improved by leaps and bounds, and where they used to be replacable fodder that you thoughtlessly sent into battle, they are now much closer to organic characters. They have need and relationships with each other. They fall in love and get married(no babies though?). They get into fistfights when they disagree, and care deeply for their pets. They hide in their rooms when someone they care about dies, or if they've seen too much battle. Some of them can be emotionless sociopaths, while others can be nervous wrecks. It makes you feel a lot more interested in replacing lost body parts, and doing your best to help them recover; not so they can be ready for the next fight, but so they can get back to living their lives.If I have a complaint, it's pet animal AI. When you muster your colony to battle, the animals attend their masters and often hang around in line of fire, regardless of whether you've released them to attack or not. The only alternative at the moment is to attach all the animals to one non-combatant trainer(assuming their animal handling skill is high enough to handle the highest-skill-req animal) and keep that trainer well away from the battle, reducing your manpower. All I need is the ability to quarantine non-battle animals, or to get them to get behind the gunners until battle has closed to melee.All in all, I think that Rimworld has a ton of love and care put into it already, and the potential for more only continues to unfold. Built in mod support allows for tons of expandability, and years of continuous development seems to only be ramping up rather than slowing down. This is a game that seemingly started out as a Dwarf Fortress-like in space with a better interface, and is quickly turning into its own legend as a uniquely PC-gaming experience. You could wait for the game's official release, but I will say now: the game is wonderful in its current state, and looks like it will only get better.			"

								The dev team described the game as ""Dwarf Fortess meets Firefly"" and after playing for several hours, I can agree.General Concept:Hands-off unit direction (You give them a task, and someone will get to it.. when they're ready!), as you try to achieve more goals, starting from basic survival, to escaping the planet by building a ship, and dealing with random events that can either help you survive, or make your life hell.Pros:- Random Gen World- Small to Large gameplay areas- Customizable challenge/gameplay settings- Easy Start/Hard to Master- A lot of control over the base building aspects of the game- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires that you need to account for.Cons:- No direct unit control (w/exception for combat)- Random Gen World doesn't always spawn with needed resources (you are limited by in-game trade rng)- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires, and will take care of them in the order they want, not the order that might make the most sense.- Maps are currently only a single 'layer'- Single PlayerGameplay Overview:Dwarf Fortress is a good example of how the game plays, and what you can generally expect.  If you're carfeul about how you assign tasks, you can 'force' the AI to do certain things first, but at the of the day, if the character wants to sit and watch the clouds more than cook their food.. they're going to go hungry while enjoying the view!Release 14 introduces new modes expending on the core game, often increasing the challenge to the game (one scenario has you start with 1 character, instead of the normal 3), but ultimately is just a variation on the core game.  14 also introduces intergrated Workshop support for custom scenarios you build, which allows for much easier sharing of the scanrio with others.Thoughts:Overall, a fun game to sit down and kill a bit of free time with, but with enough to do to occupy a larger block of time if you have it to spare.  While the maps have various playfield sizes you can choose from, it is still only a single layer map (at least form what I've been able to find - I might just be missing something in the UI/game), but never felt 'small' or confined.  The NPC events (even teh bad events) tend to be fun (or at least as much impact you allow them to be, and provide a very real sense of 'Aw crap, what happened this time'.One thing I'd like to eventually see in RimWorld would be a variation of the random NPC 'story' archive you get in Dwarf Fortress.  You don't really see the characters 'story' recorded in the development of your colony/camp, and given the nature of the game, I think that could draw you in to the lives of the characters a bit more while increasing your emotional investment in them.Recommend?If you enjoy 'god' games where you do more influencing than directly control gameplay - Yes!Gameplay Livestream Recording:

Early Access Review
								An astoundingly complex and deep game that suffers from a bit of early game difficulties.Please don't misunderstand me, this is one of my favourite games of the decade - before playing on Steam, I've played every Alpha adding up to hundreds of hours. If you're willing to put in some effort, the rewards of watching your little ♥♥♥♥ed up ant farm of colonists is exceptionally rewarding.But I would be remiss if I didn't point out how excruciatingly difficult it is to learn the early game of RimWorld. You start with very little (in the base version) and have to learn by constant trial and error what's necessary to survive past the first winter. ""Oh, I should probably dispense nutrient paste until I have a way to easily replenish stocks. And I'll need a lot of tuques and parkas if I want to get work done during the winter. And don't skimp on cleaning and hailing, or else you'll find a lot of carcasses go to waste and people go insane from their sorry surroundings (?!).""But I suppose that's also part of its charm, if you're willing to learn the hard lessons the game teaches you.Overall, this game is worth the praise by leaps and miles, but it still needs some fine tuning.

								Warrning: Sr for any overeasy Puns and Mis-spelling in eggvance :)Best strategy game I've seen in a while. My favorate part of the newest update, the Wanderlust update, would have to be the abillaty to look at the world in a Circler form/3d instead of a Flat form/2d, and the ability to now form Caravans to attack or trade with your Neighbors. The ways that you can build your Colony('s)/Base('s) is endless, weather you want to tunnle into Mountains like Dwarves or build a Village surounded by walls. Would recomend this to anyone who has a Creative spirit and or wants to make digital life suffer.-Catmaster09			"

Early Access Review
								One of the best early access games I've ever played. This game has kept my attention for over 140 hours so far, and I plan on sinking a lot more into it. Absolutely addicting and well worth the price. There are so many different ways this game can play out due to the variation of colonist skills and personalities, game type, starting biome, and a bunch of other things. The mods are top notch and the community are very helpful. A small story from my game: Decided to accept a pyromaniac with a very low breaking point and no skills to speak of into my colony - spent a while basically guarding her whilst she kept starting fires around my home place. After a while, I felt I had enough of her and locked her in a room with utterly nothing to her name (I had even taken the clothes off her back) and let her starve to death. I forgot to look at the colonist relationship screen before I did this. Turns out, she was the daughter of one of my hard-working colonists. The mother falls into a deep depression and can barely do any work before she breaks and binges on beer. She passes out and wakes up with a mammoth hangover, thus making her mood worse and breaking again. It decended into a vicious cycle, and I could no longer keep beer in my stockpile. The mother eventually recovered somewhat... but I didn't. I felt utterly awful, and now I try not to take in people who are mental and/or have a severe lack of skills, and check the relationships tab before I... uh.. ""let go"" of colonists.10/10, will be playing for at least another 140 hours.			"

Early Access Review
								Currently at 170 hours.I only play Permadeath (no saves except on exit), Classic Storyteller, Some Challenge difficulty, Crashlanded Scenario (3 colonists basic scenario) and I accept every random choice they make for me (planet seed, starting location, colonist stats, etc) no matter how good or bad. This playstyle has given me so many wildly different narratives, stories of triumph, defeat, sadness, and unexpected joy. This is a game about the journey, not the finish line.I still have not had a successful colony to date. My most successful one lasted probably about 30-40 gameplay hours, which ultimately fell to an unchecked infestation while dealing with attrition and a seige. I sat in silence, respectfully released all my animals, and watched in abject detatchment as my legless prisoner eventually succumbed to simultaneous starvation and infection. He died alone, in extreme pain, and surrounded by the clattering claws of murderous bugs scraping his cell walls. I like to think his slip into unconciousness saved him from the horrific fate that awaited.The game looks basic, but the interactions between everything are masterfully crafted. You will find yourself having to make hard choices that will really make you question your own values in life. The AI is a masterful story-teller.I can't express this enough: the real enjoyment from this game comes from the meta story. It's a great colony builder, and you can micro-manage so much that it will really satisfy those OCD control issues, but you have to learn to accept losses. It's all about risk management, time management, and resource management. One of the most stressful, but satisfying gameplay experiences I've had in a long time.My only advice: learn to accept losses and failure.			"

It's not perfect today, but the developer has been steadily improving it.   If you don't mind the game evolving and changing every few months and like the survival / base building kind of game do pick this one up.

My last survivor was holed up in a doorway slowly picking them off one by one with a shotgun. After a while she remembered a colonist who died a few days previously, went berserk and decided to instead punch the alpacas to death, which backfired when they quickly killed her. The other survivors still couldn't walk so it was game over.Reloading a autosave from 10 minutes earlier, I avoided the Alpacas and had my first colony relationship. Almost immeadiatly raiders came, gun fire was exchanged and one of the couple was hit in the head and killed instantly.I cri evri tim </3			"

								I've played this game for quite a while, and i've loved every minute of it. What really impresses me with this game is it's attention to detail. For the ability to tell what each room you built is used for and labling it as such, to the description of the artwork your mooks create that's based on real game events. Plus the ability for shananagins is pretty good too. You built a stripe mine and it's now full of deadly bugs now? crank those heaters up to 11 and wait for the bugs to pass out from heat stroke then light their lairs on fire. Then watch in horror as the fire spreads to your base and you pray your fire suppresion devices are placed in a good enough possition to stop the damage. not to mention that the sound track is awesome.Hands down the BEST early access game i've ever played.

Early Access Review
								Dwarf Fortress was a game I played a few years back, and one I would like to play again when it 'eventually' gets closer to completion. RimWorld helps to scratch that itch of managing a colony though, and it does it well. As of this review, I have been playing the game during Alpha 15. I can safely say that this is an excellent game that I've poured several hours already without fully mastering all RimWorld's content.For what its worth, RimWorld is a fantastic game in the colony builder genre. Compared to Dwarf Fortress it perhaps dumbs down some things - like having you mine steel out of walls instead of mining iron and working it into steel first. However if you can get past some of the simplification there is still quite a bit of depth in the game. There is a still caring and managing of your different colonists through assigning them all different work tasks and ensuring they are fed and happy; and while you probably won't have failure due to tantrum spirals, you still have to watch out for the safety of your colonists - be it from dangerous predators, roving raiders, infectious diseases, and rather 'fickle' weather.Something to bring up as well is that if you are coming from Dwarf Fortress, or just picking up a colony builder game for the first time, you won't be spending a whole lot of time trying to figure out how to play. The game features a very basic tutorial - and even without the tutorial the game has a sweet user interface which makes it very easy to actually sit down and just play the game.I certainly encourage buying this game, even in Early Access. It does indeed play quite well without much in the ways of irritating bugs, and the developer seems quite busy in continuing to add new content to the game as well. Check It Out.			"

								I used to play rimworld before it came out on steam, since a very early alpha i believe. When i was browsing the steam community, and saw a rimworld review, i immediately dashed to my PC, and got busy working on obtaining the steam key.It was a little drama obtaining the steam key due to the huge amount of traffic on the devs' servers, and i found myself frustrated a couple of times, but after a long time of doing, i finally got it. This wont affect my review though.Rimworld is an extraordinary colony management sim, which combines PA and dwarf fortress. The game is frequently updated (credits to u ty), and such theres something to explore most of the time.As mentioned in the huge list below, rimworld is a sci-fi, albeit realistically aimed simulator, and succesfully lives up to type with the amount of features it haves. The features all together make it very realistic-like, but thats not the end. The devs will continue on this game for a while (hopefully), and new features will arise.In any case, this really is a recommender, since its lives up to the features it promises, unlike the big AAA games everyone talks about.

								Incredible game. At times it's survival drama where you lose days to sickness, lose animals to predators, limbs to explosions and your companions to attacking tribes. At other times survival horror, executing prisoners while sealing off excavated caves filled with ancient dangers who want to end your time on their Rimworld. Then sometimes it's survival fun, everything is working, your crops are growing and the five people who tried to raid you are lying naked in your courtyard while you consider whether or not to feed them to your pack of Yorkshire terriers or harvest their organs to sell to orbital traders.Menu heavy, and slight learning curve. However the narratives that play out everytime among my survivors in this alpha game are amazing and at times rival AAA storytelling.Randomly generated everything means tons of content and reasons to build another base and keep trying.Perma death is a nice option, and my preferred playstyle. But there is always the option to not turn it on.			"

								I broke my personal rule about not buying early access games to get RimWorld, and very glad I did.Zero crashes, and not noticed any bugs in first ~50 hours playing (and many long nights!), far more polished than most final released games.One of the overall top rated games on Steam for very good reasons - intuitive interface, easy to get started, lots of fun surprises. At the easiest level its pretty much a sandbox to build your favorite base, but anything harder than the easiest setting it becomes quite challenging to survive all the surprises and can snowball quite quickly into a disaster.I'm too wimpy to survive the harder difficulty settings yet!

								I was originally torn when i purchased this, between this and No man's sky. I bought No man's sky...........returned it in less than 2hrs(so boring) and got this. Haven't looked back since, this game with and without mods is very challenging and fun! It's what I wanted fallout 4 to be. the graphics aren't super awesome but they are good enough and the gameplay more than makes up for it.  This game should be in your libary.My first game-   Created myself with prepare carefully, proceed to get bitten by a rat and die of infection alone.My Second game-   Created myself built a little base, only to have a cook i hired go beserk and burn it down. I died fighting the fires.My Third game-   Created a whole party of people all super badass and op, set diffuclty to low, start game........whole party gets trampled to death by a pack of manhunting muffalo. etc. etc. etc. Great stories to be had in here.

								I can't stress enough how good this game is. There are more detailed reviews out there, but this game is a story creating masterpiece. The interface is intuitive, the mechanics are all very well made (taking inspiration from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect) but the replayability is insane. There is so much value and creativity in this game it is most certainly worth your time and attention.			"

Early Access Review
									Definitely a quirky little game.  The first 5 times i looked at the screenshots for this game I had a little trouble believing it could be engaging.  You read that right, 5 times, if not more, because it would continually show up on my recommendations list.  I would scrutinize the screenshots in complete disbelief.  Would these little larva like bobble things elicit the kind of excitement one feels for a game that keeps them coming back the way armor sets in WOW keep people paying a monthly fee?  Obviously i was skeptical.  As it is with many things in life the only real decision can be made once you have a little skin in the game.  So i bought it. Discounted.  I'm a sucker for pretty faces and getting' something for a little less than I could have a week ago.	Because bullet points are basically the end-all be-all of human existence, here is my bulleted list of impressions of this game.  NOTE: 27 hours of beer infused, ""to hell with my week end obligations"", playing at the time of this writing.- Limited tech tree, in the sense that it doesn't really go anywhere.  Escalation is not game depth.  Admittedly I've not fully dug deep into this tech tree, but you kind of intuit it after about hour 16.  Well it took me that long at least.  I'm a slow learner.  Still, there are neat little surprises that a lot of games fail to deliver.  Like a television?  It took me two weeks to carve a sculpture out of stone but i had a T.V. in a day or two.  What the F are they watching?  It could not have been good, as evidenced by the depression that set in pretty quickly for the prisoners i had been feeding the flesh of their fallen compatriots.  Ok, maybe no amount of T.V. was gonna keep morale up under those circumstances.- YOU CAN EAT PEOPLE!!!!! So cool.  And along those lines your peeps will get bummed out if there are too many corpses around.  Somehow this sweet and sour contrast is heartening, but also provides an interesting kind of challenge that i haven't seen in a measurable degree in other games i've played.  Your little dudes get wigged out but stuff that happens in the game.  ""Bob, I'm really sorry bandits killed you pet llama.  We'll make them eat their friends.  Promise.""  It definitely endears you to the game and draws you closer to the little, pistol carrying, sometimes drug and alcohol abusing, larva people you're managing.  Or not managing.  The AI let's you do more or less or less or more or a little less then a lot more. You can manage and prioritize where and what they do, much like the SIMs but you can't control how they feel about it.  The little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, regardless of what you do will sometimes just flip each other off.  BTW, bob hates ninja7.  I had nothing to do with that.  I just needed a wall built.- You can't explore other areas even though when a new game starts, a huge map is generated.  It's not clear to a new player what the relevance is of this giant game map is meant to communicate other than, ""Look.  You can go to all these cool places."" Nope.  This is, BTW the complete same level of disappointment experienced by ""No Man's Sky"" players except the reasons are completely inverted.  If you play ""No Man's Sky"" you'll know what I mean.- The great beaver attack of 2016.  ""Bob, the colony recognises your service.  You sir are a hero.  You lost your nose, and toes.  You now walk with a limp and are a bit slower on the draw then you used to be, but, we promise, when the deer run out, and the turkeys and the crops have iced over, we will eat you last.""  Yes beavers started eating all of the trees in the area.  The colony depended on the lumber from those trees.  I as the leader of the colony had to make the hard decision.  With a  heavy heart, making sure i had a recent saved game, I sent out my finest larva people, armed to the teeth, and <snuffle> ... I'm sorry, it's still very hard to talk about, we lost two.  Once engaged, their true evil was unleashed.  Belligerent, rabid, hungry for wood and human flesh.  <snuffle>, this is very difficult, neither Bob or our colony will ever be the same.	In conclusion, lot's of weird stuff can go wrong in this game, and that I guess is it's big sell and real home run.  It's not an expansive game but it's deep in it's own way.  I referred to the SIMs and I think that's a really good comparison.  A little RTS on a very small scale, a little RPG and a little SIMs.  Overall for it's scope I think this is a pretty fun game.  Definitely more fun and engaging than my initial impressions of the screen shots would have led me to believe or expect.  I can only imagine this game expanding it's scope and becoming truly all encompassing.  The mechanics are solid, UI is crude but 100% what you need for this kind of management style game, and the AI nuances make it, on a small scale as engaging as a well written and heavily scripted game like Baldur's gate.  Pretty amazing for a game that relies so much on AI. "

								(Note: Don't let the play time fool you. I, like many others, play the non-steam version. I have tons of hours of gametime.)This game is amazing. I've played others like it - Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Towns, Timber & Stone, and others, and they all pale in comparison. (Ok, Dwarf Fortress has more complexity, but, honestly, who could every play it with the horrible interface?)It's similar to other colony-management games, but much more interesting. The basic premise is that your people crashland on sparsely-habited planet on a rim world, and have to survive, and eventually build a spaceship to escape. (The new scenario editor opens up other options, but this is the premise of the basic game.) You will battle hunger, disease, injury, hostile enemies, random events, and even interpersonal relationships.The game features three different 'storytellers' which control how often events occur and how dangerous they can be. You can play a relatively safe colony-building game, or a 'This planet hates me' game. It's your choice.The interface works well, and while there is a bit of a learning curve, it's part of the fun, and the game never gets tedious or overly complex.Features:Colonists with different skills and quirks. (Nudist artistic cannibals? You bet!)ResearchFriendly villages and traders that you can barter goods withEnemies in the form of villagers, pirates, mechanoids, giant bugs, and rabid animals.Farming and goods production that is easy to automate.Well-modelled injury and disease system, including limb loss.You can capture enemies and convince them to join your colony, or sell them into slavery.Prosthetics and organ transplants. (Yes, you can harvest a lung from a prisoner.)Tons of different animals, all of which can be tamed and trained.Several different biomes to choose from (forest, jungle, tundra, desert, ice). Each presents its own challenges.Colonist have a mood rating which is affected by many different things, including hunger, temperature, joy (fun), pain, etc. A colonist that has too low of a mood can actually go berserk.Lots of random events that keep things interesting.Cons:Some people may not care for the art style, but I love it. Similar to prison architect.Only one level (i.e., you can't dig down.) You can mine into the sides of mountains, which carries its own benefits and risks.Winning the game is a bit anti-climatic, being nothing but a short blurb, but this may get addressed in the future. Remeber, it's still early access.The best thing about this game is the stories it generates, just through normal gameplay. Some of my favorite game moments:Having everyone in my first game die of disease except for one lone person, who went berserk and lost a melee fight with an alpha-beaver. Watching a thrumbo (really big animal) wander into the middle of a firefight between me and pirates. It took a hit, got mad, and killed all of us.Having half of my colony die from heatstroke when a solar eclipse knocked out my power during a heat wave.Watching my colonist feed a dead raider to my dog who was injured in the fight with the raider. (Karma)Harvesting a lung from a captured raider to replace the one that was destroyed in my colonist by that raider. (More Karma)Having an entire herd of boomalopes die from their own explosions because one of them suffered a fatal heart attack in the middle of the night. (Boomalopes explode when they die.)Watching two of my people get into a fistfight over an insult, and have to spend time in the infirmary together afterwards.Recently, having one of my people go berserk and attack a group of visitors from a friendly tribe. They and their four panthers killed four of my six colonists before leaving.I really can't recommend this game enough. Go buy it. "

								I rarely find a game that is a 10/10 but this game is it.One of the most robust, detailed and complex colony management games I've ever played. (never played Dwarf Fortress) You can build and design your colony a thousand different ways and still never find that 'perfect' build that can deal with everything thrown at you. I love this aspect, as it keeps me coming back for more. I often, when I'm not playing, find myself constantly thinking of new ways to tweak my colony.On top of all this, the modding community is fantastic and adds so much more to what is already there. Then tack on a fantastic development team and you easily have a 10/10 game.Worth twice the price in my book. Buy it!			"

								I've played since Alpha 12, this game is superb.If you don't like micro management this isn't for you, this game has such depth and a good UI that almost everything can be done.Dwarf Fortress meets Firefly in this lovely game. This is more upbeat than Prison Architect which I found a bit heavy by nature of its setting. That doesn't mean its easy, there will be Dwarf Fortress levels of 'Fun' involved.The music is perfect, even the gap between tracks is perfect, the art style is endearing and easy on the eye. Being easy on the eye is important because you'll be playing this a LOT!The story teller difficult settings are wonderful, gaming industry as a whole please take note.The modding scene is fantastic.The game is very stable, even after mods! :OThis is an Alpha and its so incredibly polished!? why can't all devs be like this?The steam key for early alpha players came as a surprise. <3Things this game could improve on? a couple of UI issues maybe, that I can't remember off the top of my head they are so minor. Possibly adding vertical levels... but part of the joy of this game is its accessibility compared to Dwarf Fortress, z-levels might hinder that.10/10Just buy it already.			"

								Rimworld is A cruel game about usually terrible people trying to survive on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ planet where tribals and raiders can and will ruin your day. That being said. Rimworld is an Amazing game where romances kindle, struggles are had, and complete stangers become the closest friends in the hopes of carving out a life on an alien world.I've had colonies fail due to my ineptitude, collapse into cycles of dazed wandering and psychotic rages, or get curbstomped into the dirt by a rampaging elephant. I wouldn't have it any other way.10/10 would watch everyone due to mad elephant.			"

								I really dont know what more I can say about RimWorld other than AMAZING.Now I do not want this to become your average review explaining how the mechanics are great and all that♥♥♥♥♥♥however, what I did think was that I would tell you a story about the game and how it came to its modern stage. RimWorld started out as a game that was literally just ""A Survival Game by the Guys That Made Prison Architect"" The Game"". I played the game in beta and absolutely loved the simplicity of it. However, I wanted more of a challenge and from the looks of it so did the rest of the beta-community. We continue to play until a week after about 20-30 posts were made about how we wanted a challenge and they said ""here, have this so more complicated stuff is added"". Just like that I knew the game was heading in the right direction and dont let my hours in Steam fool you, i easily have HUNDREDS of hours on the non-steam versions (I just dont want to lose my save haha) but I would reccomend this game to anyone that likes games ranging from RUST all the way to games such as HOI4 and CIV. It does have a learning curve for example you can get in and depending on the save you can be fine and never have to worry about  athing unitl you are ready. Or you can sleep in a cave one night and get attacked by a bunch of rabid man-eating turtles while your dog goes crazy and chews off your mother's leg, so in response you kill your dog and your mother gets angry at you because you ""killed her innocent dog"".  It is the idea that you are never safe in the RimWorld and everything that can go wrong, may end up going wrong. You need to refrigerate food, hunt, and chose how people live and how simple things such as love life in their world can impact the rest of the tribe. A perfect mixture of adventure, RPG, strategy, and casual gaming. Constant updates and an amazing modding community the game is one of the best games that I have ever played and I know that I will continue to play it in the future as I still play Prison Architect today.

Overview: Rimworld is a prison architect esk game with matching art and design concepts, but with a ♥♥♥♥ tone more gameplay elements and game mechanics....What makes Rimworld stand out from the crowd is the sheer amount of customization before actually starting your save and during your time through the game. When making a new save (Starting a new colony) you can choose between a huge amount of options which will in return determine how easy, hard, balanced, fun, boring, interesting, dull, your overall game will be.To list a few things:Traits, stat multipliers, in game events, starting items, researched projects, starting location, AID (artificial intelligence director), amount of people you begin with, type of settlement, time of year, size of overall explorable map, and much-much-much more.....One of the biggest selling points of Rimworld is the ""artificial intelligence director"". There are 3 AID's to choose from, the carefully-paced Cassandra Classic, the slower-paced, building-oriented Phoebe Chillax, and the totally unpredictable Randy Random.Each AID will oversee your game and will make choices based on your performance, like when to start a random event, type of weather, severity of each raid, overall mood of NPC's, and yet again... Much-much-much more.On top of the AID's themselves, you may also choose the play style of them too. (Basically difficulty of each AID) Pro's: Very addictive. I've not stopped playing since I got this game. I even skipped my doctors appointment today and told them I'll be there tomorrow instead. - I waited 2 weeks for this appointment. Unique and well throughout characterized artificial intelligence directors which really do spice up the game andkeep it interesting each new save.Lovely looking art concept which fits the theme of ""Rimworld"" and the type of game. Massive customization Mods!Con's:Heatwaves are basically GG. The only way I found to counter them if you haven't got coolers and electric is to strip all NPC's of their clothes and turn on Dev console, then force a thunderstorm which only slighty reduces the heat.Even with the above I still normally failed to counter it and all NPC's died. (Please ♥♥♥♥ing fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥dev's, we beg of you.)Thing's go from bad, to worse, to hell real ♥♥♥♥ing quick here in Rimworld.    With my latest Tribe I was around one hour in and suddenly a psychic drone (Some really bad thing off the map which you have no control over) started to make all my people unhappy extremely badly.  10 mins later it crashes to the ground and lands on all my crops, completely wipping out all my food, then begins to freeze the land stopping my from growing anything, to which I'm given a message that  I must attack and destory it before it freezes the land more + makes everyone even more unhappy.     I tell my people to attack it when suddely 3 ""AI"" climb out with lazers & shields and begin attacking my 4 tribes men with clubs.  2 die instantly, and then third goes mental and begins attacking the forth. Only for the AI to then make all animals go mental and begin attacking everything else alive. Oh and a thunderstorm struck lightning too, burning what was left of my village and surrounding forest.This kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥happened in every save of my so far, but not quite of that scale tho the above is a true story. The base game lacks content.... Kinda. For the amount of time it's been out and for a price tag of £20 there is a lack of  (At least early game) content. Tribe/Colony managementis quite awful. I'd say learn Crusader kings 2 is easier then dealing with your ♥♥♥♥ing people. Lacks basic simple features  which are not game breaking but is a basic concept and should be already implemented.Conclusion: To answer the question you'll all asking.... Yes... It is worth £20.In time this game will be 100x better then it's current state ( Which is already at a high standard )  "

I have put hundreds of hours into the alpha versions and it has been very fun. I keep coming back to this game every few months to get my fill.

I torreted the game after hearing about DRM free and within 1 hour I purchased on steam. This game featurers a random generated scenario in which you must try and thrive against all odds. Everytime you play its different. Only makes you wonder... whats going to happen to these people next :O *EVIL LAUGH* ""SENDS TRIBE TO MELEE JAGUARS.*			"

								I have played tons of games, witcher, terraria, wow, battlefield, warthunder, rust, lol, dota, almost any game you can think of I have played it or at least watched gameplay of it.This is my also my first review ever. I don't think I have ever played a game this fun from the very beginning. It offers a steep learning curve and caters to beginners as well. I haven't even played normal difficulty yet still trying to find a lot of things out. The possibilities are near endless with the randomization and mods. Each play through is entirely different. Play anything besides rimworld? ( don't make me laugh ) and beta? this is the best beta I have ever seen in my life. I wouldn't know it was beta if it didn't say it! Buy this game for you, you deserve it! Especially if you've wasted money on other crappy betas. dayz z, rust, the dinosaur game? etc. 10/10			"

								I love this game so much I'm going to write my first review on it.Lag: There was no framedrops through the entire game and I played on large maps and had a 10v10 + allies&animals battle. It's like a mix of Dwarf Fortress and Towns with it's own twist. They do a really good job of achieving what you want to do, for example: you can have prioritized storages, so they will fill up one storage before the other, there is a storage for specifics so you can have stuff you want to feed animals in 1 place, and food for you people in the other. You can prioritize each individuals work from 1-4 (with empty being not worked). This allows for optimization of their skills and jobs.The most brutal and realistic part is the vitals+combat (and is my favorite). When in firefights your colonists can take cover behind trees, walls, rubble, and pretty much anything that can block a bullet. If one of your colonists get injured, most likely it can be healed, but there is the chance they lose limbs or organs from the fight (damaged beyond repair). Better medicine can lead to better healing (as well as the doctor's skill). Colonists have a large list of vital signs that need to be monitored including, but not limited to: blood filtration, blood level, consciousness, sight, hearing, moving, eating, etc. Losing organs or body parts can lower these, and getting injured and not patching up can lead your colonist to bleed to the point where they pass out and eventually die. Every organism in the game has this vital recognition, everything from a mechanoid to a squirrel.On top of all of this survial realism pazzaz, there is tons of story to be told. Like the story of the 5 townspeople plagued by the 2 months of Volcanic Winter only to be followed by 2 weeks of Toxic Fallout (probably the ash). Not only did all of the plants and animals die, but we had to eat all of the barn animals. Sadly though, while out to retrieve the barn animals, one of our people developed dementia, and two developed Carcinoma. After they were gone, starvation started to sit in again, so we prayed in the Rec room. Right as we thought it was all over the toxic fallout ended, and a trade caravan from ""Patience's Cliff"" (an outlander town) came, we bought all the food we could to last us. Animals almost immediately started flooding back into the area along with the regrowing grass. We continued farming and restocked our freezer. We recovered mostly, but the 2 people with Carcinoma still have it (one is stable, the other has recession), and the person with dementia still has it, all they do is walk around cleaning, and then forgetting what they're doing and wander around aimlessly. A good thing that came of this though, the 2 people with Carcinoma got married.The one con I have with this game so far:The world map is only useful for choosing where you want to settle. It would be really cool if you can use that Pemmican (preserved food), and go travel to other faction areas (like the ones that are near you via Comms Console), nefarious deeds, or friendly negotiation would be up to you. (But seriously I would love to raid those people that tried to sell me human leather, and released a pack of manhunting muffalo [long story])In conclusion: If you're in to rather difficult strategy survival games, this is the game for you.WARNING: If you don't like a challenge don't buy this game, it gets really boring with no events and the events are BRUTAL (mostly)			"

Early Access Review
								To anybody who is reading this, it will be a long review. I will try to focus on both good and bad things (also ""neutral"" ones). Since this game costs quite a lot and doesn't have best graphics or any demo, it might be hard to know what is really behind this Early Access Game. My review is based on both positive, negative reviews and especially on my own experience in the game. Don't mind my relatively low play-time, I have also watched hours of gameplay and was able to see main issues (which were confirmed when I played by myself too). And yeah, I will try to keep it spoiler-free. So, let's start with positive points:+ Addictive and fun. The game can easily get an award of ""Let me play 5 more minutes"". There is a lot to do in this game (since it is a sandbox), which makes it a lot of fun. RimWorld can be very addictive, because you always want to do 1 more thing, before going to sleep/work etc. I personally always want to come back to my colony, to do one more thing.+ Low amount of bugs. Without mods, this game is pretty stable. I didn't have any issues and didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs. Small bugs exist, but they exist in any game.+ Optimization. I played the game on Windows PC, which can run heavy games (such as Crysis 3). So RimWorld had high fps. However, after trying this game on Mac (small Mac, without a good videocard or cooling system), I found out that it runs pretty smooth. It is not 60 fps, but my Mac didn't overheat, even without charging. If I zoomed out, the game started to have lower fps, but in general, it was possible to get 30 fps no problem.+ Depth. The game is pretty deep. I was heavily surprised by the health system alone. There are many parts of the body, which can be damaged (legs, arms, torso, head, eyes, ears, mouth/jaw, fingers/toes, heart, lungs, liver and some more). Each of them can be damaged individually (during combat) and most of them can have different diseases and problems (infections, cataracts, hearing loss, scars, heart-pumping problems, asthma etc.). On top of that, there are many different random diseases, both lethal (such as plague) and non-lethal (such as muscle parasites). Most of them can be healed or obtained during the game. Surgeries also play a big part of the game. So installing bionic eyes or peg legs can get pretty common. There are also tons of faction, a whole planet to explore (not that you will do that, but you can do that). Many different weapons, skills, traits and backstories (which determine your colonists). The game is deep. I have to give a tip of my hat to that.+ Your moral choices. Do you want to harvest organs from prisoners to sell them? Or do you want to recruit and save everybody you can? You decide how you answer these questions. And you decide whether you value more life of a prisoner or heart condition of your colonist.+ Different difficulty levels. There are 3 ""AI storytellers"" (about them later), each with his/her own difficulty levels. So you can decide whether you want raids full of people (making it harder) or base-builder difficulty (just for fun).+ Music and sounds. The music and sounds are amazing. Not perfect, but I really enjoy them. I often listen to OST of the game, personally I like it very much.Neutral points, which can be good for some people and bad for others:+/- Mods. The game supports mods. There are a lot of mods, which add or change the game. They make combat more real, surgeries more fun or even add Cthulhu. However, mods mean instability. And each game update will result in waiting for mods to update. Once, my save got corrupted because of mods. This doesn't happen very often (according to Google), but keep that in mind.+/- Learning curve. The game requires lots of time to play and learn. If you can only spend 1-2 hours a week, this game might simply be bad for you. However, if you are willing to learn the game and willing to play it a lot, you will have lots of fun.+/- Requires creativity. The game is not a game with a plot. YOU make the plot by yourself, dependent on random events by AI storytellers (about them later). If you are not ready to use imagination or just wanna build a big colony without having any attitude towards any specific person...then the game might simply get boring to you.+/- Micromanagement. The game is all about micromanagement. It means that even though colonist do the jobs you told them to do (you can assign each colonist a specific job, dependent on their skills), you will often have to manually say ""hunt these animals"" or ""cut these trees, don't you see, you don't have any left at home"". This doesn't change as game progresses. It doesn't become automatic (this is not Factorio), unless you install mods. But this can be fun if you enjoy micromanagement. If you don't, then the game is definitely not for you.And negative points. If you are okay with them, then you definitively should buy the game. Otherwise...depends on you.- ""AI storyteller"". The game has this description about storytellers: ""RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax."" However, there is no story generation. Each storyteller is not an ""Artificial Intelligence"". Each of the storytellers is basically the set of initial values, which define how random events are generated. Storytellers don't decide that ""because there was a raid, neighbour factions sent free stuff with drop-pods"". They simply randomly generate raid and then randomly generate drop-pods. Storytellers NEVER say a word and you only remember them when you choose your difficulty. As I said before, if you don't have creativity, you won't get any story in this game. However, if you do, then you will have very fun experience.- RNG (basically randomness of the game). The game is heavily dependent on random events (see AI storyteller). And each action has a random chance of being successful or fail. It leads to those moments, when you scream at your dying colonist, who was killed by a low-skilled raider with a bow, who just got a lucky shot. However, it works both ways. I think the game is way too random at times. As of A16, surgery is very random. ""Minor failure"" of installing a peg leg can lead to death. This is stupid, and sometimes frustrating. Even though surgery is planned to be changed, as of now, consider that sometimes it might be a bit strange. - Graphics. Yeah, they a bit bad. Looks like prisoner architect, though it is not one. I think that is not a really big dropback, but if you are the graphics-person, then you won't like the graphics.- UI. UI is confusing at times. It is not bad, but requires some clicking to learn. Moreover, some parts of the game can require mods. For example, I had to install ""Medical tab"", so that my doctors wouldn't use best medicine on scratches. So you can use mods to fix the UI...- Lack of demo. The game lacks demo and it is bad. That is why people are unable to try it before buying. 2 hours are not enough to taste the game fully. So if you are unsure, WATCH gameplay. Definitely do that before buying, if you are really unsure. But if you don't mind RNG, micromanagement and can spend lots of time, then you can easily buy it.As conclusion, the game has ""96% positive"" on Steam. It doesn't mean that YOU will like the game. There are some problems with it. However, I personally enjoy it a lot. If unsure, ask questions in comments. Thank you!			"

								Amazing base building and social simulation game. It's the closest thing you'll get to the complexity of Dwarf Fortress with adequate UI/decent graphics/etc. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time.			"

								NB: Have owned the game since early alpha outside of Steam. Probably close to 700 hours I would estimate.Can't remember the last time I wrote a review, I guess I don't feel the need to do it except in extremis. This is without doubt one of the best value-for-money games I have ever bought. The slow but steady development has left me returning again and again to each release, happily playing it for days or weeks on end. The community is awesome and the mods available are excellent.I'm so happy that the developer gets to see their work hit #1 globally, it's a very fitting and well deserved reward. Here's to RimWorld continuing for many years to come. Now, back to finish removing various body parts before I send these people home.			"

								A friend suggested this game to me; since paying full price for it I've gotten more than my money's worth out of it.It's basically a fully-skinned (ui) of that ridiculous dwarf fortress game you could never get into because every modded skin you tried was just as horrible as the last.People compare the graphics/mechanics to prison architect but ♥♥♥♥ prison architect, that game's asthetic/plot is just awful (I literally wouldn't, and didnt, pay ~5$ for it, when it was on humble bundle).The game is extremely pause friendly and has never ever crashed on me before (only lag if you use certain worldsize settings). Play at whatever speed you like, the more you micromanage the more efficent your colony will be.The base game has plenty of content, but still leaves some to be desired (like more unique enemies, guns, buildings etc.); from what I see, all of the can be accomplished through mods...still havn't gotten there yet though! I really hope this developer takes hints and integrates much of what mods offer into the game c:I definately wouldn't pass this one up if it looks interesting at-first-glance. "

								I have been following the game pre-Steam for quite some time now. Without going into particulars of rights and wrongs, goods and bads, dev schedule, bugs, etc., all I can say is that it’s worth its current price tag. Every single penny of it. The game progressed significantly and judging from what I have read about dev plans there is plenty more to come. It plays well and provides many hours of solid fun. The moding community is robust and they frequently conjure up incredible stuff that makes the game more fun and/or worth returning to and rediscovering anew. It. Is. Good. Plain and simple Fun, even in its current unfinished/semi-finished state (which makes me all the more excited about the final product) :) "

								This game is unequivocally the most I have ever played any game, hands down. I must have 500+ hours playing it and have had the Kickstarter and beyond versions since initial pre-alpha release. The roleplay that you create when you have your characters is just like that feeling you had when you were a kid playing with toys. Each of them had a personality and you fought them and had them get along. It really brings the wonder of just letting fun happen organically right back to me as if I were 5 again.If you like sci-fi, basebuilding, and/or, most clearly inspired, Firefly, then you need to get this game. I promise you you wont be disappointed. the complexity of the game may seem daunting at first but I know that within an hours or two you will have a good hang of how to get around and the fun will just start to flow like water.Edit: formatting and clarity			"

								So tried this out, looked interesting and I've been wanting to play this sort of game for a while.  Starting out and have no idea what the controls are or anything so look up a guide. Next thing I know I've realized I've failed when colonists start going berzerk and I have no food.9/10, will fail againEDIT: After a bit more play, it's not quite what I want. Characters are very random, and can be unfortunate. Like having your strongest fighter also be the only person that can do doctoring, and they get incapacitated, and you watch them die because no one else can figure out to drag them to a bed at least. There isn't that much to in the game, but it's here because dev wants to add more, and it seems to have active modders. Also a very micro-management heavy game. I can see how some people would like it though, so keeps the positive review :)			"

If you are looking to fix your withdrawals from playing Banished - this game is perfect, but prepare yourself for a new drug.Anyway, I can't write much because it's time to start up a new game!

								If you want to step up your casual gaming from The Sims series to something more extreme, RimWorld is it. It's as difficult as Dwarf Fortress, but there are easier difficulties (and three different 'storytellers' that control what happens) that you could pretend like you're playing The Sims. Plus, there's no household cap of 8! Anyone that survives, crashing into your colony - or enemies you capture from a raid - you can *convince* them to join your colony and become a part of the family. :)  Once you're comfortable with observing your Sims, I mean, colonists get cozy - bump up the difficulty for hordes of your neighbors, space pirates, and even space alien robots. No one could make fun of you for that. Yes, sure, you can make people into hats.			"

								If you enjoy micromanging every moment of your game, this is the challenge you're looking for. RimWorld, or as I like to call it: RimJob. RJ will keep you engaged with a plenty of random events to deal with from whichever AI you pick. From lightining srikes that turn a single flame into a raging inferno, poison clouds that suffocate every living thing for days at a time, to emotional instablities of your colonists. Most days are a new struggle with some rewarding moments thrown in.SQUARETOP:Life in the colony of Squaretop wasn't easy. Stranded on a new planet with a few meals and essentials destined for survival. We had to build walls and build quickly. The initial crew (Vurn, Dacil and Sephicite) survived fires, 3-man raider attacks, and captured many raider prisoners whom after some time were convinced by Vurn to join our cause. After 10 years the Harambe faction became the most coveted in the area, we heavily invested silver into creating nearby allies that we could trade with and call on for help. The poison clouds wiped our crops and killed our animals but still we remained strong. Our stockpile of food encased in Marble walls kept the colony of 9 happy while the natural disasters came and went. It seemed all was well, Joy was reaching new levels, simple meals turned into fine meals. Sweltering heat blistered each year but the A/C kept us cool. Squaretop had it's first gay male couple; Sephicite fell in love with a captured prisoner turned colonist named Ray. He was known throughout as RayJ for how he liked to sing sweet love songs to all the colonists. RayJ was desperately seeking love with any living being in the colony. It didn't matter if you had a peg leg, prosthetic arm, or a brain implant. After multiple rejections RayJ found love with Sephicite in a hopeless place. The colony held a wedding and a party in their honor, everyone attended. Life hummed along and the Squaretop expanded quickly and researched many new technologies. YEAR 15:In year 15, our luck started to turn: Vurn died in a mining accident when a roof collapsed and crushed his body. None of his remains were found. The entire colony was disheartened by our Warden's and best doctor passing. He was a social butterly that no longer graced our marble floors or hospital beds with his presence. During this year a firestorm wiped out the majority of the map but our research in firefoam poppers kept the colony walls safe from a fiery intrusion.While in awe of the firestorm a infestion of bugs manifested itself inside our primary mining node. Several colonists were called on to clear the infestation after preparing for a few days. During the preparation the bugs multiplied in number. The 4 man clearing team was severely wounded and spent 5 days in the med bay recovering after the mission. The team mostly returned to their daily work and was effective even if their movement was a bit slower than before, except for one. Sephicite caught multiple stray friendly fire bullets to the head during the infestation mission and had lost his eyesight. He was unable to navigate around the colony or continue his duty as a Hunter. After much debate it was deterined that he was a useless member of the colony and was euthanized in the 15th year by his lover RayJ. A burial was held in his honor, a sandstone sarcophagus was formed by Dacil as his final resting place. RayJ entered a state of depression and began to experience mental breaks. RayJ had a tendency to be a pyromaniac and began to burn down the colony from the inside out. RayJ successfully burned down the food and medical supplies. The fire was contained and so was RayJ. He was placed in a steel walled room with no door and concrete floors. I determined RayJ will be tortured for what he has done to the remaining 7 colonists. The warm exhaust of a cooling vent pushed the temps to over 80C in his contained cell. RayJ died from heat exhaustion and was buried in a wooden sarcophagus next to his dead lover. There was no ceremony held for RayJ. The colony was desparately trying to replenish food supplies through hunting and trade. RAIDER TEAM ALPHA:That's when the best equipped raider team we have ever seen showed up. It had just turned to the 16th year when raider crew B.A.M.F showed up with mortars and established a permiter of sandbags for defense. They brought survival meals and were ready for a long battle. What once was 9 colonists was now only 6 for defense. Of the 6 remaining Diver was incapable of fighting though he was drafted anyway. He would serve as a human meat shield and if possible would haul the wounded to the hospital. We called our allies for help, they would arrive in 3 days and the colony was drafted and formed up on preparation positions. I determined 3 would attack head on lead by Diver the meat shield and 3 flanking from the east side to take out the mortar operator. Diver was immediately hit with the most accurate shots I've seen in RimJob to date. The five man raider crew landed direct hits and he was the first casualty killed instantly. There would be no rescue for Diver. Dacil lead the flanking team and they sucessfully downed two raiders. The head on meat shield team now lead by Tako the Brawler another former prisoner was badly hurt. He was losing blood quickly and the hospital was far away. They would have to fight and try to survive. Moments later Tako was downed by shotgun fire and his mate Erin attepted to rescue him. Erin made it out of small arms fire range when she caught a direct Mortar round with her face. Tako and Erin died instantly. RIP. Three colonists of Squaretop were remaining and four raiders left. We only needed to down one more raider and it was likely they would retreat. The flanking crew hid behind trees and attempted to take down the raiders from range using assault rifles. The colony aim wasn't true that day and the raiders were operating like the legendary Chris Kyle. I sent Mikey south as a distraction and tried to reposition my crew closer to the sandbags. Mikey caught a mortar, was downed, and began to bleed out from a missing left leg. Dacil's movement was impaired from multiple gun wounds to both legs and torso. The only colonist left capable of moving was Curry. Chef Curry was the colonist cook and he had a recipe for disaster. Chef Curry retreated out of sight when I seen the aid show up from our neighboring ally. I sent Curry back in the fight to bake the raiders from the south while they were attacking the allied force. The 3 allies were ill equipped to handle the 4 heavily armed raiders. Poor quality clubs were no match for the raiders as the allies were also taken down, 2 were killed, one downed and left for dead. Curry couldn't hit the side of a barn during this time and was also downed by assault rifle fire. At this point the remaining raiders had won... My colonists were being captured and taken away. Dacil the last remaining downed colonist remained. Once she died, the colony of Squaretop was no more.THE END:This was my 5th RJ colony and I'd say every single one was a major learning experience. I played without save points (Save only on exit, the True RJ experience) The randomness of my attackers fire during the final raider fight was enough for me to quit the game permanently. I mostly just stared in awe as things went from OK to OH to WOW to WTF. I had several crew that were 13/20 and higher shooters and they couldn't hit anything even when equipped with superior weapons. RNG FTW. This also happened while hunting turkeys at times being unable to shoot them at melee range. Seems a bit ridiculous. I'd still recommend the game to anyone with a lot of patience.			"

								This review is based on just a a few hours in the game.Here's my story...There was a couple and a friend. They lived happily in Rimworld. We carved into the mountain for our home and set up a kitchen and farms in preparation for the Winter. A few days later we were joined by Sval, a doctor. I was enthralled by this but he had dementia and enjoyed wondering off.Later on we were attacked by pirates, the wife was injured which cause the friend to panic who then attacked the cat. Both started to do fine until the friend died. Spencer then arrived at the colony who was chased by pirates, she was great until we kept getting attacked by the same pirates which led to her and the husband bleeding out.Prior to this Mikey had joined the colony who was also fleeing from pirates. We survived but the wife was stressed and starting walking in the wilderness. Whilst this happened a thunderstorm set alight my homestead. Mikey was too injured from escaping but still attempted to extinguish the fires but was set on fire and died.The wife then returned home to find no food and, electrics fried and Mikey dead. But she's a strong woman and will regrow the colony. "

The music is great, the art style is neat and the gameplay sucks you in for hours and hours at a time.Almost every game I've played winds up in disaster as killer robots invade, someone has a mental break and sets everything on fire or everyone drops dead from sickness after the only doctor is mauled to death by angry beavers during a hunting accident. But that's part of the joy. Seeing how your colonists will interact,  what the AI will throw at you next and how (or should that be if) you'll handle it.It's a game that's better in the early access stage than a lot of games are after years of post release support.

								Yes buy it.It still has very minor issues in the day to day gameplay.  It has a good balance between planning and execution, with random events taking place provided by which storyteller you choose.  I.e. the storyteller (apparently) provides the non-deterministic events in the world, which can range from pirate raids or lunar eclipses to the wildlife going crazy.It seems to play like a D20 game.The Good:- Characters have to sleep each day - which usually means hitting fast forward.  This provides a casual feeling to the game - the game is not rushed.- It might even be the most casual ""chill"" game I can remember.  You can pause the clock at any moment or revert to an old save.  So even when things are getting heavy you can think through what needs to happen.- The game setting is living in the wild and pulling together a survival plan in the midst of the storyteller generating random events.  It's very easy-going this way -- not like Prison Architect which was too heavy and dark for me.- Grizzly bears seem to just eat berries.  Now you know storyteller will make them go crazy at any moment - so try to figure out a way to deal with them.The Bad:- The price feels high before you buy it.  So it might take longer before many people try this game.  - The game could provide more pointers.  ""Just look it up on the Wiki.""  I suppose if you're hardcore you will want to figure everything out - but this is the blurry line between gameplay-based enjoyment and arbitrary recipe search-space Easter Egg hunting.- There's no demo.  You can watch youtube videos all day - you'll think this is a Dwarf fortress thing like I did, but it's not, and all the videos don't do the game justice.  A demo would have helped me get over the price hump.As it is this game is easily worth the asking price.  Listen - you have 2 hours to figure it out - if you still want a refund, you'll know after first hour.			"

								This game is great fun. Design and build your base, fight off attackers, hunt, shoot animals, take down killer robots.... The best part is that it's free-form enough to have a great deal of flexibility. You can play as a high-minded altruist, a tribe of cannibals, or anything in between. Give medicine and food to your fallen enemies, or harvest their organs, it's your choice!The game is under very active development and each new release brings all sorts of cool new stuff to play with.

								After 75 hours I finally beat the game after 4 attemps!Ok lets try to describe this game for others:The game is a mix between an random generated world, mixed with base building like in Prison Architect, Unique ""Characters"" that are somekind randomized.I know it really sounds simple - in the core it is - but in my opinion it's hard to master!There are random event that can change everything...Your colony is up and running?Dry Thunderstorm which spreads 4 fires at once over the whole map and all trees start burning and your only have 4 colonists who will die in the flames... Next round i thought about cutting all the trees near my building so the fire can't spread that fast!Srsly I love this game it gave me sooooo much joy! I'll keep this game in my mind.Although the game doesn't really have a real story, but all the random events and encounters telling their own story - despite the fact that the story will develop in you mind!Pro:+ Unique Gameplay+ Good Mix of Genres+ High Replayability+ Random Events*Cons:- Random events*- Sometimes not enough options for certain mechanics*Sometimes those Random Events are unbalanced, therefore it can be a Pro/Con.

								I don't really need to give a proper review, since the top reviews already do a good job. I just wanna bump up the rating.This game seems like there's a ton to manage at first, but you get used to it fast. Don't go in expecting to ""win"" right away. This is a game about making due with what you have, and learning from failure.God help you if you get a colonist with 2 cataracts, a bad back, and frail body, who is incapable of dumb labor, skilled labor, intelligent work, being social, or tending to wounds. If that happens, just have them box with a panther. They aren't worth the food.			"

								I don't normally write reviews, but here is one of my stories that just happened:Andrea started this colony on her own with her dog, Mandy. Over time,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lidia, Calvin, Othello, and Ian join the crew. Now♥♥♥♥♥♥was there from day 3. I tried to get them to hook up, but then Lidia came crashing out of the sky (literally) and won over♥♥♥♥♥♥ That was fine. Now let's talk about Calvin. Calvin was this big guy that joined the colony sometime after Lidia and♥♥♥♥♥♥started sleeping together. Calvin had a thing for Lidia. Lidia didn't care. Andrea, however, was that friend next door/co-worker type; You saw them all the time and talked, but you didn't see them as anything more. Some time went on and Ian joined the group. Ian was Andrea's long lost brother and no one liked him (including me, but that's beside the point).One day Ian goes out hunting and pulls a Robert Baratheon (mauled by a boar). Ian dies and Andrea is devastated. Calvin and Andrea start to talk a bit more here and there. Next thing I know, they are lovers. Before bed on their first night, they vist the grave of Ian. They go to bed and wake up as usual. That's when it happened.Two raiders appear.Now Lidia and♥♥♥♥♥♥don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥(incapable of violence bull♥♥♥♥♥♥. Othello, Calvin, and Andrea run out and take these thugs down. Calvin is attacking one raider while Othello is taken out by the other and being carried away. Andrea runs to save Othello because Calvin is a big guy and is holding his own. Andrea takes out the raider, but it's too late for Othello. She runs back to Calvin to find the raider has killed him. She beats the holy hell out of that raider and heads to the hospital nearly dead herself. While this is all happening, our only prisoner has gone berserk and breaks out of prison. The prisoner attacks Andrea's dog, Mandy, and beats her to death.Andrea sleeps in the hospital for a whole day and wakes up on the brink of a meltdown.♥♥♥♥♥♥and Lidia try to help with the healing and cleaning, but Andrea winds up wandering off into the forest because of all the grief. I wanted to follow right along side her.Moral of this story: do not become attached. I was warned and learned the hard way. This game is amazing. Buy it already. I read many of these reviews for the stories and was so glad when I finally created some of my own. I can't wait to see what else they do with this game.5/7			"

I speak from experience as I've played since Alpha 9, before the first steam version (Alpha 14) came out. Worth every penny. What's not to like about a game where you can be a cannibal psycopath with two squirells, a husky, and a emu as pets, whilst be raiding by your 89 year old mother who has malaria and a peg leg. Thats only part of it, let me tell you.			"

								This game is absolutely ridiculous and ridiculously hard.  I love it.The commands are largely simple, but the interactions and complexity are huge-- reminiscent of NetHack, Dwarf Fortress, or the like, but much more approachable.  The game is HARD.  Progress is hugely satisfying, but defeat is frequent (and often hilarious).I recommend getting the ""Prepare Carefully"" mod, and that's it.  Even WITH ""Prepare Carefully"", the game is really hard, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable challenge.The ""Narrator AI"" gimmick is a neat approach, and it works really well.  It's most fun to use the slacky relaxed settings until you have a big♥♥♥♥♥colony, then switch it over to something harder.  Oh, the chaos and mayhem.The backstory engine is surprising, too!  Your colonists will surprise you, and will actually be interesting.  Well, except for the graphics, but you get used to that pretty quick.Great work, guys!  Keep bolting on!PS:  Oh, yes-- if you ever feel your colony has become invincible:1. Buy 250 fertilized chicken eggs.2. Wait.3. Laugh at little chicks everywhere.4. Several minutes of business as usual.5. Starve.6. Realize that chickens need to eat-- and they did.			"

								So everything was lovely in ""Melhadfs World"", crops were growing indoors under a sun lamp safely, everyone had a bedroom, the solar power surplus was enough to get through a winter night without difficulty. Even Raids were easily defeated.But then a storm came, greater than anything else. Lightning tore the sky, and my colonists slept.  Nothing could disturb the sleep of the hard working survivors. They had earned it.Over the horizon a predawn light grew, a flicker at first in the distance, then another on the opposite horizon and a third to the south. The light grew brighter, a blaze slowly enveloping the screen. the colonists awoke to fire ripping through the roof, all but one immeditately started to put out the blaze.  The other one, well she did the most british thing possible, she prepared a meal and cup of tea for the firefighters.But the blaze was too out of control, slowly people succumbed to the effects of the fire, passing out and being consumed in the blaze. While the lone tea maker wondered what had happened. She eventually went looking for them, upon seeing their corpses she ran into the blaze to save her lover... but it was not to be and she died just out of arms reach of him.The fire consumed everything, leaving nothing but 8 burnt bodies.

								At 24 years old, I find myself to be at the threshold of growing out of video games all together. I don't get excited over games any more like i used to in ym teens. It's a rare occasion for me to find a game that I absolutely cannot put down. RimWorld is officially a game I cannot put down. I can't wait for this to be a finished game so I can unlock achievments. The only thing that I really hope the Developers add is multiplayer. Imagine being able to have 4 or 6 people go to a world and make huge colonies and fight for the world. But you could only attack the other persons base if they were online. Something like that would be cool. BUY THIS GAME NOW			"

								I have been playing this game now for some time, and backed it on Kickstarter in 2013.  Since this time the game has continued to grow and develop at a great pace.  This review is based on Alpha 14, the last version before Steam release.  I estimate that I have approximately 200 hours of play.The setting for this game is a group of people in a sci-fi frontier backdrop (Firefly) trying to survive.  Rimworld is described as a ""Sci-fi Colony Sim"" by the creators, whilst accurate it is a rather dull description of what is a very fun and exciting game.  This game has the depth of Dwarf Fortress with the aesthetics and visual style of Prison Architect.  Throw in a great 'western' (as in cowboy) soundtrack and you have something pretty special.  This is a niche game, it is not for people who prefer form over function, but after watching the trailer you will know if that is you or not.This game is hard on its default / average settings.  Your colonists will get sick and die, you will run out of food, wildlife and raiders will attack, colonists will freeze to death or go mad, and natural phenomenon will thwart best laid plans.  Luckily, the amount of customisation available is huge.  You really can tweak most options in the game, by changing your starting climates, picking your storyteller type and difficulty and selecting custom rules.  You can select a random group of survivors or re-roll them as many times as you like.  Options that are not changeable in game are often mod-able.  The Ludeon Studios forum has hundreds of mods available, although many will likely require updating to be compatible with the Steam release.  I would like to thank the creator of “EdB Prepare Carefully” for making a mod that I find it hard to play the game without.The sandbox in this game is rather large.  If you wish to build a small cannibalistic tribe (yes, you really can) that live in wooden huts in a jungle, you can.  If you want to build into a mountainside for the true Dwarf Fortress feel, you can.  Want to tame animals to attack hostile entities or help with hauling, guess what, you can.The story progresses nicely at a pace determined by the storyteller options you selected at the start.  A typical playthrough will have you rushing at the start to get shelter, and food.  As you expand and more colonists join you will look towards researching new technology, and upgrading security measures.  After a source of electricity is constructed, you can really start to grow.  All the while you will have a number of challenges, some brutal, some comical.  I recall one raid that followed after a solar flareMy only criticism of the game is that at the time of writing this, you cannot visit other colonies on the world map to raid or trade with them.  I would not be surprised however if this changes in the future.EDIT: Regarding the only criticism above, it has now been added!			"

								Started out with five random settlers with nothing but primitive technology and spears. Manage to build a base and defend against countless attacks from raiders with assault rifles, grenades, and sniper rifles using nothing but spears and bows.  Manage to tame 10 alpacas and traded for high tech military gear using the never ending supply of crafted clothes from my alpacas. Poison fallout spread throughout the land, where we rescued a couple alpacas yet to be tamed before they would die to the poison. Surviving that, bear-sized, man-eating insects spawned in the middle of my base. My settlers fought these insects, without a single person dying. My war torn people finally had a nice streak of peace to clean up and fix our colony. Until everyone died to heatstoke.			"

								Surprisingly good - this is the best way of describing RimWorld.  The last time I played an indie game with as much potential for replayability was FTL.  If you liked FTL, I'll take a leap here and say you will like RimWorld.  Very different in its concept, but similar in it's addictiveness and replayability which for me is really important.Each time you start a new colony the experience is slightly different.  Obviously there are similarities between games which have had me sighing a little when a colony goes wrong and I have start a new one, but on a whole its quite fresh each time a new game is started.  You build a base from scratch and collect resources, but the little people you start with have real vices and personalities, some are hard workers, some lazy, some hate each other, some spawn new little people if they get together!  Pets can be trained if you have a animal friendly little person too, and they can help fight off attackers or fetch resources.  This can sound gimmicky and a little micro-management heavy, and I was a little sceptical when I read about the AI story teller, but actually it really does work and is fun and balanced.If you're like me and prefer a permadeath game RimWorld comes with that option, and its great, knowing if something goes wrong (and it often does) you just have to keep going till your team recover or all is lost, and that makes the experience deeper, because sometimes you start to feel the journey with your characters, particularly if some get killed or maimed.  I actually got properly sad once when one character died and then his pet dog died defending him afterwards, I ended that game, and that was the end of that story.  The beauty is, you can then start again with new people and have another 'largely' unique adventure.Give it a go, it’s worth it just for the experience, it’s quite a unique game.			"

								Well here is the story of my most recent colony:  A sea ice oneLanded with three colonists. Mason,  Farrukh, and JaydenJayden was my crack shot great against raidersMason was a great researcher and constructer Farrukh grew food and cookedI get a survival shelter up, got power and a heater get up a research bench even individual bedrooms for my people.  An electric stove.On day 6 I recieve an alert ""Manhunter Pack"".  It is only three Muffalo I thought I could handle it.To say the least we had to leave behind Mason's foot and Jayden's eye. I didn't even have enough resources to build a butcher table. 3 raids later I still have my colonists and then I get the alert ""Siege""  I grab my sniper rifles and head out. Half of my base is destroyed before hep arives including my power so hello ""slept in the cold"".  By now I am worried abot my numbers.  So accept the person who causes my demise.He was Table a young man a great colonist by my standards.  But the raid that comes is 10 pirates with 4 personal shields.  I grab my guns and hope for the best. I do ok utill the person with the doomsday launcher comes The only one who remains is Mason who is also, inconvienintly my Brawler. He dies in the next raidBut the game decides to troll me and gives me another colonist so I pack my bags with all my food and leave for the tundra.  After a fight with a hungry fox and an infection the game over screen popped upAfter playing 1,500 hours of this game I can easily give it 100/10 and say it is my favorite game.  And it is still in development!!			"

								I really like this game.This game is one of those rare games where you actually really care about your colonists. I've been playing with one colony for about 12 hours now and we've been through a lot. I started my colony with one 19 year old man crash landing onto a planet with his pet dog Scarlet. Now initially, I had no idea how to play, but I did figure it out after a bit. The man named ""Bossman"" almost died to raiders within 3 days of landing. He got stabbed in the torso and lost his left lung. I initially thought that this would be it, but he recovered from his wounds, he still lost his lung though. Now a couple of colonists named Dally and Lambertus joined and we became good friends. The colony was starting to grow and then we got raided. 3 raiders came in but we took care of them by killing 2 and wounding 1. We captured the Captain named Goki. We convinced him to join our colony and we helped him recover from his wounds, he made a full recovery. Now there was 4. A pod crash landed in our area and 70 year old man named Michael ""Chicken"" Carlson was wounded from the crash. Initially I didn't want to bother saving him as that was another mouth to feed and he wasn't useful considering he refused to do labour. But I saw that he had a high art skill so I bandaged him up and he joined our colony. Now there were 5. The colony was doing good and a lot of food got harvested, until a woman named Gitta was asking for help. She was being chased by raiders and needed our assistance, so we answered her call. We dealt with the raiders chasing her and she joined our colony. Now there's 6. Dally and Gitta became boyfriend and girlfriend and Dally proposed marraige to Gitta, which she accepted. Bossman is now the doctor, Dally is the cook and constructor, Lambertus is a miner and hauler, Chicken is a sculpter, Gitta is a grower, animal handler and warden and itini is a soldier and hunter. Bossman got surgery from Dally to add a new lung that I bought earlier. Things were looking great until Lambertus, Dally, and Chicken got the flu. That's basically where I am right now, half of my colonists are bed ridden and Bossman is tending to them all and trying to make them feel better. We are having issues with food now and it's almost winter. I'm really hoping we can make it one more year, I have faith for these little people.Definately one of my favourite games this year and for an early access title, It's jam packed with content and has few bugs. If you want a game that makes you emotional and gives you a sense of progression, then this is it.I rate this game a 9/10 in it's current state.(There may be spelling mistakes, it's late and I was tired when I wrote this.)

								Rimworld: A game of Drama! Intensity! Love! Now, I do not like to review games on steam, but I feel as if this game needs this thumbs up. It is a strategic colony builder in which i LOVE. It is in alpha, but it feels as if it is a full game. The modding helps the game even more. The people who create mods for this game are good at it and their mods make the game more complete than it is already is. To sum up all my thoughts because I am bad at writing reviews: Get the game, try it, if you like it consider helping the developers even more by buying the backstory in game or the pirate king update.

								So everything was lovely in ""Melhadfs World"", crops were growing indoors under a sun lamp safely, everyone had a bedroom, the solar power surplus was enough to get through a winter night without difficulty. Even Raids were easily defeated.But then a storm came, greater than anything else. Lightning tore the sky, and my colonists slept.  Nothing could disturb the sleep of the hard working survivors. They had earned it.Over the horizon a predawn light grew, a flicker at first in the distance, then another on the opposite horizon and a third to the south. The light grew brighter, a blaze slowly enveloping the screen. the colonists awoke to fire ripping through the roof, all but one immeditately started to put out the blaze.  The other one, well she did the most british thing possible, she prepared a meal and cup of tea for the firefighters.But the blaze was too out of control, slowly people succumbed to the effects of the fire, passing out and being consumed in the blaze. While the lone tea maker wondered what had happened. She eventually went looking for them, upon seeing their corpses she ran into the blaze to save her lover... but it was not to be and she died just out of arms reach of him.The fire consumed everything, leaving nothing but 8 burnt bodies.

On second thought, even losing is pretty sweet. 10/10 Stop reading start playing.			"

								I've been playing RimWorld for a very long time. Way before it came out on Steam, I probably have close to 500 hours in the game already off Steam. Personally I think the game is already great and it just keeps getting better and better as more updates come out. I very rarely encounter any bugs and when I do they barely have an effect on the gameplay. The modding community is great, people are constantly hard at work to create bigger and better mods. From what I've seen the staff is fantastic as well. If you're worried this game is going to be another one of those early access games that take all your money and then cease development don't be. It's been in steady development for years and it's going to keep going for quite some time.			"

								I've been playing this game off and on again for the last two years before it came to steam. It's an amazing game, and it's very easy to find yourself playing this game for hours and hours at a time without realizing. The game has a built in storyteller which determines the events that happen to or arround the colony, this makes it so that even when you may lose and your game may end, it's usually to something different each time and keeps the game interesting and fresh. It makes it a lot less painful when you lose and have to begin a new colony. Which is probably something you'll end up doing quite a bit. So pretty much buy it, it's worth a lot more than it costs.

								RimWorld is a game that is a strategy game at it's core, and one with a solid amount of depth, especially with its mod capabilities. The game has a lot of options and considerations, and can be as hard, or as easy, as you want it to be. Yet what always brings me back to the game is the stories the game creates. With a little imagination, you can take the characters you're given, the setting, and the events that occur and weave an epic story that will leave your friends stunned and interested to know just what game you were playing. I love RimWorld because it lets my imagination run wild, and lets me be strategic and a builder. It's a  game that's hard to learn, but has a near limitless amount of potential and fun to be experienced. The only complaint I have about the game is that every time I start it up, hours pass before I can put it down again.			"

The sadness you get from a favorable colonist dying, the drug system, the sheer difficulty yet ease the game can bring depending on your AI setting and map choice, is amazing. Not to mention this game is made by a small group of developers. 10/10 will rage over not eating at a table again.			"

								I almost never write reviews, despite having hundreds of hours in many games on Steam. Yet I feel that I must write a review for RimWorld. RimWorld is nothing like you think it will be, period. It is an infinite canvas of stories, experiences, horros, trauma, victories, and more. I have many passions in life and yet I have been craving RimWorld non stop for the last few weeks, I have yet to burn myself out from it. This game is the perfect mixture of ""society simulatory"" and survival game. I love survival games and I've been looking for one like RimWorld for ages. It's far more intimate and content rich than Dwarf Fortress and the community behind the workshop for this game is out of this world good. And best of all the lead dev is super involved in the community, incredibly reasonable, adaptable, and industrious as hell. The active development of this game is incredibly exciting. It's just insane to me that a game in its Alpha stage could be better and more fleshed out than more than half of the games still in Beta/Early Access on Steam. I deeply apologize for pirating the game for the first few days I played this. Once it became apparent to me that nothing could possibly entertain me more than this game, I immediately bought it on Steam.This game is easily worth more than $30 so the game is worth more than every penny. Now I will return to my Lovecraftian horror story as I watch my colonists get eaten alive by crazed bears and angry cannibals.			"

								Rimworld is a great game. If you've played prison architect, and liked the way it worked, you'll love this game. Rimworld is my perfect cross over between a city builder and a managment game.			"

								My first game play I got very lucky with a bunch of steel that came out of no where. Until my whole colony died due to a beaver attack and they were all ""downed"" and could not rescue each other. My second game play I tried to get a little more fancy and learned all about the wonders of wood and wood powered stuff. It was pretty cool until all my animals went crazy. RIP.My third play through was by far my best with a whole house layout and everything, until the rabbits had too many babies and they ate all my crops, so now my people are eat raw meat with no crops and are slowly starving. And my most recent play though I thought was going to be fun, until my character couldn't fight and was being attacked by a mad rat. Needless to say he is still running away from the rat.Feels bad man, 10/10 would harvest their prisoners organs and sell them off to other tribes.** Update**I have finally made a great colony who only feasts on corn and rice because we don't hunt pandas, I have saved a loved one from being stolen by shooting at them both and killing one while cripling the other, gave him a new leg, and have a nice love triangle.Still love this game!

								- Started up a decent colony that had a mountain base.- Had a brawler named Mitch that wielded a steel shield and a masterworks long sword.- Toxic fallout happened so I got everyone to stay inside the mountain for a couple of days. (Thought it would be a piece of cake)- Halfway way through the fallout, those stupid gaint ants started breeding again and have taken over my half of my mountain base.- Ordered all of my colonists to get rid of them, everyone got severely injured but they managed to clear them out. (thanks to the brawler I had)- Fallout is almost over and all of my colonists are extremely joy deprived and have cabin fever.- Mitch (brawler) decided to go savage and started killing everyone with the damn shield and sword they made for him?!?!- He killed all of my colonists and the last colonist that tried to stop him got his left hand cut off and his head sliced open.♥♥♥♥ you Mitch, and thanks for ruining my colonyGreat game I would totally recommend it, if you like seeing your colony go to♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Been playing this game long before it got onto steam, it's a very good colony/base building game although i feel that theres still a lot of stuff that can be added and tweaked to make it better.my biggest grief with this game is that the lamps are 150 watt!!! each.. i mean come on.. 15 watts would be more reasonable, for us that want to light up the base nicely it's impossible unless you have a gazillion powerplants, which you normally need to power your heating lamps and hydroponics if you play on ice sheet worlds.. but if you don't have lamps your crew gets depressed.....so come on, theres no reason for lamps to be 150 watt!!

								As a kickstarter backer, I've been playing this game for a long time, probably putting in 30+hrs per alpha.   I can't recommend it enough, Rimworld is fantastic.Every playthrough is different. The unique combinations of who your colonists are, the enviroment they start in, and the story and events that unfold ensure that you won't ever have the same experience twice.  Every new alpha adds more depth to that experience, and the wonderful modding community continues to enrich it.  It's a game that is constantly being tweaked and upgraded to find that perfect balance of challenge and reward.If you're on the fence, go for it.  You won't be disappointed. "

								Tthe thing with rimworld though is it's not a ""game"" persay. It's a story, which is why suddenly and out of nowhere your entire colony is brutally slaughtered by some terrible event. You have 3 different story tellers. One of them, Randy Random can literally drop a giant pirate raid very soon after you crashland, your colony is dead and your story ends. Or you could survive for a little while, or you could survive long enough for you to build a new starship and escape the planet. Rimworld is a story, of survival and hardship. Your colonists suffer ilnesses, infections, injuries. They can lose limbs, eyes etc. They can get dementia, a bad back. A brain injury. Missing eyes. They can also fall in love, get married. Then you have families, a raiding part might attack and one the raiders if the brother of one of your colonists. Then there are rivaleries, just like in the realy world people don't always get along. Say a colonist dies, now a couple other colonist might've been good friends so they'll get a massive hit their mood, as a close friend died but another colonists hated them and now they're dead they're happy and have a spring in their step. Every colonist has traits and backstorys that are randomly generated. Some may be pyromaniacs, others may be cold tolerant, again others might be alcholics, drug addicts, hard works and the list goes on. For bakcstories, they may have been surgeons, builders, bounty hunters, royality and the list goes on. It's a very deep game and immensely satisfying. Unlike other random colony or city builders you get very attached to these colonists because of how deep this game is. "

								I played this game already for countless hours before the steam release and I'm still doing so.it won't get boring, one of the advantages of a large and very good modding community. You will alway find new challenges to master. Make sure to visit the forums though, you won't find all the good mods on steam.In general, I can highly recommend this to any player who likes base building games, with a lot of strategic decisions mixed with the strong survival aspect of the game.As most of the reviews mentioned, there are a many similarities to ""Prison Architect"", due to the angled top down view and the the building system ( single blocks, put together to build your desired colony / prison ).I played some Prison Architect, but I never really enjoyed it, so I can say I like RimWorld a lot better!You can play your colony simply as a base builder, recruit people and have a prospering place to live. Or you can go hardcore, fight against nature and hostile factions. There is surely a setup you will enjoy. From basebuilder to real struggle to survive is everything included. This game offers you a real challenge if you are up to it!Theres is a lot of detail to the game and your colonists. Social interactions with other colonists, ranging from hate to marriage. A health system where you can lose and replace limbs and organs. Individual traits for the colonists making them a super soldier, doc or that guy who is always on the edge to a mental break.The combat system is divided into melee and ranged and you can get into big and epic firefights when 20 pirates start to raid your colony and you have to defend against them. You can set up your defensive system over the whole map and generate a new layout never seen before.Set up a big prison wing to keep all the prisoners, captured during enemy raids and convince them to join you.There are not only human threats, but also mechanoids, advanced killing machines, which can be the end to an unprepared colony. Nature itself can make it a struggle to feed everybody, when the sun is covered for months during a volcanic winter. Or a solar flare disables your heaters when its -60°C outside.A lot can happen and there is enough material for a very good story.This can make your first start a bit tricky, but over the course of time you will learn to deal with each situation and I'm sure at some point, there will be another great colony somewhere in the endless vastness of space ... There are complaints about the lack of multiplayer, but I think they are unjustified. There is no real need for it. However, I can agree that I would enjoy to visit or raid other colonies, AI or not. It goes hand in hand with the fact, that you are currently restricted to the piece of land where you start. There is no possibility to take a few colonist and wander off to start another colony on the same planet ( a generated map from where you can choose your start biome ). This would allow you to trade and do all the interactional stuff and I would love to see that.Always keep in mind that this is still an Alpha version and that there is a lot of time to implement mechanics into the game.I give a lot of credit to the developer, he keeps every new version perfectly playable. With each update there is new content to explore.If you are still not sure whether you should buy this game, there are a lot of videos about it. I already made several Let's Plays myself with various setups. You can check out the newest one here:

I have never been interseted in games like this before and ive chosen to completely ignore them in the past however this game happend to become one of my favourite games so far.Ive only comitted to a whole 2 hours as of now but i expecting to put in many and more, due to the simple fact of it being so addictive and  is a nice change of pace compared to the many shooters that i play. I highly recoomend this game, however, watch a begginers guide before you play it will help you alot.

								Surprisingly good - this is the best way of describing RimWorld.  The last time I played an indie game with as much potential for replayability was FTL.  If you liked FTL, I'll take a leap here and say you will like RimWorld.  Very different in its concept, but similar in it's addictiveness and replayability which for me is really important.Each time you start a new colony the experience is slightly different.  Obviously there are similarities between games which have had me sighing a little when a colony goes wrong and I have start a new one, but on a whole its quite fresh each time a new game is started.  You build a base from scratch and collect resources, but the little people you start with have real vices and personalities, some are hard workers, some lazy, some hate each other, some spawn new little people if they get together!  Pets can be trained if you have a animal friendly little person too, and they can help fight off attackers or fetch resources.  This can sound gimmicky and a little micro-management heavy, and I was a little sceptical when I read about the AI story teller, but actually it really does work and is fun and balanced.If you're like me and prefer a permadeath game RimWorld comes with that option, and its great, knowing if something goes wrong (and it often does) you just have to keep going till your team recover or all is lost, and that makes the experience deeper, because sometimes you start to feel the journey with your characters, particularly if some get killed or maimed.  I actually got properly sad once when one character died and then his pet dog died defending him afterwards, I ended that game, and that was the end of that story.  The beauty is, you can then start again with new people and have another 'largely' unique adventure.Give it a go, it’s worth it just for the experience, it’s quite a unique game.			"

								Well here is the story of my most recent colony:  A sea ice oneLanded with three colonists. Mason,  Farrukh, and JaydenJayden was my crack shot great against raidersMason was a great researcher and constructer Farrukh grew food and cookedI get a survival shelter up, got power and a heater get up a research bench even individual bedrooms for my people.  An electric stove.On day 6 I recieve an alert ""Manhunter Pack"".  It is only three Muffalo I thought I could handle it.To say the least we had to leave behind Mason's foot and Jayden's eye. I didn't even have enough resources to build a butcher table. 3 raids later I still have my colonists and then I get the alert ""Siege""  I grab my sniper rifles and head out. Half of my base is destroyed before hep arives including my power so hello ""slept in the cold"".  By now I am worried abot my numbers.  So accept the person who causes my demise.He was Table a young man a great colonist by my standards.  But the raid that comes is 10 pirates with 4 personal shields.  I grab my guns and hope for the best. I do ok utill the person with the doomsday launcher comes The only one who remains is Mason who is also, inconvienintly my Brawler. He dies in the next raidBut the game decides to troll me and gives me another colonist so I pack my bags with all my food and leave for the tundra.  After a fight with a hungry fox and an infection the game over screen popped upAfter playing 1,500 hours of this game I can easily give it 100/10 and say it is my favorite game.

Poison fallout spread throughout the land, where we rescued a couple alpacas yet to be tamed before they would die to the poison.

Me personaly this game is a godsend, I would highly reccomend this game to those who played PA (Prison Architect). The gameplay is a 10/9 due to the incompletion of the game and the fact that it could use a bit more content (But thats what mods are for). There is one thing I would like to change about the game is recruitment encouters, Say the (This person has joined your colony shabang) I hate the fact that half the time these people simply murder my dudes hanging on to dear life due to the fact I live on hydroponics and my gaint horde of wolf babies eat EVERYTHING in my tiny little unground bunker. There should be a option to uhh.. How would you say stop the ""Breeding Proccess"" Between two tamed animals of the same type and diffrent gender. All in all I would highly reccomend this game for Combat Lovers,Micromangement Lovers, Building Lovers.			"

								There's little like the joy of guiding random shipwrecked spacefarers, have them build houses, grow potatoes, mine out mineral deposits of mountains, tame wildlife, defend their colony against pirates, trade with neighboring settlements, research new technology and grow and prosper ...!... until manhunting elephants stampede through your colony and trample everybody and everything as your defenses are shut down by solar flares and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ colonist playing with matches sets your food storage on fire, all in all tearing your heart right out. Now also with raccoons!			"

								So my crew of 3 crashed their escape pods into a open area and I started to build a basic base / shelter.  Shortly after getting started an outsider contacted my crew and asked for help.  But in accepting I had to fight off two angry and naked pirates who where chasing her.  After I saved her she joined my small crew on.  But that was just a a heat wave hit which drove everyone mad and caused them to wonder aimlessly.  Then an angry rabbit attacked and killed everyone off hince ending my short and sad first game.  LOVEN IT!This game has hit my most loved drivers for a game head on.  Survival & base building.  I am enjoying the ability to generate the same world to explore different starting spots.  The character creation is spot on providing both pro's and con's to each doomed castaway.  I am really having a hard time getting enough time to play this game.			"

								I am going to do this review while the last game is fresh in my mind.I only play on Extreme difficulty with permadeath mode, this game was with Cassandra Classic as the storyteller.5 Colonists doing ok, I had weathered through multiple Solar flares coupled with heatwaves, Cold snaps in the fall that coincided with a Toxic Fallout for about a month of game time.  Food was scarce, but I built some Hydroponics stations to stay fed and ventured outside only when necessary.Fought off a couple minor raids, acquired a few machine guns from the dead.Life is good after the toxic fallout.  Full pantry, 2 geothermal generators indoors to keep warm in winter and supply power,  tons of excess steel, wood, etc for whatever needs building.See a large pack of 8 deer waltz in, 2 older ones, let's harvest the old and top off the freezer.Niklas is a level 13 Shooter armed with a Light Machine Gun, I'm quite certain he can mow these two geriatrics down and we're all set.NOPE.First deer goes down and then the pack gets enraged.  Niklas makes it about 85% of the way home and is knocked unconcious.  Send Makkinen to the rescue.  Makkinen makes it to the front door and is battered to a pulp with Niklas draped over his shoulders.  Front door is now open so I have a multi-buck problem in the living room.  Blitz is armed with an assault rifle, gets one volley off before getting concussed in the hallway, and  Law the doctor is thrown across his bedroom.  Only Komp the brawler armed with a silver mace is alive, and cornered in the foundry.Komp batters 3 deer to death before collapsing in a heap.Minutes later Komp is able to walk and gets the rest of the colony to their beds before collapsing again.Hours pass before the rest of the colony is limping about, banged up but alive.Slowly rebuilding the wrecked interior of the colony and trying to salvage the dropped food and weapons.DROP POD RAID FROM THE LOCAL PIRATES.Armed with frag grenades, sniper and charge rifles, they bust through the weakened doors, mow down my cat Java, my Warg Terror, and my Boomrat, all 5 colonists shredded, steal my @Q#$%! air conditioners for the parts...like seriously? Don't take the 815 silver in the storage room, but take my !@#%!~@#$^@#$^ air conditioners!?!Just buy the game.			"

The only annoying thing about this game thus far, is its still limited in its current state and the stupid automated built roofs… Where are they getting the aluminum or steel for these things?			"

								This game is astonishing. The stories that are created as you struggle to survive everything the game throws at you will stay in your head for a while, from great triumphs to the (more likely) bitter defeats. There's something morbidly satisfying of watching you colony burn to the ground, swarming with raiders, as your colonists bleed out alone on the floor.  Developer is hugely active in both development and community; both through their own website and on reddit's /r/rimworld. Mods are constantly being developed that change the dynamic of your play-style.First game to make me actively weigh the pros and cons of cannibalism. You can harvest human skin and turn it into leather for cowboy hats. Favorite crafter has asthma? Take a prisoner and harvest their lungs. Sure, the prisoner will die, but your crafter can breathe easily again! Or build towards an entirely bionic colony and travel the globe murdering everything in your way. You can just capture them all and sell them into slavery instead, which is a great way to make bank. Although drug production is a rather lucrative option as well, if you're willing to deal with the occasional addicted dog that got into your cocaine stash.You can see average hours of other reviewers, and you can see the fascinating stories. The price does appear a bit steep as you're browsing around the Steam Store, but I, personally, have found it to be worth every penny. That steep price actually led me to download the free* version to make sure I wasn't being swindled by EA promises (oh StarForge, how you've betrayed me). Three hours in, I deleted it and happily bought the official version. Now I'm actually debating on picking up another copy or two to gift to Steam friends, to both further support the developer, and spread the gift of catastrophe.Get it now.*Yeah, there isn't a free version, but I think we all got that.

								Rimworld is easily one of my favorite games. Vanilla RW is polished, engaging, full-featured, and grim. The community is ranked among the best: friendly, helpful, and industrious. Choose from hundreds of mods to greatly expand on the gameplay, enhancing complexity and QoL, and adding more of everything! It feels like the dev works on enhancements to the framework of the game, while the mod community handles filling out the content. This is in my opinion the correct relationship for small or one-man development teams. This will without any doubt be a game I will be playing for many years to come. And it isn't even complete yet!			"

								I've owned RimWorld pre Steam release and for me it's one of the most solid early access purchases I've ever made. Very few bugs coupled with intuitive mechanics make the game a pleasure to play and extremely replayable. The modding scene is alive and the community is active in discussion with reachable devs.But now for something less serious, storytime!:One of my favourite playthroughs I did was on the far north of the world on an ice sheet, nothing grows, there are no animals to hunt.After getting attacked by raiders I turned my colonists into my new unwilling cannibals and began eating everyone who attacked me.Even after getting hydroponics set up I continued eating my foes, ""It will make my people strong!""By the end of the game I was crafting the leather from the raiders into armchairs in my rec room and had a fridge full of human meat.All in all this game allowed me to scar 3 colonists by forcing them to eat human flesh for 2 years, worth every penny!

								I've been playing RimWorld for a very long time. Way before it came out on Steam, I probably have close to 500 hours in the game already off Steam. Personally I think the game is already great and it just keeps getting better and better as more updates come out. I very rarely encounter any bugs and when I do they barely have an effect on the gameplay. The modding community is great, people are constantly hard at work to create bigger and better mods. From what I've seen the staff is fantastic as well. If you're worried this game is going to be another one of those early access games that take all your money and then cease development don't be. It's been in steady development for years and it's going to keep going for quite some time.			"

								Sawyer looked after every one. Her last two friends ultimately succumbed to their wounds in their beds while she desperately tended to their dying needs. Overcome with grief, she decided to exact revenge on the prisoner they kept in the holding cell. She quickly executed the prisoner and left the corpse where it was.For the next few days she was dead to the world as she slept to heal from the wound incurred from the last raid. Unbeknownst to her, a basket of berries had kept the cold storage room door ajar and the last of her food had spoilt. Though she could have resolved to start over and rebuild, she said ""$&# it"" and headed to the prisoner's cell.A few days later, this message:Sawyer, Doctor has gone berserk! The final straw was: Ate corpse.Sawyer was last seen running into the woods, engaging in melee combat with a boomalope.I hate/love this game.			"

								If you like any kind of strategy / sim / survival (hell, even space) games, BUY RIMWORLD ! It is amazing how much ""game"" you get for the money.. And it is done by one dude ! Tywin Lannister ! (Or something like that). And big kudos for that ! It is amazingly detailed, but still very easy to get right. Especially with the new tutorial and learner in v.0.15.  And yes you maybe think its just Prison Architect in space... But after 10 min. of playing you quickly see, that Rimworld is very different from PA... But don't buy it for the graphics.. It its nice to look at and there are no glitches or bugs, but you dont play the game because of beautiful graphics.. You play because there is just soooo much stuff you can do !Oh and... Install some mods for it ! It only makes the game better and more enjoyable. Worth every penny ! 9 / 10			"

								Rimworld is exceptional because the developers have had their ear to the community of players for 14 alpha releases.The actual experience can be described as ""story of woe generator"" because each game you play turns into an epic drama of survival and hardship, usually progressing to tragedy.  Yes, you can play the easy basebuilder mode and just learn how to create a mega colony, but thats not where your best hours will be in this game.Check out Ludeon's forums where players tell stories of how their colonists had to resort to cannibalism to survive an epic cold snap that wiped out their crops.  How they captured raiding tribesmen, and harvested their organs to save a sick member of the colony.  How a small herd of Alpacas went mad and attacked a fledgling colony, ultimately burning it to the ground.  My most recent game included a pair of colonists who were madly in love with each other.  However, one of the lovers had a crazy sister.  Social time was a little awkward up until the wedding.  The Ceremony was beautiful and the attendees went to bed with a large buff to their mood.   Then, the sister went mad with rage and set the colony on fire while everyone else was sleeping.  10/10 will bring popcorn to the next episode of ""What insane way will my colony fail today?""			"

								I have had this game for over two years now and it finally just got released on steam. Here is what I can say:The Good: The charecter design allows greater resources to be poured into the game systems making them very complex. Multiple levels of difficulty allow the player to decide if they want to play a ""basebuilder"" game or go full blown survival mode. Fairly smart AI strategies when raiding the player. AI director keeps things ""exciting"". Allot of love and care went into the social sytems in the game. People have emotions, needs, dependencies, realistic relationships, backstories, and skills. Fairly transparent feedback from the devolper. I am rarely dissapointed because expectations are always set correctly.The Bad: Sometimes the balance of this game can be brutal. Although the random elements have been cut down a bit,♥♥♥♥♥♥can get bad real fast. Releases can take a long time (please refer to my transparency point above, it makes this less of an issue) After years it still seems colonists will rather roll around in filth and almost starve to death while happily chopping trees or mining rather then proactivaely collecting some food or cleaning the blood off the floor They could do allot more with the different colonies and clans you interact with. There are no politics between clans other than a number which increases or decrease how much they like you by the actions you take.It was worth $30 then and it's certainly worth it now.			"

								So I create my first world and I start naming the characters my friends names and my name also.  I tried to match the traits closest to my friends and we got pretty good results.  But that's not what I am going to talk about.  So one of my colonists was a really good shooter and they had a trait that made then a super good shot but take extra time.  I didn't think much, but what I noticed is that they were really inaccurate.  I was so confused about this because a lot of the shots he took weren't even hard shots. K, enough of that back to the story.One day my character, Adam, became unstable because of the heat and I have been rejected so many times and I lose it.  I start attacking a rat and some of the other colonists.  Matt comes to the rescue and lands 2 really hard consecutive shots.  I was complaining because I don't know why he couldn't do that before with a darn beaver.Matt then rescues me and puts me in a medical bed where I then learn that his shots blew off both of my legs!  So I had no legs and that put my character in an uncomfortable situation.  Since Matt was also our best doctor I told him to do an operation to put 2 peg legs on me.  He puts the first peg leg on with ease but the second one was a whole different situation.  While putting in the left peg leg he somehow managed to take out my lung and failed the operation.  I just lost it at this point because I was so confused how you took out a lung instead of put a peg leg on!  Those are 2 totally different parts of the body.  I ignored it.Fast forward time to like a season later.  Some cobras attacked us and Matt came out to save us.  I was melee attacking the cobras while Matt was sniping them from far away.  Matt missed one of his shots and it hit me.  It hit my torso and caused me to pass out.I quit that world and started another one.  We got to have Matt and Adam on the roster again for this world.  So Matt became emotionally unstable early on in this world, so I shot him.  I guess my character wants revenge on this world.This game is great though.  For an Early Access Game this is like one of the best you can get.  I definately recommend it!			"

								I started this game and before I knew it 10 hours had passed.  My first play through was a disaster, but it was a disaster that was so engrossing that I couldn't look away.  TL:DR Buy the game.To me the whole story was about Mary or ""Mars"" as everyone called her. She was stranded on this planet with her son and a rough looking miner who had an eye for her. They sat up a colony by the side of a lake until a soldier named Jack radioed for help. The colonists of Laketown rescued him and patched his wounds. Mars and Jack fell in love almost instantly. Jack was the backbone of the colony and made sure everything ran smoothly, Mars was proud to love a man like that. One bright day, Jack stumbled into some ruins filled with mechanized warriors. They were hostile and chased him back to the colony. One by one the colonists fell, until only Mars and a girl named AJ were left. They were able to finish off the robots and to try to treat the wounds of the other colonists. It was pointless though, all the medicine was gone and there were no traders in the area. The first cassuality was her son, he got an infection in his leg, then Jack, her beloved Jack, then the rough space miner had to be euthanized because of a shattered spine, AJ did that, she never liked him and got a little pleasure out of it, Mars thought she was sick. That was the breaking point for Mars, she snapped and killed all of the other colonist, suffering mortal wounds as she did. Mars died alone in her bed, insane with grief. They say when you visit the lake on a quite night, you can hear Mars, her son and Jack all laughing and playing horse shoes, united together again.			"

								Most of my complaints are not about the game itself, but some of the misleading reviews. They're quick to compare RimWorld to Dwarf Fortress, but it honestly seems like most of them have just heard of it in passing and don't want to be teased for not knowing what a dwarven atom smasher is. RimWorld is somewhere between Prison Architect and Dwarf Fortress in complexity, and would best be explained as diet, caffeine-free, dolphin-safe Dwarf Fortress in a nice-looking can just as willing to run your colony into the ground with misfortune you can't help but laugh at.The tutorials aren't the best, but if you're relying on those to teach you how to play, you're going to have a bad time. Take some time to explore the menus available to you and the map around you. There are no Z-levels, so you're stuck playing on and gathering resources from only one plane. Steel is not produced as an alloy, but gathered from salvage and compacted steel, the latter of which is dug out from any terrain you might happen to have on the surface.And the game really doesn't need multiplayer, not that there is any at the time of this review. Honestly, that's just a recipe for disaster in a colony management game like this. If you want multiplayer, roll the same seed as your friend and pick the same starting zone, then compare how you both do.So I guess I recommend it if you really like colony management games, because this one is already more finished than most of the ones on Steam. Not entirely certain about dropping 30$ on it, but I figured I've been spoiled by enough sales that I don't mind playing full price to give a game like this a go.			"

To give you an example I'll tell a little story about one of my latest endavours on one of these unforgiving Rimworlds.Quellin was a happy place, tucked away in a little alcove with a plenty of food, clothing and weaponry. Most of the colonists were as happy as they'd ever be. Fred and Marcia were enjoying the company of their Yorkshire terriers and their collegues all had their duties in and around the little settlement.One day, Fred went out hunting and had set his eyes on the white-wooled Muffalo, as he'd seen a large herd the day before, at least eleven of them, not too far to the south. He set out with his trusty greatbow and managed to get a hit in but then disaster struck, the Muffalos turned on him and before he even managed to turn around he was getting swarmed by five of them while the rest was making their way north, towards the settlement. Most of the people there were still unsuspecting of any danger and even though a few archers had been set out as sentries, the town was soon overrun. Fred's body was nothing more than a meaty pulp and along the way Martin, who had a bad back, was overrun by the wooly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, knocking him out cold and leaving him to die as the set out for more violence. Bashing down the front door of my main recreational space and catching yet another colonist off-guard. The two Terriers weren't afraid of these brutes and they charged in, biting at the bovine's ankles but apart from spilling a few drops of blood it was to no avail, both of them became scraps on the muffalo's hooves long before the first one fell to a well placed arrow by an enraged Marcia, losing her husband was the first blow and the loss of her favorite furry friend pushed her over the edge. She charged out and managed to take down one of the invaders but soon joined her husband in the afterlife.The remaining inhabitants were hiding in the cooler, plenty of food and double doors would keep them happy for a while, at least, if the bloodthirsty herbivores would ever leave. I let time run by for a few days but the beasts were unforgiving and were dead-set on wiping out the hunters, in retribution to the death of their kin I suppose.How gruesome all of this may seem, I enjoyed every second of it and reminded me that this game is relentless.I love it.

Early Access Review
								RimWorld is like Steam Early Access: a black hole from which nothing escapes. This game is an absolute diamond that wasn't on my radar at all, but has fully enthralled me for way longer than it should have. RimWorld is all about managing a colony of people whom you will get to know and love or hate.Before you begin a game, RimWorld presents you with a randomized selection of colonists. Each of these folks has a varying skill proficiency list which includes basic skills like Cleaning, Hauling, and Harvesting or more advanced skills like Medicine, Crafting, and Warden (Sheriff). Along with a skillset, your colonists may also have other traits such as Pyromania, Drug Addictions, and even old injuries. Just as you would assume traits can have quite an effect on your colonist, sometimes for better and yet other times for worse.There are several biomes in which you can land in (or migrate to if starting as Tribals) and colonize all of which have positives and negatives. Are you in a boreal forest location? Winter will come eventually and your people need warm clothes and warm rooms if they are to survive without complaint. Did you pick a desert? Most of the year you'll have to combat high temperatures and a lack of some materials that would be plentiful elsewhere.When you decide your initial band of survivors and colony location, you'll be dropped into the game proper. Immediately your group is in dire straits: you need shelter and food. Luckily RimWorld is populated with many different types of materials with which to build and much in the way of things to eat.Besides constructing actual buildings for your pawns to live in there are also different crafting stations that allow the creation of various items like weapons and armor to clothes and drugs. If you are feeling a little country, you can try your hand at farming crops and tending animals. Electricity is another option and there are several ways to generate it as well as several ways to expend it including colored lights and television.After you get your colony up and running, your chosen A.I. will start throwing you curve-balls depending on your difficulty choices. Random events will occur and they can range from a raid by Pirates who definitely want that booty to wandering packs of animals that will join you or attempt to eat you.RimWorld is incredibly fun when things are going as you plan. However the game really shines when it is able to exploit a flaw in your colony setup. When you first lose a colonist, it is a painful experience. The next hundred lives lost don't go by any easier. Many may be tempted to simply start a new colony or reload a save game, but these losses are where the player learns how to deal with and react to each situation. Without the possibility of loss, the game would have little substance. That being said, there is a generous amount of frustration here for those unwilling or unable to let go of their village people and animals. Luckily we can construct tombs with which to honor their sacrifice.I was not an early backer for RimWorld. I learned of it's existence shortly after it arrived on Steam. Kotaku had a RimWorld article about some guy's crazy naked doctor that ate people and I knew I needed this, damn whatever flaws it would have being Alpha. This is the most complete game in Early Access that I have ever played. It is more complete than many AAA games that we pay twice the price for. However this is something that people need to understand: there are features still being added. When a major patch is put out, your progress up to that point is made invalid without some workaround. While that does suck, a major patch usually means a new feature or two so it is a bittersweet thing at worst.			"

								My settlers were all complaining about not having a house, so I said fine. lets make a house. As I was building them a nice wooden house one of the settlers dogs decided to run off and get mauled by a panther. This made the owner of the dog depressed so he went around lighting♥♥♥♥♥♥on fire, Just like any sane person would do whilst coping with the death of a beloved pet. He ended up burning down the house that I had just built them. I dont know whether to laugh or cry.			"

								Rimworld is a awesome game, I definetly recommend it. Rimworld is a colony-managing game where you start with one or more colonists, you do not get tutorials or anything so you have to play the game without any tutorials. Another thing is the combat. I like the idea where colonists and other NPCs will take cover behind walls and sandbags to reduce injury, which is pretty cool. The game is awesome. You can build your colony however you want it to be. And your colonists will live there. Pretty awesome game!			"

								Rimworld is easily one of my favorite games. Vanilla RW is polished, engaging, full-featured, and grim. The community is ranked among the best: friendly, helpful, and industrious. Choose from hundreds of mods to greatly expand on the gameplay, enhancing complexity and QoL, and adding more of everything! It feels like the dev works on enhancements to the framework of the game, while the mod community handles filling out the content. This is in my opinion the correct relationship for small or one-man development teams. This will without any doubt be a game I will be playing for many years to come. And it isn't even complete yet!			"

								I sat there at the foot of my friends bed as he was awaiting operation to put an eyepatch over his left eye. He would always say how it would hurt because it was exposed, but this was the day, this was the day that his eye was covered with a leather eyepatch. I felt bad because since it was the first eyepatch I had ever made, it was safe to assume that no one knew how to slide it on to his head. Anyways, I sat there as steve comes in with the eye patch and some herbal medicine. I asked Steve ""Is the medicine really necessary? You onl..."" and that's where he cut me off with the words that will haunt me till this day, ""Trust me, I'm a doctor."" He gets out his dice and rolls a one. He then proceeds to stab my friend Dan in the stomach with a surgical knife and punctures his kidney then proceeds to massacre then he apparently stabs himself in some way. My friend is dead and the doctor's wounds are infected because we don't have anymore medicine.10/10 would recommend.But in all honesty the game is a super fun time killer that has constant replay value especially the workshop mods. Definitely one of my favorite games. Just keep an eye out for Steve. That son of a ♥♥♥♥♥.R.I.P Dan Dec 7, 2016 - Dec 11, 2016			"

								This game is awesome!I've been playing since the early Alphas and boy it has evolved into such a great game. It does not have all the complexity of Dwarf Fortress which it is obviously based on, but it is no pushover either. The mod support is great and the only thing I really find to be missing is the possibility to play on multiple Z-Levels. That being said, I simply adore this game and, though I do tire of it from time to time, I continually find myself coming back to it when looking for a good fun game to play. I don't think I will ever stop playing this game.Though the price right now may seem a little steep at first when you look at the store page, know that if you want a Dwarf fortress-like game that doesn't dissapoint you, this is probably one of your best bets and worth the price.TL:DR I love this this game and recommend it to anyone that likes prison architect and/or Dwarf Fortress.

								I've been playing RimWorld since Jan 2014 and I can't recommend it enough. It's like playing a top down version of the Sims only 100x better. :) You start out with a few colonists and start building up the colony from there. You will be utilizing various different types of people, which don't always get along.Each playthrough is a unique story and you'll likely be relating the story to people around you. My friend and I have swapped RimWorld stories over lunch at Taco Bell many many times. The stories are created by you, but also by the story telling AI. It keeps an eye on everything you're doing and throws little curves your way to bring you down a bit or help you a long if you are struggling. There are various different types of story tellers and various difficulties in each style you choose. With the steam release and Steam Workshop integration, using Mods and shared scenarios will be easier than ever.  I honestly can't recommend this game enough. If you like base building or management games you'll love RimWorld.			"

								One of the best purchases in a long time. Lots of fun, replayability thanks to huge number of combinations of storyteller+biomes, ""5 more minutes"" addictive, if you are a roleplayer then even more replyability thanks to combining also possible scenarios and starting colonists to create endless stories.With alpha 16 the addition of caravans, world exploration and multiple colonies it provides even more colony management depth and fun.Play on permadeath. It is as fun to fail as not to.It lacks and endgame purpose but mind that this is an early alpha access game so it can be expected that content will be addedd to address that. Even with this lacking point, this game as of Alpha 16 is a content full as some AAA titles on release.Go buy it now and help this developer finish this masterpiece.			"

Don't get me wrong : The current alpha release maybe is more stable than most of 'Release Candidate' AAA titles on day-1 (not to mention the mandatory 6Gb patch ;) ).I've spent a few months on Alpha13, and had the most refreshing experience playing a game since a really looong time.Thanks to you Tynan (and Team) for such a great game, best wishes for the final product!Regards.

								Let me tell you a love story about Angus(M) and Pitts(F).After  establishing what I consider to be a 'OK' base I realize Angus is starting to have a lot of breakdowns. The caring and loving man that I am I find out Angus is getting rejected by Pitts for marriage. Poor guy, so I make him a completely seperate house so he never has to see that who**res face again as Pitts shows no remorse for her actions. After one of his constant breakdowns (I still don't know if he was asking her everyday or what) he goes nuts, not about Pitts but BECAUSE HE ATE FOOD WITHOUT A TABLE! So after my hunter smashes his face in I decide Angus is too much trouble for his worth and let him die as a horrible infection spread throughout his body.Now for the happy ending, I decide because Pitts thought it was cool to play hard to get she has to eat Angus's flesh which turns her crazy (she was 'sad' Angus died, lying dou**che). Hunter (I think his name was Lester?) smashes her face too, and then strips down and starts walking around because he wasn't a big fan of being used as a modern day executioner. I think this game has a pretty accurate outlook on modern day relationships, best dating sim 2016.			"

								This is a drama generator disguised as a game. You could just go through the motions and play this challenging survival game. Or you could take a few moments to actually read about the characters you are playing with and watch the story unfold.In one game, an overweight male cook crash lands on a RimWorld with two naked female sex slaves. The women are constantly frustrated at their lack of clothes. Mr. Cook is constantly hitting on the girls and trying to get lucky, and is constantly rejected. The girls who have the necessary survival skills between them (except cooking) ignore the cook's advances. The cook eventually goes insane and runs around in a crazy stupor until he eventually starves to death. The girls who cannot cook eventually get depressed over having to eat the corpses of animals they hunted raw and end up fighting. The one with medical skills is knocked out. The survivor has no medical or hunting skills. They both starve to death...In another game a family consisting of a daughter who is a researcher with some medical skills, her mother the botanist, and the ex husband/father who was a soldier, crash land near the pole with their pet Husky. The botanist can't do anything without a hydroponic set up as nothing grows in the cold and ice. The mother can also cook. The daughter can hunt and cook. And the father can build a shelter. They manage to build a small, heated space and have plans to create an indoor hydroponic set up to feed themselves as there are very few things to hunt out on the ice.Then the daughter is attacked by a polar bear while hunting a rabbit. The father rescues her. While she is in bed recovering, the father and mother can't take the stress of being in such close company anymore and start fighting. The mother is injured. The father has no medical skills. The daughter gets an infection which can't be treated and gets gradually worse. There's a short in the battery room and power is knocked out - with no power there's no heat. Mother - with some medical skills - gets hypothermia. Father can't repair the battery as there's no metal left, and the daughter had the mining skills. Besides - the polar bears are still out there...Eventually food runs out - the daughter dies of her infection. The mother dies of hypothermia. The father can't bear to eat the corpses of his family and starves to death. The dog survives by eating their corpses. Eventually, a wanderer stumbles upon the settlement. He figures he could just live there, mine some metal and fix the hydroponic set up. There's no food, but he has no problem with eating this frozen human protein lying around. He survives for days, repairs the battery compartment, and is re-buidling the hydroponics.A few days later an escape pod crashes near the shelter. The old man rescues the young woman - the girl of his dreams! He locks her in a room while she recovers, hoping to woo her and convince her to stay with him, that cannibalism isn't all that bad and that people are actually quite tasty. But she rejects him. Eventually he goes insane from digging up the frozen corpses and butchering them, and in his madness he attacks the dog. The dog incapacitates him outside the shelter, and the old man - unable to get back inside - freezes to death. The young woman locked in her cell starves to death...10/10 would turn cannibal and abduct women again!			"

								Rimworld is astonishingly fun and addictive for an Early Access game.  Don't let the relatively simple graphics fool you (though they're certainly less abstract than, say, Dwarf Fortress which Rimworld is frequently likened to) ... the game feels quite immersive.  It becomes very easy to empathize with your colonists as individuals, to feel pride in their skill level, to want to please them by providing for their comfort in their bedrooms and ensuring proper entertainment.  Starting from scratch, you have to act quickly to build shelter and beds, get crops going and build production stations for cooking food, producing clothing and weapons, crafting art and building a variety of goods for trade when the traders come.There are threats galore, of course -- pirate raiders, hostile primitive tribes, manhunter-maddened animals and disasters both manmade (toxic fallout) and natural (volcanic eruptions).The gameplay and the characters are complex, and its easy to lose all track of real-life time.This game has been absolutely dominating my gameplay time for over a year already (I bought the game back in Alpha 7 days; this review is a few days following Alpha 14 and the initial Steam launch).  I definitely recommend it!			"

								This is the story of the badass Barkeeper. 3  pods crashed to the surface of a Rimworld. One of them was known as Clark Hendrix, or as I like to call him, ""The bad♥♥♥♥♥Barkeep"". Along with him was Lu, a former servant, and  Watson, a Vatgrown Solider. They started a colony. One day, as everything was going smoothly, Hendrix attempted to woo Lu. lu rejected him, and he was hurt. Now, let me tell you something about Hendrix. What he wants, he gets. So, maybe a day passes, and he's at it again, trying to woo Lu. This time, he succeeds. A few days pass, and a man by the name of Thompson comes to live in the colony. Thompson was... A simple man. very simple. A hard worker, and he absouloutly despised technology. But, he was nonetheless an important part of the colony. In the end, though, Thompson died of an infection. The reason behinde this was probably because of that cut he had gotten in a recent skirmish with the wildlife, beavers to be more presise. He was honored, and placed in a sarcaufugus. Hendrix made it himself, considering he was Thompsons closest friend. Some more days pass, and a ship crashs, and a non-vilonet man named Scizo or something is found in a crash. Though he's completly irrelevant because even though he was saved he ultimatley left without giving two ♥♥♥♥s about the resources these people had used in hopes of him joining them. But, yet another pod crashed, and this one carrying the most useless person anyone could have ever met. A man by the name of Isov. Isov had a weird entitlement about him. he felt he didn't need to do ANY LABOR AT ALL. So occaitionaly he would help Watson with reasearch, and help train Raymond, the pet warg. But when it came down to it, Isov was the most useless human being in existance. Though, that didn't stop Hendrix from befriending him anyways. Hendrix was, by any means, a people person. He was a hunter too. And a fighter when the colony needed him to be. Now, a new day begins, and there is a woman on the comms channel, a criminal surgeon by the name of Toni. She needed some help getting away from a local tribe by the name of ""The Orange Plain Nation"". So Hendrix had her come, for he knew they were in desperate need of a medical practitioner. Her attackers, a male warrior, and a lesbian who absouloutly despised men. Hendrix, getting everyone into formation, repels the attackers. He bravly shoots down warrior, while the lesbian attacks the colony's solar pannel. She flees, when she realizes that her scum partner is dead. Hendrix leads the charge and scares her off for good. In the time after that, Hendrix found himself doing more for the colony, such as building a heater for Toni's room, and growing crops. But then, one day, a herd of angry boar enter the area. Hendrix knows what he must do. He gathers Watson and Lu, who are the only other two in the colony with guns, and they fight off the boar. When Hendrix realized that his, at this time, fiance'a(However you spell that) Lu was going to be killed by a boar, he bravely swooped in and meleed the boar to death, while 2 more boar fight him. He managed to knock one unconsiouns, but the other boar, oh, that ♥♥♥♥ing other boar, killed Hendrix. Watson, in complete rage killed the boar and all other boars in the area. In the days afterwards, a steel sarcophagus was made to honor Hendrix, and all his contributions to the colony. Without him, the colony may very well have died. Though it isn't a happy ending for anyone, especially Lu, who finnaly broke after Hendrix died. She went on a fire starting spree, but before she could, Watson arrested her. Now shes gone insane in that prison, and people wander if she'll ever get better. As for Watson and Isov, they have contracted some sort of disease, and it is feared they may very well die from it, leaving Toni to a colony full of bad memories, and an insane woman who may never recover.So, that's my story after playing ""Rimworld"". I am still playing on that save, still kind of want to see is Watson and Isov will pull through or not, but I doubt it. Heck, maybe I'll get lucky and Watson will live while Isov dies a very painful death, and he can refelct on how being a self-entitled ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turns out in the end. Hope you enjoyed reading, I am having and will continue to have, a great time with this game, and I hope you might to, if you decide to get the game!			"

								Well,after all this time,I don't remember a good enough story to tell. But,there was this one time where I led a group of tribals,and gave the leader an A.I chip,Bionic arms and legs,all Synthetic organs... Hell,if I saw that guy,I'd run and tell my faction to worship him. Besides,everyone who fought him ended up casually persuaded to join or shot to death by powerful,futuristic weapons.EDIT:New story! After seeing chapter one of Rock Paper Shotgun's ""Bogdan's Rest"" I made Big Boss Hotel. With a LOT of mods,including Glittertech and more furniture,fashionrimsta,and MORE,I built a massive hotel in a Boreal Forest inside of a hotel. We had Kevin ""Boss"" Lewis,with great social skills,Craig Boone,who keeps talking about how his wife is dead,but then shoots millions more to death,and Shauna ""Food"" Gray,who makes food. We quickly made a grand entrance hall,and right above the entrance,we made a massive power room.  To the left,we dug further into the corner and built our rec center,where our first infestation was. Boss beat some bugs to death with his baton,but Boone came in and killed the rest in around one shot while Food ran outside and hid behind a tree. We then dug below the rec room,and expanded to the rooms. The first 2 were guest rooms,and the next 2 were for staff. Staff rooms were larger and had colours based on the personality and name of the character. We dug so far down,and then came our first visitors! They were a group of Outlanders and had some good stuff to trade. They all went into thier rooms. One guy brought some drugs,he began smoking flake,then died. He overdosed or something. We happily took his stuff,and when Boone was wearing his jacket,noone suspected a thing. After a while,they left,and were so amazed they turned over the rest of thier drugs to us! Remember kids,don't do drugs,give them to random strangers!1 season LaterARK! GET AT THE DOOR! BOONE! GRAB THE RIFLE! COOKE! GET OUT THERE!Fourty Rhinoceri outside,bashing at the doors,invading Teh Coive (Our stockpile) and bashing our Enmergency Exit. Boone one shots them all,until they blindly run away to maul a caribous. Cooke charges out there and shoots the legs off of 3 of the beasts. They fall over as Ark guards the entrance,blindly firing her assault rifle at the monsters. Our turrets finally regain power from the solar flare,and mow down the rhinos. As the others begin to wander off,as they've gotten bored of death,we all rush back in and go to the hospital. Down below,a prison break occurs. The Pirate Leader we captured has decided enough is enough. With his useless Lackey,Justin,they break out and grab some wood from a nearby room,under construction. Boss rushes to deal with them,as he is our noble warden. He whacks Maker on his head,and as Justin draws near,Boss flees upward to get more reinforcements. Our pregant,and brave dog,Taffy,charges forth. She bites Maker's arm,and he whacks her tail and legs with his wood. Maker,in a smidge of pain,takes a bow from an equipment locker in a room,and shoots Taffy. She dies in one hit. Her middle-stage fetus,is never shown the beauty of this world. In a fit of rage,Boss charges Maker and beats him senseless. He knocks him over,he falls in pain. Justin,in fear that his beloved boss was struck down,rushes back to his cell. Later,we put Taffy in a Sarcophagus. Maker recovers and stays in his cell,as the hated Dog-Killer. Our colony mourns the death of Taffy still. The save continues on to this day.     Get RimWorld today for many great stories and tales of drama,action,bloodshed,and Romance!			"

								I played this game already for countless hours before the steam release and I'm still doing so.it won't get boring, one of the advantages of a large and very good modding community. You will alway find new challenges to master. Make sure to visit the forums though, you won't find all the good mods on steam.In general, I can highly recommend this to any player who likes base building games, with a lot of strategic decisions mixed with the strong survival aspect of the game.As most of the reviews mentioned, there are a many similarities to ""Prison Architect"", due to the angled top down view and the the building system ( single blocks, put together to build your desired colony / prison ).I played some Prison Architect, but I never really enjoyed it, so I can say I like RimWorld a lot better!You can play your colony simply as a base builder, recruit people and have a prospering place to live. Or you can go hardcore, fight against nature and hostile factions. There is surely a setup you will enjoy. From basebuilder to real struggle to survive is everything included. This game offers you a real challenge if you are up to it!Theres is a lot of detail to the game and your colonists. Social interactions with other colonists, ranging from hate to marriage. A health system where you can lose and replace limbs and organs. Individual traits for the colonists making them a super soldier, doc or that guy who is always on the edge to a mental break.The combat system is divided into melee and ranged and you can get into big and epic firefights when 20 pirates start to raid your colony and you have to defend against them. You can set up your defensive system over the whole map and generate a new layout never seen before.Set up a big prison wing to keep all the prisoners, captured during enemy raids and convince them to join you.There are not only human threats, but also mechanoids, advanced killing machines, which can be the end to an unprepared colony. Nature itself can make it a struggle to feed everybody, when the sun is covered for months during a volcanic winter. Or a solar flare disables your heaters when its -60°C outside.A lot can happen and there is enough material for a very good story.This can make your first start a bit tricky, but over the course of time you will learn to deal with each situation and I'm sure at some point, there will be another great colony somewhere in the endless vastness of space ... There are complaints about the lack of multiplayer, but I think they are unjustified. There is no real need for it. However, I can agree that I would enjoy to visit or raid other colonies, AI or not. It goes hand in hand with the fact, that you are currently restricted to the piece of land where you start. There is no possibility to take a few colonist and wander off to start another colony on the same planet ( a generated map from where you can choose your start biome ). This would allow you to trade and do all the interactional stuff and I would love to see that.Always keep in mind that this is still an Alpha version and that there is a lot of time to implement mechanics into the game.I give a lot of credit to the developer, he keeps every new version perfectly playable. With each update there is new content to explore.If you are still not sure whether you should buy this game, there are a lot of videos about it. I already made several Let's Plays myself with various setups. You can check out the newest one here:

								I won' t lie to you : I've never managed to get my colonists to hop on the ship and lift-off... Yet, I've been slaughtered in so many different fun ways, that I can't refrain from trying again and again :)RimWorld shows a very robust gameplay, and lots of potential. Don't get me wrong : The current alpha release maybe is more stable than most of 'Release Candidate' AAA titles on day-1 (not to mention the mandatory 6Gb patch ;) ).I've spent a few months on Alpha13, and had the most refreshing experience playing a game since a really looong time.Thanks to you Tynan (and Team) for such a great game, best wishes for the final product!Regards.

								Don't be fooled by the prison architect style graphics this game is NOT PA.I bought this game almost 2 years ago through Ludeon's website.I played the game for a few months on and off back when I bought it. Just picked it up the other day when it hit Steam. And holy **** this game has improved immensely! Literally every aspect of the game has been imporived drasdtically since I last played.I have emailed them 2-3 in the past when I had a poblem getting the game working on Linux and 2 days ago when I couldn't get my steam key. They have replied to my emails within 1-2 hours every time. Not only is this an amazing game that I'm extremely excited is finally on Steam, but the main man behind it is geniuinely a great guy.Head over to the Ludeon forums if you want to see what I'm talking about.

								Although Steam tells you something different, I have bought this game soon after it's Kickstarter campaign and easily collected over 100 hours of playtime in the past three years. I can say that this was literally the game I waited for without knowing it when I first saw it. While it has an excellent presentation it gives you the complete freedom of choice how to develop your colony on the one hand, but also an ultimate goal, building a spaceship, on the other.Before you keep on reading a word to the few negative reviews from new players: Yes, this is a complex game. As someone said on the discussions: ""It's not a FPS where you start on heroic difficulty becasue you know shooters."" It's a game with many mechanics you will have to learn before beeing good at it, I recommend enableing the adaptive tutorial to learn the basic systems. It's also a very slow paced game with eventual peaks in form of raids or such. The two hours you have to decide if you want to refund are not nearly enough to see all the facades of the game and get a complete picture of it. Now on to the positives.Wether you want to build an underground complex or a large fortress, all stragtegies are viable and have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you need to hold a large base you will have lots of walls which you need to defend and the enemy may break through at different locations. But while you can keep your entry small and defendable if you go underground, you eventually will have to fight bug hives which can spread sub-surface and enemies which are equipped with granades and pickaxes in order to dig their way to you.The incredible amount of replayability also thrives from the different biomes and the recently added scenario system. Each of the eight climatic environments has unique weather, animals, diseases and challenges. The scenarios give you the ability to never play twice with the same starting condition, may it be the number of colonists, items and conditions of the map or forced cannibalism.There is also an active mod community which has specialised on vanilla- and lore friendly mods that truely expand the game to it's full potential. Every veteran will be able to give you a list of some length with mods that he/she considers necessary to play the game. Of course it's not unplayable without mods but they do add many quality-of-life improvements which make playing the game easier.Many people ask why they should pay 30$ for an early access title. Bear in mind that the early access is there to indicate that the game is still beeing worked on. However it has met all his goals, is polished, optimized and generally bug-free. You are basically looking at a finished game which will get expanded in the future and thus is marked as an early access. The developer, Tynan Sylvester, who made this game almost on his own, usually releases new mayor builds every three to four months, introducing new and basic game mechanics, like the scenario system, but we will have to see how steam dynamic will change this. If there are bugs which survived the extensive testing phase, you can count on a hotfix beeing published within days.RimWorld is what it says: a story generator. Usually I'm very suspicious about games who claim that, but in this case it is totally correct. Stories on the forums range from prisoners getting torn apart in order to sell their organs to colonists which give their lives in a heroic last stand to save the colony. If you're not sure, head over to the  stories forum [ludeon.com] and read one or two to a glass of your favourite relaxing drink.Anyone who has an interest in strategy, building and/or science fiction should buy this game and probably wont be disappointed.

								This game is awesome. It has no story, because you make it. If you want to name all your colonists off spongebob characters you can, and sooner or later you'll find patrick getting malaria, spongebob and plankton getting married, and sandy going into a mental daze, running outside in the middle of winter naked and proceeding to fight a bear with nothing but her bare hands. That all happened to me in this game, and is why i love it. Every new start i made has a new adventure which i can't describe. If you want to see your favourite cartoon characters being mauled by bears, fighting diseases and falling in love, get this game, because its awesome.			"

								I don't think I could possibly say enough about this game.  It definitely earns its Overwhelmingly Positive rating in my books.Don't be fooled by its simplistic 2D look.  There's surprisingly a lot that is hidden under the hood.  For a survival colony simulator, this one has an enormous amount of detail.  Also, don't let the Early Access tag throw you off of buying now.  This game is surpisingly mature even now and is remarkably complete despite being in Early Access.It covers all of the bases when it comes to basic survival against nature... climate (whether it be too hot or cold, or even uninhabitable due to some other factor like toxic fallout), hunting and growing food, finding sources of power, heat, and refrigeration for food storage, etc.  Then it throws in the added things like raider attacks, or attacks by mechanoids, among a huge list of other possible events.  But part of the additional appeal is that this game manages to simulate the personalities and mental states of every living creature on the map.  Not only do you have to worry about keeping your colonists well fed, happy, living together peacefully, and from going nuts, but there's also the chance that you may, at some point have to defend yourself from one or more animals that suddenly go mad (like a herd of squirrels... I'm not joking).The game does such a good job emulating the personalities of the individual colonists, I actually found I was getting attached to my colonists.  I cheered them on as they developed relationships among each other, some of which eventually led to marriages.  I would sometimes curse at them when they didn't do what I expected.  I was always leery of any newcomers.... like the pyromaniac girl I saved who was going through drug withdrawal symptoms who kept going nuts and starting fires all over the place.  But I nursed her through her rough time and she became one of the leading members of my colony.But besides all of that, it also allows you to run your colony how you like to.  If you're fed up with running a colony based on the morals/laws of current society, and would rather have a colony entirely made up of nudist cannibals, then go for it!  I know I used to run a pretty straight forward colony except that if I were attacked by raiders and survived, I would patch up any surviving raiders and sell them off as slaves and butcher the dead ones to feed to my livestock.  That is, of course, if the cannibals among the members of my colony could keep their hands off the human meat long enough for me to turn it into kibble.All in all, I generally have a hard time really getting into a game and sticking with it for a long time, but with this one I've put over 300 hours of game play (as of the time I write this) into this game so far.  It was extremely easy to become addicted.  Every day brought new events and new adventures.Extreme thumbs up for this one!			"

								Incredible, Gave me many hours of enjoyment and many hours of entertainment and anger.This game is extremely unforgiving when it comes to making mistakes, you have little room for mistakes. Due to the fact that the disater system is random, it could seem like you never get a break in between each problem, or too far apart. So it makes you prepare ahead for anything. There are a few crashes here and there, but the game is easy to load up again so it is not a big deal.You get very attached to your colonists, so when one of them may die, it kind of breaks your heart.Anyway, I ended up beating the game and shipping my colonists off to find a glitterworld planet or even onto another planet to start all over again. So now I am sad that they are all gone and wont be playing for a little while :(			"

								If you want to step up your casual gaming from The Sims series to something more extreme, RimWorld is it. It's as difficult as Dwarf Fortress, but there are easier difficulties (and three different 'storytellers' that control what happens) that you could pretend like you're playing The Sims. Plus, there's no household cap of 8! Anyone that survives, crashing into your colony - or enemies you capture from a raid - you can *convince* them to join your colony and become a part of the family. :)  Once you're comfortable with observing your Sims, I mean, colonists get cozy - bump up the difficulty for hordes of your neighbors, space pirates, and even space alien robots. No one could make fun of you for that. Yes, sure, you can make people into hats.			"

								This review might not be very professional but honestly if your into managment builders this is one of the best. There have been a few days when I have been free to play and I have played 10+ hours straight, I didn't eat those few separate days and didn't even realize it! With the amazing mods available the gameplay is even deeper and more rewarding! The only con is the game does have horrid memory issues depending on your system after 8-12 in game years performance lags and it is very noticable. However alpha 17 is supposed to adress this! If you have the money this is totally worth every penny as an amazing game!!!			"

								As a rule I generally don't write reviews; not out of some arbitrary reasoning, but out of fear that I don't have insight to either advising picking up a game or steering clear of it.This is not the case with Rimworld.Rimworld is arguably one of the finest crafted games ever released for the colony/survival genre. Boasting a huge range of character traits, a complex relationship system between characters and a potentially harsh or easy world to survive in. The game is entirely fantastic in it's ability to tailor your experience from a relatively easy adventure through a lush, temperate forest; all the way up to a ball-crushing torture fest of surviving in the harsh, arctic tundra, or the equally terrifying super dry deserts.If you have even the slightest interest in this game, please do yourself the favour and pick it up. Whilst it's only just come out on Steam, I have well over 500 hours of gameplay prior to it's release: and I've loved every single second of it. You will not regret this purchase, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic!			"

								Played for a long time since Alpha 8, and would definately recommend this game as a great colony survival game with constant updates and a great modding community behind it. I've probably put in atleast a couple hundred hours easily, it's very easy to get into and each update increasing changes the entire game dynamic and the upcoming one being more of a mobile presence of the world will hopefully help create a solution to trading, exploring or the end game stagnation that is of current.

								Well,after all this time,I don't remember a good enough story to tell. But,there was this one time where I led a group of tribals,and gave the leader an A.I chip,Bionic arms and legs,all Synthetic organs... Hell,if I saw that guy,I'd run and tell my faction to worship him. Besides,everyone who fought him ended up casually persuaded to join or shot to death by powerful,futuristic weapons.EDIT:New story! After seeing chapter one of Rock Paper Shotgun's ""Bogdan's Rest"" I made Big Boss Hotel. With a LOT of mods,including Glittertech and more furniture,fashionrimsta,and MORE,I built a massive hotel in a Boreal Forest inside of a hotel. We had Kevin ""Boss"" Lewis,with great social skills,Craig Boone,who keeps talking about how his wife is dead,but then shoots millions more to death,and Shauna ""Food"" Gray,who makes food. We quickly made a grand entrance hall,and right above the entrance,we made a massive power room.  To the left,we dug further into the corner and built our rec center,where our first infestation was. Boss beat some bugs to death with his baton,but Boone came in and killed the rest in around one shot while Food ran outside and hid behind a tree. We then dug below the rec room,and expanded to the rooms. The first 2 were guest rooms,and the next 2 were for staff. Staff rooms were larger and had colours based on the personality and name of the character. We dug so far down,and then came our first visitors! They were a group of Outlanders and had some good stuff to trade. They all went into thier rooms. One guy brought some drugs,he began smoking flake,then died. He overdosed or something. We happily took his stuff,and when Boone was wearing his jacket,noone suspected a thing. After a while,they left,and were so amazed they turned over the rest of thier drugs to us! Remember kids,don't do drugs,give them to random strangers!1 season LaterARK! GET AT THE DOOR! BOONE! GRAB THE RIFLE! COOKE! GET OUT THERE!Fourty Rhinoceri outside,bashing at the doors,invading Teh Coive (Our stockpile) and bashing our Enmergency Exit. Boone one shots them all,until they blindly run away to maul a caribous. Cooke charges out there and shoots the legs off of 3 of the beasts. They fall over as Ark guards the entrance,blindly firing her assault rifle at the monsters. Our turrets finally regain power from the solar flare,and mow down the rhinos. As the others begin to wander off,as they've gotten bored of death,we all rush back in and go to the hospital. Down below,a prison break occurs. The Pirate Leader we captured has decided enough is enough. With his useless Lackey,Justin,they break out and grab some wood from a nearby room,under construction. Boss rushes to deal with them,as he is our noble warden. He whacks Maker on his head,and as Justin draws near,Boss flees upward to get more reinforcements. Our pregant,and brave dog,Taffy,charges forth. She bites Maker's arm,and he whacks her tail and legs with his wood. Maker,in a smidge of pain,takes a bow from an equipment locker in a room,and shoots Taffy. She dies in one hit. Her middle-stage fetus,is never shown the beauty of this world. In a fit of rage,Boss charges Maker and beats him senseless. He knocks him over,he falls in pain. Justin,in fear that his beloved boss was struck down,rushes back to his cell. Later,we put Taffy in a Sarcophagus. Maker recovers and stays in his cell,as the hated Dog-Killer. Our colony mourns the death of Taffy still. The save continues on to this day.     Get RimWorld today for many great stories and tales of drama,action,bloodshed,and Romance!			"

								It took me 43 hours of game time to get a wonderful base going. I thought this was a good time to start raiding the pirates. I got my three best snipers in a line ready to fire. I killed about 5 of the pirates before they started shooting back. My fragger threw a grenade, right next to two of my guys. Surprise, surprise they didn't die. After the raid was over I found one of my guys with a shredded leg. I got him back to base and prepared to replace the leg with a robotic one. After a day I saw a little red box with the word ""ridiculous"". I looked at my guys heath and he had two broken arms with brain damage. I thought he would be fine. Until a week later he went crazy and gunned down my entire base after picking up my only minigun. ""9/10 would ruined my life with more video games again""			"

								It's finally out, go get it!  Really though, if you enjoy ant farms, building, seting up things to fail/succeed..then this is the game for you.I have been involved with Rimworld as far back as October 2013, back when it was a REALLY barren world. Watching and and being involved with the game over the past 3 years has made this game feel like a family member you watched grow into a successful young adult.   Game notes: A smart AI lays out a story for you, either the traditional 3 colonists, 5 club wielding/ backwards tech colonists, or the challenging 1 colonist. All of which can be speced to your personal choices.  TONS of REPLAYABILITY   -A sandbox, with countless stories to tell.   -A refreshing sense of humor is laced in.   -Incredible Mod support built in.   -Easy to learn, hard to master   -Great ablility to indirectley control your colonists   -Epic battles, strategy, resources   -Play intense pirate over-run worlds, or peaceful sim-cities   -Tech Tree   -Survival   -Colonists interact, get married, party, fight..it's all here   -Good Soudtrack   -A great deal for what you pay.  So if you enjoy the above then Rimworld is for you. A game I have played for 3 years, and I still love it!			"

								This review is based on just a a few hours in the game.Here's my story...There was a couple and a friend. They lived happily in Rimworld. We carved into the mountain for our home and set up a kitchen and farms in preparation for the Winter. A few days later we were joined by Sval, a doctor. I was enthralled by this but he had dementia and enjoyed wondering off.Later on we were attacked by pirates, the wife was injured which cause the friend to panic who then attacked the cat. Both started to do fine until the friend died. Spencer then arrived at the colony who was chased by pirates, she was great until we kept getting attacked by the same pirates which led to her and the husband bleeding out.Prior to this Mikey had joined the colony who was also fleeing from pirates. We survived but the wife was stressed and starting walking in the wilderness. Whilst this happened a thunderstorm set alight my homestead. Mikey was too injured from escaping but still attempted to extinguish the fires but was set on fire and died.The wife then returned home to find no food and, electrics fried and Mikey dead. But she's a strong woman and will regrow the colony. "

								Yes buy it.It still has very minor issues in the day to day gameplay.  It has a good balance between planning and execution, with random events taking place provided by which storyteller you choose.  I.e. the storyteller (apparently) provides the non-deterministic events in the world, which can range from pirate raids or lunar eclipses to the wildlife going crazy.It seems to play like a D20 game.The Good:- Characters have to sleep each day - which usually means hitting fast forward.  This provides a casual feeling to the game - the game is not rushed.- It might even be the most casual ""chill"" game I can remember.  You can pause the clock at any moment or revert to an old save.  So even when things are getting heavy you can think through what needs to happen.- The game setting is living in the wild and pulling together a survival plan in the midst of the storyteller generating random events.  It's very easy-going this way -- not like Prison Architect which was too heavy and dark for me.- Grizzly bears seem to just eat berries.  Now you know storyteller will make them go crazy at any moment - so try to figure out a way to deal with them.The Bad:- The price feels high before you buy it.  So it might take longer before many people try this game.  - The game could provide more pointers.  ""Just look it up on the Wiki.""  I suppose if you're hardcore you will want to figure everything out - but this is the blurry line between gameplay-based enjoyment and arbitrary recipe search-space Easter Egg hunting.- There's no demo.  You can watch youtube videos all day - you'll think this is a Dwarf fortress thing like I did, but it's not, and all the videos don't do the game justice.  A demo would have helped me get over the price hump.As it is this game is easily worth the asking price.  Listen - you have 2 hours to figure it out - if you still want a refund, you'll know after first hour.			"

								If you enjoy micromanging every moment of your game, this is the challenge you're looking for. RimWorld, or as I like to call it: RimJob. RJ will keep you engaged with a plenty of random events to deal with from whichever AI you pick. From lightining srikes that turn a single flame into a raging inferno, poison clouds that suffocate every living thing for days at a time, to emotional instablities of your colonists. Most days are a new struggle with some rewarding moments thrown in.SQUARETOP:Life in the colony of Squaretop wasn't easy. Stranded on a new planet with a few meals and essentials destined for survival. We had to build walls and build quickly. The initial crew (Vurn, Dacil and Sephicite) survived fires, 3-man raider attacks, and captured many raider prisoners whom after some time were convinced by Vurn to join our cause. After 10 years the Harambe faction became the most coveted in the area, we heavily invested silver into creating nearby allies that we could trade with and call on for help. The poison clouds wiped our crops and killed our animals but still we remained strong. Our stockpile of food encased in Marble walls kept the colony of 9 happy while the natural disasters came and went. It seemed all was well, Joy was reaching new levels, simple meals turned into fine meals. Sweltering heat blistered each year but the A/C kept us cool. Squaretop had it's first gay male couple; Sephicite fell in love with a captured prisoner turned colonist named Ray. He was known throughout as RayJ for how he liked to sing sweet love songs to all the colonists. RayJ was desperately seeking love with any living being in the colony. It didn't matter if you had a peg leg, prosthetic arm, or a brain implant. After multiple rejections RayJ found love with Sephicite in a hopeless place. The colony held a wedding and a party in their honor, everyone attended. Life hummed along and the Squaretop expanded quickly and researched many new technologies. YEAR 15:In year 15, our luck started to turn: Vurn died in a mining accident when a roof collapsed and crushed his body. None of his remains were found. The entire colony was disheartened by our Warden's and best doctor passing. He was a social butterly that no longer graced our marble floors or hospital beds with his presence. During this year a firestorm wiped out the majority of the map but our research in firefoam poppers kept the colony walls safe from a fiery intrusion.While in awe of the firestorm a infestion of bugs manifested itself inside our primary mining node. Several colonists were called on to clear the infestation after preparing for a few days. During the preparation the bugs multiplied in number. The 4 man clearing team was severely wounded and spent 5 days in the med bay recovering after the mission. The team mostly returned to their daily work and was effective even if their movement was a bit slower than before, except for one. Sephicite caught multiple stray friendly fire bullets to the head during the infestation mission and had lost his eyesight. He was unable to navigate around the colony or continue his duty as a Hunter. After much debate it was deterined that he was a useless member of the colony and was euthanized in the 15th year by his lover RayJ. A burial was held in his honor, a sandstone sarcophagus was formed by Dacil as his final resting place. RayJ entered a state of depression and began to experience mental breaks. RayJ had a tendency to be a pyromaniac and began to burn down the colony from the inside out. RayJ successfully burned down the food and medical supplies. The fire was contained and so was RayJ. He was placed in a steel walled room with no door and concrete floors. I determined RayJ will be tortured for what he has done to the remaining 7 colonists. The warm exhaust of a cooling vent pushed the temps to over 80C in his contained cell. RayJ died from heat exhaustion and was buried in a wooden sarcophagus next to his dead lover. There was no ceremony held for RayJ. The colony was desparately trying to replenish food supplies through hunting and trade. RAIDER TEAM ALPHA:That's when the best equipped raider team we have ever seen showed up. It had just turned to the 16th year when raider crew B.A.M.F showed up with mortars and established a permiter of sandbags for defense. They brought survival meals and were ready for a long battle. What once was 9 colonists was now only 6 for defense. Of the 6 remaining Diver was incapable of fighting though he was drafted anyway. He would serve as a human meat shield and if possible would haul the wounded to the hospital. We called our allies for help, they would arrive in 3 days and the colony was drafted and formed up on preparation positions. I determined 3 would attack head on lead by Diver the meat shield and 3 flanking from the east side to take out the mortar operator. Diver was immediately hit with the most accurate shots I've seen in RimJob to date. The five man raider crew landed direct hits and he was the first casualty killed instantly. There would be no rescue for Diver. Dacil lead the flanking team and they sucessfully downed two raiders. The head on meat shield team now lead by Tako the Brawler another former prisoner was badly hurt. He was losing blood quickly and the hospital was far away. They would have to fight and try to survive. Moments later Tako was downed by shotgun fire and his mate Erin attepted to rescue him. Erin made it out of small arms fire range when she caught a direct Mortar round with her face. Tako and Erin died instantly. RIP. Three colonists of Squaretop were remaining and four raiders left. We only needed to down one more raider and it was likely they would retreat. The flanking crew hid behind trees and attempted to take down the raiders from range using assault rifles. The colony aim wasn't true that day and the raiders were operating like the legendary Chris Kyle. I sent Mikey south as a distraction and tried to reposition my crew closer to the sandbags. Mikey caught a mortar, was downed, and began to bleed out from a missing left leg. Dacil's movement was impaired from multiple gun wounds to both legs and torso. The only colonist left capable of moving was Curry. Chef Curry was the colonist cook and he had a recipe for disaster. Chef Curry retreated out of sight when I seen the aid show up from our neighboring ally. I sent Curry back in the fight to bake the raiders from the south while they were attacking the allied force. The 3 allies were ill equipped to handle the 4 heavily armed raiders. Poor quality clubs were no match for the raiders as the allies were also taken down, 2 were killed, one downed and left for dead. Curry couldn't hit the side of a barn during this time and was also downed by assault rifle fire. At this point the remaining raiders had won... My colonists were being captured and taken away. Dacil the last remaining downed colonist remained. Once she died, the colony of Squaretop was no more.THE END:This was my 5th RJ colony and I'd say every single one was a major learning experience. I played without save points (Save only on exit, the True RJ experience) The randomness of my attackers fire during the final raider fight was enough for me to quit the game permanently. I mostly just stared in awe as things went from OK to OH to WOW to WTF. I had several crew that were 13/20 and higher shooters and they couldn't hit anything even when equipped with superior weapons. RNG FTW. This also happened while hunting turkeys at times being unable to shoot them at melee range. Seems a bit ridiculous. I'd still recommend the game to anyone with a lot of patience.			"

								I love this game. It has kept me up all night more times than i'd like to admit. by no means is it perfect but thats why this is in alpha the devs are still working and adding new fetures to it with every update. this game will keep you up  at night this game will not take pity on you this game will take your hours of youtube research and walkthough watching and spit it right in your face and your colonist with the rocket launcher will go crazy and set half your base on fire, then the game will send a herd of man hunting rinos to kill everyone and just for good messure a ship with killer robots will crash right in the center of it all and youll watch the base you built go down in flames.but thats the kind of game this is. its not going to hold your hand but it wont be overly cruel youll learn from your failures and build better colonies for them.(also stay away from turkeys and chickens they are the devil in desguise and will over run you like locusts)			"

								This is probably my favorite colony simulation game. The music is great, the art style is neat and the gameplay sucks you in for hours and hours at a time.Almost every game I've played winds up in disaster as killer robots invade, someone has a mental break and sets everything on fire or everyone drops dead from sickness after the only doctor is mauled to death by angry beavers during a hunting accident. But that's part of the joy. Seeing how your colonists will interact,  what the AI will throw at you next and how (or should that be if) you'll handle it.It's a game that's better in the early access stage than a lot of games are after years of post release support.

								I was hesitant about this game at first because of the clunky looking low-res graphics.This is an Incredible game, and I highly reccomend it.With so many mods, scenarios, geographical options and characters replayability is as close to unlimited as it gets.  Sorry, gotta go.  My herd of alpacas needs hay and my surgeon needs to harvest the livers and hearts from the summunabiches we captured who attacked my beloved base.  By the way, you're looking kinda haggard, lemme craft you a few advanced bionic limbs and organs and get you a better gun and armor...  Maybe you need a brain stimulator with a luciferium rib- implant if you're not smart enough to try this game out right now.			"

								Don't let the lack of time played fool you, I've played this game for probably a hundred hours before its release on steam. This is a game I love and keep coming back to, each game is different and with the inclusions Alpha 14 have added make the game even more awesome! I can see this game becoming quiet the gem once it's fully released. Each playthrough has its ups and downs, you find yourself attached to certain characters, you swear when a swarm of aliens spawn inside your base and kill everyone and you relish at the thought of capturing prisoners and harvesting their body parts to sell on the black market. This really is an awesome game, highly recommended!			"

								Surprisingly good - this is the best way of describing RimWorld.  The last time I played an indie game with as much potential for replayability was FTL.  If you liked FTL, I'll take a leap here and say you will like RimWorld.  Very different in its concept, but similar in it's addictiveness and replayability which for me is really important.Each time you start a new colony the experience is slightly different.  Obviously there are similarities between games which have had me sighing a little when a colony goes wrong and I have start a new one, but on a whole its quite fresh each time a new game is started.  You build a base from scratch and collect resources, but the little people you start with have real vices and personalities, some are hard workers, some lazy, some hate each other, some spawn new little people if they get together!  Pets can be trained if you have a animal friendly little person too, and they can help fight off attackers or fetch resources.  This can sound gimmicky and a little micro-management heavy, and I was a little sceptical when I read about the AI story teller, but actually it really does work and is fun and balanced.If you're like me and prefer a permadeath game RimWorld comes with that option, and its great, knowing if something goes wrong (and it often does) you just have to keep going till your team recover or all is lost, and that makes the experience deeper, because sometimes you start to feel the journey with your characters, particularly if some get killed or maimed.  I actually got properly sad once when one character died and then his pet dog died defending him afterwards, I ended that game, and that was the end of that story.  The beauty is, you can then start again with new people and have another 'largely' unique adventure.Give it a go, it’s worth it just for the experience, it’s quite a unique game.			"

								Love, love this game. Been playing for a couple alphas now (since 12) and watching Let's Play videos before that. And it just keeps getting better and better, And the best part of that is that it started out great. This game has been super stable, the only thing ever really causing any issues that I have seen is mods interfering with each other, which is purely an issue with operator error (yes, me, the fool poking at the keyboard.)Other Early Access games need to be stacked up next to this one for comparison. They will nearly all come up very sadly lacking. This game is a masterpiece. Even without the awesome mods this game is great. Many will say ""well the mods are what make it really great"" and while they are certainly correct, the reasons the mods are so good is that the dev planned and coded for those mods to be able to be made from very early on in this game and it shows!

								Tthe thing with rimworld though is it's not a ""game"" persay. It's a story, which is why suddenly and out of nowhere your entire colony is brutally slaughtered by some terrible event. You have 3 different story tellers. One of them, Randy Random can literally drop a giant pirate raid very soon after you crashland, your colony is dead and your story ends. Or you could survive for a little while, or you could survive long enough for you to build a new starship and escape the planet. Rimworld is a story, of survival and hardship. Your colonists suffer ilnesses, infections, injuries. They can lose limbs, eyes etc. They can get dementia, a bad back. A brain injury. Missing eyes. They can also fall in love, get married. Then you have families, a raiding part might attack and one the raiders if the brother of one of your colonists. Then there are rivaleries, just like in the realy world people don't always get along. Say a colonist dies, now a couple other colonist might've been good friends so they'll get a massive hit their mood, as a close friend died but another colonists hated them and now they're dead they're happy and have a spring in their step. Every colonist has traits and backstorys that are randomly generated. Some may be pyromaniacs, others may be cold tolerant, again others might be alcholics, drug addicts, hard works and the list goes on. For bakcstories, they may have been surgeons, builders, bounty hunters, royality and the list goes on. It's a very deep game and immensely satisfying. Unlike other random colony or city builders you get very attached to these colonists because of how deep this game is. "

								Great game!!!  I liked Prison Architect but felt it needed more.  RimWorld exapnds well beyond PA with more options, challenges, and random events.  This game is challenging, especially managing the physical and mental ""needs"" of the colonists. The pets are really cool even though I have a tough time getting them to do what I want but that's probably more user error than anything. Love the fact that they bond with a colonist and will follow them around and accompany my hunters when they go looking for food and help bring home the kills.  I can't say enough good things about this game. It's just awesome. If you even remotely liked Prison Arcitect or city/colony builders try this game. $30 may seem lke a lot for an EA game but there is already enough content that I view anything else they put in to the game as a bonus. New content is being added and for once I am very happy with an EA game purchase that, IMO,  is worth the price they are asking, as is, and it only looks to be getting better.  Great job so far Dev's, please keep up the great work!!!			"

Purchase this game support the developers working hard to make better games.Note in version 15 which was just released they have just added a tutorial.

								Tynan is one of the most transparent developers I have ever spoken to. Now more than ever, you have to be very careful about buying into an early access game. Many early access games have faded into obscurity or failed to deliver on any of their promise. RimWorld is not one of those games. The modding community for this game is already great, and will be made even better with workshop support. Whether you're a masochist that doesn't mind your entire colony being decimated every other day or a casual base builder, the game and the modding community has something to enhance your experience. Every update comes with a ton of new features to try out.If you like Prison Architect, this game is probably right up your alley. You have to manage all aspects of your colonist's lives: their joy, moods, health, food, living spaces...I recommend checking out the Twitch community for RimWorld if you are debating whether or not to get the game. Sacriel is probably one of the biggest streamers that plays. However, an entire other community has evolved for the game as well. There is a group that does speed running for the game (you can launch a ship to escape the world) to see who can get off the planet first. These streamers (ZeebosZone, disnof, spartyon7) play at the highest difficulty and often with storytellers that can send multiple raids each day. They also do other fun challenges, such as the Ice Sheet challenge (starting off on the coldest map seed and trying to survive), or the Cannibalism Only challenge. The fact that there are so many different challenges and restrictions you can make for yourself is one of the greatest things about this game and ensures for a ton of replayability. "

								Rimworld is astonishingly fun and addictive for an Early Access game.  Don't let the relatively simple graphics fool you (though they're certainly less abstract than, say, Dwarf Fortress which Rimworld is frequently likened to) ... the game feels quite immersive.  It becomes very easy to empathize with your colonists as individuals, to feel pride in their skill level, to want to please them by providing for their comfort in their bedrooms and ensuring proper entertainment.  Starting from scratch, you have to act quickly to build shelter and beds, get crops going and build production stations for cooking food, producing clothing and weapons, crafting art and building a variety of goods for trade when the traders come.There are threats galore, of course -- pirate raiders, hostile primitive tribes, manhunter-maddened animals and disasters both manmade (toxic fallout) and natural (volcanic eruptions).The gameplay and the characters are complex, and its easy to lose all track of real-life time.This game has been absolutely dominating my gameplay time for over a year already (I bought the game back in Alpha 7 days; this review is a few days following Alpha 14 and the initial Steam launch).  I definitely recommend it!			"

								Kickstarted this game, and it's great.It's like a less-difficult, better-looking Dwarf Fortress, but in a sci-fi setting.Now, whether or not lower difficulty and/or better graphics are an improvement or not will probably vary from one individual to another, but I personally believe there's a place for both.And I like the place this game's at.

								First off let me say that although this game says early access, it in no way feels like an early access game. I've rarely, if ever, ran into a bug that greatly affected gameplay or anything like that.I'm always amazed at the amount of detail put into this game every time I play it. From some colonists missing a middle toe to someone having a jaw injury due to their background as a soldier which impairs their ability to talk and trade with others.Every colony really is truly different because of the randomly generated worlds and all the unique combinations of skills you can get on a colonist. Theres also the many random events that can take place such as anything from a small raid by a local tribe to a nuclear fallout which forces everyone indoors until it subsides.I've never had a boring experience playing this game and it's always fun trying to figure out how I will get past the next challenge, I highly reccommend this game :^)			"

								I thought I was doing pretty good, then the raiders came. Everyone but Big Red was injured, and he did a good job of healing the rest, but as a result he got an infection and died. Then the raiders returned and stabbed my mercenary to death. It was just Fields and a hurt Mia left. Mia might have had a chance, but seeing all the bloodshed caused something in Fields to snap and she killed Mia before going on a killing rampage against helpless forest creatures. After taking a nap in the same bed where her dead friend still laid, she went on another rampage before a fox took vengeance for all his furry friends. The moral of this story: Killing woodland creatures is never a good stress reliever. "

								Dwarf Fortress Lite with a UI. For those who haven't played DF, it is a top-down colony management sim where you set goals for your colonists and they carry them out. I really enjoyed this game and easily got my $30 worth. There's a lot of priorities to balance and different paths to success. One thing I like about it over DF is that there is an actual end-game goal (which you can prioritize or ignore at your leisure). There are various difficulty levels from trivial basebuilder paradise to really hard ones where you are essentially under siege from all sides. Despite being a much simpler game than DF, I still felt that the combat was implemented better. Economy is simpler but still complex enough to keep you busy. Highly recommended, you will lose a weekend to this.			"

								Tynan is one of the most transparent developers I have ever spoken to. Now more than ever, you have to be very careful about buying into an early access game. Many early access games have faded into obscurity or failed to deliver on any of their promise. RimWorld is not one of those games. The modding community for this game is already great, and will be made even better with workshop support. Whether you're a masochist that doesn't mind your entire colony being decimated every other day or a casual base builder, the game and the modding community has something to enhance your experience. Every update comes with a ton of new features to try out.If you like Prison Architect, this game is probably right up your alley. You have to manage all aspects of your colonist's lives: their joy, moods, health, food, living spaces...I recommend checking out the Twitch community for RimWorld if you are debating whether or not to get the game. Sacriel is probably one of the biggest streamers that plays. However, an entire other community has evolved for the game as well. There is a group that does speed running for the game (you can launch a ship to escape the world) to see who can get off the planet first. These streamers (ZeebosZone, disnof, spartyon7) play at the highest difficulty and often with storytellers that can send multiple raids each day. They also do other fun challenges, such as the Ice Sheet challenge (starting off on the coldest map seed and trying to survive), or the Cannibalism Only challenge. The fact that there are so many different challenges and restrictions you can make for yourself is one of the greatest things about this game and ensures for a ton of replayability. "

The unique combinations of who your colonists are, the enviroment they start in, and the story and events that unfold ensure that you won't ever have the same experience twice.  Every new alpha adds more depth to that experience, and the wonderful modding community continues to enrich it.

								This is a drama generator disguised as a game. You could just go through the motions and play this challenging survival game. Or you could take a few moments to actually read about the characters you are playing with and watch the story unfold.In one game, an overweight male cook crash lands on a RimWorld with two naked female sex slaves. The women are constantly frustrated at their lack of clothes. Mr. Cook is constantly hitting on the girls and trying to get lucky, and is constantly rejected. The girls who have the necessary survival skills between them (except cooking) ignore the cook's advances. The cook eventually goes insane and runs around in a crazy stupor until he eventually starves to death. The girls who cannot cook eventually get depressed over having to eat the corpses of animals they hunted raw and end up fighting. The one with medical skills is knocked out. The survivor has no medical or hunting skills. They both starve to death...In another game a family consisting of a daughter who is a researcher with some medical skills, her mother the botanist, and the ex husband/father who was a soldier, crash land near the pole with their pet Husky. The botanist can't do anything without a hydroponic set up as nothing grows in the cold and ice. The mother can also cook. The daughter can hunt and cook. And the father can build a shelter. They manage to build a small, heated space and have plans to create an indoor hydroponic set up to feed themselves as there are very few things to hunt out on the ice.Then the daughter is attacked by a polar bear while hunting a rabbit. The father rescues her. While she is in bed recovering, the father and mother can't take the stress of being in such close company anymore and start fighting. The mother is injured. The father has no medical skills. The daughter gets an infection which can't be treated and gets gradually worse. There's a short in the battery room and power is knocked out - with no power there's no heat. Mother - with some medical skills - gets hypothermia. Father can't repair the battery as there's no metal left, and the daughter had the mining skills. Besides - the polar bears are still out there...Eventually food runs out - the daughter dies of her infection. The mother dies of hypothermia. The father can't bear to eat the corpses of his family and starves to death. The dog survives by eating their corpses. Eventually, a wanderer stumbles upon the settlement. He figures he could just live there, mine some metal and fix the hydroponic set up. There's no food, but he has no problem with eating this frozen human protein lying around. He survives for days, repairs the battery compartment, and is re-buidling the hydroponics.A few days later an escape pod crashes near the shelter. The old man rescues the young woman - the girl of his dreams! He locks her in a room while she recovers, hoping to woo her and convince her to stay with him, that cannibalism isn't all that bad and that people are actually quite tasty. But she rejects him. Eventually he goes insane from digging up the frozen corpses and butchering them, and in his madness he attacks the dog. The dog incapacitates him outside the shelter, and the old man - unable to get back inside - freezes to death. The young woman locked in her cell starves to death...10/10 would turn cannibal and abduct women again!			"

								I've played RimWorld since Alpha 11 or so, and it's one of the best games I've ever played. It's fun, the AI is great and sometimes laughably confused, and I've had dozens of hours of pure joy through playing the game. It's great, and the support personnel are awesome, too.			"

								My partner bought this game and I decided to give it a shot and was immediatley hooked.I have just around 6 hours and I have decided to tab out of my game to write this review on why i believe you should buy this gmae. The following harrowing tale has just taken place in the space of about 15 minutes irl time and nothing i am about to recount has been made up. It has all just unfolded in front of my eyes and i just had to share the experience before i forget all the minor details.It is the 6th of summer. After being banished from their previous tribe this band of plucky cavemen and women set out to start a new.After a month of toil and food all but run out. Today is the day of the big harvest, at least, it was supposed to be.It is a chilly morning. 3 degrees c but the sun has risen and its warming up niceley. Everyone is ready to take in the harvest when V3trox spies some raiders to the north. Fortunatley we have prepared for this. The tribe is all skilled in the use of bows and our recent addition ""toad"" has been working hard to equip everyone with a bow.V3trox calls the whole tribe to arms but leaves toad behind as she is an outsider and has no place fighting for the tribe and is left to perform the cleaning duties.3 radiers come into sight. One armed with a shotgun, another with an smg and the last with a pistol. 3 against 5. We may have more men, but they have gunpowder. V3trox takes the head of the group. Velaniel, Mantis, Berro and Hawk stand behind him. The bows out range the guns, but not by much, enough to to get a wave of arrows in befor the enemy come in range.The first withering hail of arrows is released in a catastrophic failure, All 5 arrows completley miss, the tone of the battle is set. The first raider, armed with an smg opens up with a burst of shots. The group of tribesmen is peppered but mostly superficial wounds. A leg is shot here, an arm there but the tribesmen hold their ground and let loose another round of arrows. A couple hit but the damage is superficial. All 3 raiders are in range.The tribesmen are quickly mowed down in a merciless shower of leaded death. V3trox is the first to fall. A shotgun sweeps across him. His torso shredded, a hole in his stomach, damage to his left leg, his left foot is nowhere to be seen and in its place just a bloodied stump. Mantis is decimated. Smg rounds in every part of his body including his spine.Berro takes two full shotgun blasts. Blood pooling beneath herHawk takes the worst. Every raider scores a good hit on poor Hawk with both kidneys sporting nasty bullet holes.At this point all the tribesmen are still alive, albiet downed in pools of blood and vicera. Some concious and unable to walk. Others plain unconciousVelaniel retreats to the safety of the camp and to seek aid from Toad but all is not lost. One of the raiders is downed under the pouring stream of arrows. The  remaining 2 raiders, satisfied with the damage they have caused proceed to try and take a prisoner each and proceed to pick up Hawk and V3trox but a stray arrow landing on the floor forces one raider to drop v3trox on the ground. The raider turns around to see Toad screeming at the top of her lungs brandishing a spear. He gets hit, somewhere in the torso. The raider lashes out. A flurry of punches knocks Toad to the ground giving the raider time to flee. Toad is down and out. The final raider, a blonde female, runs with v3trox over her shoulder. Who knows what these raiders want but she was desperate to get v3trox back to her camp.Velaniel is trying to chase but struggles to breath. A stray bullet from the initial engagment has punctured her lung. Thats not going to stop her though. She continues the chase, launching arrows at the final raider. Each one lands a hit, each arrow slowing the raider to a bloodied stop. The fight is over, Velaniel gasping for air refuses to give in. The future of her tribe is at stake. She cannot afford to simply lay down and give up. She grabs v3trox and takes him back to the camp. She does the same to the rest of the downed tribesmen. Bleeding and gasping for breath she gets them all home. Velaniel stares at her dying tribe. No one will survive, they have all lost to much blood, had to many damaged organs. Only one person will survive. She walkes up to toads bed. What a ♥♥♥♥♥. A few punches and she was on the ground unconcious. This outsider. With only a few cuts and bruises. Velaniel tries to patch up some of the cuts whilst all the tribesmen she worked so hard to rescue all bleedout in their beds.Velaniel applies the final bandage before passing out on the floor, air failing to fill one lung. Toad awakes to see her saviour lying on the floor and carries her to her bed and applies whatever medical care she can muster...Will she survive without meds.This was too good for me not to share. I could restart with a new game or i could struggle to survive with just one survivor, maybe two but its unlikely			"

								No one ever thinks they’ll stoop to cannibalism.  But, then again, you don’t normally expect a bandit raid, 20 man strong, to storm your base in the dead of night while bunkered down for the winter.  12 colonists dead, 20 bandits laying frozen in the snow outside, and it’s just Cythia left to keep the joint running.Well… Cythia and Sam.  But Sam has never quite been the same after taking that bullet to the head and somehow surviving.  He used to be head of research but… he can’t keep up with much anymore.  Most he can do is push a broom around the joint, and even that doesn’t convince me I shouldn't just gut him for parts and be done with him.“You dolt.  You didn’t store anything in the walk-in storage?”Well… I did.  But the fire that broke out during the raid gutted my stores.And Cythia can’t run this joint on her own.  Which, really, she pretty much is.And there are all these perfectly good, frozen, man-shaped bags of meat just… sitting there… right outside my door.Like I said.  You don’t start off thinking you’ll have to eat someone but….====Don’t let the hours fool ya.  I backed this a couple years back direct from the developer and have been playing dev build after dev build, watching it grow in complexity.  I’m excited to see it out on Steam now, and can’t wait to see what the community does for the game through the Steam Workshop.It is a FANTASTIC game that has kept me occupied for countless hours.  One of the best parts, especially after you get your friends hooked in a few secessions of their own, is telling the stories of what was.Some damn brutal stories of survival, triumph… and a lot of failure.

								I bought this game at the end of 2014 and have been in love with it ever since.It is a truly remarkable basebuilder. It accomplishes this by mixing a few geners into it. It is part basebuilder, part RPG, part survival and part towerdefense.Playing the game feels like being in a constant crisis, death is ALWAYS looming for your colonists. It will take a long while before you can relax a couple of minutes, there is just too much that HAS to be done. Maybe you could also call the game a crisis management simulator.Other things i like:Good balance between micro and macroYou can designate global tasks for your settlers but can also give them a specific tasks if neededCrisp graphicsAlthough simple and 2d, the graphics are very crisp and clean.Decent interfaceHardly any bugsGood modding supportCool soundtrackGood replayabilityI usually don't play games after i finished it once but i have with rimworld. The different biomes and difficulty settings allow for very different experiences. "

The Steam release that comes with Alpha 14 looks like the biggest and best one yet.The developer had a stellar alpha release phase so far and I'd put this game right up in the 'Gold Star' category for quality, fun, playable, Alpha releases with other games like Prison Architect and Kerbal Space Program.Add to that a outstanding mod community combined with the ease of installing them using the Steam Workshop and this game has endless replayablity.

								I’ve been playing RImWorld for well over a year now. It is a cross between unrelenting frustration and exquisite joy. This game makes most micromanagement games look weak. You micromanage your micromanaging. Which can be a bit frustrating of course. From setting up schedules to making sure someone is working on research of some kind. Protecting yourself from attacks and building a rocket to escape the planet, everything needs to be planned and then planned again. When you learn how to do something, win a siege or build that rocket, there is a sense of accomplishment. Now that it is on Steam perhaps others will have a chance to hear about it and give it a try. It’s a real lot of fun, and the mods for it….wow. The community long before it found its way here to Steam was outstanding. Some of the mods were incorporated into the game in the past. The team that works on RimWorld really listened to us in the past, and I do not see that changing anytime soon. Worth the price and then some Don’t let “Early Access” fool you, this is a well-polished game and then some.  "

								I played this game already for countless hours before the steam release and I'm still doing so.it won't get boring, one of the advantages of a large and very good modding community. You will alway find new challenges to master. Make sure to visit the forums though, you won't find all the good mods on steam.In general, I can highly recommend this to any player who likes base building games, with a lot of strategic decisions mixed with the strong survival aspect of the game.As most of the reviews mentioned, there are a many similarities to ""Prison Architect"", due to the angled top down view and the the building system ( single blocks, put together to build your desired colony / prison ).I played some Prison Architect, but I never really enjoyed it, so I can say I like RimWorld a lot better!You can play your colony simply as a base builder, recruit people and have a prospering place to live. Or you can go hardcore, fight against nature and hostile factions. There is surely a setup you will enjoy. From basebuilder to real struggle to survive is everything included. This game offers you a real challenge if you are up to it!Theres is a lot of detail to the game and your colonists. Social interactions with other colonists, ranging from hate to marriage. A health system where you can lose and replace limbs and organs. Individual traits for the colonists making them a super soldier, doc or that guy who is always on the edge to a mental break.The combat system is divided into melee and ranged and you can get into big and epic firefights when 20 pirates start to raid your colony and you have to defend against them. You can set up your defensive system over the whole map and generate a new layout never seen before.Set up a big prison wing to keep all the prisoners, captured during enemy raids and convince them to join you.There are not only human threats, but also mechanoids, advanced killing machines, which can be the end to an unprepared colony. Nature itself can make it a struggle to feed everybody, when the sun is covered for months during a volcanic winter. Or a solar flare disables your heaters when its -60°C outside.A lot can happen and there is enough material for a very good story.This can make your first start a bit tricky, but over the course of time you will learn to deal with each situation and I'm sure at some point, there will be another great colony somewhere in the endless vastness of space ... There are complaints about the lack of multiplayer, but I think they are unjustified. There is no real need for it. However, I can agree that I would enjoy to visit or raid other colonies, AI or not. It goes hand in hand with the fact, that you are currently restricted to the piece of land where you start. There is no possibility to take a few colonist and wander off to start another colony on the same planet ( a generated map from where you can choose your start biome ). This would allow you to trade and do all the interactional stuff and I would love to see that.Always keep in mind that this is still an Alpha version and that there is a lot of time to implement mechanics into the game.I give a lot of credit to the developer, he keeps every new version perfectly playable. With each update there is new content to explore.If you are still not sure whether you should buy this game, there are a lot of videos about it. I already made several Let's Plays myself with various setups. You can check out the newest one here:

								The stories and challenges to throws at you are amazing.One run I did I had four colonist's let call take Jim, Jack, Fred and Sally.Now Jim and Fred are brothers.Jim, Jack and Fred are all gay.Fred falls in love with Jack.But Jack loves Jim.Jack and Jim end up dating.But Fred doesn't give up he keeps on trying to impress Jack; who keeps rejecting him.Until Fred in a fit of depression because of all this rejection has a psychotic break, attacking Jack (who has a shotgun). Jack fires just one shot - BAM; and Fred is dead.Horrified that Jack killed his brother Jim kicks Jack out of his bedroom and refuses to have anything to with any of them.Meanwhile Sally, the one straight female character here,has been trying to reconcile all these guys, finally snaps and refuses to leave her room even to eat.Seriously the amazing stories that are organically grown out of the randomness that this game provides are amazing.Or my other run;Things were going strong into winter.When toxic fallout hit.As it his a lone wander joined, running through the toxic gas.Everyone was safe, we had heaps of food, we just need to sit still till things are safe.But no, the newbie who joined is a pyromaniac. He starts burning things, he runs outside and start smashing my solar panels (the only thing from keeping everyone from freezing to death), He attacks the other colonists and generally threatens everything. In the end he had to go, he was shoot trying to destroy our batteries. The fires are out, then suddenly we are attacked by 8 dudes with rocketlaunchers and frag grenades.ripping open my base (in the middle of toxic fallout). The run in, its a mess but somehow we fight them off.The rest of the winter is a fight, but we make it, half way through spring the toxic fallout finishes, my hapines fades as I then get hit by a cold snap and an infestation.Stories like this are what elevates this beyond other management games.

(Thought it would be a piece of cake)- Halfway way through the fallout, those stupid gaint ants started breeding again and have taken over my half of my mountain base.- Ordered all of my colonists to get rid of them, everyone got severely injured but they managed to clear them out. (thanks to the brawler I had)- Fallout is almost over and all of my colonists are extremely joy deprived and have cabin fever.- Mitch (brawler) decided to go savage and started killing everyone with the damn shield and sword they made for him?!?!- He killed all of my colonists and the last colonist that tried to stop him got his left hand cut off and his head sliced open.♥♥♥♥ you Mitch, and thanks for ruining my colonyGreat game I would totally recommend it, if you like seeing your colony go to♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								(Review written on Rimworld Alpha 14 Steam Release)This game doesn't grant me a single hour of sleep. Horrors, nightmares, constant fear of stuff breaking down and colonists going berserk.You want an example:- New colony, 3 ppl, going on well, spring looking good.- Base building up fine, new folks coming in.- Lots of hunting and growing for the winter.- 7. of fall, manhunting pack of 18 wild boars tearing through my wooden base doors, killing my only meele guy, his dog goes berserk, eating the prisoners whilst the boars kill and eat my colonists.- Colony up for over half a game year. A wire in a wall had a short circuit, ignited the oven in the fridge, that ignited the food.- Temperatures went over 300°C in minutes, killing 2 colonists who tried to put out the fire through a heatstroke.- ALL food and all medicine burned, no animals around because it was winter.- Colony starved to death in days.Haven't had this much fun since Minecraft. Rimworld has the same addictive potential.Full mod support via Steam Workshop3 different storyteller AI with additional difficulty settings, can be changed ingame at any time.Scenario editor: Adjust existing scenarios or create your very own colony conditions:- Constant eclipse so solar cells and growing plants won't work? As you please.- Tribesman colony with cannibals on the ice shelf of the south pole? No problem.- A thunderstorm all the time with colonists exploding on death? Well, here it is, have fun.Constant updates, bugfixes and balancing adjustments.Good combat system.If you like pain, colony macromanagement and combat micromanagement I absolutely recommand this game to you.11/10!

								Started out by making a base above ground.  Spent a lot of time planning and making sure everything was taken care of... then a rabid rabbit ate the survivor with the most medical skill.  Well, heck.  Oh another person joined!  Good.  Wait... a raid?  Okay, grab the rifle and let's do this!  Okay, he's dead.  Oh... food... right.Everyone died.Second game, I know!  I'll build in a cave!  Set a huge area to mine.  Half way through, carrying resources out, the ceiling caves in, killing two.  Third eaten by a rabid boar.Nearly 50 hours later, I have a working base and am having the most fun ever!A hardcore simulation in the vein of Dwarf Fortress, deep in strategy.  The graphics are simple but do a great job conveying information without being too taxing.  The events are varied and fun and the scenario editor is a great way to make exactly what you want.It's a game where you can make your own stories, spend a long time building, then have it all taken out by a lighting bolt setting fire to your mostly wooden structure.  Cave building is a good thing, just don't dig too big and make sure you set up an outside base for your people to sleep while you're mining.Plant potatoes first.  You can hunt for meat and all but potatoes are a life saver.The game is still in active development.  I recommend it now and I can't wait to see what is coming.  There is huge potential!			"

								Good game, fun game, dedicated developers. If you're a fan of Dwarf Fortress you'll like it. It's not a game to win, it's a game where a story is created and you get satisfaction from your eventual defeat.I've had this game since it was a kickstarter and have seen the developer continually add content while maintaining good communication with the players. While very enjoyable in its current state, i expect when it is complete (and it seems it will be completed) it should be fantastic.A good buy.			"

								I've been playing this game since A10, I think - dabbled with it on and off before that but not enough to really pay attention to versions or the like, I kickstarted it because the concept seemed interesting and I wanted to see if the dev could deliver.Simply put: They delivered. It's fantastic. This game will eat your free time. If you're into colony management type games, if you've ever wanted to play Dwarf Fortress with an actually functional GUI, this is almost certainly going to scratch that itch for you.There's minor annoyances, like with any management game - the lack of any easy way to prioritize jobs by area is a bit irritating, but I recall a mod for that in A12 and I'm sure it'll find its way to A14 sooner rather than later. Simply put, anything that bothers you, you'll probably be able to mod out or adjust to your liking.Pick it up if you're looking for something to sink hours into.			"

Early Access Review
								When i first saw this game on upcoming early access games it just seemed like a ordinary ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ea game that devs had already abandoned, i was not interested in it until release. Overwhelmingly positive reviews, interesting gameplay and fairly original idea got me buying the game, gotta say i am not disappointed at all. The game has incredibly high replayability value since there are so many different events and the map is randomly generated. What in my opinion makes Rimworld really unique are the colonists everyone has their own traits, skills and weaknesses. Mood meter for every colonist keeps the game interesting since you can't just build a huge inpenetrable wall that has nothing but farms inside of it, that would only lead to breakdowns and insanity, raiders would eventually get trough because everyone is losing their mind and are unable to repair the walls. There is just the right amount of complexity to not make playing boring. Overall amzing game 10/10 m8			"

								When I decided to give this game a try, I was expecting a simple and fun little base builder, but I couldn't have been more wrong. For an early access game, Rimworld is packed with content that will last your for a long time. With a charming artstyle, addictive gameplay, great music, devoted development team, and massive modding community, this game is sure to be a success. Like I said, this game doesn't feel like an early access game at all. It has enough content to be released now and still get great reviews, which is always a good thing when buying a game. And even when you feel like your done with the game, take a look at the steam workshop, because the modding community is one of the most passionant I've ever seen. For the $15 price, I would definintely recommend this game, however that doesn't mean it's perfect.My first playthrough, I had no idea what I was doing, and my colony immediately crashed and burned, and even after my 10th playthrough, I'm still learning new things you can do in this game, and it's also not easy what so ever. That being said, this game is much more complicated that it looks, and the learning curve can be kinda frightening.However, if you're a fan of building games, management games, strategy games, or top down combat games, you're sure to like this game, and spend a lot of time with it.

								Very good experiance so far and I really really like the dwarf fortress influence. Im a Dwarf Fortress player myself so this game just feels right at home but obviously it has its own unique charm and such. The soundtrack is particularly good and gets me in the mood. Only real complaint but it may just be my luck is that events seem to happen a bit too frequently with Cassandra. And something that is obviously not essential or anything but would be cool would be a Dwarf Fortress esque adventure mode.Oh! And the thing I would absolutely love to see the most is Z levels, Specifically focused on caves and not so much above ground but that is ay' ok as well!			"

								There are two kinds of people who play this game: 1) hardcore players who live for the thrill of almost-certain death (really, it only takes time--plague WILL get you), or 2) p*ssies who reload saves when a beloved colonist's head gets one-shotted into oblivion. I am (mostly) unashamed to say that I am one of the latter. Point is, there's a place in this great game for both types. So for all those tender-hearted people out there who have heard about how amazing this game is but are aghast after reading about man-hunting wild boars, psychopathic organ harvesters and vomitty plague, worry not. Go ahead and build your little utopic base for your colonists, because you only wanted to escape your tacky old pop superstar life after your career tanked in that unfashionable old midworld to make ugly-*ss statues which you can never sell because you foolishly made them out of pure gold that the traders won't ever have enough money to buy and instead will be sniffed out by raiders who have a true appreciation for your unique artistry. Really, there's no shame in it. There's even flowers.			"

The father was fat and didnt have any skills, but he loved to make his statues. He would tire away day after day making statues depicting his sons wife and himself coiled in embrace or watching the sunset.Then, one day after being rebuffed by the wife once again, the father went on a rampage and smashed my dogs head in. He had to be taken prisoner, would refuse to rejoin the colony, and died alone in his cell. That folks, is the meaning of true love.			"

								I have never played a game like this before. It's impossibly unique in the way the game is carried out. I've found myself rooting for these random people who really have no personality aside from the traits and skills they are given. And yet when something bad happpens to them it effects me more then other story driven games. The way the game plays is basic enough that anyone can get the hang of it, and start to forge their own story with the characters they control. Even in early access this game is unbelievable, and being a part of the steam workshop is the best move the devs could have made.			"

								RimWorld is nostalgic of old, great, later 90's-early 2000's village simulation games. It has great touches of many genre's, which shows the depth of knowledge the developer has of games. The developer, however small, is smart and deserves the credit for making a game as genuine and knowledgeable to core, enjoyable, gameplay mechanics. I personally give this game 9/10, on my scale, if it had better graphics, less repetitive and less frustrating raids/mood mechanics, maybe it would be perfect, and perfectly easier to beat for the higher difficulties. Honestly struggle a lot on the higher difficulties, but that's another thing that makes this game special. The randomness, the struggles, the attachments and efforts you make to protect your fort and your people, is amazing and a feeling you don't often get in most games.

								Rimworld is, frankly, one of the best games I've played all year. Its a great mix of roguelike/permadeath, survival, and mangament games. Each of your colonists has a unique set of traits and skills, making them better or worse at a variety of activities. You gotta manage your base, the moods and needs of your colonists, all while slowly teching up and building a spaceship so your colonists can continue the cycle of traveling the stars and seeding rimworlds. Each playthrough is unique. There are a variety of different random events, some good: like getting a herd of puppies to self tame themselves to your colony, and some are bad, like getting attacked by an army of space pirates. There are a lot of details that make the game very in depth, despite its highly cyclical nature. Even good, talented players will likely fail their first half a dozen playthroughs, I know I've come nowhere close to victory after all the hours I've put in. Honestly, it doesn't seem to matter, I have fun each time, and every time its a little different.			"

It already has the features for a full $15 dollar game and I cant wait to see where this game goes with updates in the future.			"

If you dont want to deal with bugs just wait for them to patch them out then i would highly recomend buying this game.			"

								I played this game already for countless hours before the steam release and I'm still doing so.it won't get boring, one of the advantages of a large and very good modding community. You will alway find new challenges to master. Make sure to visit the forums though, you won't find all the good mods on steam.In general, I can highly recommend this to any player who likes base building games, with a lot of strategic decisions mixed with the strong survival aspect of the game.As most of the reviews mentioned, there are a many similarities to ""Prison Architect"", due to the angled top down view and the the building system ( single blocks, put together to build your desired colony / prison ).I played some Prison Architect, but I never really enjoyed it, so I can say I like RimWorld a lot better!You can play your colony simply as a base builder, recruit people and have a prospering place to live. Or you can go hardcore, fight against nature and hostile factions. There is surely a setup you will enjoy. From basebuilder to real struggle to survive is everything included. This game offers you a real challenge if you are up to it!Theres is a lot of detail to the game and your colonists. Social interactions with other colonists, ranging from hate to marriage. A health system where you can lose and replace limbs and organs. Individual traits for the colonists making them a super soldier, doc or that guy who is always on the edge to a mental break.The combat system is divided into melee and ranged and you can get into big and epic firefights when 20 pirates start to raid your colony and you have to defend against them. You can set up your defensive system over the whole map and generate a new layout never seen before.Set up a big prison wing to keep all the prisoners, captured during enemy raids and convince them to join you.There are not only human threats, but also mechanoids, advanced killing machines, which can be the end to an unprepared colony. Nature itself can make it a struggle to feed everybody, when the sun is covered for months during a volcanic winter. Or a solar flare disables your heaters when its -60°C outside.A lot can happen and there is enough material for a very good story.This can make your first start a bit tricky, but over the course of time you will learn to deal with each situation and I'm sure at some point, there will be another great colony somewhere in the endless vastness of space ... There are complaints about the lack of multiplayer, but I think they are unjustified. There is no real need for it. However, I can agree that I would enjoy to visit or raid other colonies, AI or not. It goes hand in hand with the fact, that you are currently restricted to the piece of land where you start. There is no possibility to take a few colonist and wander off to start another colony on the same planet ( a generated map from where you can choose your start biome ). This would allow you to trade and do all the interactional stuff and I would love to see that.Always keep in mind that this is still an Alpha version and that there is a lot of time to implement mechanics into the game.I give a lot of credit to the developer, he keeps every new version perfectly playable. With each update there is new content to explore.If you are still not sure whether you should buy this game, there are a lot of videos about it. I already made several Let's Plays myself with various setups. You can check out the newest one here:

								This game is probably the best in it's genre. You'll witness tragedies and triumphs, celebrations and struggles. Your colonists and their varied strengths and weaknesses become personable and intricate in itself. The way you choose to play is completely up to you. You can create a thriving utopia on a fertile plain with minimal raiding problems, or you can choose to carve out a living in the ice steppe by creating a subterranean bunker with hydroponics. It's entirely up to you.All in all, it's a very replayable and rewarding game to experience. You'll be hard pressed to find another game with all the same advantages and variety to it.			"

								Suuuuuuuper good. This emergent story generator is an awesome place to dive into and disappear for a week. You'll be looking up tutorials and tips online, looking at all the nicely laid out colonies, then go back to your depressing hole in the mountain, where your colonists are going nuts and trying to date each other while fending of bandits, and you'll have a great time. Losing is fun, here. The death-spirals are amazing, and the hope I felt as I realized I _could_ pull this off was that much sweeter because 30 minutes later I'd realize how comprehensively screwed I actually was. No water or food, sure, but plenty of medical herbs I can get high with between bandit raids. 10/10 would fail horribly again.			"

								(Note: 0 hours on record at time of writing, but have been playing since alpha 3f; the game has been available outside of Steam through its website for over two years, and during that time I've spent many hundreds of hours on the game and am the maintainer of a small pack of mods.)RimWorld is amazing. It's a game that I am certain will come to be spoken of with similar awe and respect as Dwarf Fortress - except this time, there's graphics and a UI that won't melt your brain!As a colony management sim you will encounter tragedy and comedy, usually at the same time, as your colonists struggle to survive by collecting materials from their surroundings to build shelter, construct furniture, and make power sources and workbenches to produce advanced goods or process stuff into other stuff. As if keeping people fed, warm, and happy wasn't enough, you'll have to deal with bandits, mad animals, solar flares, heatwaves...Inter-colonist relationships? Check. Trading? Check. Traditional and hydroponic farming? Check. Research? Check. Art and mastercrafting? Check. Your colony being thrown into turmoil because a psychic wave turned a herd of llamas into a vicious manhunting pack of death? Check. RimWorld has all this and much more that I won't spoil, along with a superb soundtrack that perfectly fits the mood and never feels repetitive. If you get tired of the vanilla game, there's dozens of times more content available via mods.Honestly, you cannot call yourself a true fan of colony sandboxes until you give RimWorld a spin. The price is absolutely fair for the enjoyment it'll give you.			"

For years I have been playing this game on and off, and from my experience I can say it is a game that you will find yourself constantly coming back to. This may be in part to the extremely dedicated developer, or the greatly, yet strangely immersive gameplay. There are constant updates to this game, which introduce new ways to play. I know the game may be a bit much in the beginning, but if you take the time and learn the game, Im sure this will become one of your favorite games.

It feels like the dev works on enhancements to the framework of the game, while the mod community handles filling out the content.

It's like playing a top down version of the Sims only 100x better. :) You start out with a few colonists and start building up the colony from there. You will be utilizing various different types of people, which don't always get along.Each playthrough is a unique story and you'll likely be relating the story to people around you. My friend and I have swapped RimWorld stories over lunch at Taco Bell many many times. The stories are created by you, but also by the story telling AI. It keeps an eye on everything you're doing and throws little curves your way to bring you down a bit or help you a long if you are struggling. There are various different types of story tellers and various difficulties in each style you choose. With the steam release and Steam Workshop integration, using Mods and shared scenarios will be easier than ever.  I honestly can't recommend this game enough. If you like base building or management games you'll love RimWorld.			"

								I have enjoyed this game since purchasing direct from the website years ago. Thrilled to see it on steam finally! This game has steadily improved from it's infancy with what seems no end in sight. I encourage you to view lets plays and videos as this colony building sim has a learning cuirve as they continue to develop it. In my opinion Rimworld is one of the most entertaining colony builder resource management game I have every played!			"

								I've been playing RimWorld for a very long time. Way before it came out on Steam, I probably have close to 500 hours in the game already off Steam. Personally I think the game is already great and it just keeps getting better and better as more updates come out. I very rarely encounter any bugs and when I do they barely have an effect on the gameplay. The modding community is great, people are constantly hard at work to create bigger and better mods. From what I've seen the staff is fantastic as well. If you're worried this game is going to be another one of those early access games that take all your money and then cease development don't be. It's been in steady development for years and it's going to keep going for quite some time.			"

								I've been playing this game off and on again for the last two years before it came to steam. It's an amazing game, and it's very easy to find yourself playing this game for hours and hours at a time without realizing. The game has a built in storyteller which determines the events that happen to or arround the colony, this makes it so that even when you may lose and your game may end, it's usually to something different each time and keeps the game interesting and fresh. It makes it a lot less painful when you lose and have to begin a new colony. Which is probably something you'll end up doing quite a bit. So pretty much buy it, it's worth a lot more than it costs.

								RimWorld is an example of Early Access done right. The current state of the game is more feature-complete and bug-free than many full releases, yet Ludeon Studios continues to improve and add new features to what has become my favorite 'base builder' game. The game is very mod friendly and integrates with the Steam Workshop to provide hundreds of mods and custom scenarios. The AI storyteller will often produce hilariously frustrating situations that are reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress. A DRM-free version is available if you purchase the game through their website.			"

								This game is awesome!I've been playing since the early Alphas and boy it has evolved into such a great game. It does not have all the complexity of Dwarf Fortress which it is obviously based on, but it is no pushover either. The mod support is great and the only thing I really find to be missing is the possibility to play on multiple Z-Levels. That being said, I simply adore this game and, though I do tire of it from time to time, I continually find myself coming back to it when looking for a good fun game to play. I don't think I will ever stop playing this game.Though the price right now may seem a little steep at first when you look at the store page, know that if you want a Dwarf fortress-like game that doesn't dissapoint you, this is probably one of your best bets and worth the price.TL:DR I love this this game and recommend it to anyone that likes prison architect and/or Dwarf Fortress.

								At 24 years old, I find myself to be at the threshold of growing out of video games all together. I don't get excited over games any more like i used to in ym teens. It's a rare occasion for me to find a game that I absolutely cannot put down. RimWorld is officially a game I cannot put down. I can't wait for this to be a finished game so I can unlock achievments. The only thing that I really hope the Developers add is multiplayer. Imagine being able to have 4 or 6 people go to a world and make huge colonies and fight for the world. But you could only attack the other persons base if they were online. Something like that would be cool. BUY THIS GAME NOW			"

								Don't let the dark looking and prison architect copied/inspired graphic style step you back.In Rimworld, every playthrough is a complete different story, a thrilling, success, happy, sad, terror story. The amount of mechanics and content in this game are astonishing and they actually play along with each other affecting the colony in diverse ways. Coupled with a dynamic world filled with dangers, you will never get a rest.You can set the gameplay style and difficulty level at start which actually make a big difference making it a high replay value game.You can choose how many people and materials you want to start with.You can choose which type of biome you want to land on which will affect all your decisions and how you build your base.A true gem of a game like no other.

								This game even though it is in early access is more polished then many games at release. So if you're typically staying away from early access due to lack of content and polish then you might want to make an exception for this game.As the game description says one could call it Dwarf Fortress with a pretty interface, but that would be selling this game short. While it shares many traits with dwarf fortress it also has many of it's own special things. But in any case be prepared to lose several nights to this game by just ""finishing this one thing"".What is really refreshing is that this is doing survival right, it's always a struggle, and not unlike many other survival games a walk in the park once you get over a certain hurdle. The storyteller will always find something new to throw at you to see if you can handle it.			"

								Sawyer looked after every one. Her last two friends ultimately succumbed to their wounds in their beds while she desperately tended to their dying needs. Overcome with grief, she decided to exact revenge on the prisoner they kept in the holding cell. She quickly executed the prisoner and left the corpse where it was.For the next few days she was dead to the world as she slept to heal from the wound incurred from the last raid. Unbeknownst to her, a basket of berries had kept the cold storage room door ajar and the last of her food had spoilt. Though she could have resolved to start over and rebuild, she said ""$&# it"" and headed to the prisoner's cell.A few days later, this message:Sawyer, Doctor has gone berserk! The final straw was: Ate corpse.Sawyer was last seen running into the woods, engaging in melee combat with a boomalope.I hate/love this game.			"

								If you like any kind of strategy / sim / survival (hell, even space) games, BUY RIMWORLD ! It is amazing how much ""game"" you get for the money.. And it is done by one dude ! Tywin Lannister ! (Or something like that). And big kudos for that ! It is amazingly detailed, but still very easy to get right. Especially with the new tutorial and learner in v.0.15.  And yes you maybe think its just Prison Architect in space... But after 10 min. of playing you quickly see, that Rimworld is very different from PA... But don't buy it for the graphics.. It its nice to look at and there are no glitches or bugs, but you dont play the game because of beautiful graphics.. You play because there is just soooo much stuff you can do !Oh and... Install some mods for it ! It only makes the game better and more enjoyable. Worth every penny ! 9 / 10			"

								Simple recommendation... Ever since I first played Dwarf Fortress 8 years ago, Ive longed for a game that at least mirrored the kind of story telling and complexity that it offered, but with a much better graphical representation and something that attempted to be user friendly. To be fair, probably nothing will ever achieve the level of deep simulation Dwarf Fortress offers, but I can see this game coming close enough in the end product. Each update on this game is like an expansion that draws me into it for another week non stop. It's beautiful, it has heart, and it's fun.			"

He would tire away day after day making statues depicting his sons wife and himself coiled in embrace or watching the sunset.Then, one day after being rebuffed by the wife once again, the father went on a rampage and smashed my dogs head in. He had to be taken prisoner, would refuse to rejoin the colony, and died alone in his cell. That folks, is the meaning of true love.			"

								RimWorld is gold. If you like simulations and emergent gameplay, similar but not identical to Dwarf Fortress, this game is an absolute gem. I really hope the developer keeps adding additional gameplay mechanics, but even if they don't this is an outstanding simulation/survival/sandbox game as it exists today.I originally played the default game mode where you have 3 colonists from the start, just to learn the game a little. I came back and started over with the solo colonist because I figured it would be an easier way to start with just one person and it was. So far it has been awesome. I spent a while using my single colonist working on a simple home and camp. Then I was notified someone was fleeing pirates and I could either help them or ignore them, I chose to help. I killed the pirates chasing her and then found out she was a cannibal. Unexpected to say the least. Later someone decied to join my colony, she was also a cannibal, we're talking 2/3 are cannibals and I never had any say in this, it was emergent. Suddenly I'm dealing with a colony that is mostly cannibals. So now when pirates raid me or folks fall from the sky in cargo pods that I can't get to right away, well.... lets just say they don't go to waste, in a disturbing kind of way ;)This game is awesome, it's worth the money if you like this sort of thing, if you like Dwarf Fortress and just wished it had reasonable graphics and a far better interface (like use of mouse), this is your game, hands down. It's not as detailed as Dwarf Fortress, but it's also not shallow either.I won't go into all the details but suffice to say:- Detailed control over everything you build, down to the walls and doors- Detailed control over your colonists, when they should sleep, what activities they are responsible for, etc.- Use based skill system, the more a colonist uses a skill the better they are at it- Detailed control over combat, control where your colonist goes and whom they target- Emergent game play; colonists traits and weaknesses when observed will encourage you to do things you probably wouldn't normally do; some colonists would rather wield a ranged weapon, others would rather be awake at night rather than dayThe ONLY thing I can complain about, is the lack of height, Dwarf Fortress supports multiple levels of elevation, but this game only supports one, it's a missed opportunity, but I understand the complexities of supporting it, it's a bit of a bummer but at the same time, it's a hell of a lot more manageable this way as well.

								I don't normally write reviews, but here is one of my stories that just happened:Andrea started this colony on her own with her dog, Mandy. Over time,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lidia, Calvin, Othello, and Ian join the crew. Now♥♥♥♥♥♥was there from day 3. I tried to get them to hook up, but then Lidia came crashing out of the sky (literally) and won over♥♥♥♥♥♥ That was fine. Now let's talk about Calvin. Calvin was this big guy that joined the colony sometime after Lidia and♥♥♥♥♥♥started sleeping together. Calvin had a thing for Lidia. Lidia didn't care. Andrea, however, was that friend next door/co-worker type; You saw them all the time and talked, but you didn't see them as anything more. Some time went on and Ian joined the group. Ian was Andrea's long lost brother and no one liked him (including me, but that's beside the point).One day Ian goes out hunting and pulls a Robert Baratheon (mauled by a boar). Ian dies and Andrea is devastated. Calvin and Andrea start to talk a bit more here and there. Next thing I know, they are lovers. Before bed on their first night, they vist the grave of Ian. They go to bed and wake up as usual. That's when it happened.Two raiders appear.Now Lidia and♥♥♥♥♥♥don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥(incapable of violence bull♥♥♥♥♥♥. Othello, Calvin, and Andrea run out and take these thugs down. Calvin is attacking one raider while Othello is taken out by the other and being carried away. Andrea runs to save Othello because Calvin is a big guy and is holding his own. Andrea takes out the raider, but it's too late for Othello. She runs back to Calvin to find the raider has killed him. She beats the holy hell out of that raider and heads to the hospital nearly dead herself. While this is all happening, our only prisoner has gone berserk and breaks out of prison. The prisoner attacks Andrea's dog, Mandy, and beats her to death.Andrea sleeps in the hospital for a whole day and wakes up on the brink of a meltdown.♥♥♥♥♥♥and Lidia try to help with the healing and cleaning, but Andrea winds up wandering off into the forest because of all the grief. I wanted to follow right along side her.Moral of this story: do not become attached. I was warned and learned the hard way. This game is amazing. Buy it already. I read many of these reviews for the stories and was so glad when I finally created some of my own. I can't wait to see what else they do with this game.5/7			"

I quit playing Xbox because this game is that addictive. I've got about 300hours in the past 5weeks of playing. I literality quit playing everything else. Every game is completely random which is what i love about this game, it’s never the same thing.

								Before anything; READ THE FICTION PRIMER!!I know, reading is boring, but it fleshes out the game so much it's almost a shame to pay for it and not know the lore.Here's a little hint to get you started: Humanity never discovered FTL-travel, yet we've conquered the galaxy...What makes Rimworld so good, for me personally, is the depth it has.I know of no other games where your colonists can have fingers shot off, broken wrists, etc.I also know of no other game in which you can harvest organs to implant if your colonist has an old heart!Diseases, psychological breakdowns, a nice social system, ...It all adds up to very immersive gameplay, which I happen to like.It has a large community and a lot of mods, so browse through the workshop a few times in the next few days to add some stuff that you might find usefull to reduce the micromanagement a bit or to add buildings/features. Or visit the nexus(but, since there's a workshop, I'm more lazy than impatient about mods so I'll just browse daily).			"

								I am not normally a huge fan of crafting games even thhough I try - but this game is awesome.You have no direct control of your colonists, it is pretty difficult and quite a bit to figure out but in no way too much like some crafting games. THe recipes etc are straight-forward and the building of things is logical.Played 5 hours in one go as of writing this - wife was shouting at me to come to bed, totally addicted - cannot recommend enough.

								Love, love this game. Been playing for a couple alphas now (since 12) and watching Let's Play videos before that. And it just keeps getting better and better, And the best part of that is that it started out great. This game has been super stable, the only thing ever really causing any issues that I have seen is mods interfering with each other, which is purely an issue with operator error (yes, me, the fool poking at the keyboard.)Other Early Access games need to be stacked up next to this one for comparison. They will nearly all come up very sadly lacking. This game is a masterpiece. Even without the awesome mods this game is great. Many will say ""well the mods are what make it really great"" and while they are certainly correct, the reasons the mods are so good is that the dev planned and coded for those mods to be able to be made from very early on in this game and it shows!

								Tthe thing with rimworld though is it's not a ""game"" persay. It's a story, which is why suddenly and out of nowhere your entire colony is brutally slaughtered by some terrible event. You have 3 different story tellers. One of them, Randy Random can literally drop a giant pirate raid very soon after you crashland, your colony is dead and your story ends. Or you could survive for a little while, or you could survive long enough for you to build a new starship and escape the planet. Rimworld is a story, of survival and hardship. Your colonists suffer ilnesses, infections, injuries. They can lose limbs, eyes etc. They can get dementia, a bad back. A brain injury. Missing eyes. They can also fall in love, get married. Then you have families, a raiding part might attack and one the raiders if the brother of one of your colonists. Then there are rivaleries, just like in the realy world people don't always get along. Say a colonist dies, now a couple other colonist might've been good friends so they'll get a massive hit their mood, as a close friend died but another colonists hated them and now they're dead they're happy and have a spring in their step. Every colonist has traits and backstorys that are randomly generated. Some may be pyromaniacs, others may be cold tolerant, again others might be alcholics, drug addicts, hard works and the list goes on. For bakcstories, they may have been surgeons, builders, bounty hunters, royality and the list goes on. It's a very deep game and immensely satisfying. Unlike other random colony or city builders you get very attached to these colonists because of how deep this game is. "

								TL:DR = build a colony, watch your colonists die, repeat.I bought this game way back in Alpha 4 I believe. It's been years in development but with every update comes a deeper, more refined game.Like many people are saying Rimworld is an unholy union of Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, set in a Fireflyesc universe.In the game you build and manage a group of stranded settlers. Watch as you settlement grows; your colonists develop, interact and eventually die. That last part is something you'll have to get used to as this game can be brutal.Due to this undeniable fact of Rimworld the health system for a game like this is pretty complex with various body parts and effects being simulated. If your colonist gets a toe or two shot off his movement speed will be affective, if he catches a cold his conciousness is affected..  over time your veteran colonists will more than likely loose most of their appendages and require prosthetics.. one of my colonists has none of her original organs as well as having cybernetic limbs and eyes...""she's more machine now than man"".That is just one small aspect of the game however. There are others to worry about too, such as; seasons, temperature, colonist schedules, research, trading, diplomacy, to name a few.This is to say Rimworld hasn't got it flaws, but with all honesty they are usually addressed pretty quickly. At the moment the AI pathfinding can be a bit iffy but chances are this will be fixed in the next update, a sign of a good developer is that they address the underlying flaws in their game before adding new features. An example ot this was the trade caravans and raiders attacking in extreme temperature regions in the previous alpha version. with Alpha 14 they no long do this... so you won't have a trail of corpses leading to your colony after an especially cold winter or hot summer.Overall If your a fan of base builders or managment games then I would wholly recommend this game, even at the current pricetag. It is a game I always play at some point, and it's replayablity is probably one of it's strongest assets, due to it's procedual nature.So please have a go, build a colony and watch it eventually been thrown into chaos either by famine, fire or intergalactic robots.

								I've never wrote a review for a game so that might say something.I'm a long time civilaztion series player and was a bit skeptical when a buddy referred me to this game.  This game was smoothly addicting right off the bat and the stories I've witnessed have been amazing.  My first playthrough ended hilariously.  I captured a raider and threw him in a cell.  Shortly thereafter a heat wave hit.  All 4 of my colonists got severe heatstroke.....and promptly went to their beds unresponsive.  The prisoner must have sensed his opportunity.  He beat down the prison door and was loose in my base.  I was mortified that he'd destroy everything but he went for the front door & beat it down for his freedom.....awww sigh of relief.  But no wait- not so fast!!! On the way out he decided to set fire to a power line. Again not terrible because the line was pretty far away from my wooden walls.  He then ran into an angry tortoise.  The tortoise bit him.....he fell back with surprise and stumbled into his own fire. He wandered into my wooden walls panicked & ablaze - fell down next to them with his last breath. He promptly burnt to a crisp.  The walls caught fire from his burning corpse. Every poor colonist laying unconsious in their beds ended in fire that day on the rim.Rip my little dudes....ripYou can't make this stuff up.  Buy it now- this game will not disappoint			"

								This is a great strategy and base building game that has so much to offer. The core game is great, but the mod community makes the game even better. I have been using mods to create massive bases and have raids against dozens of raiders and it is a blast. I also have a barebones game where I am struggling with few resources on hand. There is a lot going on this game and the documentation is alright, but I learned a lot by trial and error and watching youtube videos. The events in the game like diseases and toxic fallouts keep you on your toes. It can be really intense as you struggle to keep everything in working order. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys base building games. I can't wait to see what the final product looks like as the development team seems to really know what they are doing. I would be shocked if they fell into the rut that many game developers do where the alpha is good but they make changes that seem to make no sense and upset the players. 9/10 would harvest organs of prisoners again			"

That is the game which you lead your own humane tearful story of survival and love? Cowboys of space, tribals with spears, robots with laser guns... and your cute little pets. People come and go. Surviors strive to make a living and fail. But that maybe is yet another good representation of the world we live in today, isn't it?

								After 75 hours I finally beat the game after 4 attemps!Ok lets try to describe this game for others:The game is a mix between an random generated world, mixed with base building like in Prison Architect, Unique ""Characters"" that are somekind randomized.I know it really sounds simple - in the core it is - but in my opinion it's hard to master!There are random event that can change everything...Your colony is up and running?Dry Thunderstorm which spreads 4 fires at once over the whole map and all trees start burning and your only have 4 colonists who will die in the flames... Next round i thought about cutting all the trees near my building so the fire can't spread that fast!Srsly I love this game it gave me sooooo much joy! I'll keep this game in my mind.Although the game doesn't really have a real story, but all the random events and encounters telling their own story - despite the fact that the story will develop in you mind!Pro:+ Unique Gameplay+ Good Mix of Genres+ High Replayability+ Random Events*Cons:- Random events*- Sometimes not enough options for certain mechanics*Sometimes those Random Events are unbalanced, therefore it can be a Pro/Con.

								I don't really need to give a proper review, since the top reviews already do a good job. I just wanna bump up the rating.This game seems like there's a ton to manage at first, but you get used to it fast. Don't go in expecting to ""win"" right away. This is a game about making due with what you have, and learning from failure.God help you if you get a colonist with 2 cataracts, a bad back, and frail body, who is incapable of dumb labor, skilled labor, intelligent work, being social, or tending to wounds. If that happens, just have them box with a panther. They aren't worth the food.			"

								I have put about 60 hours into this game over the last few years of alpha.Rimworld has an amazing ability to draw you into creating your own story and getting attached to your colonists. The depth of the game allows some amazing, catastrophic, and absolutely hilarous things to happen. The developers release timely, extremely significant updates that take a strong foundation and keep improving it. This game can already be considered a full game with a huge amount of replayability. They also seem to be extremely nice people that care about makig a great game more than making a profit, which can be seen in the trust they give players regarding DRM. I hope that they can eventually make both of the above.Couldn't recommend this game more. (And it seems at this point out of 316 reviews, 316 are positive, so we are a strong majority haha!)			"

								This review is for those who think is alpha worth it? Is the price right? Is game playable?This is propably the best game i have played this year. consept is brilliant. Something i always wanted from a game. Littlebit of everything. And oh loord how it is deep in gameplay. Every colony is different. Every character (pawn) is different. You get deep stories from game mechanics that randomize most things and that is rare thing in gamingworld.First time you play, don't read guides. just play. Learn. It gets dramatic. Try to survive. Trade, fight pirates, make awesome base, tame rare animals, have pets, aaaand the list goes on and on.Game is very playable at this state, and i don't get feeling that its missing something. It's solid build.Worth your penny? well ive been playing it now nonstop for days. And i promise, you will too.EDIT: ive played earlier builds, hence low hours.Stories: - My colony doctor got his leg blown off. Other pawns tries to keep him fed and safe with bad doctoring skills. Choices had to be made. He is not contributing to colony anymore. what to do? Lays in bed for months. Desperatly tried to find trader that sells prostetic leg to us. did'nt find one. Some butchering took place. -Main hero, ex military, alcoholic. No social skills, does'nt mind blood and is damn good fighter. Wounds all over his body. Has constant pains. Always in bad mood. Some colonists start fighting each other and in chainreaction people get bit berzerk. Main man Mr. Darkwood slaugthers them all in kitchen area. After that sits down and start eating lunch like a BAWS he is.-Main research dude Mr.reid is old with mad research skills, is hard working. Also have frekking dementia!! Constantly forget who he is and gets mental state. Always wandering around the map just staring stuff XD			"

It is more fully-featured, stable and has a better community than many of the triple A titles I've seen in recent years which all depend on pushing out a bare-bones base game ASAP and then leech users with endless expansions (I'm looking at you EA).I've put hundreds of hours into Rimworld pre-steam and I look forward to doubling that now that it's on steam!

I think my favorite part is how indepth the traits & interactions of these little pawns are. I find myself getting really attached to my settlers because they each have their own personalities. I also love the modding community around Rimworld. There are mods for just about everything in the game. The modders are usually very helpful, & the developer actually pays attention to what the modders are making. Occasionally, you'll see that the developer has added contact from a mod into the actual base game.Overall, very fun little survival crafting game. I'd highly recommend it to people who like chill base building, like me, (easier modes), & those who like more challenging stategic fortess builders (harder modes). 8.5/10.			"

								There are two kinds of people who play this game: 1) hardcore players who live for the thrill of almost-certain death (really, it only takes time--plague WILL get you), or 2) p*ssies who reload saves when a beloved colonist's head gets one-shotted into oblivion. I am (mostly) unashamed to say that I am one of the latter. Point is, there's a place in this great game for both types. So for all those tender-hearted people out there who have heard about how amazing this game is but are aghast after reading about man-hunting wild boars, psychopathic organ harvesters and vomitty plague, worry not. Go ahead and build your little utopic base for your colonists, because you only wanted to escape your tacky old pop superstar life after your career tanked in that unfashionable old midworld to make ugly-*ss statues which you can never sell because you foolishly made them out of pure gold that the traders won't ever have enough money to buy and instead will be sniffed out by raiders who have a true appreciation for your unique artistry.

								Let me tell you a love story about Angus(M) and Pitts(F).After  establishing what I consider to be a 'OK' base I realize Angus is starting to have a lot of breakdowns. The caring and loving man that I am I find out Angus is getting rejected by Pitts for marriage. Poor guy, so I make him a completely seperate house so he never has to see that who**res face again as Pitts shows no remorse for her actions. After one of his constant breakdowns (I still don't know if he was asking her everyday or what) he goes nuts, not about Pitts but BECAUSE HE ATE FOOD WITHOUT A TABLE! So after my hunter smashes his face in I decide Angus is too much trouble for his worth and let him die as a horrible infection spread throughout his body.Now for the happy ending, I decide because Pitts thought it was cool to play hard to get she has to eat Angus's flesh which turns her crazy (she was 'sad' Angus died, lying dou**che). Hunter (I think his name was Lester?) smashes her face too, and then strips down and starts walking around because he wasn't a big fan of being used as a modern day executioner. I think this game has a pretty accurate outlook on modern day relationships, best dating sim 2016.			"

								First of all, I already bought the game about 1.5 years before steam launch which explains the low amount of hrs on record!In my opinion Rimworld is incredibly well made. It is both a challenging and fun game which offers a lot of variation with many interesting surprises throughout the gameplay. Quite frequently I just had to smile about the creativity of the developers, when getting challenged by different situations. But most of all I love the atmosphere! The vibe of Rimworld is very unique and makes the whole gameplay really enjoyable. Furthermore, the developers are fantastic. When I purchased the game there was a daily log everyone could follow, which showed what the devs had been working with on a daily basis. Generally, it feels like the project is taken seriously, with regular updates and good development transparency. Also, although early access this game gives more a feel of a finished game in terms of content and replay value.I can only recommend the game and think the price is absolutely decent for what you get.

Do so without a hitch, killing the mechanoid baddie that was protecting it>Survive winter.>Fight off a raid that blows off my guy's left leg and shoots my right, so it became infected. Had to amputate because the infection got so bad it was gonna kill him>Marshall now has 1 ear, no stomach, 2 peg legs. What a ♥♥♥♥ing beast.>Another manhunting pack of muffalo comes at us. Peg legs saves the day as everyone else was downed. Peg leg cracked in the fight lol. Repaired doe.>Second winter coming>Finally died when 14 tribesmen rushed him and he couldn't run away quick enough to save himself. Most epic.I funded this game before it was on steam and have had so many horus of enjoyment out of this game. The additions made to the steam version weren't really bragged about by the developers as much, but they have added so much to the game, and the fact that they made light of those additions makes me believe that there's much more that they're planning to add, which is so huge because I've already given this game countless hours (unlogged, as I mostly play in offline mode).If there is a game that has come out in the past 5 years worth spending money on even in early access. It's Rimworld.I haven't read any of the negative reviews (Not that there are many), but I can only think of one negative, and that's that the maps only have 1 level (You can't climb hills, or dig downward) and maybe that's something the developers will add at some point. Still worth the money, maybe even more than asking price to be honest. This game will be a classic that will be talked about years from now, provided humans survive the coming world war.			"

								I had RimWorld since Alpha12 and, just as it advertises, it's already fully playable, balanced, and free of bugs.This game is great for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in a story that they're writing, where the characters are their own colonists who have intense and relevant needs, social interactions, and feelings.It's great for anyone who wants a tough and gritty but exciting experience.For you, i'd reccomened this game, 100%.You may not like this game if you want to make a max-efficiency production machine. This game is more about caring for your colonists and the stories of fights, disease outbreaks, and generally bad weather then it is about being able to wall yourself in and produce masterwork parkas until you get bored.For you, i'd reccomened Dwarf Fortress or Factorio.My apologies if it's badly worded or hard to read, i'm not a very good writer I find.

								RimWorld is like Steam Early Access: a black hole from which nothing escapes. This game is an absolute diamond that wasn't on my radar at all, but has fully enthralled me for way longer than it should have. RimWorld is all about managing a colony of people whom you will get to know and love or hate.Before you begin a game, RimWorld presents you with a randomized selection of colonists. Each of these folks has a varying skill proficiency list which includes basic skills like Cleaning, Hauling, and Harvesting or more advanced skills like Medicine, Crafting, and Warden (Sheriff). Along with a skillset, your colonists may also have other traits such as Pyromania, Drug Addictions, and even old injuries. Just as you would assume traits can have quite an effect on your colonist, sometimes for better and yet other times for worse.There are several biomes in which you can land in (or migrate to if starting as Tribals) and colonize all of which have positives and negatives. Are you in a boreal forest location? Winter will come eventually and your people need warm clothes and warm rooms if they are to survive without complaint. Did you pick a desert? Most of the year you'll have to combat high temperatures and a lack of some materials that would be plentiful elsewhere.When you decide your initial band of survivors and colony location, you'll be dropped into the game proper. Immediately your group is in dire straits: you need shelter and food. Luckily RimWorld is populated with many different types of materials with which to build and much in the way of things to eat.Besides constructing actual buildings for your pawns to live in there are also different crafting stations that allow the creation of various items like weapons and armor to clothes and drugs. If you are feeling a little country, you can try your hand at farming crops and tending animals. Electricity is another option and there are several ways to generate it as well as several ways to expend it including colored lights and television.After you get your colony up and running, your chosen A.I. will start throwing you curve-balls depending on your difficulty choices. Random events will occur and they can range from a raid by Pirates who definitely want that booty to wandering packs of animals that will join you or attempt to eat you.RimWorld is incredibly fun when things are going as you plan. However the game really shines when it is able to exploit a flaw in your colony setup. When you first lose a colonist, it is a painful experience. The next hundred lives lost don't go by any easier. Many may be tempted to simply start a new colony or reload a save game, but these losses are where the player learns how to deal with and react to each situation. Without the possibility of loss, the game would have little substance. That being said, there is a generous amount of frustration here for those unwilling or unable to let go of their village people and animals. Luckily we can construct tombs with which to honor their sacrifice.I was not an early backer for RimWorld. I learned of it's existence shortly after it arrived on Steam. Kotaku had a RimWorld article about some guy's crazy naked doctor that ate people and I knew I needed this, damn whatever flaws it would have being Alpha. This is the most complete game in Early Access that I have ever played. It is more complete than many AAA games that we pay twice the price for. However this is something that people need to understand: there are features still being added. When a major patch is put out, your progress up to that point is made invalid without some workaround. While that does suck, a major patch usually means a new feature or two so it is a bittersweet thing at worst.			"

								I bought this game a few months back and I'm so glad I did. This game is awesome if you like basebuilding and survival in a micromanagement setup, where each individual in your colony have certain trades that makes them faster at learning certain things. And then there are the quircks of each one, making each of the crewmembers you make absolutely unique. On a side note, yes it's expensive, but there is so much content for an early access titel, with everything running smoothly (haven't encountered any bugs at all since I bought it). So yes, while it is expensive, it's worth every penny			"

You can have a extremely easy or a very hard start. Thins i would love to see: Have a AI controlled colony setup in the same map as you (bigger) with relatively smart AI. That you can either friend or foe.So ill keep it short. Depending on your difficulty you can have a base builder, or a OMG please give me peace game.Tl'dr - Make a base, get raided.

								Rimworl has been on my wishlist for about 6 months and when I finally got it I was familiar with how to command AI since I played prison architect before which is very similar graphic and mechanic wise. I put 12 hours into this game keep in mind I had school as well as homework to do! This game is so addcitive and you want your colonists to thrive and you grow attached it is hard to see your favorite die haha. Overall this game is awesome I was able to..-Save people and habve them join me-Keep prisoners and do surgeries on them which was cool-See my colonists fight-Fixed broken limbs colonists have gotten due to fights-Traveled in caravans across the rimworld(different seed for each world so the world generates randomly)And so much more!I recommend to this game to anybody who is ddepluy into games such as prison architect, sims, etc. and they should give this a try because it is a awesome game. I cannot wait to see what updates they have for us in the future to make the game EVEN BETTER than it alreayd is!			"

								Tynan is one of the most transparent developers I have ever spoken to. Now more than ever, you have to be very careful about buying into an early access game. Many early access games have faded into obscurity or failed to deliver on any of their promise. RimWorld is not one of those games. The modding community for this game is already great, and will be made even better with workshop support. Whether you're a masochist that doesn't mind your entire colony being decimated every other day or a casual base builder, the game and the modding community has something to enhance your experience. Every update comes with a ton of new features to try out.If you like Prison Architect, this game is probably right up your alley. You have to manage all aspects of your colonist's lives: their joy, moods, health, food, living spaces...I recommend checking out the Twitch community for RimWorld if you are debating whether or not to get the game. Sacriel is probably one of the biggest streamers that plays. However, an entire other community has evolved for the game as well. There is a group that does speed running for the game (you can launch a ship to escape the world) to see who can get off the planet first. These streamers (ZeebosZone, disnof, spartyon7) play at the highest difficulty and often with storytellers that can send multiple raids each day. They also do other fun challenges, such as the Ice Sheet challenge (starting off on the coldest map seed and trying to survive), or the Cannibalism Only challenge. The fact that there are so many different challenges and restrictions you can make for yourself is one of the greatest things about this game and ensures for a ton of replayability. "

								Definitely a game of stories. It is what makes this game so amazing. Here is my favorite so far.Ricky and Anna were 2 of 3 crash survivors. Anna was a medic, and Ricky could build practically anything. Together they built a life on Rimworld, and made the most of a bad situation. They found solace in each other after many hardships, and eventually they moved in and spent a couple of seasons bunked up. Things were looking up. Progress on their community was moving at an incredible speed with Ricky's engineering background. Anna kept everyone happy and healthy through the random raids. But new settlers arrived, and everything changed. One was a slimmer fellow by the name of Alpha (fitting). Anna took a liking to Alpha, but Ricky had no idea. He was in love with Anna and asked her to marry him. She turned him down, and shortly after, Ricky found out she was cheating on him with Alpha. This broke Ricky's heart. He built his own home, and watched as Anna and Alpha moved in together. This ate at him. Each day his mood became darker and darker until eventually he could take it no more. He caught Anna alone outside of the perimeter and attacked her with a knife, cut her right ear off, and stabbed her numerous times. She fell to the ground bleeding profusely. One of the guards showed up and subdued Ricky, locking him up with other prisoners. Alpha, with a bit of medical background, was able to save Anna, and nurse her back to health. He also helped Ricky recover...a mistake that would almost destroy the community.Even after healing up, Ricky had become highly unstable. Nothing could sate his rage. The community needed him for his building skills, but every time he seemed to improve, madness would overcome him, and he would have to be subdued by a guard or warden before he could do more harm. The community made a mistake keeping Ricky and the other prisoners in wooden rooms. Trying to earn their trust, perhaps welcoming them into the colony one day. Ricky took advantage of this. He, with two other prisoners, staged a prison break. While the other two prisoners went to dig their way out of a back room, Ricky began rampaging through the colony. He was finally shot and killed by a guard with a shotgun. Ricky had gone too far. The other two prisoners managed to escape, never to be seen again. Thankfully Anna had recovered by the time of the prison break, and with Alpha's help, they nursed the injured community members back to health. They all visit his grave from time to time and give what thanks they can to this troubled man who almost single handedly built their community, and almost tore it apart. A season later and Anna and Alpha are getting married come summer. After surviving a toxic fallout winter, and other hardships, apparently they grew closer together. Anna also just passed her 54 birthday, and as a gift, the gods gave her Carcinoma.			"

Early Access Review
								Although Steam tells you something different, I have bought this game soon after it's Kickstarter campaign and easily collected over 100 hours of playtime in the past three years. I can say that this was literally the game I waited for without knowing it when I first saw it. While it has an excellent presentation it gives you the complete freedom of choice how to develop your colony on the one hand, but also an ultimate goal, building a spaceship, on the other.Before you keep on reading a word to the few negative reviews from new players: Yes, this is a complex game. As someone said on the discussions: ""It's not a FPS where you start on heroic difficulty becasue you know shooters."" It's a game with many mechanics you will have to learn before beeing good at it, I recommend enableing the adaptive tutorial to learn the basic systems. It's also a very slow paced game with eventual peaks in form of raids or such. The two hours you have to decide if you want to refund are not nearly enough to see all the facades of the game and get a complete picture of it. Now on to the positives.Wether you want to build an underground complex or a large fortress, all stragtegies are viable and have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you need to hold a large base you will have lots of walls which you need to defend and the enemy may break through at different locations. But while you can keep your entry small and defendable if you go underground, you eventually will have to fight bug hives which can spread sub-surface and enemies which are equipped with granades and pickaxes in order to dig their way to you.The incredible amount of replayability also thrives from the different biomes and the recently added scenario system. Each of the eight climatic environments has unique weather, animals, diseases and challenges. The scenarios give you the ability to never play twice with the same starting condition, may it be the number of colonists, items and conditions of the map or forced cannibalism.There is also an active mod community which has specialised on vanilla- and lore friendly mods that truely expand the game to it's full potential. Every veteran will be able to give you a list of some length with mods that he/she considers necessary to play the game. Of course it's not unplayable without mods but they do add many quality-of-life improvements which make playing the game easier.Many people ask why they should pay 30$ for an early access title. Bear in mind that the early access is there to indicate that the game is still beeing worked on. However it has met all his goals, is polished, optimized and generally bug-free. You are basically looking at a finished game which will get expanded in the future and thus is marked as an early access. The developer, Tynan Sylvester, who made this game almost on his own, usually releases new mayor builds every three to four months, introducing new and basic game mechanics, like the scenario system, but we will have to see how steam dynamic will change this. If there are bugs which survived the extensive testing phase, you can count on a hotfix beeing published within days.RimWorld is what it says: a story generator. Usually I'm very suspicious about games who claim that, but in this case it is totally correct. Stories on the forums range from prisoners getting torn apart in order to sell their organs to colonists which give their lives in a heroic last stand to save the colony. If you're not sure, head over to the  stories forum [ludeon.com] and read one or two to a glass of your favourite relaxing drink.Anyone who has an interest in strategy, building and/or science fiction should buy this game and probably wont be disappointed.

								I actually have hundreds of hours in Rimworld. I purchased this game several years ago, and have actually spoke to Tynan a few times. He's a guy that really knows what he wants, and as the lead for this game you can see it. I have countless stories of my Colonies and their downfall is ultimately what makes it great. The AI Storyteller sent a pack of onfire muffalo to my colony which overwhelmed my colonist, and then a pirate raid occured at the same time while my Colony was onfire. Just one example of some of the randomness that can ensue. Rest assured, if you give this game a few hours and a few tries - you'll fall in love with it just like I have. Over the years there has been massive additions to the game, It isn't even the same game I first played several years ago. Happy Colonizing.			"

It's a rare occasion for me to find a game that I absolutely cannot put down. RimWorld is officially a game I cannot put down. I can't wait for this to be a finished game so I can unlock achievments. The only thing that I really hope the Developers add is multiplayer. Imagine being able to have 4 or 6 people go to a world and make huge colonies and fight for the world. But you could only attack the other persons base if they were online. Something like that would be cool. BUY THIS GAME NOW			"

								Rimworld is easily one of my favorite games. Vanilla RW is polished, engaging, full-featured, and grim. The community is ranked among the best: friendly, helpful, and industrious. Choose from hundreds of mods to greatly expand on the gameplay, enhancing complexity and QoL, and adding more of everything! It feels like the dev works on enhancements to the framework of the game, while the mod community handles filling out the content. This is in my opinion the correct relationship for small or one-man development teams. This will without any doubt be a game I will be playing for many years to come.

Early Access Review
								I've been playing RimWorld for a very long time. Way before it came out on Steam, I probably have close to 500 hours in the game already off Steam. Personally I think the game is already great and it just keeps getting better and better as more updates come out. I very rarely encounter any bugs and when I do they barely have an effect on the gameplay. The modding community is great, people are constantly hard at work to create bigger and better mods. From what I've seen the staff is fantastic as well. If you're worried this game is going to be another one of those early access games that take all your money and then cease development don't be. It's been in steady development for years and it's going to keep going for quite some time.			"

								I've been playing this game off and on again for the last two years before it came to steam. It's an amazing game, and it's very easy to find yourself playing this game for hours and hours at a time without realizing. The game has a built in storyteller which determines the events that happen to or arround the colony, this makes it so that even when you may lose and your game may end, it's usually to something different each time and keeps the game interesting and fresh. It makes it a lot less painful when you lose and have to begin a new colony. Which is probably something you'll end up doing quite a bit. So pretty much buy it, it's worth a lot more than it costs.

								An enjoyable strategy game, it can be tough on newcomers, but very fun once you get the hang of it. Whether the difficulty is set on easy basebuilding or living nightmare, RimWorld is exciting and full of adventure. Best enjoyed for those with an adventurous and imaginative mind, but still fun for all.			"

								This game is astonishing. The stories that are created as you struggle to survive everything the game throws at you will stay in your head for a while, from great triumphs to the (more likely) bitter defeats. There's something morbidly satisfying of watching you colony burn to the ground, swarming with raiders, as your colonists bleed out alone on the floor.  Developer is hugely active in both development and community; both through their own website and on reddit's /r/rimworld. Mods are constantly being developed that change the dynamic of your play-style.First game to make me actively weigh the pros and cons of cannibalism. You can harvest human skin and turn it into leather for cowboy hats. Favorite crafter has asthma? Take a prisoner and harvest their lungs. Sure, the prisoner will die, but your crafter can breathe easily again! Or build towards an entirely bionic colony and travel the globe murdering everything in your way. You can just capture them all and sell them into slavery instead, which is a great way to make bank. Although drug production is a rather lucrative option as well, if you're willing to deal with the occasional addicted dog that got into your cocaine stash.You can see average hours of other reviewers, and you can see the fascinating stories. The price does appear a bit steep as you're browsing around the Steam Store, but I, personally, have found it to be worth every penny. That steep price actually led me to download the free* version to make sure I wasn't being swindled by EA promises (oh StarForge, how you've betrayed me). Three hours in, I deleted it and happily bought the official version. Now I'm actually debating on picking up another copy or two to gift to Steam friends, to both further support the developer, and spread the gift of catastrophe.Get it now.*Yeah, there isn't a free version, but I think we all got that.

								I started this game and before I knew it 10 hours had passed.  My first play through was a disaster, but it was a disaster that was so engrossing that I couldn't look away.  TL:DR Buy the game.To me the whole story was about Mary or ""Mars"" as everyone called her. She was stranded on this planet with her son and a rough looking miner who had an eye for her. They sat up a colony by the side of a lake until a soldier named Jack radioed for help. The colonists of Laketown rescued him and patched his wounds. Mars and Jack fell in love almost instantly. Jack was the backbone of the colony and made sure everything ran smoothly, Mars was proud to love a man like that. One bright day, Jack stumbled into some ruins filled with mechanized warriors. They were hostile and chased him back to the colony. One by one the colonists fell, until only Mars and a girl named AJ were left. They were able to finish off the robots and to try to treat the wounds of the other colonists. It was pointless though, all the medicine was gone and there were no traders in the area. The first cassuality was her son, he got an infection in his leg, then Jack, her beloved Jack, then the rough space miner had to be euthanized because of a shattered spine, AJ did that, she never liked him and got a little pleasure out of it, Mars thought she was sick. That was the breaking point for Mars, she snapped and killed all of the other colonist, suffering mortal wounds as she did. Mars died alone in her bed, insane with grief. They say when you visit the lake on a quite night, you can hear Mars, her son and Jack all laughing and playing horse shoes, united together again.			"

								So everything was lovely in ""Melhadfs World"", crops were growing indoors under a sun lamp safely, everyone had a bedroom, the solar power surplus was enough to get through a winter night without difficulty. Even Raids were easily defeated.But then a storm came, greater than anything else. Lightning tore the sky, and my colonists slept.  Nothing could disturb the sleep of the hard working survivors. They had earned it.Over the horizon a predawn light grew, a flicker at first in the distance, then another on the opposite horizon and a third to the south. The light grew brighter, a blaze slowly enveloping the screen. the colonists awoke to fire ripping through the roof, all but one immeditately started to put out the blaze.  The other one, well she did the most british thing possible, she prepared a meal and cup of tea for the firefighters.But the blaze was too out of control, slowly people succumbed to the effects of the fire, passing out and being consumed in the blaze. While the lone tea maker wondered what had happened. She eventually went looking for them, upon seeing their corpses she ran into the blaze to save her lover... but it was not to be and she died just out of arms reach of him.The fire consumed everything, leaving nothing but 8 burnt bodies.

								Surpisingly fun and addictive! Having bought this game on a whim, I had little to no expectations going forward, now I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Rimworld provides a unique approach to city management, resource management, building, and simulation / strategy genres while remaining simple enough in gameplay to quickly pick up and run with it. Though simple in design, there are enough random elements and variables within the characters and maps to make for a true infinite possibility of gameplay, true re-playability at its finest. If you've been on the fence about this game make the leap, you'll be sorry you didn't do it sooner!

								I have been playing RimWorld since very early alpha, about 2 years now. This is the best colony simulator I have ever played, and I have played them all up to now.If you are worried about this being Alpha, don't be. The game is updated regularly and with tons of new cool features every time. Also the modding community is massive and the game changes dramatically (harder / easier, more realistic / hundreds of new options) whichever you prefer based on what mods you use. Before Steam release I used about 30 mods, and they work well together. I imagine modding will be even better (if possible) on steam.Graphics are awesome (kind of like Prison Architect) gameplay is incredible and depth of immersion is fantastic.I can't give this game less than a 10 out of 10.If you love colony type games (DF, Gnomoria, etc...) You will love RimWorld! Buy it now! You will not be burned by ""early access"" on this one. The game is already 100% playable.			"

								tl:dr - Do try this game.  Don't get attached to your colonists. Kill all the cougars.There were five of us.Daniel ""Dan""Olesya ""Lalande""Theodore ""Seraph""his brother, TanIvanand Flora, our retriever.We started out with a modest farm, built into the mountain, slept out in the cold.  Things weren't easy but there were livable.  Tan was getting over his Flake addiction by taking up sculpting, Dan trained Flora and they were inseperable. Lalande and Seraph hooked up on day one.  Ivan was Ivan.We managed to get up a solar panel, a battery, and a freezer within just a few days.  Next task was working on living quarters.  However before too long a pair of raiders came hunting us down.  We killed one and knocked out the other one.  Threw him in a makeshift cell and learned his name at least. Finn wasn't so bad.  Ivan sort of befriended him.  A day after that a woman ran into camp to hide from some local tribe.  Her name was Carson.  We took care of the pair of tribesmen rather quickly.  Things couldn't be going better.  It was only a matter of time before something happened.A cougar, of all things.  Started huntin Flora.  It was by far the better predator and killed our dog.  Daniel lost her leg to that thing before we managed to put it down.  The damage was done.  So we made a tomb for Flora, and set Daniel in bed.  We had used up all our medicine so we couldn't do much about a prosthetic.  Sometime after that, Seraph and Lalande got engaged, Ivan convinced Finn to join us, then started dating Carson.  I guess Ivan isn't so odd after all.  A drop pod got us some medication so Daniel could get the medical procedure she needed to walk again.Then we hit a dry spell.  Nothing happened for days.  We built rooms for everyone. Celebrated the Wedding of Seraph and Lalande, and even Ivan ended up proposing.  Everything went to hell so fast.  Middle of the night, a battery overloaded and started a fire in the freezer.  All our food went up in flames.  Ivan and Carson died trying to put out the fire.  They never got to get married.  The rest of them waited outside as the fire died down. Our farms survived.  We had four stable crops that gave a steady supply almost daily.  So we started rebuilding.  What would you know another damn cougar shows up and takes down Daniel.  Finn tried to lay some cover fire, and Lalande grabbed a knife.  Sadly they weren't quick enough.  Daniel died that day.  It took her arm this time, and even chewed off a bit of Lalande's toe.  Finn started cowering and Tan finished it off before it could get more of Lalande.So now there's four of us.  And I still can't stop playing despite the pain and suffering.  I can't help but cheer on the survivors, and hope for the best.  At least I've got Tan, Seraph, and Lalande.			"

								Fun and addicting game. Primely features town simulation and survival.I lost a lot of sleep when I first started this game.What I like about this developer is that he is always participating on his own forums too.And Rimworld doesn't really count as Early Access any more.Now. Surviving on a Rimworld...A colonist gets their foot and arm shot off, or cut off by the assorted wildlife and invaders.This makes them very innefficient, and I notice how bad this was after watching the injured colonist hunt elephants one handed, and limp away very slowly.I luckily have a prisoner that I kidnapped from a recent raid.I chop them up for spare body parts.Transplant those onto my injured colonist.Good as new!Now the rest of the colony is horrified towards what was done on the prisoner.But they had a fun party recently, which calms them down. One colonist was a beautiful woman, but after losing a hand and an eyeball, nobody in the colony likes looking at her any more.Fixed this by inserting an eyeball made out of solid gold and giving her a wooden hook hand.Now they think she's beautiful again.Another pirate gets a lucky shot and shoots a colonist in the head. Damaging her brain so bad she becomes a vegetable.Colonists have to deliver her food each day to keep her alive.Have to find a brain implant to fix her.An orbital trader eventually comes along and has one.It's more expensive than the rest of my colony combined.Food stores are getting low, and I now really have to consider whether it's worth it to keep this vegetable colonist alive.Surgeryworld.

								I've only played 15 hours so far, but I know I have a great many to come. For my review, I'll talk about some gameplay I had.My last colony, I started with one man, Arkady (and dog, Orange), some rss and a joywire. Built some simple rooms against the rock face. Joined by one guy, Stephen, helps me mine out some more rooms into the rock face. A little later a good grower and cook comes along, Anna. Things are really starting to go well, making meals and growing crops, lots of steel. Fought off an attack well, got some extra guns but Orange died. Arkady upset, buries the dog.Get a message about an escape pod. I rescue the pod lady, but as soon as she regains the ability to walk she is off. I check her health, she's bleeding and as I watch one of her stats drops a level. Ok, draft Stephen and arrest her. She can stay here until she is healed. I forget about her for a bit and things go on well.Then, a larger raider group comes through with high calibre weaponry and the skill to use it. Right, draft all my guys up, let's get out there and shoot these guys. Did well the first time.As we approached, Arkady and Anna take up long ranged positions. Enemy sniper shoots first. Blows Arkady's leg clean off. Second shot destroyed his stomach. Stephen roared, charged the sniper, who calmly blew his head off. Anna, without stopping to think, grabs up the screaming mess that was Arkady and runs back to base, locks the door and tries to stop the blood pouring from Arkady's ruined lower body.The raiders take a few items but never enter the base itself, leaving a few hours later. Between feeding the prisoner and tending Arkady's wounds, Anna built a prosthetic peg leg for Arkady. It was then she noticed he wasn't eating, slowly starving to death. Of course, the stomach was destroyed. This is when the prisoner came to mind.That night, when the pod lady was sleeping, Anna stole into the cell and put her under anesthetic. A short while later, pod lady's stomach had been removed without killing the patient, and transplanted (as well as the peg leg) into Arkady. Who became infected.While Anna tried to keep up with the cooking, feeding and treatment of Arkady, the pod lady awoke. She was not happy at all. In fact, she flew into a full on psychotic rage. Can't say I blame her, she'd been held against her will for several days now and had woken to find her stomach gone. Anna tried to explain that this was never what they meant to happen, while pod lady proceeded to pummel her into unconsciousness before fleeing into the night.Arkady heard all this, slowly dying from infection. Depressed about the loss of Stephen and Orange, barely conscious, he slipped away later that night. Perhaps he just lost the will. Anna lay in the halfway outside, slowly bleeding out while drifting in and out of consciousness. Her last thought was how it had all been for nothing in the end. They'd taken her stomach, and he had died anyway.Pod lady's future is unknown. Maybe she found help in time. Most likely she starved in the forest, without even a rumbling of her, now rotting, stomach. END.Each of my play throughs has had this unique feel to it, with stories generated from the game naturally. The difficulty and struggle, coupled with the ability to make morally questionable choices in order to survive, make this feel very real. Would steal someones stomach again.Note: I played Dwarf fortress for many hours, and that is a very good game. Its inpiration to this game is very clear in the mechnics and playstyle of this game. DF is, however, very complex and very niche. Rimworld is DF that is accessible to both hardcore and casual gamers.Small Update: Some hours further in with the vanilla game, having a lot of fun. Decided to check out and run some mods. There are a lot of very good mods. Very active, dedicated and talaneted collection of modders in this community. The developers of this game have made mod support a priority, this much is evident. The vanilla game has a huge number of playable hours, practically limitless because of the variations. With mods, the combinations of play styles, stories and setting are truly uncountable. TL;DR If I could put five thumbs up, I would.			"

								I have more than 100 hours on the pre-steam versions and I have to say it is an excelent game. Even on super easy the randomised traits of your people are fun to plan around and on super difficult the challenges are varied and sometimes hilarious. From having drunken jealous lovers beating eachother with bottles to plague outbreaks and vengeful squirrels, I have really enjoyed this game from designing colonies at the start struggling to survive to protecting what little you have from the onslaught of an uncaring universe. I strongly recommend.			"

								Fun sci-fi colony builder with great replayability and cool random encounters.From my last permadeath playthrough:- Food is running low, so I mark a stag for hunting.- My hunter shoots the stag and knocks him out.- The rest of the herd notice, become agressive towards my hunter and knock him out.- Their bloodlust not sated, the herd turn towards my colony and starts rampaging through the buildings.- I order the remaining colonists to bunker down in the mess hall.- The herd tries to crash through the door, but it mercifully holds. The colonists cower in fear.- Using the door I carefully start luring the deer in my kill zone.- Finally manage to kill all the deer. My dog is in rough shape and the hunter, though alive, still needs rescuing.- Take care of the wounded.- Carve up all the animals and use their meat to make meals.- Close call, but the colony suddenly has enough food to last for two seasons.... Awesome :)			"

								I've played a few early access games and Riwworld is one of my favourite games.   I've backed this back in 2013 and I tend to play couple of hours a week with it.   No two games are the same when playing and it can be super frustrating or super awesome.   I've still yet to actually escape from this Rimworld but I've loved every second.      The game can seem super complicated at first but it's easy to pick up the basics and you will soon be growing, mining, researching and maybe eating human flesh.The basic premise of the game is you crash land on a planet and have to survive.   Will you dig deep into the mountains and make a fortress, build a massive log castle outside that might just get set fire to by raiders or wait and build up super strong stone walls.Now about the game the standard vanilla rimworld is lots of fun and will give you hours of gameplay.  But then if you add in the fact this game loves mods and some of the mods people produce are insanely good.   Do you like zombies then there is a mod, do you like raiders on atv's there is a mod for that, how about mods that manage your resource levels yep again there is a mod.With the inbuilt modding in alpha 14 it makes it super easy to apply mods and you can do it all from in game from the steam workshop which is AMAZING.   If you struggle installing mods as it seems complicated you will love this.Oh and alpha 14 now has a scenario editor so you can create custom scenarios to play.   Imagine starting out a new colony with 100 pet elephants yes you can become hannibal and have a horde of elephants its mucho fun.I think the price is fine considering this came out three years and I'm still playing it, it's still got an active developer and super passionate fans.  So don't think you are getting a buggy early game with placeholder game as you are buying an awesome game.Just don't blame me after launching the game and hours have vanished from your life haha.

								My short review:  Wow - just wow!I haven't been this hooked on a game in years!  It's tough, your colonists will die and sometimes your entire colonies will die - but the experience is incredibly fun.  It's definitely not an easy game (at least not when playing on the 3rd difficulty level), but it is very rewarding.The depth in this game is amazing.  Colonists have lots of different personality traits, there are lots of things to research and build, each world is different, and there are many types of random events.  And the really cool thing is all of these things are significant.  Also, the modding community is great.  The base game is loads of fun, but I highly recommend getting some of the popular mods once you get used to the basics.  Personally, I've never been a mod person, but in this case I found about 30 I really like - they add depth to the game without affecting the balance.  (although there are mods out there that affect balance)Many thanks to Tynan for giving us this gem of a game!			"

								Ignore my steam in game time because I have played well over 100 hours of this game before it hit steam. What is this game: Rimworld is a game where you are a dungeon keeper type being who controls a small population of colonists for either their benefit, or detriment. This is a game where one minute you are taming cute bunnies then harvesting your prisoners for hearts, lungs, livers, and kidneys or, trading for some stell with other local populus then fight some mechanical centipedes from space. Ok, it may just be drawf fortress but it is *announcer voice* IN SPACE* and is much more user freindly.If you don't know what dwarf fortress is doesn't matter, this game is a strategy/sim game through and through with combat and can make some very interesting situations happen that you would not expect. It is great for people who love to micromanage but you don't have to do if you  don't want the game allows you to be as indepth or shallow as you like with its controls.If you know someone with the game ask if they have a download link, then if you enjoy it, buy it, the small team who makes this game deserves it ten fold.

								Let me begin by saying this: buy this game right now, you won't regret it. So i've been playing this game for just about 2 years now, and presumably hundreds of hours later, (already have 23 on steam alone and it just came out) I can not recommend this game enough. This game is an absolute blast. A challenging, infuriating, exciting blast. The visuals are simple, but beautiful. The music is brilliant. The gameplay is emergent and you will never get the same game twice no matter how hard you try. Over the time ive had with this game I still am not good at it, and I still love it. I always see peoples huge fortresses, and thats what I shoot for, but something always goes wrong. Even through that it has been an absolute blast. As a huge fan of Dwarf Fortress, I have tried many other games inspired by it and they just havent been up to snuff. Rimworld manages to, while not being as complex as Dwarf Fortress (and who could blame Tynan for that), be continually more and more complex and interesting while never getting stale. I remember when my friend first showed me this game, back in around July 2014, I thought it looked too good to be true. Absolutely not, it is fantastic. And it just keeps getting better. This is not one of those early access skeletons of a game for a quick cash grab. Tynan truly pours his heart and soul into this game and it shows, Rimworld is astoundingly fun. This game generates a story, a story of a colony, that probably goes down in flames. And its a story thats engaging every single time I play. Bonds are made, raids are fought off (sometimes), cropped are blighted, and fun is had. Just as the mantra of dwarf fortress says -- Losing is fun. Stop thinking about it, buy this game.			"

I've probably put in atleast a couple hundred hours easily, it's very easy to get into and each update increasing changes the entire game dynamic and the upcoming one being more of a mobile presence of the world will hopefully help create a solution to trading, exploring or the end game stagnation that is of current.

								As a rule I generally don't write reviews; not out of some arbitrary reasoning, but out of fear that I don't have insight to either advising picking up a game or steering clear of it.This is not the case with Rimworld.Rimworld is arguably one of the finest crafted games ever released for the colony/survival genre. Boasting a huge range of character traits, a complex relationship system between characters and a potentially harsh or easy world to survive in. The game is entirely fantastic in it's ability to tailor your experience from a relatively easy adventure through a lush, temperate forest; all the way up to a ball-crushing torture fest of surviving in the harsh, arctic tundra, or the equally terrifying super dry deserts.If you have even the slightest interest in this game, please do yourself the favour and pick it up. Whilst it's only just come out on Steam, I have well over 500 hours of gameplay prior to it's release: and I've loved every single second of it. You will not regret this purchase, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic!			"

								I don't normally write reviews, but here is one of my stories that just happened:Andrea started this colony on her own with her dog, Mandy. Over time,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lidia, Calvin, Othello, and Ian join the crew. Now♥♥♥♥♥♥was there from day 3. I tried to get them to hook up, but then Lidia came crashing out of the sky (literally) and won over♥♥♥♥♥♥ That was fine. Now let's talk about Calvin. Calvin was this big guy that joined the colony sometime after Lidia and♥♥♥♥♥♥started sleeping together. Calvin had a thing for Lidia. Lidia didn't care. Andrea, however, was that friend next door/co-worker type; You saw them all the time and talked, but you didn't see them as anything more. Some time went on and Ian joined the group. Ian was Andrea's long lost brother and no one liked him (including me, but that's beside the point).One day Ian goes out hunting and pulls a Robert Baratheon (mauled by a boar). Ian dies and Andrea is devastated. Calvin and Andrea start to talk a bit more here and there. Next thing I know, they are lovers. Before bed on their first night, they vist the grave of Ian. They go to bed and wake up as usual. That's when it happened.Two raiders appear.Now Lidia and♥♥♥♥♥♥don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥(incapable of violence bull♥♥♥♥♥♥. Othello, Calvin, and Andrea run out and take these thugs down. Calvin is attacking one raider while Othello is taken out by the other and being carried away. Andrea runs to save Othello because Calvin is a big guy and is holding his own. Andrea takes out the raider, but it's too late for Othello. She runs back to Calvin to find the raider has killed him. She beats the holy hell out of that raider and heads to the hospital nearly dead herself. While this is all happening, our only prisoner has gone berserk and breaks out of prison. The prisoner attacks Andrea's dog, Mandy, and beats her to death.Andrea sleeps in the hospital for a whole day and wakes up on the brink of a meltdown.♥♥♥♥♥♥and Lidia try to help with the healing and cleaning, but Andrea winds up wandering off into the forest because of all the grief. I wanted to follow right along side her.Moral of this story: do not become attached. I was warned and learned the hard way. This game is amazing. Buy it already. I read many of these reviews for the stories and was so glad when I finally created some of my own. I can't wait to see what else they do with this game.5/7			"

								This game is honestly really wonderful if you have the patience for it. It can be really slow sometimes, and a little difficult to get into it at first, but once you're in, you are HOOKED. So much weird and zany and interesting things happen all the time. It's definitely worth the try! Though sometimes the intelligence of the pawns is lacking, and they sometimes do dumb things, it makes for a good story. It's a REALLY good aid to writing a story. And the mod community is really active! A lot of the ""problems"" people have with it, I think will get solved at a later time. And there's much more to be added to the game.30 bucks SEEMS like a lot, but I feel like it will be worth it. If you really want, you can wait for a sale, but the devs honestly deserve that money. (ALSO, BUY IT OFF THE WEBSITE AND GET THE STEAM KEY! It supports the devs more and you can get a lil extra stuff!)			"

								This is how my first run ended. Apparently a nearby supervolcano erupted, causing a volcanic winter, on top of the winter I was already having. Shortly after that started, A wave of toxin spread over the area, poisoining all of my colonists. The raiders kept coming, and after the first one died, all of them started dying. Eventually, my colony's morale gave out completely, as the populace plummeted into insanity, killing what few friends they had left. Eventually, one man was left, and as the colony burned down around him, he slowly starved to death.........And so ended the colony of Jericho.			"

								I started playing this game quite awhile back, it has been steadily been updated and improved. There has also been a great modding community around it as well. Replayability is very high in my opinion, I actually look forward to updates to start a new colony/scenario. (in the past you have been able to continue to play older version games with little issues). Don't let the grahpics deter you if you like colony sims, survival type games. ATM I have little time clocked on steam, but I have played many colonies over the previous alpha versions, not sure on total time, at least 100 hours+. I highly recommend this game. Despite it's alpha state, there have been very few bugs and I have never had the game crash on PC or Mac.(even with outdated mods). I honestly feel the game is worth the price even if it is never updated again. If you think you might like a sci-fi dwarf fortress style game, play it. The game has a great complexity that is easy to approach.			"

								This is my first game review so I'm not exactly sure what to say really. About two years ago I bought this game from ludeon studios because my friend came up to me one day and was like ""Yo I'm going to email you something so get it and play it you're going to love it."" Of course my first thought was something like ""Oh god it's so gonna be a hentai game or something"". When I got home I tried out the game Rimworld and I absolutely loved it. Now for these past two years I have made over 200 worlds lasting for at least 3 weeks each. I have done so much different stuff with it and I'm still not bored of it. Over the years Ludeon has made Rimworld from a pretty cool game into an AMAZING game that just makes me love it more with every update that comes out (They will never have one of those R8 updates [shoutout to csgo players]) I was very happy when Rimworld came to steam because well of course it's where I play ALL of my games so I would want one of my favourite games there as well. I was even happier when I get an email saying ""Hey guess what! Since you bought Rimworld from ludeon you get it for free on steam! Congratz!"". So overall Rimworld is just an amazing game and if you don't at least TRY it then you're a pinecone.-Turtle			"

								What more can you say when you can cram 5h a day to play a game, while pulling long hours at work for 10 consecutive days (weekend included)?I have only played 19h so far, and even though I'm as tired as I ever was, I'm afraid to start up this game, because I'm fairly sure I will end up playing for another 4-5 straight hours, before finally heading to sleep at 4am. Again.Disclaimer: my pedigree includes everything from ATARI to Spectrum, 386, 486, Pentium, MMX, and so on. While Quake and CoD are fun to play, the games I typically invest more time are games such as XCom (the old school ones: Enemy Unknown and Apocalypse), Europa Universalis Rome,  Sword of the Stars, and even Majesty.I am a sucker for a challange and an awesome AI that doesn't resort to cheats to trample over my dead body.Now how does RimWorld rank?With a steep learning curve, I took 3-4 hours to learn the ropes. Now, I'm learning about defense, research, trading, herding, resource management, beautifying the settlement, joy, and everything else. The list is too big.I have around 5-6 stories, but one that touched me a bit more than the others. I will update this review later, when I'm not so tired. Will probably play this now. Damn.10/10Quick update: managed to only play 3 hours.Finally had an awesome home base with 5 settlers, until the game decided it was getting a bit boring and unilateraly decided Malaria would make things more fun. Skip forward several game days.Now, 2 settlers left, moody and sad, and 1 gone crazy... ""Engi"". First Engi striped naked and walked around, refusing to eat or sleep. Her BFF ""Nine"" had to arrest her so they could finally force feed her.That didn't last very long, considering Engi almost imediately jumped up and went on a rampage, trying to force the prison door open.Engi's best friend Nine shot her on the spot. And yet, Nine rescued Engi immediately, and tried her best to tend to her dear Engi. That's true friendship, I have no doubt. Engi ended up dying of infection, a few days later.Outlook is bleak... But I will come back to ""Rimville"" tomorrow. All odds are this story will end just as all others... a sea of hopelessness, desperation, sorrow and suffering. 11/10.On a final note... Screw herbal medicine, might as well pack it with dirt, rambo style (hint @ game dev).			"

								Im going to break down this review in 2 parts: for people that know what Dwarf Fortress and those that dont.if you know what DF is and you like it, just buy this game. you will definetly enjoy it. maybe you wont think its better or anything but it is worth your time and i personally think that it could surpass DF with enough time and dedication.if you dont know what DF is and never had your Dorfs mauled by a carp before, this game is basically a colony builder where you try to keep your ""pawns"" alive as best you can in a border world. these types of games are usually realy daunting at first but RW in general does a very good job of easing you into the core gameplay loop and has several features (such as being able to control your drafted pawns directly during attacks in a similar fashion to other grid based games) and being able to manually tell someone to do a specific task goes a long way towards making the game more player-friendly. i suggest watching youtube videos of people getting their colonys up and running, dosent matter the version. its real hard to put into words exactly the type of game/gameplay you can expect out of it but just 5 minutes with a video and you will have a fairly clear idea of what to expect.in general its a solid game. several things can and will be improved, either by the devs or modders, but with just what they got now you will have a lot of enjoyment out of this game. i havent experienced any annoying bugs either, some stuff definetly needs to be balanced/worked on and stuff like that but it runs just fine.

								Put on basebuilder (easy) setting.  Doing pretty good up until a lightning storm, so I send my guys out to put out some fires - but one of my guys doesn't firefight.  He instead decides to clean so there is nothing to do.   Meanwhile I'm busy with the fire and one of my guys flips out and starts shooting everyone.  I send my guys to stop him - meanwhile the cleaning guy decides the rocks need to be cleaned, inside a ring of fire.  He gets trapped inside and starts requesting help - just as a pack of animals decides it's a good time to attack my people.  While I'm fighting off the wildlife my guys are down for the count.  I manage to get everything stopped and get my two injured people to drag back two unconcious people.I quickly put those guys in hospital beds, but the cleaner dies - and the crazy shooter actually lives and starts getting better.  As I have my game on fast forward he stumbles out of his hospital bed tho and takes a nap in my freezer - dying from the cold and being frozen before I even realized what happened.  Meanwhile one of the two remaining guys gets in a fight with an angry bear - then a group of exploding buffalo come so I say screw it, and send my last guy out with a knife to end the game.The republicans would blame this all on Obama.

								Okay, so this is one of the few games I pirated before buying, just because I didn't really want to waste $30 on a game I wouldn't play. And I know about Steam refunds, but I find that I need a bit more than just 2 hours to get full impressions on a game, but that's besides the point.The point is that this game is, to put it simply, bloody fantastic. The level of depth that this game goes into is simply amazing. I won't go into the gameplay that much, because I find it's more fun to discover it for yourself, but I will give you a brief overview of the plot if you play the standard scenario. Three colonists are in cryptosleep, only to be awaken by their ship falling apart. They barely manage to make it to the escape pods, which land on an unknown rimworld. Your job, as a hive-mind commander sort of thing, is to help your colonists survive by giving them indirect (or sometimes direct) orders. Whilst trying to keep your colony alive and happy through random events (good or bad) that occur. These include, but are not limited to: raids, flashstorms, trade caravans and heatwaves. These events are determined by an AI story teller you choose before starting the game, each having different personalities. Depending on how you play this game and what AI you choose, crazy things can happen. As an example, once my colonist, who's son had just died, went on a rampage, shot his cat with a minigun, then ate it. So yea...So if you are a fan of Prison Architect or Dwarf Fortress, then I definitely recommend picking up this game. Even if you aren't a fan of either of those games, still check this game out.

								RimWorld. A game of survival. This game Is one of my favorite games to play. The endless replayability and many different objects, scenarios, people, tribes, weapons, foods, plants, animals, tools, Its all just a great game. I love the art style. its very similar to prison architect in art style which is also a great game. One of my favorite moments was when one of my colonists leg was shot off after a raid.  He was stuck and injured so i brought him to a medical bed. I then order a surgury so we could install a peg leg. My Doctor at the time had a skill of 15 which is pretty good. I started watching hi  preform the sugury but i got bored and started designing some other part of my colony. A little message pops up say *the surgury went slightly wrong* so i was thinking oh maybe he messed up and needs to try again. I move back over to the medical bed where my colonist was on and i see him bleeding out on the bed. Very confused i click on him and check on health. The first thing i see is *stomach removed* ""what, excuse me"" how the ♥♥♥♥ while trying to install a peg leg did you miss and cut his stomach out. And then i see *severe heart bleeding* and again i like ""what the ♥♥♥♥ happened"" how is it that while doing surgury on someones leg did you *slip* while cutting and cut a mans entire stomach out with one swoop and slice is heart open. AND THEN, i see the docter, WALKING AWAY TO EAT. Like Oh boy after that surgical mishap it would be a great time for a lunch break. While the colonist is still bleeding out on the damn medical bed.  I laughed for a good 10 minutes about it, and shared the story with all my friends who thought it also hilarious and all found an interest in the game!I would Reccomend this game 10/10 if someone is looking for a Crash landing survival simulator with a prison architect kindof feel. It is worth the purchase as it can be replayed many times and has hours and hours and hours of content			"

								I have had this game from the very early stages of Alpha, and for the $30.00 I purchased this game, in that infancy it has by far surpassed my expectations more than any other game I have every prepurchased; so much so that I just had to write a review when finding out about the steam link because it's a great game that really needs its moment in the spotlight. To begin with it has simple and quite refreshing visuals, although it may be quite comparable to Prison Architect , and the game does play out slightly in the same style, it sure does bring a feeling quite unique to its name. If you love survival and enjoy a sandbox with scalable challenges as well as a diverse and respectable modding community, you need to get this game. Even if you don't have a very powerful rig, this game plays quite well on older models (such as my acer aspire v3). There should be no reason for you not to try this game and hopefully enjoy it as much as I do.			"

It's a user-friendly dwarf-fortress.  The Sims as a space-western suvival game.   With the mods it becomes a lot more.But my favorite part is that it's a story generator.

Raiders start burning crops.I have no food so I am forced to fight.Go outside, half are wounded then kidnapped.Raiders are gone, crops are burned.Toxic air falls upon the hidden valley. Everyone slowly starves. First one to die is cannibalized.Colonists start going insane out of grief of lost loved ones.Two go berserk and kill the others. Try to lock them in their rooms. They break down the doors and try to kill each other.Finally one overcomes the other and eats his heart.After a long time other colonists join the colony.They wonder why the lone guy sits in the corner babbling to himself and staring at them with a wild look in his eyes.

								So I had a pretty sweet colony going, you know lots of food good number of people. Then it happened. My fighter lost his left foot. ""Not bad"" I say to myself, after all I had a prosthetics mod on that let me make feet. So I make the foot and get him prepped for surgery. The doctor fails. Again I tell myself it's fine we'll just try again. So my doctor then cuts his arm off. ""Well crap time to save scum"" I tell myself. Then my surgeon stabs the poor man in his neck. (Note: IT WAS FOOT SURGERY, SHE WAS INSTALLING A WOODEN FOOT. WHERE IS A KNIFE EVEN USED?) Then I look at their relationship and see that number, the number I'll never forget. -99. Then I realised that this game is exactly like real life.Also here's something that should be meme http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/453790-Digital%20Hex%20Floor%203%20%28%0AFoil%29?filter=Candice "

								So far, I have gone through 334 hrs of game play on 4 of the many biomes (desert, tundra, tropical rainforest, and temperate forest). At an “ALPHA” development stage, I must say that this looks more like a beta than anything else. Off course, the possibilities with this game are endless given that in real life there are many more biomes around the world like the Gobi cold desert in Mongolia. I would like to see them all incorporated into the game in future updates. Also, given that this game is a graphically enhanced version of a dwarf fortress like of game, the developers could be adding content to it for the rest of their life to add value to what they already have. I think I understand why they call it an “ALPHA” stage game, and it may be related to content because it seems to me that it is well balanced. It does not have as much content as Dwarf Fortress (DF) but in time it could get there. Off course, the themes are different (DF is more a fantasy like scenario while RW is more a wild west steampunk environment) but I would like to see in RW as much content as there is in DF. It would be nice to see the implementation of a Z level layer into the game like there is in similar games of the gender. It would be a huge thing.Since it is a randomly generated seeded game the playability is also endless. Try ‘mesa’ for example, it is a good seed. In addition, the emergency situations are randomly generated and there are many but this is an area where the developers could also expand.In conclusion, for an “ALPHA” stage game, your gone get more than you pay for in hours of enjoyment playing it and the possibilities are endless given the amount of mods available, and the amount of content the developers could add in future updates.

								Started a solo colony with my trusty dog. Few days later, a cannibal wanders into my colony. We get into fist fights from time to time.

								Been playing this for a few years now.  The developer makes regular, awesome updates and keeps the playerbase informed along the way.As for the game itself, it's just incredible.  The game experience is incredibly customizable.  If you want a brutal, no holds barred full on fight for survival, you can have it.  If you want to sit back and build a huge colony, you can do that too, and everywhere in between.A lot of city/colony builders will tell you that ""no game is the same twice"", and they often fall flat, Rimworld does not.  There's just so much good here.  Rimworld is like nothing you've ever played.  The game oozes character out of every orifice.  You're going to die, but you're going to have fun doing it.Now go, cut that stubborn prisoner up for lunch and sit down for a nice meal, and get your rifles ready, because there's a horde of really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off squirrels about to come and wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥real soon.

								Rimworld, is a deliciously deep game with non-intensive graphics and great gameplay. You will most likely grow an attatchment to your colonists, and cry manly tears of sorrow at their death. When two colonists marry, its a moment of joy, crashed by some bandits who decided it would be a WONDERFUL time to shoot the place up. As a whole, the game takes a try or two to get the hang of, but once you got it, prepare to have a good time. I would thoroughly reccomend this game to anybody who even was remotely interested in base builders. If you like story, while the game has no official story, your colony's story unfolds, with no narration, just you playing the game. This is one of the best games I have ever stumbled across, and with many updates coming from Tynan, this is a game you cannot miss. 10/10 -Utterly Fantastic, Would use raider induced divorce again.

Two, Vaska and Seraph, constitute security. well, those two and the 4 gun turrets set up stategically around the base, which is dug deep into a mountain. a raid occurs. The green stream people, long our enemy, send over 6 men, armed with greatbows and clubs of the highest quality. Serpah and Vaska look on impassively as the men attempt to rush gun turrets with clubs. With the numbers advantage, they manage to down one gun turret, which explodes. only then do vaska and seraph spring into action, using their charge rifles to pick off the fleeing opposition. meanwhile, the others enjoy a nice beer and a joint, listening to the melodious sounds of screaming agony as the tribals are brutally killed.

								At the time of this writing, I've had Rimworld for about three weeks, and I have already put 60 hours of gameplay into it. This game is, quite frankly, amazing; It is one of the few early access titles that I'd ever recommend to someone, simply because it is already a complete, filled game. The gameplay is fun, if a tad micromanagey; You (usually, you can play other scenarios) play three crash landed colonists, and guide them throughout life on a harsh world, trying to keep them from getting killed, or killing eachother, and eventually work your way from that, towards trying to build a ship to get off the planet; All in all, a complete experience.Alongside that, the game's already large lifespan and replayability is easily extended with the massive amounts of mods available for it; there are some mods that completely overhaul parts of the game.The best thing about all of it though is that it's still being worked on, and probably will be for a while.Admittedly, the game has it's share of oddities and frustrating moments; To highlight one of them, botched surgeries can be botched extremely badly when your doctor decides that in order to amputate a leg, they must first remove the patient's head. Yeah. But all in all, the great things about this game far outshine the few negative quirks. So I have to say it, I can't really recommend this game enough; It is most definitely worth every penny. Go get it, now.			"

								(I Have Two Reviews, Long And Short, read whichever suits you.)[Long Review]      Do not underestimate this game, it might say ""early Access"", but I've been playing this game for about 3 years (before they released it on Steam) and it has come a long way. This is one of, if not the best space/sim/building game I have ever played. This early access game has a lot of content in it that can make you enjoy this game for hours and hours straight without getting bored. Every game is different aswell (Unless you use the same seed and always pick the same spot where you first started), but aside from that, every relationship is different, starting is different (Unless you use the same senario). Every enemy attack is different, there is randomized weather, (It also depends on what kind of biome you're playing in) randomized animals (Differs with each biome). This game is absolutly a blast (No pun intended, you damn power surges!) The developers listen to their community, fans, supporters (Whatever you want to call us) and are constantly putting out patches and new updates![Short Review]     Quit trying to save time, and just buy it already.Pros:+Cool Backround Music+Pets+Relationships+Graphics+This whole gameCons:- Can be challenging for a new player- No tutorial			"

								Honestly, this is one of the few Early Access Games I do not regret buying.I had been burnt by many games in EA, but after reading a lot of positive reviews, I gave this a shot. This game as of writing is my favorite game on Steam. I've always been a sucker for Colony / Base-Building / Simulation games. Planetbase, Banished, Prison Architect are games that I've fallen in love with, but this one I enjoy a lot more at the moment. Speaking of Prison Architect, the art style reminds me a lot of that.You have a lot of freedom (which is expanded even further by the great Steam Workshop Mods) to start your ""story"" however you want. You can customize how many people will start with you, the resources, weapons and materials to make your ""perfect start""The AI Storyteller can be made to be very easy or extremely brutal if you prefer.Once you land, you'll start building your base, creating rooms for your people, researching new technologies, and creating defenses. There are numerous random events that will surprise you for the good or bad.The combat is the most frustrating in my opinion. I may just be bad at it though. Also, the colonist’s attitudes can be difficult to manage at times, but hey, the game is supposed to be challenging.If you want to just free build, there is a Debug mode built into the game with a ""God Mode"" allowing you to freely build and spawn items if that tickles your fancy.Overall, I feel like this is a really strong game that is VERY polished for an EA Game. I will be dumping a lot more hours into this one and it was well worth the purchase!Lessons I picked up along the way:Check the “Work Tab” and make sure your people are assigned to what you want them to do. I was working on my 3rd colony before I realized only 1 person was set to cut down trees or to construct things which really slowed down my progress.I prefer mountainous regions as you can find natural chokepoints for defenses as opposed to flatlands.Sealed structures tend to hold enemies in them (usually the game will warn you too when you get near it). I’ve wiped a few colonies by deconstructing a wall to get into it before we were ready for the “ancient evils” inside.Research Stonecutting ASAP!Tailor new clothing often as your stuff will become tattered. This makes your colony angry.Create a storeroom ""freezer"" as soon as you can support the power. Makes preserving food for the colony so much easier. "

								I kept seeing a friend of mine playing this, and decided to check it out. With the simplistic graphics, and ""sim"" label, I promptly ignored it. Boy, was I an idiot. About a week later, I read through the reviews, had a good laugh, and haven't played anything but Rimworld since.My first colony started out well. Built a nice base, had loads of farms, met neighbors, etc.I had a soldier, a medic chick, and a farmer/researcher.First raid, soldier whoops♥♥♥♥♥Second raid, soldier whoops♥♥♥♥♥Third, soldier whoops♥♥♥♥♥until incapped. Medic goes to save him. Farmer freaks out and starts firing wildly, hitting medic in the head on accident. Medic dies. Soldier dies. Farmer lives for a few days in a funk before offing himself.10/10 would witness tragedy again and laugh			"

								Jono was a simple man with simple taste. He never wanted anything too extravagant. He just wanted to build. Well Jono saw one dead corpse and decided to lose his mind. After attacking other settlers, the others decided to incapacitate him. Jono soon went into a coma only to awaken months later. He then went insane again and killed one of my colonsists while the others had to put him down. Safe to say, Jono would never taste the simplicities of life again. Seriously though, great game! AI is great and can make some crazy situatons occur. Overall, I definitely recommend!			"

								Had a nice little settlement built up, self sufficent.. had a few run ins with tribals, but nothing my rifle-chick couldnt handle.Got a call over the radio (I hadnt even researched radios at this point..) that someone needed to seek refuge at my settlement and that they'd join my colony.Accept. No problem.Discover said person was being hunted by tribals. Ok. No problem.Set everyone up behind sandbags. Looks solid.Last minute, the new chick dived over the sandbags pistol blazing.My rifle-chick shot at the tribals, miss-aimed, hit the new chick in the spine. New chick insta-killed.Desperately hold off tribals till they flee. My crop-grower/Researcher and doctor took a few melee hits.Took them back to get rest in bed. No doctor to bandage up my doctor..Doctor is very slowly recovering..Suddenly, heatwave.Doctor dies a slow death over the course of three days from blood loss and heart attack from heat exhaustion.Now Fernandez and Ayoya live alone in a once thriving settlement with their pet turtle, Snappy.

								I have been playing this game since 2014 and put most likely 1000+ hours into it and it still doesnt get boring.Pros:-lots of good mods (which aren't updated YET)-let's you play the game the way you want-lots of major updates since i bought it (with more to come) and even though they're not very frequent i always put another 100 hours into the game once an update came out-it's somewhat realistic in my opinion (mental breakdowns, scars, bruises, etc., one well placed shot can instantly kill a high tech soldier, skills that colonist learn faster or slower depending on their interest in them, animal keeping and breeding and last but not least the social system)Cons:-it seems as though you didn't buy this game yet so DO IT, JUST DO IT			"

								I've played a few early access games and Riwworld is one of my favourite games.   I've backed this back in 2013 and I tend to play couple of hours a week with it.   No two games are the same when playing and it can be super frustrating or super awesome.   I've still yet to actually escape from this Rimworld but I've loved every second.      The game can seem super complicated at first but it's easy to pick up the basics and you will soon be growing, mining, researching and maybe eating human flesh.The basic premise of the game is you crash land on a planet and have to survive.   Will you dig deep into the mountains and make a fortress, build a massive log castle outside that might just get set fire to by raiders or wait and build up super strong stone walls.Now about the game the standard vanilla rimworld is lots of fun and will give you hours of gameplay.  But then if you add in the fact this game loves mods and some of the mods people produce are insanely good.   Do you like zombies then there is a mod, do you like raiders on atv's there is a mod for that, how about mods that manage your resource levels yep again there is a mod.With the inbuilt modding in alpha 14 it makes it super easy to apply mods and you can do it all from in game from the steam workshop which is AMAZING.   If you struggle installing mods as it seems complicated you will love this.Oh and alpha 14 now has a scenario editor so you can create custom scenarios to play.   Imagine starting out a new colony with 100 pet elephants yes you can become hannibal and have a horde of elephants its mucho fun.I think the price is fine considering this came out three years and I'm still playing it, it's still got an active developer and super passionate fans.  So don't think you are getting a buggy early game with placeholder game as you are buying an awesome game.Just don't blame me after launching the game and hours have vanished from your life haha.

								My second go at this ended with the very first raider attack in a surprising chain of events.  One of the two females in my band of three survivors ran toward the barricade, rifle in hand.  The one male propositioned her as she ran by, and she decided it was not the time.  He lost his head, murdered both women with a knife, killed the dog for good measure, and was finally put down by the lone unarmed raider.10/10! - would lose again.			"

								I've been playing rimworld for about a year before it was released on Steam.  It's one of my favorite games.  Every biome has unique challenges, like lack of food and warmth in the ice sheets, or rampant diseases in the jungle.  No matter which biome you live in, the raiders and mechanoids will find you.  And setting the difficulty to extreme is a lesson in humility.  I guess I like a challenging game.			"

								Here's the story of my very first colony.So, there's a tutorial now so I did that. But, when the ""Raiding"" part of the tutorial came by, I decided to have my 1 melee person attack a ranged person. She managed to get up to him, and severely wound him, but her leg got ♥♥♥♥ING SHOT OFF! Then the same happened to him. I rescued her, and installed a peg leg(I know, that's ♥♥♥♥ing cool). Everything went as normal, with our colony of women with a dog. I got a fourth person somewhere around 30 minutes of play time. So, after around 2 and a half hours went by, all of the ladies were sleeping, when all of the sudden, a ♥♥♥♥ing flashstorm came by, and started the whole place on fire. Everything was complete and utter chaos. The one person I thought of as a leader went to go save someone who was in need of rescue, and when she went inside, she just collapsed. On the other hand, the person she was carrying made it out, but left her there. All of my buildings burned down, my ""leader"" died, and the fire kept raging on. The fire had reached some artillery shells I found, and then blew them up. That may not seem too bad, but the person the ""leader"" sacrificed her life for got blown up. The other two people were doing something else in a place I don't know, but then the person who got blown up died. The dog was injured too, but of course, the dog is more important then the human. What happened after that was a series of raids, that got the dog handler kidnapped. We got another person during that time, but she only had a knife. The other lady(The one that still had a gun), went beserk, and incapacitated the new blood. Then, a raider came along, killed her, and left the new blood to bleed out. She was just bleeding out for a good 15 minutes, and then it all ended.10/10 would have a tragic event happen to innocent people again.			"

								The video and images don't do the game justice.  If you want to see real samples of gameplay - watch a YouTuber.  I spent 2 weeks watching 2 YouTubers  before the week I decided I was going to buy the game.  The let's plays were much more informative, much more enlightening for the game and it's (bluntly said..) depth.  Every moving colonist, animal, mechanoid and even objects like fire and lightning add to a depth of the game that can not be described in words.  Start the game with 1 of 3 scenarios; add a random world generation, from snow to heat to forrests to mountainous terrain (and more probably); add 3 randomized colonists with traits and inabilities (No such thing as a perfect colonist); and one of 3 AI storytellers with each some 5 or so difficulty levels; and set permadeath if you want.  Phew, mouthful - but that's just setting up a save file.  Now you gotta make your colonists survive together, avoid exploding wildlife, take care of health concerns (including surgery), weddings, colonists hating each other, mental breakdowns, umm, this is an endless list.  Then the video on the store page describes raids, traders, orbiting space traders, and..  well, death.  Welcome to RimWorld!			"

 Don't let the amount of hours I have played fool you. The first thing that I noticed about this game is how well it runs. Yes, it's the not the most demanding game in terms of RAM usage etc; but it looks really nice on the eye. The textures are great to look at.I have always enjoyed games which are unpredicable, making you wonder what is going to happen next. One minute you are being attacked by a rival tribe, the next minute you have a new colonist in your home. Having a new colonist comes with strengths and weaknesses, and their weaknesses can have a massive impact on your colony. You have be sure to keep your colonists happy, as they can fall into a minor or major mental breakdown. This can affect many thing, from gathering crops to mining resources.So far I have enjoyed every minute of this game, and is worth every penny. Get it now!			"

But there was always one character the gamer got attacthed too, and sadly, that character was Brexios. Brex was the healer, the animal-trainer, and the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ melee fighter anyone has seen.Two raids came, we wiped them out and captured one from each raid. Then the third raid... Oh the third raid was a fateful mistake... Brex got hurt, badly. We had to amputate her leg and give her a peg leg, surprisingly, she still fought. Everything was smooth sailing...Until they came.The pirates attacked with their savage ways, and captured Brex while Brex was trying to save Trosma. Now we can only pray she is still alive, and safe. 10/10 would pray for Brex again			"

								wonderful colony management, survival, combat, and depth of gameplay.detailed stats for every creature in game. i Had an iguana that developed dementia, a tamed bear with astma to wich i have transfered a healthy lung taken from a prisoner.Every playtrough is unique, every load is unique , events are random and keep the game fresh.Every colonyst is unique and with awesome mods the game becomes an even more in depth and hardcore expericne, or it can become the utopia u have dreamed to acomplish since you had a dream.Game dificulty is set by the player, the 3 storytellers(aka game modes IMO) are incredibly well made and realy offer a great experience. After playing a few times on base builder difculty i felt ready for more chalange, i was blasted to pieces and the last dificulty with joy and tears on my face, my colony burned to ash by stormtroopers, we defended to the last one with bows and rifles. One survivor went into shock and was leftr for dead by the invaders. After the atack he came back to life only to bury his friends among the ruins of the colony. after the last tomb was dig he went crazy and locked him slef in a room and died of starvation.WARNING: NEVER EVER NEVER EVER name any colonyst after you, your friends or anyone elso you know, they will die, thats a fact or you will end up loading to the limit of exploit. I can go on with this but is not enough. buy it, play it, love it, hate it, play more.			"

								a game not for everyone, but personally found it very enjoyable for the short term. the game gives you options ranging from easy as pie, to death pirates will try to kill you every other day.  choosing climate and territory will also affect how your settlement grows, and you have good options on how to prioritize your people's tasks so you dont need to micro manage them all day once you take a few minutes to set them up. late game does get a bit boring and  repetitive as you simply wait for traders to show up with rare materials so you can build your ship. but for anyone who enjoys the sims or civilization type games, this is a good choice to whet your appetite between installments and expansions.

								So first off I want to say that buying this game, I had full intent on not liking it. I've tried a couple of games like this (Prison Architect comes to mind) and I just could not get into them at all. Now, saying that, I have been horribly, HORRIBLY addicted to Rimworld since I bought it. It has skyrocketed up on my list of favorite games ever. The $30 buy-in for this is nothing compared to the amount of fun I've had with it so far. Whether you're fighting off raiders, starvation, mad animal packs, diseases, or just mother nature herself, you will find yourself in a world of excitement every minute you play. Yes this game is in alpha, but Tynan loves his community and the feedback he gets and he puts forth a ton of effort into making this game great. He fully supports modding and even encourages modding with fully integrated workshop support. He stays connected on twitter and acts like an actual person instead of a robot. I can honestly say that if I knew how awesome this game, the community, and the developers were before I bought it, i would have zero problems spending upwards of $100 on it. We need more games like this. Definite purchase in my opinion! :)			"

								Only 32 Hours on steam at time of writing, played Rimworld much longer before steam launch.Rimworld is a shining star in the early-access landscape. Unlike most early-access games I have invested in, I have yet to be uncertain about Rimworlds future. With an active and communicative developer, Rimworld is regularly updated with new and quality additions.This game is for everyone, whether you wish to calmly construct a settlement, watch your colonists farm, thrive and advance through technology, propogate relationships and tame and train animals through friendly companionship.Conversely, you can raid a passing caravan, capture all of the survivors, remove all of their limbs, eyes, jaws' and nose' (and much more with mods!), sustain their pitiful existence for as long as you find necessary, then replace everything with bionic fittings and blades to make your very own deadly (albeit traumatised) cyborg army.I can honestly say few games have given me as many crazed laughs and hours of enjoyment as Rimworld has.10/10 would commit horrendous atrocities against humankind again!

								An absolute joy to play!Initially, it has that ring of “oh no, not this again”  but as you spend more time with your chosen colonists you start to see more than just generic place-holders wandering about.  Their skills have a very real effect on how things play out. The more time you spend the more you see the complex game mechanic come alive as your colonists interact with each other and not just the environment.  What initially seems like a terrible skill system suddenly becomes a complex tool to get things sorted out..Diary of a survivor:Day 1:  5 Clan members build their new home. A makeshift wooden hut with 5 beds and a broken wooden lamp. Everyone is helping, except the Chief who seems to be watching. Crops are planted, but we need food Now so someone has to go hunting.Day 2: Horrible nights sleep, the beds fine but sharing a room with 4 other people…  Give me a break.  These ratios will not last long. The Chief has gone hunting, but unless we can find some steel to make a stove, I doubt we are going to be eating healthy any time soon.  At least we have a Butcher table built.Day 3: Raw meat for breakfast, I think Im going to be sick…  Between that and the lack of sleep Im starting to loose my mind here.  Just focus on the tasks, gather wood, gather resources and make sure the Crops are okay.Day 4: Healer said she spotted a Rabid squirrel. I hope it doesnt come towards camp. We finally have the stove up, but theres little to cook. Im going to have to go hunting with the Chief.  Day 5: The squirrel found us late last night.  It bit our Healer first then attacked me as I tried to help. Toko finally killed it, but only after he got badly scratched.  We have no bandages, no way of cleaning the wounds… This could be bad.Day 6: Woke up with a fever, as did the Healer and Toko.  We could be in trouble. The Chief is doing his best but unless someone comes back with medicine soon……Day 7:  Chief cooking is terrible…  I think Id rather die from the infection than eat his soup again, and his bedside care is not much better.Day 8: Toko passed away last night, I dont know what..  I am so close to losing my mind now, Im pretty sure these beds would burn pretty well…..Day 9:  Visited Toko’s Grave, spent a good 2 hours there…  I really dont feel like doing anything today.  But we are low on food, and nobody has checked the crops in days………..-  Thats my story,  (so far) Whats yours going to be?.			"

								First attempt: Start simple, right? So I go tribal start in a rainforest. I learn the basic controls and mechanics of the game, painfully at times.All is well.Unable to build walls yet, I dig out a home in a small hill. Beds for everyone.My community thrives and slowly grows and expands its numbers and riches.Still no walls.Get raided multiple times by bandits, often having some major injury from the firefight.Into the second year nearly every living member of the tribe either has an eye patch, hook hand, or peg leg. One colonist is even totally blind, having lost both eyes.There's gotta be a better way.I know, I'll tame some attack animals. Tamed my first two panthers no problem. Never got a chance to train them before attempting panther number 3...Tanning fails. Panther attacks. Kills 3 of my 6 colonists, and injures my doctor and cook. Nothing but the hunter left who doesn't know much of medicine.He attempts to save them.During surgery on the doctor, he critically fails at installing the peg leg and removes her brain (how, I have no idea). The cook later dies of infection.My hunter lives his days in solitude until the next bandit raid. During the raid he is shot and his stomach is destroyed. He dies alone from infection.10/10 Would remove brain again			"

								This is a fantastically enjoyable game for the obsessively detail oriented; you are building a community, but stuff happens; a mid-fall cold snap cripples the winter food supply, and you have to decide whether to eat the dogs, or hold out just a little longer waiting for that caravan you called for, hoping you have enough silver to get through til spring.Spring comes, everyone survived, even the dogs, then eight raider from a nearly tribe invade, killing half the dogs and paralyzing one of your original colonists, who helped you build everything from day one.She now sits in a hospital bed, waiting for someone to feed and talk to her, while her friends and lovers die, and are replaced by new, strange faces, living in the homes she built, her home slowly moving on without her. This game creates stories that actually make you feel things, rather than ""press x to throw the baseball at the racist"".			"

								Okay, so this is one of the few games I pirated before buying, just because I didn't really want to waste $30 on a game I wouldn't play. And I know about Steam refunds, but I find that I need a bit more than just 2 hours to get full impressions on a game, but that's besides the point.The point is that this game is, to put it simply, bloody fantastic. The level of depth that this game goes into is simply amazing. I won't go into the gameplay that much, because I find it's more fun to discover it for yourself, but I will give you a brief overview of the plot if you play the standard scenario. Three colonists are in cryptosleep, only to be awaken by their ship falling apart. They barely manage to make it to the escape pods, which land on an unknown rimworld. Your job, as a hive-mind commander sort of thing, is to help your colonists survive by giving them indirect (or sometimes direct) orders. Whilst trying to keep your colony alive and happy through random events (good or bad) that occur. These include, but are not limited to: raids, flashstorms, trade caravans and heatwaves. These events are determined by an AI story teller you choose before starting the game, each having different personalities. Depending on how you play this game and what AI you choose, crazy things can happen. As an example, once my colonist, who's son had just died, went on a rampage, shot his cat with a minigun, then ate it. So yea...So if you are a fan of Prison Architect or Dwarf Fortress, then I definitely recommend picking up this game. Even if you aren't a fan of either of those games, still check this game out.

Every playthrough is randomized enough to not be ""Samey"" but not so much that tactics you learn are incompatible. It builds on all the other city building games we've seen in the last few years (Gnomoria, Towns, Dwaf Fortress, etc) and improves on what made those games interesting. Temperature management, surgery for organ damage, monster rancher, forest fire fighting, and so much more with the mods.			"

								The learning curve is crazy in this game, but after three or four failed Colonies, you will understand why it is a 'colon'y. Let me tell you about this last colony.. It was three females. Everything was going fantastic! We were in a perfect location, so if any raids happened, our turrets would gun them down. Even the lone crazy turtle, didn't last long. Everyone had their part and we even saved a 4th female. She became our researcher! We had amazing amounts of medicine, food and 3 out of the 4 ladies could doctor if needed. How ever... all this changed when I put in a stove. Good lord. You would think I started WW3. Fights started on who was cooking and who was doing what. And sadly, this Utopia ended in a great ball of fire. Literally. A fire started on the stove and everyone, including our trusty bull named ""Gordo"" burned to death. 10/10Would build a mecca for women again... but will leave the stove out until I replace all the wood for stone.

								I've been playing this since early Alpha release about two years ago. It is hands down one of the best games I've ever played.Gameplay is straightforward once you get the hang of the Architect menus, but it has incredible depth and behind-the- scenes complexity, from its incredibly fun combat and injuries/medical systems to your colonists' interpersonal relationships and psychology to your interactions with the environment.Every game is completely different, and replayablility is ehnanced by a large and excellent modding community that continues to produce even greater varieties of play experience. And it's still only Early Access! The devs are committed, active on their forums, and have big plans.Build the base of your dreams, establish a production economy, and watch it all get torched by raiders! What more could you ask for? p.s. cannibalism isn't required - strictly speaking - but you know you're going to try it.			"

								Everything was great, sun was shining, colonists were smiling. Then the Pirate Band attacked...RimWorld is a top-down God/Colony simulator. Artistically similar to games like Prison Architect, RimWorld expands on the ""do as I have commanded"" gameplay of similar top-down titles, and throws in a healthy dose of colonial revolt, complicated romances, creepy breathing and calamity, just to make things exciting.In this story, a colony of 5 that had crash-landed on a an arid, tree-less plain. It was cold, food was scarce and shelter was nowhere to be seen. A few seasons later, the colony was flourishing. Food and medicine a-plenty, other space-faring travellers found salvation when they joined the crew. They had healthy trade relations with other nearby colonies and tribes. A few disagreeances and minor arguments broke out between certain opinionated individuals, but for the most part everything was OK.Then a pet boomalope exploded right in the middle of the trade plaza due to malnourishment. It exploded on one of their trade partners. They didn't like that.Not. One. Bit.A battle broke out, they escaped. They thought they were safe, but it turns out this outlander colony was allied with certain powerful people. Several more seasons passed.Then the siege alarm sounded... the Space Pirates arrived...I can still hear the mortar shells exploding around me... the cries of my colonists in pain... the crackle of the fire burning my colony to the ground...11/10 would accidentally start RimWorld War 3 again.

								my colony came under siege, so i was forced to send my 7 soldiers out to dislodge the enemy from their position.Due to every one of my colonists having undiagnosed parkinsons diseas they managed to draw the attention of several vicious grizzly bears, which turned the Guerilla warfare operation into a 3-way battle involving legs and hands being torn off on both sides.After 2 of my colonists were downed i ordered a retreat, and brought out my previously acquired incendiary launcher to cover my retreat. As my colonist (boyle) was rescuing the husband of my pacifist doctor, Boyle was shot in the foot, slowing him down, and almost allowing the enemy to catch up.In the nick of time, Mooney, armed with an incendiary launcher, arrived to slow the enemy. The rockets from the incendiary launcher set fire to the dense forest in which the battle had taken place, effectively dooming the enemy to a horrible death.As Mooney turned to head toward my fortifications, the enemy sniper fired a lucky shot straight through Mooney's stomach, killing her instantly. Her sacrifice saved the lives of my other 8 colonists, and the one prisoner taken from the battle was made to pay for their crimes; in the form of compulsory organ donation.Never before in a game have I seen such intense and compelling stories from entirely unscripted gameplay. The Indie games industry is not about games like Ark, or Rust, they are about gems, which provide experiences unlike anything that could be had in a scripted AAA masterpiece.

								I wanna start off by saying that I generally hate single player games. I absolutely love online player interaction. This game does not have that yet, it's all about you building a colony and interacting with ai colonies/tribes/factions. This game can make you forget about time and not want to do anything else but make sure your colony stays alive. I love this game and you won't find me playing any single player games besides this one. If there is ever a mutliplayer mode, I ALWAYS play that. This game manages to have enough creativity and story though in just the every day to day survival of your colony in the world of RimWorld.10/10, would say this is one of the best games ever created if it would support online functionality. This game has a lot of potential and is always growing :)!			"

								Ok at first i was scared to play this before the tutorial was added ( i didnt have a clue how to cook or anything) and i write this after getting my 6 colonist into space.but after a few miss starts (mainly me digging into a mechanoid nest and dying) i got a stable colony going!i clapped and yay'ed as my 2 colonist hooked up and finally married.I thought ""WTF!?"" as my most usefull colonist kills another Colonist with his FIST! ( he was happy the his rival was dead and that he got a proper burial!?)I ""aww"" with joy after i tamed a black panther and a colonist named it ""Don"" then slightly loled when it got shot in the head by my turret and it now has brain damage as it wanders the empty base. (there is plenty of food)And i said ""Oh sh..."" as my Husky that been with us from the start got shot defending the base from raiders just 2 days before i finished the ship!I love this game and cant wait to see what they add to this!

								I held off buying this for awhile since it's early access. I finally broke down and bought it a few weeks ago and played it this weekend. It's a fully finished game. As others have said, don't be fooled this time by the ""early access"" tag. There is so much to do, no bugs that I've found, and an amazing mod community. I'm sorry I didn't purchase it early.Now if my one colonist would stop stripping and running around like crazy that would be great. Just because you're cat got shot by raiders wasn't mean you need to do that!			"

								I don't usually write reviews but this game is damn addicting.  I'm also not a huge indie guy but the guts and mechanics are pretty solid, even in alpha.  If you're like me and want games that you can obsess over and thereby have the opportunity to ignore your friends and family, this is for you.  And the PC resource footprint is pretty mild so you can waste time on your work computer too!  I haven't geeked out with a game like this probably since Terraria.  I give it top marks and can't wait for all the new features!			"

								wonderful colony management, survival, combat, and depth of gameplay.detailed stats for every creature in game. i Had an iguana that developed dementia, a tamed bear with astma to wich i have transfered a healthy lung taken from a prisoner.Every playtrough is unique, every load is unique , events are random and keep the game fresh.Every colonyst is unique and with awesome mods the game becomes an even more in depth and hardcore expericne, or it can become the utopia u have dreamed to acomplish since you had a dream.Game dificulty is set by the player, the 3 storytellers(aka game modes IMO) are incredibly well made and realy offer a great experience. After playing a few times on base builder difculty i felt ready for more chalange, i was blasted to pieces and the last dificulty with joy and tears on my face, my colony burned to ash by stormtroopers, we defended to the last one with bows and rifles. One survivor went into shock and was leftr for dead by the invaders. After the atack he came back to life only to bury his friends among the ruins of the colony. after the last tomb was dig he went crazy and locked him slef in a room and died of starvation.WARNING: NEVER EVER NEVER EVER name any colonyst after you, your friends or anyone elso you know, they will die, thats a fact or you will end up loading to the limit of exploit. I can go on with this but is not enough. buy it, play it, love it, hate it, play more.			"

								This game is just absolutely, utterly, unbelievably fantastic. I've been a supporter of Rimworld since 2013, when I purchased into one of the very early versions, and I've been a huge fan ever since, I've logged hundreds of hours on the game before it was released on Steam. This game crafts you a story and crazy things can and will absolutely happen. I've had spurned lovers go on rampages killing the person who spited them, a bear defending my colony kill half a dozen tribal attackers emerging only with a new collection of scars, plagues wipe out colonies in the blink of an eye, and had amputate the leg of a colonist after a vicious squirrel attack. This game never gets old, never gets reptitive, and it will always shock you with just how organic and original it can be. It's absolutely worth the purchase, a great game with an enormously responsive developer, and constant, signifcant updates. If you do get this game (Which you absolutely should) just remember, never reload a save if something terrible happens, it might be incredibly tempting if you lose a colonist during a raid, or a farming season goes badly, or a colonist goes on a cathartic drinking spree. This isn't the kind of game you play to win, it's the kind of game you play to experience.			"

								And with yet more hours under my belt, a story emerges with ease from my latest settlement, and the most insane colonist I've ever had.What began as a simple bid to survive amidst the mountainous waste-lands proved odder than many had ever thought. The colony first consisted of three. Gen, a depressive nudist, Aaron, the too-smart taster, and Slade, a volatile young Urbworld CriminalThey were an ecclectic bunch, but they were hard workers. Hunters, growers, miners, builders. The colony shaped. The mountain nurtured them. She housed them, sheltered them. But it could not always be a time of peace in that place they grew to call Taynid's Navel.Without warning, they came. At first few, but with time, many. The raiders of Hyenas Forest and the Pirate band known as the Murderous Vultures. Their eyes set on that place, its flourishing farms nestled before the great mountain.The colony fought.Gen and Aaron, though they were hard workers, they seemed ill equipped to deal with the harsh realities of battle. Particularly battle brought on by nothing more than greed and apathy. But Slade? He was born to it. For all his short years, he had lived it.They don't recall which; the fourth? Maybe the fifth incursion? But the son of the leader of the Hyenas himself headed a raid on the mountain's children. A proud raider, he nearly brought them their goal, too. Gen and Aaron were pinned, they were outmatched, no matter how hard they struck, the raider fought on, thriving on the violence and bloodshed.And from the ringing gunshots and yells, Slade awoke. The boy worn out from his hard night's toil, rose with fury in his heart. He disliked being disturbed. The doors of the colony slammed open, and out he stormed into the midst of battle. A bee-line was made for the Leader's son.With one brutal punch, the raider fell, crumpling to the dusty earth.Emboldened by their comrade, and the fall of the raid leader, the colony pushed back, and soon had the Hyenas on the run. The day was theirs, once more to continue building a life for themselves. Slade took from the fallen raider, his tuque, and walked back inside.Seasons passed, the colony grew, and the Hyenas came sniffing once more. This time, fuelled by grief and a hunger for vengeance, the leader of the raiders himself made himself known. The force was greater, and their goal was clear. Take revenge on those that had stolen so greatly from them.And just like his son, they struck a terrible blow against the colony, nearly bringing it to its knees. Several were wounded, but so too were the leader's forces.It would do for now. They could return at their leisure, and finish the task. As they turned, they found one of the colonists laying helpless from the fighting. A grin crossed the leader's face, and hefting the helpless figure onto his shoulder, began a trek back towards their squallid hovel, to plan, and divest the mountain of her children.Once more they had overlooked the sleeping Urbworld criminal.At the cries from the colonists still conscious, Slade made his appearance. Though he was volatile, and he had little rapport with the others, they were there with him, celebrating with him, suffering with him, working hard to eke out a living in that place. They had earned his respect.His pistol flashed, his shot rang out, and with a curse, the leader from the Hyenas Forest dropped his struggling prize.The stories spoke of the figure that had taken his son's life. The monster that had ended his most prized pillager and fighter with a single, merciless strike. A boy. A wirey boy, in poorly crafted leathers, and his son's tuque. It had to be a farce.A boy with his hardened face and burning stare that with a second bullet that went whizzing passed the leader's ear, were enough to send the leader running in pain. Reinforcements? Cowardice? Slade didn't care.He chased the man.He ran him along the plains, through the spindly make-shift paths of the mountain, over the lake of the far-reach pools. Step by pounding step, closing the gap between them. His pistol lifted, the shot rang out.The leader collapsed, yelling and swearing as the boy approached him. He froze, staring at the silent gaze looming over him. Slade lifted his pistol once more.The shot rang true.Art was crafted of the bane of the Hyenas. A party was had. The colony continued to thrive.Through the on-going raids, the fighting grew harder and harder. No one recalls who, what, or exactly when it happened, but a lucky shot to the young criminal's arm rendered it useless, and for a time seemed to rein the young Slade. But the colony had not been resting on their laurels. They, like the mountain, did not abandon their kin. Their labours and budding connections with the nearby Tribes and towns, eventually brought a caravan to their midst.And from one such caravan, they purchased a Bionic arm, and rushed Slade to the operating theater.The seasons pass, the colony thrives. Word wanders the wastelands, telling of that place, nestled deep within the mountains. To some: peaceful and just, where the hardiest of raiders have grown into peaceful, helpful souls. To others: the mountain that harbors the Bane of the Wilderness, The one with his shining metal arm, who tore the fangs from the hyena, and the wings from the vulture.Taynid's Navel.			"

								Put on basebuilder (easy) setting.  Doing pretty good up until a lightning storm, so I send my guys out to put out some fires - but one of my guys doesn't firefight.  He instead decides to clean so there is nothing to do.   Meanwhile I'm busy with the fire and one of my guys flips out and starts shooting everyone.  I send my guys to stop him - meanwhile the cleaning guy decides the rocks need to be cleaned, inside a ring of fire.  He gets trapped inside and starts requesting help - just as a pack of animals decides it's a good time to attack my people.  While I'm fighting off the wildlife my guys are down for the count.  I manage to get everything stopped and get my two injured people to drag back two unconcious people.I quickly put those guys in hospital beds, but the cleaner dies - and the crazy shooter actually lives and starts getting better.  As I have my game on fast forward he stumbles out of his hospital bed tho and takes a nap in my freezer - dying from the cold and being frozen before I even realized what happened.  Meanwhile one of the two remaining guys gets in a fight with an angry bear - then a group of exploding buffalo come so I say screw it, and send my last guy out with a knife to end the game.The republicans would blame this all on Obama.

								Jono was a simple man with simple taste. He never wanted anything too extravagant. He just wanted to build. Well Jono saw one dead corpse and decided to lose his mind. After attacking other settlers, the others decided to incapacitate him. Jono soon went into a coma only to awaken months later. He then went insane again and killed one of my colonsists while the others had to put him down. Safe to say, Jono would never taste the simplicities of life again. Seriously though, great game!

Looks solid.Last minute, the new chick dived over the sandbags pistol blazing.My rifle-chick shot at the tribals, miss-aimed, hit the new chick in the spine. New chick insta-killed.Desperately hold off tribals till they flee. My crop-grower/Researcher and doctor took a few melee hits.Took them back to get rest in bed. No doctor to bandage up my doctor..Doctor is very slowly recovering..Suddenly, heatwave.Doctor dies a slow death over the course of three days from blood loss and heart attack from heat exhaustion.Now Fernandez and Ayoya live alone in a once thriving settlement with their pet turtle, Snappy.

								So this game to anyone that is buying I would recommend it this, good luck. Why do I say this? Well I had learn how to make the ship however I didn't have any uranium. Whats worse is my comm's had stopped working so that created a problem. While waiting for a faction bringing exotic goods I got hit by Randy with his 20-30+ tribal boys. Even though I had 15 colonists only 5 had guns and the rest were brawlers. The end result many dead, many wounded, and the 3 that weren't down were about to die of blood lose. So pretty much anyone that buy's the game and decides to go up against Randy don't be suprised that he makes you restart a 1000 times. But over all its a great game and you learn quickly to love the people that create mods in this community.P.S. for those that will say why didn't I just travel to a different spot I couldn't. What I mean by that is I literlly placed myself on an island in the middle of the ocean. So yay regret doing that now.			"

								My doctor, Azrael, had a fear of animals, and an abhorrence of violence (something messed up happened in his past, maybe his parents were murdered by a ferret or something).Anyway long story short, for some reason a chincilla went mad near our base when Wulf and Kaerie (my Hunter and his wife, the Miner) were off hunting and mining respectively. So the chincilla went for poor Azrael, who basically ran for his life due to swearing off violence. He ended up getting incapacitated by the damn thing, and thankfully Wulf went to rescue him and killed the chincilla in revenge.Azrael lost a toe in the scuffle (it became majorly infected and had to be amputated), and had some minor wounds to his legs and torso, however came out fine in the end. Wulf even made him a nice Chincilla-skin hat from the beasts hide to wear as a memoir. We never did let him live that down. We made him wear it to the great feast we had to celebrate his recovery (which used the meat we got from it too)TL;DRWhat are you doing reading reviews? Go buy it now! You won't regret it!			"

								You choose one of 3 ai storytellers at the beginning of the game. They throw everything they can at you to burn, freeze, slaughter, starve or otherwise wipe you're beloved flegling settlement off the map. Your settlers each have their own skills and foibles which flesh them out and distinguish them. This is fundamentally a game about optimally allocating time and scant resources to meet the unrelenting disasters the game throws at you, but the settler traits and events give the world a touch of life and narrative beyond the bare strategy mechanics. The game is still being developed, but is fun to to play and feels complete in it's current form.			"

Me being the noob that i was thought if i forget about it, it would go away....i was wrong. It started with heat stroke initial, i did not care and forgot about it, this was my first mistake. my second was the fact that i did not care about cooling so i hoped it would go away. The final nail in the coffin was when my most competent colonist collasped, acting on impulse i sent someone to go get him,the person who went to get him collasped...... soon enough this started a chain reaction in the colony with everyone down, me being ignorant, hoped they would get back up...they never did. That is how my first game went10/10 would die again			"

								Alpha 16 review. Early Access is a dangerous place to buy a game. I've been burned, specifically Towns (which is sad, because I rather enjoyed it). Many devs have the issue of not balancing out features with objectives (in-game, or the content to be able to come up with your own). Rust gets dull quickly, with most time spent leveling up, and Townes had a breaking point that you could reach within a few hours. The developer of Rimworld, however, has done a very good job of balancing out features and things to do in a Early Access Game. Hell, I put in 50 hours of playtime last week. Almost no bugs, and nothing that is gamebreaking. Lots of animals, character traits, backstory, mystery, and events. The ""ancient engine of hate"" line about the psychic drone gave me tingles, and reminded me of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.All in all, one of the only Early Access games that is worth buying in Early Access. The developer could say that this is a completed game, and I would feel it was worth the $30 that I paid. The developer, last I heard, is still working hard at updates!Pretty big mod catalog and support too, but I can't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to actually deal with modding and keeping things up to date. As the game is still actively being updated, you don't have the mod stability you find with Skyrim or Rise of the Reds.All in all, worth the $30 I paid for it.			"

								I told one of my people to hunt a deer, thinking it would be a good source of meat. The deer, along with 10 of his deer friends, immediately mobbed him and he was lying on the ground writhing in pain. The gang of deer then proceeded to charge my colony, kick down the door, and brutally trample the rest of my people.10/10, would get killed by deer again.			"

								I highly recommend Dwarf Fortress...I mean Rimworld!!!  This game is meta on detail but in a way that every detail actually matters and helps build the story of your colony.  The learning curve is of medium difficulty.  Watch a simple video tutorial and you can totally figure out the rest.Oh, and don't let psychopaths or cannibals into your colony unless you do.  If you do, you are a horrible, horrible person:)			"

								this game i SO much darker then it seems. i had a very successful colony in which everyone was really happy and even a marriage occurred. But suddenly things took a turn. one of my colonists named feeb began acting up. i looked into it and found out she has gone blind and had dementia and Alzheimers, so i tried to help her, but she refused to have the surgery, so i had my mail guy arrest her, but she resisted and the AI fired  shot gun shell at her knocking her out. she was dragged off to medical where i tried to help her, but i could do nothing, so tried to euthanize her, but i didn't have the resources, the next best thing was to remove her heart, so i tried, but it didn't work. she died of pain instead and the heart was not harvested. so i left it to the AI thinking they will give her a burial. But no> one of them grabbed her slammed her on the butchers table, cut her up and cooked her. a few days went by and nothing odd happened. then a raid occurred, the woman who was married was killed in it, and coincidentally her husband was the doctor and the warden, so he captured the woman who killed her, and put her in a prison nut she woke up. so i cooled down the room to -50 and she passed out, and which point i harvested her lungs liver kidneys and heart, gouged her eyes out, replaced her legs with pegs and left her to die. then butchered and ate her. so basically 10/10 recommend and would butcher again			"

 Frozen Mountain: Day 15 We have managed to dig a base inside a mountain and are surviving by mixing crops with hunt. Couples are starting to form. We are currently researching electricity. 7 Villagers Remaining Cold snap, temperature goes down 40 degrees. All the crops are gone instantly.No problem: we have enough food for a season and we'll plant some crops inside the mountain just in case.The roof breaks in a bedroom, villager goes insane from cold, runs out of base and gets killed by wolves.Cold snap passes, resources are low, temperatures aren't rising much since we're in late fall.We start going on long hunting trips but everything is dead.Almost no more wood for heat, the tree have all been burned for heat/cooking.It's too cold indoors even for crops, they stop growing.Leader kills a man after he rejects her advances.Sister of deceased starts eating our remaining food in her room, she catches a cold and dies. 4 Villagers Remaining Some big furry white animals appear, kill 4 of them and butcher for food, hunter/beasttamer killed by wild boar.Villager leader has an infection and a flu -> dies without so much as an ""atchoo"". 2 Villagers Remaining WellRounded is keeping NoManualLabor villager alive. NoManualLabor goes berserk from having seen all his friends die and starts killing our remaining animals.WellRounded tries to stop NoManualLabor with his fists and gets killed in the process.NoManualLabor gets bitten by the last remaining husky and is left to die in the kitchen. Husky saves him from death 24 hours later by bringing him in bed.Travelling nomads come by to trade. NoManualLabor is incapacitated so no contact, the nomads get bored after a day so they steal our food give it to their bears.NoManualLabor dies from an untreated infection.10/10 Would go through frozen hell again.

								PROSThis game is absolutely brutal \m/Though it's in Early Access, I would almost consider it full-featured already (definitely still some major fixes/additions I'm waiting on)Astoundingly detailed character health/skills/personality/mood - love it. Like The Sims ""needs"" system with Dwarf Fortress injuries and equipment.Weather, seasons, temperatureMods up the butt!Random occurrances such as pirate raids, visitors, heatwaves, rabid animals, and toxic smog keep the game interestingIf you don't take care of them, colonists go berserk and start murdering their own -- just like in the USA!Pets <3 (it's really something special when your colonists run around naked and yell at trees because their cat died)Prisons and prisoner recruiting and organ harvestingMEHThe game world only exists in 2 dimensions. As a result, resources can be much scarcer than in Dwarf Fortress and similar games. Mining only gets you so far, then you need to sell crops, animals, art, or people to trade for things like steel and gold. This would be alright, except you've no idea how long you may need to wait before someone willing to trade comes along with the resources you want.CONSOne wrong click in combat and your dudes will straight murder eachother. A friendly fire toggle with some kind of simple combat AI would be nice. All I want is for the colonist with the shotgun to take a step to the side before splattering friendly melons everywhere! "

								A great devastation wiped out the tribe. The five surviving members of the tribe set out led by Crow, who was raised in a cave as a child and went on to become his tribe's most brilliant hacker despite not having the technology level to build computers. Crow and his four companions found a nice spot in a world that was largely deserts. It was the sole tropical forest.Crow and his friends get to work! They build up some sleeping quarters, a research area (maybe one day Crow, gifted hacker, will be able to figure out how to make a computer, like the prophecy foretold), and then disaster struck. Raiders from the desert wastelands beyond the new tribe's village had attacked! After beating one of them unconscious and stabbing the other two to death with spears and taking their guns, Bear, the tribe's resident medic, stood by while the rest of the tribe very quickly built a prison. Bear brought the fallen man whose name was Gizzard, to the prison.The group decided to try to recruit Gizzard, and meanwhile Crow and two other tribals headed down to start excavating out some of the compacted steel in the hills nearby. However, Crow noticed a wall and it terrified him. It was made out of polished granite. Despite Crow's warnings, Soup, the tribe's primary researcher (who was also a cave child, and a pyromaniac) decided to take down one of the walls.Beyond the wall was a series of four pods. Strange things, they said CRYOSLEEP on them. The tribe went to bed that night, but Crow knew taking down that wall was a bad idea.The next day, the pods were empty and open. What happened? Well, no bother. The tribe needed to forage, and Bear and a one of the other tribeswomen (Lilac, an art-loving psychopath), went off to hunt.Then the sleeping occupants came back with heavy assault rifles and two arctic foxes.Sadly, the last of the tribe of Goreflicker was no more.10/10. Dwarf fortress in spaaaaaaace.			"

								In an age of $60 dollar games with huge over rated budgets RimWorld gently snuck under the radar. With it's simplistic graphics and concept, I expected a mindless tower defense game, but what I got would be anything but mindless. RimWorld's attention to detail and careful considerations made (and continues to make) me feel like an architect, social scientist, therapist, prison warden, match-maker, and warlord. Not since I was in the fourth grade thinking of the Legend of Zelda have I spent the quiet moments of my day thinking of creative solutions to heat waves, mental break downs, or a stampede of rhinos. But what makes this game memorable isn't the gameplay, but the stories that are made. Buy this game, learn it, and never look back.			"

								While I don't have many hours logged on steam, I have owned the game since early alpha and I would recommend this as the perfect RTS/Colony Sim game, hell if you like games were you play god and are in charge of people then this is perfect, if you even think this game looks remotely good get it, I have hundreds of hours logged out side of steam and if I didn't recieve a key for it when it came out on steam (I got one since I bought the game a long time ago) I would have bought it again just out of support for Tynan and Ludeon studios, they have great customer service and are very active with their community. So yea I'd highly recommend this game. I mean if you want you can have a colony of people who do nothing other than capture and butcher people who come through your land and then eat them, harvest and sell their organs and turn their skin into couches, or you can run a prison colony and sell people or make colony of vegan hippies with hundreds of animals and all wind/solar power, you can have a colony of super human cyborgs who build a spaceship and then you can send people into space to do stuff, the posibilities here are endless and its honestly one of the best games I've ever played			"

								The town started as soon as our spaceship crashed. Three of us, Leeta, my wife, trevor, my uncle, and I were the only survivors. We began to build, I was the miner and builder, Leeta was the gardener and cook, and trevor was the doctor and inventor. Soon, our little home was blessed with a new survivor, I don't remember his name, but I always called him steve the failure. Steve was an assassin that could only shoot. and when he did, he fired all the bullets. Whatever. We made him our hunter, and he went about killing every animal he saw. And he was good. Then winter came. The Crops that were still in the ground died, and the animals turned mean. Then the raiders came, and stole trevor away. We never saw him again, I still have the necklace that belonged to my mother her gamve to me. I blamed steve for our loss, he didn't care, he could never care. He just seemed incapable of it. In the spring, I found out that Leeta was with child. I was the happiest i have ever been. Our love had culminated in a child. Then, one day, while she was in the fields, she was attacked by a pack of manhunting elephants. I held her in my arms as she died. Tears fell down my face as I buried my wife in a ditch that steve had the gall to call a grave. I took my anger our on steve. It was just us now, I couldn't hurt him, I couldn't hurt anyone, not the elephants that came to kill my wife and unborn child, not the raiders that took my uncle, and not the man that I despised. I lost control, my eyes went red, and I attacked steve, until he had beaten me unconscience. He totally destroyed my nose and ears, and I gave him a bruise on his right tibia. Serves him right. That night, as I lay in my bed, I hear the raiders come, their drums pound in the night, I hear the crack of the hunting rifle from steve, but since he fires so fast he just didn't aim. I hear his rifle fire abruptly stop, I hear new sounds of fire. I don't like fire, not since that accident when I was a kid. I'll just lay here for a little while longer. They are in the house, I see them, one punch and i'm on the ground, helpless, they put a sack over my head, hoist me over their raider's leader's shoulder, I just hope that they opened up that wall that I suspect was the house of an ancient danger...

								Built a tribe of primitive people's after their homes were destroyed by massive machines of death. We built houses for ourselves and set upon mining great amounts of steel. We then constructed an enormous round hut and named our village Steelhut after it. We set upon building more buildings than we could use, incase any nearby tribes people decide to join. After 2 new recruits, and a couple small raids of 2-3 tribesmen, we decided we needed to enclose our farms and houses with steel walls and steel buildings. With this completed we fortified the only entrance to our village.The head shaman had been working on new magics in the great hall of the steelhut. After discovering advanced clothing like dusters and cowboy hats, as well as how to forge steel weapons and great bows. We set upon making these weapons and equipped our best hunters with great bows. But we were after a new magic: electricity. Our tribe had seen electricity before, in lightning storms and the machines, but out shaman believed we could harness it for ourselves. Though she predicted it would take many months to finalize.Several months went by quietly, and winter was nearly upon us. Food crops had been plentiful and our hunters had bountiful hunts. Pemmican was stocked up, but electricity was still being researched. With only about a month left of research we hear an outsider call our tribe. A machine collector named Braun was being chased by a violent gang of people. My people did not want this outsider among us, but the shaman believed that perhaps Braun's knowledge of machines would help our people uncover the secrets of electricity. So we offered Braun residence, and prepared our warriors to defend our homes.As Braun's arrived at the village the raiders after him had begun closing in. Braun went to grab a steel mace, as the pacifist shaman cleaned the great hall. As the Raiders closed in my people quickly realized they were outmatched as the Raiders carried rifles and guns. Our best warrior was shot dead almost instantly. A second warrior shared a similar fate right afterwards. Another warrior was downed so the shaman set upon rescuing her, but was shot by the raiders doing so requiring her to rest and heal after setting her friend down in the hospital bed. Next almost instantly two more of the warriors we're incapacitated, so the remaining warrior and Braun back up. The raiders advance killing Braun almost instantly before my warrior kills the raider attacking them. After seeing three of their own drop and so many of mine drop the raiders decided it was time to pick up their losses and grab our injured survivors and haul them off as prisoners.Down to three villagers all injured we had to make do with doctoring. The least injured was the shaman who was first to recover and then began tending to the others. However warrior who survived his last stand began to come down with an infection. He died shortly thereafter. Soon due to all the death and destruction that occured our pacifist shaman went outside and then berserk. She began attacking all the local wildlife without remorse until a lowly squirrel tore her throat out... The person the shaman rescued recovered after these events and woke to find everyone around her dead, blood splashed on the walls and floors. So she did the only logical thing...she kept researching electricity. Being an excellent researcher she managed to discover the secrets to electricity in only a few days time, and armed with that knowledge swept out across the land abandoning the decaying husk of the fort she once called home.10/10 would save someone to have my village overrun by mass gun wielding murderers again.

								An amazing city builder/manager game with some combat elements! Very satisfying to watch each colonist do their part for the new society to function, which makes deaths all the rougher to deal with when no one can fill the hole he left			"

								Probably one of the most fun games that I play.  I keep coming back to it when ever i need something to do.  It has the dwarf fortress feel that makes it interesting but you can actually understand what is going on without a dictionary sized manual.  Now if only there were z-levels.			"

								Timesink, awesome game.I'd be willing to throw money after some sort of co-op multiplayer, where you could each ""control"" / assign work orders to characters. Host could give control of characters to people who joined, sort of like in divinity.Anyways, regardless of multiplayer / co-op. Worth it.			"

								You are not supposed to play this game to win it. You are not to expect that it will let you ""beat"" it. Hell, you aren't even supposed to have a chance at survival at all. This game hates you with every bit of its existence. Its unfairness will test you until you fall. Its goal is to break you until you are sure you cannot be broken, before it snaps you like a twig. Its purpose is not something to be taken as sport. You are not supposed to best this game. You do not play this game. You experience it. If what you are looking for is a game you can overcome with perseverance and ingenuity, then leave, as the only way to beat it is to cheat it, and that's not fun.  But if you want what can only be described as an experience worth having, in the form of overcoming hardships, drama of community, naive hope, twisted insanity, and crushing despair...Welcome to rimworld... prepare to die...

								So everything is going great. Trigger, Katia and Chaney are trudging along, my base is taking shape, I have lots of resources, my colonists are happy. BUT for some reason, everyone that wants to join my colony, with pirates in their heels every time, are all incapable of violence. This means that very soon Trigger, Katia and Chaney have like five people to protect against increasinly difficult enemies. All of the sudden, Trigger is ambushed and carried off, Chaney dies of an infectious turtle bite and Katia goes berserk over the loss of her friends and kills the other doctor in the group, is left incapacitated after pirates attack with hand grenades and dies of an infection due to lack of medicine.I swear, this game is making me rip my hair out at an alarming rate, as it gives you some things to get you going, to just rip the carpet from under you and leave you with imbeciles, wear you down with dry thunderstorms, beavers, raids, mental breakdowns and mad animals until a mechanoid comes along and slaughters the last four pacifists like dogs and rip your base apart.It's ♥♥♥♥ing good though...

The learning curve is of medium difficulty.  Watch a simple video tutorial and you can totally figure out the rest.Oh, and don't let psychopaths or cannibals into your colony unless you do.  If you do, you are a horrible, horrible person:)			"

								Another typical day around the camp. I'm swinging a pick on the periphery of the main barracks again, hoping to open up enough room that we're not always under each other's feet. The noise from pick on stone isn't enough to drown out the screams from the lockup where Bodie is amputating the prisoner's gangrenous leg; I bet he doesn't even thank Bodie afterwards, assuming of course he lives. And I hope I don't have to haul the leg out. Arthur is tinkering at his improvised lab bench, trying to figure out how to rig up hydroponic gardens from the junk we have around, so that if the game stops running in the winter we'll have something to eat. Vas is out right this minute stalking an elk and so far she's fed us real well, but frankly the more time she spends away from camp the better if you ask me. There's something dead in those eyes.It's not much but it's home. We call it Hard Times.			"

								Playing Rimworld is like getting into an abusive relationship. The first time you run out of food and everyone dies you let the game convince you it was your fault. When you keep it happy for long enough to start killing your colonists off with diseases you start looking for where you went wrong.But as things continue you start to realise that no matter how much it tells you it loves you, it's just going to keep tossing fire, random explosions, medicine shortages, degrading clothes, hard to please colonists, raids, rabid animals, solar flares, and more at you, no matter how you try to please it.I hate this game so much, and I can't stop playing.

			Rimworld is one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. This review doesn't even scratch the surface of everything you're able to do.		

Rimworld is a colony simulation, and it's probably my favorite game of 2016 so far. Every colony has it's own specific narrative, even if it fails. The game doesn't necessarily hold your hand, and is a wonderful example of learning through failure to make it just another day, week, month, or year further than your last attempt. Watch my video review for a more in-depth look at Rimworld.			"

								When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build a colony on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, Lad, the strongest colony in all of the Rimworlds.I backed this on kickstarter way back in 2013 and until it came to steam I barely played it. What a mistake that was. This game is phenominal, it takes some of the best parts of Dwarf Fortress and pairs them with a bearable UI and lovely, if basic, graphics to create an absolute masterpiece. It was good when I backed it, but now it is a must have.Buy this game or i'll amputate both your legs and replace them with pegs, and i'll harvest one of your lungs and make you eat it. In the game of course. :)			"

								Started off as a good day. Everyone was content in their little house. Foods being made and people are happy. Alert! Beavers are attacking the forests. Must try and save the wood! Load up and go out to defeat a small group of beevers. Wrong. They took out almost the whole colony. RIP.I didn't give up so easy. I came up with a plan. It had to work, it must. I went to a recent save before the attack and tried again. I will get them 1 by 1, while they slept. Yes, they can kill me that way. I had my guys creep through the woods and sneak up on them and start taking them out 1 by 1. The plan was working! My guys are thriving with this well thoughout plan of evilness. Whats that? A fire? At my house? Crap. I retreat from the misson at hand and run back to the house to have my awesome fire fighters save my house. What the heck is wrong with them?! Theyre standing in the fire! Nooo, dont lay down in it! Ones dead, no 2. Retreat! Forget about the house, save yourselves! No not the pets. 2 more people dead. Another pet dies. The boomalpoe. BOOM. It blew up the other half of the house as it died. And the rest of the colonists scream in pain as I can do nothing but watch. What a sad end to a seemingly good day. :(10/10 would watch them burn again. You honestly never know what your going to get with this game. :D Beyond highly recommended!			"

								So I've never reviewed a game before, but I feel the need to let people know that this game is extremely fun, on it's own it offers a lot of customization, and then goes the extra mile with mods, Well worth the price of admission if you ask me. I just want to tell anyone who is on the fence about purchasing this game, about my little story of death the thrumbo. After I got the hang of playing I had decided to make a colony with the purpose of breeding thrumbos (a rare and valuable creature) and so I downloaded some mods that allow you to edit your starting crew and resources, in order to add 2 female and 2 male thrumbos to the start of my game. I ended up with a colorful cast of animals, being Death and Affinity, (the males) and GumDrop and Dolores, (the females). I had thought to myself ""Death, That is a bad♥♥♥♥♥name"" and checked his medical report, he had a few scars here and there, and had clearly been through some♥♥♥♥♥♥in his life, but I had yet to realize how bad♥♥♥♥♥this guy actually was. Eventually while building my base in the side of a mountain, The game announced a party of raiders was attacking my base, I thought I was ♥♥♥♥ed, becuase my only real defenders were off hauling resources, and the raiders spawned right next to my base. Thats where I was wrong. As the raiders neared my base, they ran across Death, who was sitting outside in a field, eating a tree. One of the ♥♥♥♥-wits decided it would be a good idea to take a shot at him. That was the last mistake he ever made, death immediately rushed them and began pummeling the goup of 3-4 raiders to the ground as my defenders made their way over. Death sustained massive injuries in the process including but not limited to: gunshot wounds to the Torso, liver, neck, Front two arms, Head, Brain, and the magnificent horn on his head, and even withstood the explosion of an incendiary Grenade from one of the raiders. He and managed to kill all but one of the raiders before my defenders even got to him, and becuase I had no idea how to get him medical attention, he stayed like that for 3 ingame days before I figured it out. He then later got into another spat with some android raider things, who were firing on one of the pregnant female thrumbos, murdered them single handedly. Death, throughout the entirety of this play through has sustained major permenant damage to his brain and both of his eyes, but some how he still finds a way to break into the colony's brewery and get so absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥faced, that he can't stand up right and has to be carried back to his bed. At this point in time, I have downloaded mods that allow me to replace the organs of animals with bionic substitutes, in order to give Death his eyes back. In my opinion this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, and I can't believe they still have things to come. If you are interested in games like this, I can't recommend it enough, I almost hope they never take it out of early access, because I don't want this project to come to an end.			"

								This are the final moments of my first colony (that actually lasted for a week).This one guy who was the resident mele specialist got upset because his pet chicken (emu but whatever) was bitten by a cobra and died, so he eventually went berserk ... and proceeded to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out and ended breaking two of his colleagues' legs ... while at the same time, a generator exploded and lit the whole camp on fire. Meanwhile raiders showed up and stole the only woman in the camp... who was coincidentally the guy's lover. ... this was on medium difficulty.... anyway ... the rain had put out the fire by this point however there was no more food in the camp... or so i thought.... So... ... Seeing as though Mr lucky just couldn't be bothered for a while.... because he was having a strong psychotic break... and was humping a plant for about a day non-stop... both guys with broken legs died off because there was nobody to get them the propper treatment. ... I'm fairly certain that the cessation of their anguish-infused cries for help had diminished the number of voices in Mr lucky's head who, at this point, had exhausted himself and collapsed on the floor... sleeping like a baby for about a day.... I'm curious whether he noticed his lover's dissapearance.It gets weirder...Mr lucky here, who i swear was basically Lecter in the movie Red Dragon ... during the philharmonic crew dinner party scene (i.e. just waiting for an excuse to eat someone) ... seeing as though he didn't even stop to think about it for just a second... had woken up, and then immediately proceeded to cannibalize on one of their corpses.... then got depressed again and was eventually bitten by the cobra that killed his pet during a failed attempt to exact revenge on the scaly ♥♥♥♥er. ... did i mention that it was his ♥♥♥♥ing birthday?on a side note, here's my opinion of this game : ""Love it. Needs more work. Definetly worth it.""... oh and Mr. Lucky killed the cobra... had recovered from the snake bite after a few agonizing days... buried what remained of the now rotting corpses that were once his closest friends in a beautiful cemetery where he planted everyone's favourite flowers.... then mined straight into an ancient tomb with things that insta-killed his♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Ernie Stozka was a good man. He was the best crafter/blacksmith/tailor a colony could hope for. Raised as a mercenary, he was the best shot in the whole colony, and could be relied upon to produce weapons very quickly. He was also quite a cook.But in the back of my mind I knew, in his fragile mortal state, I would someday lose Ernie. Much like all our lives, it was inevitable. I imagined him going out in a blaze of glory defending the colony, or eventually dying of old age in his bed, surrounded by friends and family. However, being ""accidentally"" shot by the man who stole his wife was not what I envisioned. They were both drafted to attack a chicken eating wolf, which they were able to down in a few shots. Miles, the colonial surgeon and HOME WRECKING A** HAT, was to perform the coup-de-gras. Somehow, while aiming at a creature lying at his feet, ON THE GROUND, he managed to shoot Ernie through the eye (several feet above and to the left of his target), killing him instantly. Miles was quickly arrested under suspicion of Murder. Sienna, Ernie's ex-wife, was also detained under suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. Their trial was brief and definitive.Ernie was laid to rest in a silver sarcophagus covered with intricate, soul-wrenching artwork created by the Lauren, best artist available. Miles and that cheating b***h Sienna were sealed in a small cave deep inside of a granite mountain. After a few days Miles ended up cracking and beating Sienna to death shortly before succumbing to starvation himself. 10/10, would deliver righteous frontier justice again			"

It's highly addictive!I'd say this game is feature-complete and generally bug-free, but the developer keeps it Early Access because he wants to add more stuff, and as an indication that things can still change.Every big update adds tons of new features.You SHOULD buy this game!

								Here is a story. If this doesn't convince you to buy this game, I don't know what will.Day 1.My group of 3 survivors are name Mantis, the builder, Kimeko, the doctor, and Lynn, the hunter and cook. For the first few hours of their new lives, they create a small shelter and beds. Life is great for a while until their food rations start dwindling. Lynn decides to take matters into her own hands and begins hunting the nearby herd of elk. They feast on elk steak all night long.Day 3.The frosty jaws of winter enclose their small settlement, destroying Kimeko's fantasy of creating a small garden to grow vegetables and cotton. To avoid getting dangerously cold, the 3 of them huddle up in their shack to keep warm. After 2 days of imprisonment, cabin fever begins to grip their minds. They fight constantly, their social stances on each other crumbling quickly. Their seemingly endless supply of elk is quickly dimished to a pile of gristle and hide. Unable to take the pains coursing through her stomach, Lynn braves the biting cold, venturing out with the groups only functioning firearm to try and aquire a suitable meal for herself and her companions. As she stumbles through the tundra however, the cold overtakes her, and she is later found by a pack of wolves, who devour her stiff lifeless body.Day 9.Mantis and Kimeko barely cling to life as they sit in the darkness, eating the meager scraps of whatever rodent is unfortunate enough to scurry by. But a revelation occurs to Mantis. Rats arn't the only source of meat available. Within an hour, Mantis sits alone in the cabin, and while is belly is full for now, his mind slips further and further away.Day 14.As Mantis' food finally disappears down his throat for the last time, he can't help but think, ""What next?"". His body was too malnourished to hunt or gather, his friends were gone. Mantis comes to a decision. I will not succumb. He proceeds to reach into his pocket and pull out a small knife and flat chunk of flint. He carves off strips of wood off the wall next to him and gathers them in the corner. He then scrapes the knife quickly along the flint, causing sparks to fly, into the small pile of kindling. Mantis can feel his body shutting down as the fire builds, quickly engulfing the kindling and a part of the wall, despite the cold. Mantis lies back on the smooth wooden floor and closes his eyes, waiting for death.Day 15.A group of friendly tribesmen, well worn by the years of travelling, come across a destroyed cabin along their journey. While the small wooden structure is badly damaged, fire having obviously scorched it, leaving the remaining wreckage ashen and unmoving. Inside, they find a small amount of seared elk hide, and a corpse, blackened by the flames, with a shard of metal roofing lodged through his chest. They consider the body for a moment, wondering about its story, before carrying on looting it, before finally moving on.To this day, that is my shortest game of RimWorld ever.Buy this game. Its good.			"

								Everything was great, sun was shining, colonists were smiling. Then the Pirate Band attacked...RimWorld is a top-down God/Colony simulator. Artistically similar to games like Prison Architect, RimWorld expands on the ""do as I have commanded"" gameplay of similar top-down titles, and throws in a healthy dose of colonial revolt, complicated romances, creepy breathing and calamity, just to make things exciting.In this story, a colony of 5 that had crash-landed on a an arid, tree-less plain. It was cold, food was scarce and shelter was nowhere to be seen. A few seasons later, the colony was flourishing. Food and medicine a-plenty, other space-faring travellers found salvation when they joined the crew. They had healthy trade relations with other nearby colonies and tribes. A few disagreeances and minor arguments broke out between certain opinionated individuals, but for the most part everything was OK.Then a pet boomalope exploded right in the middle of the trade plaza due to malnourishment. It exploded on one of their trade partners. They didn't like that.Not. One. Bit.A battle broke out, they escaped. They thought they were safe, but it turns out this outlander colony was allied with certain powerful people. Several more seasons passed.Then the siege alarm sounded... the Space Pirates arrived...I can still hear the mortar shells exploding around me... the cries of my colonists in pain... the crackle of the fire burning my colony to the ground...11/10 would accidentally start RimWorld War 3 again.

								87.6 hrs last two weeks... I only feel like I am just getting started with this game. Rimworld has an active modding community and is still in active development. This is exactly what I am looking for in a game! I was playing a lot of Cataclysim DDA and Dwarf Fortress when I found Rimworld. I honestly can't wait to see all the great stuff the modding community will put out and I may get involved with modding as well. Truly a great game!			"

								Listen -- This game is not ""early access"" in the disappointing sense we've become accustomed to.This game may not be complete in the developers eyes, but uh... to everyone else, it is FANTASTIC already and extremely fun to play. And replay. And replay. You wont regret buying this game, and it's still growing and gaining features at a really impressive rate. Tynan is quite a disciplined developer who doesn't lose sight of his goals.This is basebuilding at its best. The little legless people have surprising depth--they have relationships, they have various work ethics and manerisms. Some of them you'll value and protect--some of them you'll entrust to defend against raiders... others you wouldn't be sad to see eaten by a pack of man-eating rats. Which happens. The richness of this world and its evolving and unpredictable nature makes it never get old.			"

								Don’t mess with my stuff.Rimworld loves to mess with your stuff. A happy little sci-fi sim, this is not.I just spent two hours researching the technology that allowed me to set up the work station that enabled me to build the improvement that I needed and now here come a bunch of pirates-jerks to smash it all to bits. And kill everyone. And stomp on the flowers.I hate pirates.I hate the fact that I have just spent all this time building a better base for my poor, starving, neurotic, flawed castaways on this backwater, hellhole planet and these punks are now burning, looting and smashing everything that we have worked so hard to build.Sure the game is rock solid. It's great that they are working on updating it all the time.But, Elroy just got shot in the head.My automated defense turret got hit with a grenade and exploded.Tammy, my favorite yellow lab, whom I was delighted we finally taught to haul sacks of potatoes in from the fields, just got killed by a shotgun blast from a dastardly pirate (see comment above about how I feel about pirates). I mean, who shoots a dog?Eva is crying in her dark room. All of her precious research work did little to save her.Wilfred is puking all over the marble floor because the poor bloke got food poisoning from eating uncooked, two-day old turtle meat.Daisy wants a biotic arm. Hawk loves Mikelia, but she’s already married to Wilfred.Jon is cloud watching, oblivious to the death and carnage raging around him. He always was too gentile for this world.Oh, looks like we might get some more toxic fallout today. That'll be great.It’s all going to hell quickly, my whole colony is being destroyed in front of me.It’s just like the Afghanistan simulator.(sigh) Damn it. Time to restart. Maybe someday I'll manage to get someone off this rock. "

								Current Colony Name: Test Community Please IgnoreFaction: Trial and ErrorAI: Cassandra Classic, Rough with Permadeath on Crashlanded  This is the ongoing saga of: Miu, a defector good with guns and medicine. Zebo, a builder and green thumb. Mac, a scientist who dabbles in the culinary arts.After crash landing, our survivors take their belongings to a valley close by. Two large hills provide some natural protection, but the south flank is left completely exposed. Our survivors have a lot of work ahead of them if they want to make this valley a safe settlement. Miu and Mac bring Zebo building materials and soon enough, Zebo has built a solid foundation for the colony. A roofed stockpile is kept just outside of individual rooms connected to a fair sized rec room built into the side of a hill. 3 Solar Panels charge 6 batteries connected to all the appliances in the rec room and a small freezer is built to house food supplies. During the day, Zebo tends to his crops and small construction projects. Miu hunts and hauls. Mac stays glued to the research bench Zebo built in his room, only coming out to cook and eat meals. Raids are few and pose little threat. As fall comes around, Jase, a barkeep, joins the colony. His skill in medicine outmatches Miu's and he's an even better cook than Mac. Our colonists welcome him and Jase quickly becomes a vital part of the community. Soon enough, both east and west flanks of the valley have been sealed by stone walls and doors while Zebo begins building defenses on the southern flank. Thanks to Mac's tireless efforts, the colony is able to build their first auto turret before winter and it easily fends off following raids. One summer day, Zebo proposes to Miu after only being together for 15 days or so, and she miraculously accepts. A marriage date is set in the near future. (So they can get to know each other better XD) Well before winter rolls around, the fridge has been expanded and is stocked with food. A geothermal generator powers a wall of turrets surrounded in sandbags to the south and a secondary wall of turrets powered by wind turbines lay to the north as a final line of defense. Daphne, our husky is pregnant with doggos and our colonists are confident and hopeful. But not for long.Raids quickly become more dangerous and the southern defenses require constant repair and rebuilding. Injuries are common, but luckily, no one sustains a fatal blow. As snow begins to fall, a massive volcanic eruption covers the planet in ash, killing all of Zebo's crops and lowering the temperature further. Luckily, our colonists are well prepared with warm clothing and food. Following an especially dangerous raid on the southern defenses, Zebo and Miu decide they cannot wait any longer and marry in the rec room amongst their fellow colonists. Everyone celebrates and as the marriage ceremony ends, thats when A HERD OF 8 MANHUNTER MUFFALO appear on the horizon and head straight for the eastern entrance to the valley. On the way, they mercilessly slaughter a visiting group of tribals armed with nothing but clubs. They burst through the Eastern door and charge toward the colonists who scramble back into the rec room..only to be followed by Daphne, who reveals their location to two of the herd. The Muffalo start to beat down the wooden door that hides the colonists, but luckily turn away at the last moment. Zebo springs into action and repairs the door by repurposing the wooden stools in the area. Mac goes to his hi-tech research bench to bury himself in books and Jase calms his nerves at the tailoring bench. The colonists are safe for the moment.After spending an inordinate amount of time arguing over where to stay (the zone mechanics are tricky to a newbie) the colonists agree to stay in the rec room and let Zebo deconstruct the walls that block off their individual rooms so that everyone can at least spend the night in their own beds. As Zebo finishes deconstructing the walls, Daphne beelines for a door in one of the rooms. Before the colonists can call her back, she's run outside and the nearest Muffalo sees Zebo. With a guttural roar, the Muffalo charges to the wooden door and beats on it ferociously as the colonists back away from the door. * SMASH*The Muffalo is in! Screaming, the colonists flee to the last bastion of safety: the freezer. They barely make it in as the Muffalo reaches the door, splintering the wood as it attempts to break through. Gun's at the ready, the colonists prepare for their end.. Yet somehow, the door holds! The Muffalo bores of banging its head and backs away to wander the rec room, leaving our colonists trapped in the freezer. Shivering in the cold, their only solace is the  the fact that they won't starve to death. Ironically, death by starvation seemed a far preferable choice over the stampeding Muffalo that now roamed the colony. Eventually, the colonists calm themselves down enough to sleep. The next day, Zebo carefully tears a hole in the wall separating the fridge from the nearest room, and the colonists are able to take shifts sleeping in the bed there. They spend the day talking amongst themselves and dine on a stash of fine meals to keep their spirits high. As day three in the freezer comes around, the muffalo's rage subsides and they fall asleep just outside the rec room. Zebo quickly reseals the broken-down door and begins to fortify the area, while the colonists happily leave the freezer.. when suddenly the comms console makes a garbling noise and a transmission begins to play:""MAYDAY MAYDAY! ANYONE OUT THERE PLEASE RESPOND!!! MY NAME IS CETI AND IM UNDER ATTACK BY MERCENARIES OF THE DEADLY SHANKERS!!"" (the faction is actually called this) Upon hearing the voice, Jase sprints to the console and issues a response:""Mother?!! Is that really you!?!? It's me, Jase! Come to these coordinates and we'll provide you with shelter!"" The other colonists echo their support, forgetting the rampaging Muffalo just outside their doors for a brief moment. ""Thank you so much!! I'm heading to your coordinates now! *after a brief pause* It's good to hear from you son."" Too excited at the prospect of seeing his mother again, Jase cuts the comm link before remembering to warn Ceti about the Muffalo herd! Sensing more humans in the distance, the herd awakens and heads straight for Ceti..She sees the clouds of dust from the stampeding Muffalo before she sees them. But by the time she realizes what's happening, there's no where for her to go and Ceti realizes she's trapped. That's when the mercenaries arrive behind her and true to their name, shiv her near to death. Leaving her to bleed out, the merc group from the Deadly Shankers proceeds to mow down the Muffalo herd and head for the southern defenses of the colony. The colonists are able to fend off the brunt of the Deadly Shankers force, capturing one and killing two including their captain before the others flee. Seeing that his mother has yet to return, Jase sets off to rescue his mother while the others stay behind to assess the damage. Jase reaches his mother, the last of her life trickling away..Ceti dies in Jase's arms..Ceti's funeral is short. Jase says nothing other than revealing her profession as a botanist. She's buried by the flowers in Zebo's crops. Following the Muffalo rampage and Ceti's death, there was much work to be done by the colonists. Jase could not keep up with the workload, and combined with the death of his mother, he succumbed to several mental breaks where he wandered the colony aimlessly, foregoing sleep and food. Each time, he was dragged to a hospital bed by Miu and tended to until he got better, but during one of his mental breaks, Jase caught malaria..Miu did everything she could, but for all her efforts, Jase had always been twice the doctor she was, and he quickly succumbed to the disease, dying in a coma and extreme pain.The colonists bury him next to his mother..

								Rimworld taught me a few things.  Everyone is valuable. If you can do one job, it doesn't matter if you like to light stuff on fire, or like to strip and wander dazed in the snow. If you can do one job, you are worth it.  There is always something to eat. Never under estimate your creativity in food. Even if it just died, why not?  The AI will get you. Congratulations! You have a new recruit. After capturing them and providing them with medical care, food, housing, a table to eat their meals. Of course. Standard hospitality. Well, turns out your new recruit use to be a bad guy. In this case, a bad girl. It just turns out that the raiding party she came from killed Emily, our best tamer. She had bonded with a baby megatherium, who turned into a manhunter and you thought it would be contained by sandstone walls. Well, you're not wrong. Turns out a baby megatherium can bust through vents and then find your smither Red and shatter his jaw and tear off his left foot. Red survived after killing the rampaging baby, although he will never run again. Now Red gets to be ridiculed by the new recruit Emmie, the sex slave, because he is now ""ugly"". Ha. Emmie. Sounds like Emily, right? "

								wonderful colony management, survival, combat, and depth of gameplay.detailed stats for every creature in game. i Had an iguana that developed dementia, a tamed bear with astma to wich i have transfered a healthy lung taken from a prisoner.Every playtrough is unique, every load is unique , events are random and keep the game fresh.Every colonyst is unique and with awesome mods the game becomes an even more in depth and hardcore expericne, or it can become the utopia u have dreamed to acomplish since you had a dream.Game dificulty is set by the player, the 3 storytellers(aka game modes IMO) are incredibly well made and realy offer a great experience. After playing a few times on base builder difculty i felt ready for more chalange, i was blasted to pieces and the last dificulty with joy and tears on my face, my colony burned to ash by stormtroopers, we defended to the last one with bows and rifles. One survivor went into shock and was leftr for dead by the invaders. After the atack he came back to life only to bury his friends among the ruins of the colony. after the last tomb was dig he went crazy and locked him slef in a room and died of starvation.WARNING: NEVER EVER NEVER EVER name any colonyst after you, your friends or anyone elso you know, they will die, thats a fact or you will end up loading to the limit of exploit. I can go on with this but is not enough. buy it, play it, love it, hate it, play more.			"

								Built a tribe of primitive people's after their homes were destroyed by massive machines of death. We built houses for ourselves and set upon mining great amounts of steel. We then constructed an enormous round hut and named our village Steelhut after it. We set upon building more buildings than we could use, incase any nearby tribes people decide to join. After 2 new recruits, and a couple small raids of 2-3 tribesmen, we decided we needed to enclose our farms and houses with steel walls and steel buildings. With this completed we fortified the only entrance to our village.The head shaman had been working on new magics in the great hall of the steelhut. After discovering advanced clothing like dusters and cowboy hats, as well as how to forge steel weapons and great bows. We set upon making these weapons and equipped our best hunters with great bows. But we were after a new magic: electricity. Our tribe had seen electricity before, in lightning storms and the machines, but out shaman believed we could harness it for ourselves. Though she predicted it would take many months to finalize.Several months went by quietly, and winter was nearly upon us. Food crops had been plentiful and our hunters had bountiful hunts. Pemmican was stocked up, but electricity was still being researched. With only about a month left of research we hear an outsider call our tribe. A machine collector named Braun was being chased by a violent gang of people. My people did not want this outsider among us, but the shaman believed that perhaps Braun's knowledge of machines would help our people uncover the secrets of electricity. So we offered Braun residence, and prepared our warriors to defend our homes.As Braun's arrived at the village the raiders after him had begun closing in. Braun went to grab a steel mace, as the pacifist shaman cleaned the great hall. As the Raiders closed in my people quickly realized they were outmatched as the Raiders carried rifles and guns. Our best warrior was shot dead almost instantly. A second warrior shared a similar fate right afterwards. Another warrior was downed so the shaman set upon rescuing her, but was shot by the raiders doing so requiring her to rest and heal after setting her friend down in the hospital bed. Next almost instantly two more of the warriors we're incapacitated, so the remaining warrior and Braun back up. The raiders advance killing Braun almost instantly before my warrior kills the raider attacking them. After seeing three of their own drop and so many of mine drop the raiders decided it was time to pick up their losses and grab our injured survivors and haul them off as prisoners.Down to three villagers all injured we had to make do with doctoring. The least injured was the shaman who was first to recover and then began tending to the others. However warrior who survived his last stand began to come down with an infection. He died shortly thereafter. Soon due to all the death and destruction that occured our pacifist shaman went outside and then berserk. She began attacking all the local wildlife without remorse until a lowly squirrel tore her throat out... The person the shaman rescued recovered after these events and woke to find everyone around her dead, blood splashed on the walls and floors. So she did the only logical thing...she kept researching electricity. Being an excellent researcher she managed to discover the secrets to electricity in only a few days time, and armed with that knowledge swept out across the land abandoning the decaying husk of the fort she once called home.10/10 would save someone to have my village overrun by mass gun wielding murderers again.

								Colonist Patricia's log, 4th of spring, 5501, Lyon's Pride, Dominance settlementWe buried Diver last night, after discovering she'd been torn apart by a pack of Alphabeavers she was sent out to hunt. I shudder just thinking about those buck teeth and what they must do to bone. Sarai wouldn't talk about what condition the remains were in.Today was meant to be a great day, with Gerador and Acosta getting married. Disaster struck however, as midway through the ceremony we heard a fierce struggle between animals directly outside the front door.Gerador's pet husky, William, was lying prone on the floor with his stomach torn out. Poor Gerador, he'd never been the same since we sold his first pet, Grace the cat, while he was sleeping, and now this.Packmates are loyal creatures, so William's mate Sara ran in to help just in time to catch a spray from Acosta's shotgun, which also finished off William while only angering the bear.In the end, Sarai got the worst of it out, and I finished off the wretched beast with a plasteel knife to the back of the head. I think Sarai's arm is infected, but we're out of antibiotics and she's the only doctor.As for the married couple, it's going to be a rough night. It's not everyday you bury a friend, get married, then watch your new spouse kill your bonded dog and its mate with a misplaced shotgun blast in the middle of a desperate struggle for your life.Or at least, it's not everyday for places that aren't our quaint little settlement of Dominance.

Oh the third raid was a fateful mistake... Brex got hurt, badly. We had to amputate her leg and give her a peg leg, surprisingly, she still fought. Everything was smooth sailing...Until they came.The pirates attacked with their savage ways, and captured Brex while Brex was trying to save Trosma.

								I began a normal 3-man survivor game using Phobe Chillax base builder mode. Along with my 3 survivors, there was Sugar-Plum the cat. I did not name this cat; it was randomly generated. This review revolves around Sugar-Plum the savior of SleepVille.From the start, Sugar-Plum the white cat had it rough. He was awoken from Cryo-sleep and tossed into an escape pod with a large man named Jose (who appreciated animals more than his human counterparts). Upon landing on this terrifying and strange new land, Sugar-Plum began exploring. Occasionally finding the random squirrel to scuffle with or being shooed out of the way for new construction projects, his life was pretty dull. He sometimes saw a distant bear or cougar but he always stayed close to home practicing his hunting skills on squirrels. He had begun to adjust nicely to his new home and animal bed. He wanted to keep it that way.Around countless squirrel (and one turtle) kills later, Sugar-Plum found himself bored and wandering around a new stockpile the humans had just made after trading with the locals. He did it more out of curiosity then anything and since this was his territory, he needed to check it out. He was on his way past the door when something caught his eye. maybe it was the round shape, or maybe there was an odd smell to it, but he had to continue investigating. He slowly sniffed around the package. Used his little hunter’s teeth to rip a small hole and proceeded to paw out some of the packages contents. He sniffed again and since he was feeling rather hungry at that moment and the freezer was so far away, he promptly devoured the small circles. He felt fine at first and suddenly had more energy than ever before. He felt invincible, like he could hunt every scumbag squirrel on this planet in minutes! But then before he knew it poor Sugar-Plum started throwing up everywhere and he passed out in his own puddle of kitty-fur bile until one of the humans found him laying helpless, shamed and barely breathing. This is where things turned bad for poor Sugar-Plum, for he had just eaten the very addictive stimulant ""Wake-up"". His personal story ends there, but it continues in my perspective. After I got the warning Sugar-Plum had passed out, I quickly read his health tab finding that he now had an addiction to Wake-up. I was furious that he had eaten some of my newly attained drugs and I proceeded to watch his EVERY move. I wanted to catch him in the act again and I even got to the point where I was goading him on in my head. Daring him to do it again while I watched this time so I could mark him for slaughter. I didn't care if he was a founding god damn member of the colony. THERE WOULD BE BLOOD!! Well Sugar-Plum must have read my damn mind because he never went back to the stockpile. Upon kicking his addiction, he developed 5/5 chemical brain damage. Great. Now I was down some precious drugs and stuck with a mentally handicapped cat. I was selling him to the trader ASAP.Called the trader in and was all smiles knowing I could at least cut my losses by selling Sugar-Plum to the trader for 300 silver. I was happy indeed. As the local traders approached, I heard a meow. It was Sugar-Plum. The poor little guy was still outside patrolling and killing squirrels in defense of my colony. My heart sank at the thought of selling my first animal and as I traded my goods, I quietly skipped over selling him.It was a season later that I cracked into the side of a mountain while mining and witnessed a horrific battle between looters and mechanoids. The sole survivor was this disgusting maggot looking mechanoid that fired extremely fast fire explosion rounds. I quickly vacated the area and back to the safety of my colony. I was not prepared for that fight yet. Night approached and all was well, I was safe for now. As my colonists slept I went over plans on how to approach the creature the next day, when out of the corner of my eye I see the horrific creature slowly slinking toward my base! @$%&!! Panic sets in and as I’m rallying my colonists out of bed, its already knocking some of my doors down trying to get revenge for bothering its home. In my panic I failed to realize that all my colonists are rushing out the one door the creatures about to knock down and potentially shoot its fiery death cannon; killing everyone inside. Then to my astonishment the creature suddenly turns back the way it came and fires its deadly blast toward a door it had already destroyed. While my colonists all make it safely past the creature and into defensive positions, I investigate the situation only to find out that poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sugar-Plum had randomly wandered out a side door and distracted the hideous thing. So to wrap things up, my colony successfully incapacitated and killed the creature after brave(?) Sugar-Plum took one for the team. He actually didn’t die (I don’t know how) and good ole Sugar-Plum can still be found around the colony happily hunting squirrels to his heart’s content. But if I ever find him taking drugs again, I swear I’ll mark him for slaughter. 10/10 Would actually never think of selling or slaughtering Sugar-Plum again.  "

								When I first saw it I was thinking Prison Architect and while they have some similar visuals it does feel like a completely different game. Think of it more like the sims with violence and mental break downs. The first atempt at the game I went for the 3 in a crashed ship didn't like that method so I went wtih the rich colonist. In the first month of his landing he got a fellow colonist, got shot and kidnaped, rescued, his dog got its leg shot off and died. A 3rd colonist came was a drunk and addicted to drugs and would have psychopathic breaks and ended up dieing. The 4th member was an run away and died shortly after due to an infection.			"

								Thank god my wife got the new Pokemon in the mail the same day I bought this... Otherwise there would have been problems.  Bought this on Last Saturday today is Thursday, I have already sunk 40 hours into the game as I write this.  This is as a grown♥♥♥♥♥man that has a career in one of those office things... speaking of which, this had me up until almost 3am on a Sunday night playing.  Wife forced me to bed... spent entire day at work on reddit reading old Rimworld post looking hung over and feeling like it was a decade ago and I just finished a night of hookers and blow. Only a few games have ever truly made hours pass by in minutes and made me act like a kid not wanting to go to bed(Civilization, Crusader KingsII etc) but... this has done that and done it on a whole new level.Ive been on Steam for over a decade and gaming since the 80s and this is a top 10 game for me of all time of any genre. AND ITS NOT EVEN FINISHED YET.  There are more improvements and additions on the horizon, and I am only excited for them to come so I can do again... an again... and pray Pokemon keeps the wife distracted for at least another few months... years... i dont know.  Reality is I have not even booted up Battlefield 1 since I bought this.  I have computers that run BF1 in ultra settings in 1440p... and I am stuck playing a game that was a 100mb download. someone help me.........................Anywho, support the game it can only get better and is already a amazing game.

								Addictive colony builder with high level of customizability and a space-western theme. I'm a very picky gamer and this one checks all sorts of good boxes.Customizable start conditions right down to what items you start with and what name your pet has if you want one. On high difficulty its about life on a alien world that hates you and wishes you to attempt to survive only so it can watch you suffer longer.On low diffculty its about a colonist or colonists setting up a new life on a new world and becoming comfortable and affluent.Somewhere in the middle I play and wrestle with the advesities the game throws at me while trying to achieve wealth and eventually get my people back into space.15 hours into a colony and after two consecutive raids and injuries sustained (but survived) from grenades my inventors mind just broke and is now wandering around my common area bleeding minorly and starving to death in a stupor. When i tried to arrest him to force him to eat and be treated he went berzerk and stabbed my ex-spy doctor to death nearly instantly. My pet warg ate the corpse of the fallen spy as the ex spys lover discovered the scene and immediately mentally broke killed the inventor in a berzerk fit before being subdued (beaten unconciouss) by the ex-spy's  lover's pet muffalo(buffalo creature).The whole time my chef was preparing meals and as the muffalo beat the lover feet away. He sat down to eat and ""relax socially.""The whole affair made me laugh uncontrollably at the rediculously unrealistic chef...until i remembered he had the psycopath trait and as rechecked his stats page and re-read that he had the trait ""Is uncapable of: caring""Then it was a bit too real and i said tahts enough rimworld for today.

This game is merciless and will have no problem bending you over and having its way with you. The graphics may be simplistic, but that's not a problem since the level of detail and the playability more than make up for it.

								Here's a story about the settlement of Escalalan:Gil (Giggles), John (Blitz) and Julio crash landed on a strange planet. Unsure of what to do, they quickly built a small shelter and went to sleep.That night, Blitz told Giggles of his love and they began a lovely romatic relationship.Julio, wakes up the next morning only to be ignored by Giggles as she has fallen madly in love with Blitz, who, proposes to her that very day.With the wedding planned, all was going well in the little settlement until...they came.The beavers came out of nowhere, it was not expected. Julio and Blitz went out to tackle the mennace before the trees were all eaten. Julio reached the beavers first. The first shot was fired and the beavers swarmed. They caused Julio to collapse before turning on Blitz who was trailing behind. The beavers took the oportunity to attack Blitz too. With both of them incapacitated, Giggles was the only one left. She waited until the next morning until the beavers had disperced and took the opportunity to rescue her fiancee and her friend.With both Julio and Blitz recovering in the shack, Giggles now needed to step up and do all of the work and harvest the crops that had been planted a few days ago.Infection set in for both Blitz and Julio and it looked like the end. Blitz managed to develop an immunity but Julio did not. He woke up and completely lost his mind and began to attack Blitz. Giggles, forced to protect her lover, attacked and killed Julio. Despite being a cannibal, Giggles allowed Julio to be burried.One year later and three new people had joined the settlement: Danil, Sienna, and Barrick (the local pirate leader). Giggles and Blitz had been happily married and were spending all of their time together. They managed to just get through the winter, thanks to some amazing hunting skills by Danil and Blitz. However, at the beginning of Spring, everything went downhill. A volcanic winter combined with toxic fallout decimated the settlement with everyone but Barrick coming down with toxic poisoning and with Giggles and Danil developing dimentia. With four out the five settlers unable to move due to severe starvation and Barrick unable to harvest crops, the settlement met an untimely end and thus ends the love story of Blitz and Giggles.10/10 - Would destroy settlement with man eating beavers again			"

								Playing Rimworld is like getting into an abusive relationship. The first time you run out of food and everyone dies you let the game convince you it was your fault. When you keep it happy for long enough to start killing your colonists off with diseases you start looking for where you went wrong.But as things continue you start to realise that no matter how much it tells you it loves you, it's just going to keep tossing fire, random explosions, medicine shortages, degrading clothes, hard to please colonists, raids, rabid animals, solar flares, and more at you, no matter how you try to please it.I hate this game so much, and I can't stop playing. Someone, anyone, help!			"

			Rimworld is one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. This review doesn't even scratch the surface of everything you're able to do.		

Rimworld is a colony simulation, and it's probably my favorite game of 2016 so far. Every colony has it's own specific narrative, even if it fails. The game doesn't necessarily hold your hand, and is a wonderful example of learning through failure to make it just another day, week, month, or year further than your last attempt. Watch my video review for a more in-depth look at Rimworld.			"

There's huge amounts of data going into every action, but it's all visible to you if you want to understand why your doctor just accidentally removed your patient's brain while installing a peg-leg.You'll keep coming back to this one, and playing for hours and hours.

								Everything was great, sun was shining, colonists were smiling. Then the Pirate Band attacked...RimWorld is a top-down God/Colony simulator. Artistically similar to games like Prison Architect, RimWorld expands on the ""do as I have commanded"" gameplay of similar top-down titles, and throws in a healthy dose of colonial revolt, complicated romances, creepy breathing and calamity, just to make things exciting.In this story, a colony of 5 that had crash-landed on a an arid, tree-less plain. It was cold, food was scarce and shelter was nowhere to be seen. A few seasons later, the colony was flourishing. Food and medicine a-plenty, other space-faring travellers found salvation when they joined the crew. They had healthy trade relations with other nearby colonies and tribes. A few disagreeances and minor arguments broke out between certain opinionated individuals, but for the most part everything was OK.Then a pet boomalope exploded right in the middle of the trade plaza due to malnourishment. It exploded on one of their trade partners. They didn't like that.Not. One. Bit.A battle broke out, they escaped. They thought they were safe, but it turns out this outlander colony was allied with certain powerful people. Several more seasons passed.Then the siege alarm sounded... the Space Pirates arrived...I can still hear the mortar shells exploding around me... the cries of my colonists in pain... the crackle of the fire burning my colony to the ground...11/10 would accidentally start RimWorld War 3 again.

								Here is a story. If this doesn't convince you to buy this game, I don't know what will.Day 1.My group of 3 survivors are name Mantis, the builder, Kimeko, the doctor, and Lynn, the hunter and cook. For the first few hours of their new lives, they create a small shelter and beds. Life is great for a while until their food rations start dwindling. Lynn decides to take matters into her own hands and begins hunting the nearby herd of elk. They feast on elk steak all night long.Day 3.The frosty jaws of winter enclose their small settlement, destroying Kimeko's fantasy of creating a small garden to grow vegetables and cotton. To avoid getting dangerously cold, the 3 of them huddle up in their shack to keep warm. After 2 days of imprisonment, cabin fever begins to grip their minds. They fight constantly, their social stances on each other crumbling quickly. Their seemingly endless supply of elk is quickly dimished to a pile of gristle and hide. Unable to take the pains coursing through her stomach, Lynn braves the biting cold, venturing out with the groups only functioning firearm to try and aquire a suitable meal for herself and her companions. As she stumbles through the tundra however, the cold overtakes her, and she is later found by a pack of wolves, who devour her stiff lifeless body.Day 9.Mantis and Kimeko barely cling to life as they sit in the darkness, eating the meager scraps of whatever rodent is unfortunate enough to scurry by. But a revelation occurs to Mantis. Rats arn't the only source of meat available. Within an hour, Mantis sits alone in the cabin, and while is belly is full for now, his mind slips further and further away.Day 14.As Mantis' food finally disappears down his throat for the last time, he can't help but think, ""What next?"". His body was too malnourished to hunt or gather, his friends were gone. Mantis comes to a decision. I will not succumb. He proceeds to reach into his pocket and pull out a small knife and flat chunk of flint. He carves off strips of wood off the wall next to him and gathers them in the corner. He then scrapes the knife quickly along the flint, causing sparks to fly, into the small pile of kindling. Mantis can feel his body shutting down as the fire builds, quickly engulfing the kindling and a part of the wall, despite the cold. Mantis lies back on the smooth wooden floor and closes his eyes, waiting for death.Day 15.A group of friendly tribesmen, well worn by the years of travelling, come across a destroyed cabin along their journey. While the small wooden structure is badly damaged, fire having obviously scorched it, leaving the remaining wreckage ashen and unmoving. Inside, they find a small amount of seared elk hide, and a corpse, blackened by the flames, with a shard of metal roofing lodged through his chest. They consider the body for a moment, wondering about its story, before carrying on looting it, before finally moving on.To this day, that is my shortest game of RimWorld ever.Buy this game. Its good.			"

								I have been playing it since about 8 this morning. I have only gotten up once, that was to use the bathroom. I love the gave, there is so much suspence never knowing when your colonist will get sick or randomly beat each other up. There is no way of knowing what is next, that is what a good game does. If you even have the slightest thought of purchasing this game do, don't let the price fool you it's a game that is 30 dollars that is good enought to be 60.			"

								HIGHLY recommended. This game is absolutely amazing, and it's still early-access! I can't wait to see what the final product is like.Every part of the game feels perfectly polished. There's huge amounts of data going into every action, but it's all visible to you if you want to understand why your doctor just accidentally removed your patient's brain while installing a peg-leg.You'll keep coming back to this one, and playing for hours and hours. I've had several nights where I've looked up at the clock and realised it was 6AM already. Can't say I've had that experience with any other game in a long time.			"

								Don’t mess with my stuff.Rimworld loves to mess with your stuff. A happy little sci-fi sim, this is not.I just spent two hours researching the technology that allowed me to set up the work station that enabled me to build the improvement that I needed and now here come a bunch of pirates-jerks to smash it all to bits. And kill everyone. And stomp on the flowers.I hate pirates.I hate the fact that I have just spent all this time building a better base for my poor, starving, neurotic, flawed castaways on this backwater, hellhole planet and these punks are now burning, looting and smashing everything that we have worked so hard to build.Sure the game is rock solid. It's great that they are working on updating it all the time.But, Elroy just got shot in the head.My automated defense turret got hit with a grenade and exploded.Tammy, my favorite yellow lab, whom I was delighted we finally taught to haul sacks of potatoes in from the fields, just got killed by a shotgun blast from a dastardly pirate (see comment above about how I feel about pirates). I mean, who shoots a dog?Eva is crying in her dark room. All of her precious research work did little to save her.Wilfred is puking all over the marble floor because the poor bloke got food poisoning from eating uncooked, two-day old turtle meat.Daisy wants a biotic arm. Hawk loves Mikelia, but she’s already married to Wilfred.Jon is cloud watching, oblivious to the death and carnage raging around him. He always was too gentile for this world.Oh, looks like we might get some more toxic fallout today. That'll be great.It’s all going to hell quickly, my whole colony is being destroyed in front of me.It’s just like the Afghanistan simulator.(sigh) Damn it. Time to restart. Maybe someday I'll manage to get someone off this rock. "

								Current Colony Name: Test Community Please IgnoreFaction: Trial and ErrorAI: Cassandra Classic, Rough with Permadeath on Crashlanded  This is the ongoing saga of: Miu, a defector good with guns and medicine. Zebo, a builder and green thumb. Mac, a scientist who dabbles in the culinary arts.After crash landing, our survivors take their belongings to a valley close by. Two large hills provide some natural protection, but the south flank is left completely exposed. Our survivors have a lot of work ahead of them if they want to make this valley a safe settlement. Miu and Mac bring Zebo building materials and soon enough, Zebo has built a solid foundation for the colony. A roofed stockpile is kept just outside of individual rooms connected to a fair sized rec room built into the side of a hill. 3 Solar Panels charge 6 batteries connected to all the appliances in the rec room and a small freezer is built to house food supplies. During the day, Zebo tends to his crops and small construction projects. Miu hunts and hauls. Mac stays glued to the research bench Zebo built in his room, only coming out to cook and eat meals. Raids are few and pose little threat. As fall comes around, Jase, a barkeep, joins the colony. His skill in medicine outmatches Miu's and he's an even better cook than Mac. Our colonists welcome him and Jase quickly becomes a vital part of the community. Soon enough, both east and west flanks of the valley have been sealed by stone walls and doors while Zebo begins building defenses on the southern flank. Thanks to Mac's tireless efforts, the colony is able to build their first auto turret before winter and it easily fends off following raids. One summer day, Zebo proposes to Miu after only being together for 15 days or so, and she miraculously accepts. A marriage date is set in the near future. (So they can get to know each other better XD) Well before winter rolls around, the fridge has been expanded and is stocked with food. A geothermal generator powers a wall of turrets surrounded in sandbags to the south and a secondary wall of turrets powered by wind turbines lay to the north as a final line of defense. Daphne, our husky is pregnant with doggos and our colonists are confident and hopeful. But not for long.Raids quickly become more dangerous and the southern defenses require constant repair and rebuilding. Injuries are common, but luckily, no one sustains a fatal blow. As snow begins to fall, a massive volcanic eruption covers the planet in ash, killing all of Zebo's crops and lowering the temperature further. Luckily, our colonists are well prepared with warm clothing and food. Following an especially dangerous raid on the southern defenses, Zebo and Miu decide they cannot wait any longer and marry in the rec room amongst their fellow colonists. Everyone celebrates and as the marriage ceremony ends, thats when A HERD OF 8 MANHUNTER MUFFALO appear on the horizon and head straight for the eastern entrance to the valley. On the way, they mercilessly slaughter a visiting group of tribals armed with nothing but clubs. They burst through the Eastern door and charge toward the colonists who scramble back into the rec room..only to be followed by Daphne, who reveals their location to two of the herd. The Muffalo start to beat down the wooden door that hides the colonists, but luckily turn away at the last moment. Zebo springs into action and repairs the door by repurposing the wooden stools in the area. Mac goes to his hi-tech research bench to bury himself in books and Jase calms his nerves at the tailoring bench. The colonists are safe for the moment.After spending an inordinate amount of time arguing over where to stay (the zone mechanics are tricky to a newbie) the colonists agree to stay in the rec room and let Zebo deconstruct the walls that block off their individual rooms so that everyone can at least spend the night in their own beds. As Zebo finishes deconstructing the walls, Daphne beelines for a door in one of the rooms. Before the colonists can call her back, she's run outside and the nearest Muffalo sees Zebo. With a guttural roar, the Muffalo charges to the wooden door and beats on it ferociously as the colonists back away from the door. * SMASH*The Muffalo is in! Screaming, the colonists flee to the last bastion of safety: the freezer. They barely make it in as the Muffalo reaches the door, splintering the wood as it attempts to break through. Gun's at the ready, the colonists prepare for their end.. Yet somehow, the door holds! The Muffalo bores of banging its head and backs away to wander the rec room, leaving our colonists trapped in the freezer. Shivering in the cold, their only solace is the  the fact that they won't starve to death. Ironically, death by starvation seemed a far preferable choice over the stampeding Muffalo that now roamed the colony. Eventually, the colonists calm themselves down enough to sleep. The next day, Zebo carefully tears a hole in the wall separating the fridge from the nearest room, and the colonists are able to take shifts sleeping in the bed there. They spend the day talking amongst themselves and dine on a stash of fine meals to keep their spirits high. As day three in the freezer comes around, the muffalo's rage subsides and they fall asleep just outside the rec room. Zebo quickly reseals the broken-down door and begins to fortify the area, while the colonists happily leave the freezer.. when suddenly the comms console makes a garbling noise and a transmission begins to play:""MAYDAY MAYDAY! ANYONE OUT THERE PLEASE RESPOND!!! MY NAME IS CETI AND IM UNDER ATTACK BY MERCENARIES OF THE DEADLY SHANKERS!!"" (the faction is actually called this) Upon hearing the voice, Jase sprints to the console and issues a response:""Mother?!! Is that really you!?!? It's me, Jase! Come to these coordinates and we'll provide you with shelter!"" The other colonists echo their support, forgetting the rampaging Muffalo just outside their doors for a brief moment. ""Thank you so much!! I'm heading to your coordinates now! *after a brief pause* It's good to hear from you son."" Too excited at the prospect of seeing his mother again, Jase cuts the comm link before remembering to warn Ceti about the Muffalo herd! Sensing more humans in the distance, the herd awakens and heads straight for Ceti..She sees the clouds of dust from the stampeding Muffalo before she sees them. But by the time she realizes what's happening, there's no where for her to go and Ceti realizes she's trapped. That's when the mercenaries arrive behind her and true to their name, shiv her near to death. Leaving her to bleed out, the merc group from the Deadly Shankers proceeds to mow down the Muffalo herd and head for the southern defenses of the colony. The colonists are able to fend off the brunt of the Deadly Shankers force, capturing one and killing two including their captain before the others flee. Seeing that his mother has yet to return, Jase sets off to rescue his mother while the others stay behind to assess the damage. Jase reaches his mother, the last of her life trickling away..Ceti dies in Jase's arms..Ceti's funeral is short. Jase says nothing other than revealing her profession as a botanist. She's buried by the flowers in Zebo's crops. Following the Muffalo rampage and Ceti's death, there was much work to be done by the colonists. Jase could not keep up with the workload, and combined with the death of his mother, he succumbed to several mental breaks where he wandered the colony aimlessly, foregoing sleep and food. Each time, he was dragged to a hospital bed by Miu and tended to until he got better, but during one of his mental breaks, Jase caught malaria..Miu did everything she could, but for all her efforts, Jase had always been twice the doctor she was, and he quickly succumbed to the disease, dying in a coma and extreme pain.The colonists bury him next to his mother..

								I wanna start off by saying that I generally hate single player games. I absolutely love online player interaction. This game does not have that yet, it's all about you building a colony and interacting with ai colonies/tribes/factions. This game can make you forget about time and not want to do anything else but make sure your colony stays alive. I love this game and you won't find me playing any single player games besides this one. If there is ever a mutliplayer mode, I ALWAYS play that. This game manages to have enough creativity and story though in just the every day to day survival of your colony in the world of RimWorld.10/10, would say this is one of the best games ever created if it would support online functionality. This game has a lot of potential and is always growing :)!			"

Think of it more like the sims with violence and mental break downs. The first atempt at the game I went for the 3 in a crashed ship didn't like that method so I went wtih the rich colonist. In the first month of his landing he got a fellow colonist, got shot and kidnaped, rescued, his dog got its leg shot off and died. A 3rd colonist came was a drunk and addicted to drugs and would have psychopathic breaks and ended up dieing. The 4th member was an run away and died shortly after due to an infection.			"

								Thank god my wife got the new Pokemon in the mail the same day I bought this... Otherwise there would have been problems.  Bought this on Last Saturday today is Thursday, I have already sunk 40 hours into the game as I write this.  This is as a grown♥♥♥♥♥man that has a career in one of those office things... speaking of which, this had me up until almost 3am on a Sunday night playing.  Wife forced me to bed... spent entire day at work on reddit reading old Rimworld post looking hung over and feeling like it was a decade ago and I just finished a night of hookers and blow. Only a few games have ever truly made hours pass by in minutes and made me act like a kid not wanting to go to bed(Civilization, Crusader KingsII etc) but... this has done that and done it on a whole new level.Ive been on Steam for over a decade and gaming since the 80s and this is a top 10 game for me of all time of any genre. AND ITS NOT EVEN FINISHED YET.  There are more improvements and additions on the horizon, and I am only excited for them to come so I can do again... an again... and pray Pokemon keeps the wife distracted for at least another few months... years... i dont know.  Reality is I have not even booted up Battlefield 1 since I bought this.  I have computers that run BF1 in ultra settings in 1440p... and I am stuck playing a game that was a 100mb download. someone help me.........................Anywho, support the game it can only get better and is already a amazing game.

								Great game would recommend this game for other people. i've spend all 128hours without any afking. one thing i would like in this game to be added is achevements. not only would it help new players get a hold onto things. but would help what to do next. i know there is a help bar which is great but not being sure on what to do next can be a little bit boring. some achevements that would be nice and suitable would be like. Make your colony plant 50 potatoes in one growing patch. and another be that you need to create a fridge of 20 blocks worth under -10 Celsius.these are some examples but your development team should be able to think of more ideas. also im not sure if your working on multiplayer but that would be a nice feature to the game but im still a bit unsure how it would work as in balance wise unless all players must be on so the world can be unpaused.Thanks for reading.My rating  9/10 would recommend to friends.

								I began a normal 3-man survivor game using Phobe Chillax base builder mode. Along with my 3 survivors, there was Sugar-Plum the cat. I did not name this cat; it was randomly generated. This review revolves around Sugar-Plum the savior of SleepVille.From the start, Sugar-Plum the white cat had it rough. He was awoken from Cryo-sleep and tossed into an escape pod with a large man named Jose (who appreciated animals more than his human counterparts). Upon landing on this terrifying and strange new land, Sugar-Plum began exploring. Occasionally finding the random squirrel to scuffle with or being shooed out of the way for new construction projects, his life was pretty dull. He sometimes saw a distant bear or cougar but he always stayed close to home practicing his hunting skills on squirrels. He had begun to adjust nicely to his new home and animal bed. He wanted to keep it that way.Around countless squirrel (and one turtle) kills later, Sugar-Plum found himself bored and wandering around a new stockpile the humans had just made after trading with the locals. He did it more out of curiosity then anything and since this was his territory, he needed to check it out. He was on his way past the door when something caught his eye. maybe it was the round shape, or maybe there was an odd smell to it, but he had to continue investigating. He slowly sniffed around the package. Used his little hunter’s teeth to rip a small hole and proceeded to paw out some of the packages contents. He sniffed again and since he was feeling rather hungry at that moment and the freezer was so far away, he promptly devoured the small circles. He felt fine at first and suddenly had more energy than ever before. He felt invincible, like he could hunt every scumbag squirrel on this planet in minutes! But then before he knew it poor Sugar-Plum started throwing up everywhere and he passed out in his own puddle of kitty-fur bile until one of the humans found him laying helpless, shamed and barely breathing. This is where things turned bad for poor Sugar-Plum, for he had just eaten the very addictive stimulant ""Wake-up"". His personal story ends there, but it continues in my perspective. After I got the warning Sugar-Plum had passed out, I quickly read his health tab finding that he now had an addiction to Wake-up. I was furious that he had eaten some of my newly attained drugs and I proceeded to watch his EVERY move. I wanted to catch him in the act again and I even got to the point where I was goading him on in my head. Daring him to do it again while I watched this time so I could mark him for slaughter. I didn't care if he was a founding god damn member of the colony. THERE WOULD BE BLOOD!! Well Sugar-Plum must have read my damn mind because he never went back to the stockpile. Upon kicking his addiction, he developed 5/5 chemical brain damage. Great. Now I was down some precious drugs and stuck with a mentally handicapped cat. I was selling him to the trader ASAP.Called the trader in and was all smiles knowing I could at least cut my losses by selling Sugar-Plum to the trader for 300 silver. I was happy indeed. As the local traders approached, I heard a meow. It was Sugar-Plum. The poor little guy was still outside patrolling and killing squirrels in defense of my colony. My heart sank at the thought of selling my first animal and as I traded my goods, I quietly skipped over selling him.It was a season later that I cracked into the side of a mountain while mining and witnessed a horrific battle between looters and mechanoids. The sole survivor was this disgusting maggot looking mechanoid that fired extremely fast fire explosion rounds. I quickly vacated the area and back to the safety of my colony. I was not prepared for that fight yet. Night approached and all was well, I was safe for now. As my colonists slept I went over plans on how to approach the creature the next day, when out of the corner of my eye I see the horrific creature slowly slinking toward my base! @$%&!! Panic sets in and as I’m rallying my colonists out of bed, its already knocking some of my doors down trying to get revenge for bothering its home. In my panic I failed to realize that all my colonists are rushing out the one door the creatures about to knock down and potentially shoot its fiery death cannon; killing everyone inside. Then to my astonishment the creature suddenly turns back the way it came and fires its deadly blast toward a door it had already destroyed. While my colonists all make it safely past the creature and into defensive positions, I investigate the situation only to find out that poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sugar-Plum had randomly wandered out a side door and distracted the hideous thing. So to wrap things up, my colony successfully incapacitated and killed the creature after brave(?) Sugar-Plum took one for the team. He actually didn’t die (I don’t know how) and good ole Sugar-Plum can still be found around the colony happily hunting squirrels to his heart’s content. But if I ever find him taking drugs again, I swear I’ll mark him for slaughter. 10/10 Would actually never think of selling or slaughtering Sugar-Plum again.  "

								To think I very nearly refunded this game! I started playing it, followed the tutorial and it just felt very boring. There was no point in anything, my guys just wondered around or sat doing nothing. I tried clicking to make them do chores etc but it just felt laborious and uninteresting. I'd try to tame an animal and the tamer wench would just stand there chilling. So I logged out and didn’t give it much thought. Then before refunding I decided I’d try it again and actually googling some of the issues i was having. So much of it is customisable, even right down to random people wondering into your camp and being like ""HEY IM IN YOUR TEAM NOW, SURE I BURN EVERYTHING IN SIGHT AND I'LL KNIFE YOU IF YOU LOOK AT ME THE WRONG WAY BUT HIGH FIVE!"" (It's in customise scenario: D) Everything in this game is a little bit complicated, but even something as stupid as working out how the cabling from solar panels to batteries feels good.I ended up doing the rich explorer scenario a lot mostly because it was easier to just focus on one guy. Just me and my dog chilling, arresting any beach that comes within gun range of my property. I'd put them in prison (to arrest somebody you need to already have built a bed, click it and click the prisoner icon :D), tend to their wounds, chat with them, make them comfortable and then either release them or execute them on the spot and harvest their organs (Traders will buyy that shiz!) I've actually just came off the game...giant lightning storm started a fire near my battery building :( It then spread to my solar panels which then spread to every single building I had. My poor guy tried spending 2 minutes patting one square of fire, meanwhile 600 others had caught. He was so badly burnt he eventually felt to the ground, dropped his weapon and lay there helplessly. My poor dog who I had actually trained to guard me and bond with me, sat by whelping miserably. Sadly there was no rescue party (maybe because i shoot at everyone) and my poor guy succumbed to his infected wounds. RIPWould shoot/arrest everyone again. "

								You can't see the over 1,000 hours I've put into this gem from before it was on Steam - but if you like colony management games, this one is a MUST play. Not unlike Dwarf Fortress, and Prison Architecht, with each major update the game is so alive with new features and content it warrants another dozen hours of watching everything spiral out of control.Inbetween regular updates and content, and massive mod / community support, this game will have legs for a long time coming.

I'm sorry I didn't purchase it early.Now if my one colonist would stop stripping and running around like crazy that would be great.

								After almost 10 hours in this game its just as addicting as the moment i got it, It starts inocently enough,with 3 colonist,but things can go out of control quickly i was just getting my first harvest done when a heatwave hit. Me being the noob that i was thought if i forget about it, it would go away....i was wrong. It started with heat stroke initial, i did not care and forgot about it, this was my first mistake. my second was the fact that i did not care about cooling so i hoped it would go away. The final nail in the coffin was when my most competent colonist collasped, acting on impulse i sent someone to go get him,the person who went to get him collasped...... soon enough this started a chain reaction in the colony with everyone down, me being ignorant, hoped they would get back up...they never did. That is how my first game went10/10 would die again			"

								Most of this is up to you. Who you’re with, what you have, where you start – your choice. What happens to you, however, is a different story. After crash landing on a distant, alien planet, survival is the only goal. Build your base and maintain your colonist’s mental health while balancing intellectual pursuits and territorial control. The AI narrator is ruthless and unforgiving, forcing your space society to deal with everything from natural disasters to bloodthirsty troops of Yorkshire terriers. Who knew sustaining life could be so hard? Witness, firsthand, the flawed dynamics of your very own Adam and Eve or lead ragtag group of tribesman towards civilization. As it turns out, colonizing an alien planet is also a grieving process. Let me walk you through the stages.1. Denial“This’ll be easy”, you think to yourself as the game starts without knowing how absolutely wrong you are. It’ll be dark soon and you don’t even have a bed to sleep in yet. 2. AngerChopping down trees for a bed frame and four walls seems like a menial task. How borin...oops! The tree came down and crushed your leg. That’s going to slow things down.3. BargainingThankfully a band of traders is passing by your camp. They take pity and offer you a discounted peg leg. Score! Might as well get a few other supplies while you’re at it.4. DepressionYou shouldn’t have traded so much of your food for those supplies. Now you're hungry. And everyone you meet thinks you're weird because of your peg leg. Did those guys rip you off? 5. AcceptanceAt least you had the extra materials to finish building a spare room. You also fought off a deranged marauder and took him, and his two fresh legs, prisoner. Things are looking up. Almost anything is possible (thanks to a loyal modding community) and you’re given the opportunity to micromanage every aspect of the action or just sit back and watch it like a fish tank filled with interesting space creatures. Rarely is a game everything you ever wanted it to be. RimWorld is impossibly deep and equally entertaining. You won’t be disappointed.			"

One has a rifle and is standing back a bit.-The raiders enter the mountain pass in approach to my base.  The first shot of the battle rings.-My pistol wielding soldier falls to the ground.  Shot in the back of the head by my soldier wielding the rifle.  The shot missed it's mark.  The fight is now 2v3.-Another bang sounds through the air.

The other would follow soon.  Followed by the arms...... the rifle soldier was now dead.  The fight is now 1v4.-The last man standing is the solider that is incapable of violence...-BOOM! The first bear swipe at my wooden door.-BOOM! The 2nd swipe at my wooden door.  My pacifist soldier is standing in a dark room - saying his final words.-BANG!  A gunshot rings again.

It builds on all the other city building games we've seen in the last few years (Gnomoria, Towns, Dwaf Fortress, etc) and improves on what made those games interesting. Temperature management, surgery for organ damage, monster rancher, forest fire fighting, and so much more with the mods.			"

I haven't encountered a single bug so far, the game feels very solid already. The story telling is pretty good as well. I reckon that this game is going to be amazing when complete, it's already very good. However, my one suggestion is adding in-game tutorials,because i had no idea what to do when i started. They have now added a heavily demanded tutorial, which well help people quite a lot, as this game is brutal. I wasnt sure about getting the game, but im very happy i got it.

								RimWorld is one of those games you could play every day for the rest of your life and have a completely different outcome each and every time. If you put into perspective the amount of random generation and events, then look further at the amount of details like relations between colonists, capturing enemies or even having your own colonists captured right down to their types of injuries.. you can tell a story.It's a library of books, each game a brand new cover. Will you build a ship and escape or succumb to the dangers and mishaps around you? Will the favorite character who has fantastic shooting and a friendly face get mauled by a megasloth? Nobody knows. There is no script, only a story to be written after.Aside from all of that, completely independent of it, this game supports mods. As we see from games like Garry's mod, mods can make a game immortal. Already, even before the game is done, there is a fantastic modding community adding things that we can only hope will be added by the developers.TL;DR - Imagine prison architect 3000 years in the future except it's not a prison, it's the entire world. Oh and it has about twice the features and complexity. Plus mods.			"

								I put off buying this, ignoring recommendations from pretty much all of my friends .. I have a LOT of games, so with Early Access I tend to wait and see how they turn out before adding more to the list... That was dumb of me, after much convincing I went and bought it .. And for the past couple of days, it's the only game I've played. The developer is extremely active, and it's clear that they are passionate about making this perfect. They're often adding improvements, technology changes, and goals. Not only that, they allow you to roll back when there's a major update that may affect your save games. The difficulty of it can be somewhat brutal, I think I lasted about 45 minutes in my last game, maybe less. But that's one of the things I like most about it. Too many games these days hold your hand, and it's all over in a few hours. This game however, is dynamically generated, has multiple ways to play, and multiple difficulty levels; from hard, right through to pants on head crazy.Another excellent thing is the amount of community mods, there are bucketloads of them to be used, some completely changing the game, and that just increases every day.I can't recommend this enough, even at full price (which I paid), it's worth every penny.

								Rimworld is a colony sim game run by a one-developer shop. The game consists of picking a starting location, some colonists that will do the surviving, and a storyteller that creates the challenges you'll face.Through the game you'll build your colony, manage assets like raw resources, food, colonist mental health, colonist physical health (damn bullets), defenses and a host of other things! Rimworld keeps you on your toes as you expand and build necessities to survive challenges like Raiders, crop blights, electrical fires, man-hunting animals, disease and a host of other horrible, horrible things.The UI is simplistic but easy to navigate, allowing you to make adjustments to allow efficiency in playing the game.The fun thing is that every time you play, you learn a little more about what works and what doesn't work. The most fun is at the beginning, when you're struggling to survive in a harsh environment with an AI storyteller that wants you to SQUIRM. I definitely recommend enabling permadeath to remove save scumming, and it's hilarious to watch your colony get destroyed in the most unanticipated of ways.Rimworld also boasts a combat engine that has an extra tactical layer than what these games usually have. Distance/cover/weapon type/hit location all come into play. Sometimes your colonists are fine, other times they're down a finger/hand/leg/eye/kidney (especially kidneys!).Overall, I play this game obsessively every time a new release is out (one dev shop, takes some time but damn is it worth the wait). Definitely worth the money!			"

								Great game, base building/character skill level ups/gathering resources/somewhat rts/and for everthing else there is MODS!! Don't get too attached to your colonists, just like reality random things happen when you least expect it. :(Now here's Kirby <('.'<)			"

								This game... its quite simply legendary. I'll tell you some highlights of my game experience (take in mind i had seen videos before playing)My first Colony: I chose the standard biome (forest) and got some overall good colonists. 25 minutes later everyone died to manhunter boomalope pack.My Second Colony: I have stopped playing this colony but have built the spaceship and can leave at any time. this colony really gave me an apreciation for the game. I learned a bunch and realised how addictive this game is. i would play for 2-3 hours straight and feel like it was 30min. the game sucks you in and doesnt let you out.My third Colony (now including mods!) OMG MODS ARE SOOOOOO GREATTTTT. Ahem. Mods are what makes this game great. The community is really doing great things for this game. From prepare carefully (my possibe fav) where u can make your colonist anything you want, to  more effiecent lamps, so you dont waste all your power. Honestly if you get this game i would say get mods almost immediatly. or at least after you know the basics.Conclusion: I would highly recommend this game for its realism, addictiveness, and great community pumping out amazing mods :)			"

								I thought I'd start out easy so I set the game up in the gentle 'Base builder' mode.On the first day, one of my three colonists had a heart attack. Unfortunately she was the doctor. Never fear, I assigned another colonist as medic and ordered him to treat her. He tried once, failed and then became her lover instead, which meant he climbed into her sickbed and stayed there until she died.The third colonist was so freaked out by her dead body that he went for 'an aimless wander' and was savaged by a rampaging hare... so he was killed by a bunny.My colony is now one necrophiliac with no survival skills, lets see what day 2 will bring...11/10			"
