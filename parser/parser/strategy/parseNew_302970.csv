Favorite mobile TD finally arrived on PC!! *Version WITHOUT in-game store!*I am consider this game as a 10/10 perfect experience, even after I already played it for over 30+ hours on my Android tab. The soundtrack is a mix of catchy space and lounge tracks and the graphics are beautiful coloured 2D animations.Played a lot of Tower Defense games which were simple windowed *.exe files (Grassland TD) or more complexe ones (Revenge of the Titans) but this here is my absolute favorite TD game.By spending the five bucks, you will get a game without a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in-game store (Yes, I look at you Ubisoft!).I prefer games, where you can pay a price and get everything in it, instead of trying to win by paying cashGood move, Hexage! And now give us Radiant HD with Controller support (*_*) "

												Don't let the cute graphics fool you, his is a challenging game.  At first I didn't like it because it.  In most tower defense games you can figure out a pattern and keep applying that strategy as you go.  This game you have to reinvent your strategy every new course.  Sometimes you can only place one block, sometimes you can create elaborate mazes.  New enemies are introduced on most courses which make you winning method obsolete.  You get frustrated, yell at it but then eventually/hopefully come up with a way to win. I wish the developers would allow you to move the map with the keyboard.  Having to hold down the left mouse button and move the map while trying to place weapons in a game can be unnecessarily frustrating.  Also it would be nice to know when you upgrade a weapon what actual percentage more damage it does.  Lots of guess work is needed. "

												Vibrant colors, good music and cute aliens to battle in the cosmos. I love this game. Its sure to win any tower defense lovers heart. Its very forgiving with check points for each wave you go through. I appreciate that. Plus theres light humor along with a small story to follow, Very casual and fun. 10/10			"

												Short review:Radiant Defense is a fun and colorful tower defense (TD) game complete with Hexage's signature humor and clever level design. You won't find anything groundbreaking or innovating but you'll sure have fun. If you're a TD fan then this is certainly a worthy title for your collection. I didn't come across any bugs and all of the achievements work.			"

												The difficulty people are talking about is not due to clever design but due to annoying 'features' (bad design). For example you can run a wave once and be unsuccessful, and run it a second time (with the exact same setup) and be successful. It's seemingly random. It often depends on the direction your towers are facing when you start a wave, because they take sooo long to turn around and face the enemy.Another design flaw is badly tiered difficulty of waves. For example on level 7, waves 1-10 are easy and can be beaten with 3-4 towers. Suddenly waves 11 and 12 are next to impossible, even if you've been saving the max resources per round. Now all of a sudden you need 6-7 towers just to barely scrape by. There was no preparation for this. Another example is often when you do scrape by those difficult waves, the next 8-10 waves will be super easy enemies that you faced earlier in the level. It jsut doesn't make sense. The dificulty doesn't ramp up like it should: easy medium hard insane. Instead it spikes randomly in waves: easy easy easy HARD easy easy INSANE, etc.Like other people said the controls are clunky. It's not a problem during the setup rounds between waves, but mid wave it's harder than it should be to set up a tower.There's no backspace function like in Defense Grid. You cannot 'Undo' tower placements without selling them for a loss. 1 mistake can cost you the mission and you have to restart, making it very difficult to optimize your bases. This gets frustrating since the levels are SO long (45 waves at level 7).Note to the designers: Do 10 waves WELL, instead of 45 waves SLOPPILY. It's just annoying how many hours it can take to finish 1 mission after you do get it on lockdown.Another problem is enemies can walk off the screen, so you can't even see them. The map does not scroll. For all of these reasons, the difficulty of the game is due to Design Flaws and Not clever design. I cannot recommend this game.			"

												The hope of mankind lies within your hands as you take command to keep thousend of aliens from invading your world. As military commander your only help comes from a scientist providing you with new technology and weapons.'Radiant Defense' is a tower defence game in space. Its colourful, glowing look is beautiful and the comic style can be deceiving. That's because 'Radiant Defense' is not a simple game. Some players even claim it's too hard altogether. But in my opinion that's not really the case. Yes, the game becomes difficult in the higher levels but it's a clever difficulty. While difficult sometimes leads to frustration in 'Radiant Defense' difficult is challenging and inspires to keep trying again and again until you finally win victory. Pros:- nice graphics- good music- clever game design- very good selection of weapons and enemies- freedom to build your own route in most levels- more than 300 waves of aliens across 14 missions- pauses between waves allow you to arrange your weapons- you can repeat any wave without loosing money if you do not upgrade towers before starting the wave. This allows you to experiment.- the game automatically saves progress for each level. You can simply stop playing and return right to were you stopped any time later.- nice tactical component for money. Dead aliens fill your purse but you can increase the money earned by placing money boosters. Additionally you collect further money depending on your funds at the end of each wave. This adds to very interesting tactical twists.- high number of waves- nine upgradable weapons- three super-weapons for mass defenceCons:- online hall of fame seems to contain cheaters and you can't find your own position- one achievement seems bugged (Endangered Species)			"

												If you enjoy tower defense games, this is a must. Yes, it's a bit difficult but that's part of what makes it so fun. When you figure out what path the aliens should follow, what the best weapons are to slaughter them, and where best to place everything. After  working hard to get a winning combo and you kick some serious alien butt - well, you just feel really satisfied. This is one of those ""don't start playing anywhere near bedtime"" games. :D			"

												Warning: This is Only for the TD powerplayer and perfectionist.  Fun to play, but horribly unbalanced and requiring  ludicrously narrow and complex winning strategies.

												TL;DR: No raw stats for anything and towers select random targets instead of the most threatening. These two aspects alone are a deal-breaker for ANY tower defence game!---------Artistically, this game is fine. Programmtically, this game has no major technical issues. However, I cannot recommend this game because it has serious design flaws.I only played for 10 minutes and ran into several design issues:* UI is not as straightforward to use as it looks* Enemies do not path in ways which make sense* One hit death: You take ONE POINT of damage, you lose and have to do the wave over* Towers select RANDOM targets, not targets closest to the end of their run, meaning luck plays a huge factor in how well you do rather than skill* NO RAW STATS FOR ANYTHING (Not damage numbers, not firing rates, NOTHING!)Also, I should point out the game heavily borrows design concepts from other better TD games. For instance, the first, third and fourth towers here are COPIES of the first, third and fourth towers from Defense Grid. Not graphically but in terms of function.			"

												Ok lets be honest here.  This is a great tower defense and it's great that it's on PC and it's great that it's so damn cheap!  Just know before you buy that it's a pretty bare bones port.  From my limited experience with the android version the PC version is identical, which is fine.  I'm not gonna complain, it's five ♥♥♥♥ing dollars!  It's just that the interface ends up feeling a little awkward.  You have to do a lot of clicking.  The most annoying result of the port being that in order to figure out what a tower was I had to click it first.  Right click to return or cancel would have been a nice addition, but instead you have to click a cancel button.  Or click a build button, then click where you want it, then click again, then click your heels together.  Just a hell of a lot of left clicking, you understand?  No right mouse, no keyboard shortcuts, no graphics options, in fact the options menu if i remember correctly just has volume sliders.  But what do you want?  It's radiant defense and it's five bucks.  Go buy it, it's worth it.  Just don't be disappointed by how tablet-ey it feels.  It's worth it still.			"

												This is a game deliberately designed to be stupidly hard to beat without buying all the IAP stuff.  Seriously, I've been playing TD games for years and while the core mechanics are pretty good, you're either going to be replaying levels a dozen times or staring at youtube videos of level strategies.  That's not a game - it's an exercise in frustration.  I'm sure on Android it's loads of fun after paying to win with the IAP, but the steam version is just flat out unbalanced.  It's a shame.			"

			This game is Radiant Defense by Hexage. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanovichZ1/recommended/302970		

I think graphical quality is good. I like the music and the sound effects.It's a tower defense game. If you have a played a lot of these types of games before I wouldn't say that it really innovates. But so far I think a pretty good implementation of this type. It has few useful features. For example if built something in the wrong place you can get a full refund if you sell it straight away and you also speed up time during the waves, so that the game isn't so slow. You seem to have good variety of turrets to build. Some require you to have a tech structure first. I noticed that there seems to be only 15 levels, I'm not about that though.The game is easy to get the hang of the basics such as turret placement. You need to get to know the characteristics of the different types of turrets. Obviously some ordinances are more effective against certain types and amounts of enemies. However rotation speed of the turrets also comes play, some are very fast while are so slow enemies can get past them.I like this game. I like trying to find the best turret placement, combination of turrets etc. It was fun. But if the game only has 15 levels it may be relatively short. However later levels should be increasingly difficult and have more waves.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												Agree with other reviews that this game is too difficult. I've played loads of Tower games that provided a challenge but were beatable with a quick re-think of my strategy for that particular wave of enermies. With this game, it feels like if you don't start putting down the perfect sequence of towers from Wave 1, you're doomed to fail by mid-level, and the wave reset won't help because you won't have enough resources to build what you need to. Everything else about the game, i.e. music, graphics, choice of towers etc is great.I'm all for a challenge but this is just frustrating, and I gave up.			"

												I have always been a sucker for a good tower defense game, and Radiant Defense is no exception.  It is an Android game ported to the PC, but don't let that fool you; there is a level of enjoyment and challenge to the game that makes it more than worth playing.There are no real differences between this and the Android app, save for all the DLC is already part of this package.  If you aren't sure whether you' like it, give it a run on the Android - the base game on that platform is free through the Google Play store.			"

												There's an element of randomness to any tower defense game, but this one is...well, it's remarkably inconsistent. Most of the towers have a firing arc and a set rotation speed, but the AI on the towers loves to point them in the least helpful direction. If you fail a wave, restarting it and changing nothing about your tower placements and upgrades is just as likely to bring a win as reworking everyhing that you previously tried.The game isn't outright bad, but it's meant to kill time as it's nothing more than a port of a smartphone game.

												I'm a pretty avid fan of tower defense titles and Radiant Defense was a pleasant surprise.  If I were giving it a grade on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a solid 7.  It doesn't do anything genre-defining like Orcs Must Die or Kingdom Rush, but it does put the standard tower defense pieces together well to create a challenging experience.If you research this game for more than 30 seconds, you'll see that people complain/rave that it is very difficult.  It is definately a very challenging tower defense game, easily one of the hardest I have played.  Unfortunately, the difficulty often comes as a result of poor wave balancing.  The difficulty really gives very low margin for error, causing you to not experiment too much in the obvious formula to success.Also, unlike a lot of the best tower defense games, there's really no tower-progression or leveling up through the campaign - you have access to all of the towers right away.  This creates somewhat of a rinse-repeat feeling by halfway through the game that never goes away as nothing very new presents itself throughout the entire game except stronger and stronger waves.I would definitely recommend it to genre fans like me looking for yet another Tower defense game to play.  For all others, I'd suggest first knocking out genre classics like Orcs Must Die, Dungeon Defenders, Kingdom Rush, and Bloons TD before spending your time on this title.			"

												I have always been a fan of tower defense games and on the surface this seemed like a well put together attempt.However, what starts out as pretty standard fare becomes one of the most challenging games I have ever played. At the end of each wave interest is applied to the total amount of money you have left. This leads to many instances where you think you are doing ok but then you hit a brick wall. The only way of progressing is to start again and make sure you don't overspend too early. This creates a unique challenge where you have to very carefully monitor whether you need to spend the money or not. I spent several days, and hundreds of attempts on some levels to get them finished. Mastering the interest mechanism is absolutely critical to completing some of the more challenging levels, and it is clear that the developers must have spent an age play testing it. Superb			"

												Radiant Defense might be a mobile port but everything plays better on PC, right?  Absolutely, I've put in a bunch of hours on this on my phone and plan on doing the same on my PC.  Radiant Defense is considered by many to be one of the best Tower Defense games out there.  I have to admit I'm apart of that crowd.  I don't think Hexage really did anything visionary here but they made an extremeable enjoyable and fun to play game.  It has just the right amount of difficulty while still being very easy to pick up and play for beginners.  Perhaps most importantly the marriage of the beautiful aesthetics, music and gameplay make this game really hard to put down!  Check out my video review below if you need more convincing, otherwise what are you waiting for!

												Radiant Defense is a tower defense game.  Its missions are played on a grid.  Enemies get one or more starting points, and they have to make their way to the ending point.  Towers have to be placed on modules, and while there are fixed modules for each mission, you're also allowed to put some down yourself, which means you're allowed to change the route of the enemies.There are about a dozen different towers, including machine guns, laser guns, sniper rifles, and tesla towers.  There are also super weapons, which are more expensive than regular towers but have much better attacks.  Regular towers can be upgraded four times during missions.  There isn't any upgrading outside the missions.There are also a dozen or more types of enemies.  They can be fast; they can be shielded; they can spawn more enemies; they can be resistant to some of your towers; and more.  The in-game information isn't great, so you have to learn by playing and trying things out.The missions in the game tend to be long.  Most have over 30 waves, and the peak is somewhere around 70.  Luckily, you get a save before each wave, so if one goes badly then you can load and try again.  This is friendly but also necessary because your score for each mission depends on how much money you have unused at the end of each wave.  So your goal is to kill everything while spending as little money as possible, which adds a little extra strategy.Overall, Radiant Defense is a pretty vanilla, but it works well enough, especially for the price.  It doesn't do anything new or innovative, but it's colorful and humorous, and it took me over 30 hours to beat the 15-mission campaign plus earn all of the achievements.  The campaign starts out very easy but then gets tough at the end, so don't give up on it after only an hour or two.			"
