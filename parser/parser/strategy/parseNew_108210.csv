												Would I recommend this game? Yes IF it was the actual board game.  Because you pay once and you can play everyday forever.  This digital version is great because it has most of the expansions included, easy to play BUT after a short period you have to start paying actual money to play - continually.  That's just plain stupid.  IF this game where a one time pay and you own it for life, like say 19.99 (which I think is fair) I'd buy it in a heart beat.  But this game ending up being a pay-to-play is really the only reason it's got a bad rap.  Do yourself a favor and try this digital version to see if you like the general overall play and game mechanics.  THEN when you run out of your gift coins...DELETE and buy the actual board game!!

												1.5 out of 6 stars.In short, sorry to say this but I don't reccomend it.  To sum it up:1) The outcome of the battle tends to depend far too much on luck with dice rather than tactics, using terrain etc. The game tends at times to eb so random as to seem a glorified game of craps with toy soldiers in the background. 2) Units are generic, you get almost no ww2 ""chrome"" in this game. Maries and Japanese infantry are the only exceptions that stand out.3) The business model is costly and player-unfriendly. Its not so much a F2P game, It feels more like a free extended demo.IN DETAIL:I played this with a friend - we are both old time wargamers (Advanced Third Reich, Squad Leader, Steel Panthers). We came to this expecting a beer&pretzels sort of ""Baby's first Squad Leader"" game.  I don't mean it in a derogatory manner -  in my opinion there is nothing wrong in making a simple or fast-play game on a popular topic, in this case tactical WW2 combat.Memoir 44 failed to deliver though. Yes, it is simple and fast. However it also lacks historical ""chrome"" and all the unit types feel far too generic (german tanks in Normandy have same stats as allied tanks etc).The worst thing about it is that it is VERY random in combat outcomes. 9 out of 10 games both me and my friend walked away with the mutual conclusion that it was luck that was the decisive factor. In this game, your decisions, combat errors or tactical mistakes feel to have very little impact on the outcome - luck means much more. We've had situations when infantry charged madly into the open field and shot to pieces an opposing infantry squad (same stats) that was defending a bunker. And no, this was not a point-blank assault on the bunker, we were shooting from many hexes away. I'm ok  with such situations happening ""once in a blue moon"", but in memoir 44 this happens all the time. Much more so than in most ww2 combat games we've seen - here everything depends on how the dice rolls - terrain and equipment don't seem to matter all that much. For me this is an absolute joykill. Let's get one last thing straight - calling this F2P is somewhat an exaggeration. The free part is more of an extended demo - you have a limited amount of gold that allows you to play the game a limited amount of times except for several small free scenarios. After you run out of gold, you will need to pay money for each scenario you play - multiplayer, single player, doesn't matter each time you will have to pay. This does become a probem as each scenario is small and these play fast. IMHO this is not a fun business model for me as a player.			"

												Man, I feel for the developers of this game. Steam kids are idiots, especially the f2p grazers.No, this game is not entirely free. You'll find no game ever really is, since someone has to pay the developers. Instead, it's a demo (as the text explains) in which you have full access to all factions and maps for hours of playtime. The devs tried a new payment model, where you don't pay for the game or DLC, but pay-as-you-go instead. A round of play (20 mins) costs around 2 or 3 gold and you get 125 gold for EUR 5 or 1.000 gold for EUR 30 (which also includes the scenario maker, btw). That's over 300 games worth of gold and you never have to pay for DLC. That's actually pretty fair, in my book.   So what about the game itself? It's a pretty faithful remake of the board game. I would not have minded a less cartooney and more lifelike approach, especially since the board game does feature 3D models. Different scenarios come with different rules (the Russian chain of command rule drives me insane, for one) but despite that, it's really easy to pick up. You'll be playing inside 5 minutes after watching the tutorial vid.The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed. It has a tendency to overextend and get its units into trouble. This is offset by it seemingly getting better command cards, which feels ho-hum. However, it's not overly obvious and the balance is actually pretty good.If you're in for a really basic beer&pretzels wargame, they don't come more basic than this. Expect around 6-8 hours of free play in the -otherwise unrestricted- demo. After that, you pay EUR 5 for every 10 hours of playtime max, probably a lot less. That's pretty decent in my book.			"

												First and foremost, this is a great implementation of the original board game. The execution of the game's rules along with a clean user interface and having absolutely no set-up time makes it desirable.However, the pay-to-play model that they employ is a travesty. If it were a one-time purchase, I would buy in a heartbeat because of the potential to reach a larger player base. Unfortunately, as it is, I would only suggest playing the free scenarios, using the limited free plays they offer and, if you really enjoy it, purchase the actual board game. It's just too bad the publisher had to be greedy on this one!			"

												Fun and accurate digital reproduction of the board game. The game offers  two free scenarios. Playing further scenarios requires the use of Gold ingots. Creating an account gives you 50 for free. Scenarios cost from 2-3 gold ingots in my experience. After you go through your initial 50 you'll have to pay for more ingots. Packs of Ingots can be bought from their site and apparently from inside steam, but I can't get that to work. For 8$ (USD) you get the sergeant pack which comes with an 200 additional ingots. For 30$ you get the captain pack which comes with 1,000 ingots as well as access to their expert mode. Expert mode allows you to build custom scenarios. 30$ for this is way too high. Especially considering the simple 2-d graphics and uncomplicated game play. I would happily recommend this game if the captain pack was 10-15$.			"

												This is a Pay-4-Play game with 50 free tokens, which amounts to a demo period.  After the free tokens are gone, you are paying them or you are done.  Oh, and if they say you lose connection before you even make your first move, those tokens you spent to play that map are gone.  There is no such thing as owning this game.  This is an arcade game where you need to keep pumping in the quarters to pay from now to eternity.  At least Candy Crush lets you come back after a cooloff period if you don't want to pay for immediate continue.So... play this decent game for 50 tokens.  If you get addicted, start looking for the quarter slot on your computer.  Or if you love it, go buy the board game and get reaquainted with your IRL friends.  It'll be cheaper in the long run than entering your credit card number.Would I play again?  If I had been able to buy the game instead of rent it, sure I probably would.  Would I pay from now to eternity to rent time on the game?  Not on your life.  Would I buy the table-top game IRL?  Not after the sour taste in my mouth from losing my last 3 tokens trying to Storm Paris and having it say I disconnected.			"

												Memoir '44 Online is a ""free to play"" video game reproduction of the actual Board Game Memoir '44.  Worked on Win 10 , looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It amounts to more as a Pay to Play than Free to Play game.  Does help diehard fans of this boardgame to find opponents online.  You really need to like playing the boardgame Memoir'44 to like this game.You can spend from your steam wallet: 5 dollar for 125 gold, 15 dollar for 400 gold, or 30 dollar for 1,000 gold and Expert Mode.  You start off with 50 free gold.  The game is turn-based on hex map that is divided into three sections Right Flank, Center and Left Flank.  You have two kinds of cards that give your units orders, Command and Tactics.  You randomly draw cards but get to pick one of two drawn.  You have to pay 2 or 3 gold per play of a scenario ( didn't see any for 1 ). You can play Solo vs AI or against another online player.  There is a tuturial video but it didn't help teach the game much, you need to read the manual and seek out more clearer help.  The AI is effective as an opponent.At the time of this review, i saw like 30 players online, so you can find someone to play, with plenty of invites to play from other online players.  It has a lobby chatroom and uses languages of English or French. You can play with your Steam account or the Days of Wonder account.  Has Steam Achievements.CONS:- Has business model of charging you gold for each play of a scenario.- The online tutorial video have a lot of loading lag.- There are Only 2 Scenarios (Pegasus Bridge and Juno Beach) that are truly Free.- Expert mode is currently in Developement.- Very annoying flicking of rainbow colors as a highlighting feature.Try it, only if you like wargame board games.  Don't expect to play this game for free for long.For more info:

												So, I own Commands and Colors: Napoleonics. This is pretty much the same system. I tried the Pegasus Bridge scenario 10 times as the allies and was soundly beaten by the AI each time. I'm not that terrible at Commands and Colors, and in the scenario the Germans only have a 2 card start. I strongly feel that the luck is skewed in the favour of the the AI. I haven't bothered to try any Humans. There is a positive though. This demo has saved me money, since I was planning on picking up the board game version of Memoir '44. Thanks for that!			"

												Superb version of a classic boardgame although, as usual, ""free to play"" means ""limited demo"" unless you want to pay extra. Games only take about 15 minutes, it's easy to learn, the manual's only a few pages, but gameplay's excellent... the sign of a great game. All you need to know about is movement, terrain restrictions and range modifiers and you're away. The visuals may put some people off (it's hexey, same as the boxed real-life version) but behind that it's a gem. Roll the dice, get symbols that match your target type to hit, destroy units or capture a location to get a victory point medal. Simple but effective.       The only trouble is the pay to play model, imo one of the nastiest money leaching and off-putting things to happen to gaming in the last 20 years. Once the 50 free gold runs out you're stuck with only 2 free maps. It may only work out as pennies to play a match but if  they'd sell it as a complete game, drop the ""free"" tag and the extra payments, it would've been great (and maybe had a larger number of long term players). It's happened with other boardgame conversions such as Ticket to Ride, Smallworld, Catan, Space Hulk, Talisman, so why not this too?        Use the free bits then buy the boardgame until they come to their senses and release it as a full game where you can play to your heart's content without paying extra for the pleasure.			"

												As much as I wish there was a 'So, So' rating to this, I had to chose negatively.]The game is really good on strategic levels, but the dice thing can be really unfair, and make it look like it favors your rival's side. Which can be really annoying. Also the 'Free to Play' thing can be REALLY deceiving for this. You have like, let's say credits in this game, which you NEED to play some maps. And when you run out, you're down to 2 very boring maps, so basically you need money to make this game interesting.

												I highly recommend this game to any fans of Memoir '44 or anyone who is new to the game. I know that sometimes it is hard to find a real opponent and this game offers you just that. You can play a battle in a fraction of the time it takes to play a real battle and is just as fun. Though I wish they would offer scenarios from the Equipment pack and Terrain Pack, it still offers battles from all fronts and the ability to create your own maps. All in all, it is a great way to play Memoir '44.			"

												Memoir '44 is a really fun board game. This is the video game version of the real board game, and it is just as enjoyable. However, the game starts you out with free money and charges you to play each game. Once you run out of coins, you'll either have to pay, or register a new e-mail address to get free coins again. If you do re-register with another e-mail, you'll start over from scratch, so there is no way to progress in the game without paying.Even so, I would recommend this game if you are interested in the board game, or if you just want to kill some time playing a board game about WWII. Just know that the coins will run out, and you'll have to decide how to proceed from there.			"

												This is a tremendous challenge in a quickly played WWII map based game.  You are the general and use various army units to defeat your enemy on any one of dozens of battlefields that span most all the various campaigns.  With limited options each turn based on the cards you draw; and combat outcomes determined by the roll of the dice,  there is no guarantee of victory.  Have played for over a year and a half and still am never bored.  Love this One!!!I still believe this to represent a fabulous value.  After hundreds of hours have spent about half of the $60 invested.  And have played against a truly amazing variety of opponents from around the world.			"

												Cannot control all of my units.***Units do not defend*** - units do not exchange fire during combat.Cards usually only allow you to control  a couple units at a time andusually only on left, center or right...!??!So big problem is if you have more than one objective (and enemy may not have the same problem) while you move towards one objective, enemy has at your other units Without incurring damage!Your order, movement and combat choices are (very) restricted by the cards.In a nutshell: much more luck than skill involved  :PMaybe it's just me.

												A great implementation of the Memoir '44 boardgame; great tactical wargaming and controls. Lots of fun and a good community of players. Two drawbacks: 1) I'm in two minds about how frustrating the touch move implementation for some actions can be. 2) The pay to play model is a bit limiting and although I'm planning to buy some credits beyond the free allocation some form of monthly stipend or one or two more free maps would be nice.
