												The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.The bad news: you're critically low on supplies.The good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.The bad news: they're all derelict.The good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.The bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.So on the balance, it's mostly bad news.			"

												I want to like this game. The concept and interface are both brilliant. The core gameplay is compelling and tense, but I cannot recommend this game because of how punitive it is.In Duskers there is no such thing as a small risk: whenever you enter a potentially risky room you could find no hostiles, a hostile you can quickly close the door on and back out, or swarmers: hostiles that will destroy your drone within 3 seconds and then hover over the body making it unrecoverable.To minimally build back from such a distaster requires a drone husk (you find these maybe every 5 ships), and 10 scrap (fully exploring your average ship nets you ~5 scrap), but all of your scrap goes to maintenance because your stuff is breaking at a rate roughly equal to how much scrap you get from fully exploring a ship.This game isn't a battle of attrition, its a death lottery. No matter high how you are flying at any moment you are one dice roll away from losing your capacity either gain resources or to explore carefully, cosigning you to a slow withering dealth with no capacity for recovery.

												1. Purpose your drones.2. Isolate rooms when scouting.3. Know  your egress route.4. Stay the hell away from vents.5. Don't ♥♥♥♥ up.6. Don't panic.7. nadvigate all r18. nsvigate all r19. navigate all r110. reset.I'd been waiting for this game since I saw the EA featured on Cool Ghosts. Not dissapointed. Calling it hard is misrepresentation. It's not hard as long as you act deliberatly, know your limits and react well to pressure because it seems nice and slow until something goes wrong. And when things go wrong, they go wrong very quickly. Figuring out how to salvage a bad situation is my favorite part.Get this game if you: - Like deliberate planning- Like atmosphere- Like unconventional controls.- Like puzzlesDon't get this game if you:- Don't like typing- Need strong story elements (they're there, just not cutscenes)- Want graphics- Don't like dying and restarting.Runs well on Surface 4.

												Conceptually, stylistically, and even mechanically, Duskers seems like a unique and fascinating game.  It's tense, original and compelling.  And yet, the more I played, the more the lack of progression and excessive randomness wore away at me, until eventually I gave up frustrated.  Duskers is a sort of ""last man in the universe"" scenario.  Everything - and apparently everyone - is dead and the player is tasked with figuring out just what the heck happened.  This involves exploring various derelict space ships via a squad of remote-controlled  drones.  It's a sort of SpaceChem meets Aliens as the player controls the drones from an overview while identifying and (hopefully) avoiding dangers.  Each drone has three slots that hold upgrade modules that serve as tools to facilitate safe(?) exploration of the ship.  These range from the subtle and strategic Motion Scanner and Lure, to the more directly useful Stealth and Teleport modules.While controlling the drones directly with the cursor keys is necessary, the player can also type in commands from an overhead view of the entire ship.   The need to type in commands is a neat gimmick and really helps the immersion in the game, but it can also be awkward and aggravating, as a single typo could have devastating consequences.   There's no mouse or gamepad input at all.A big part of Duskers is its procedural generation.  The derelict ships vary greatly in size and layout, yet all feel basically the same.  Each ship is essentially just a bunch of boxes.  There are no force fields, elevators or teleporters, no human corpses scattered about or locked away in stasis.  It all feels very dry.  I would have thought the setting would allow for some really unique and varied stuff in each ship, but there's only a handful of elements randomly scattered about.   There are different ship types:  a ""military"" ship might have more defense turrets, and a ""fuel"" depot might have more fuel, but these differences are so subtle I eventually stopped paying attention to what type of ship I was visiting.  Worse, the layout of the ships seems completely illogical at times.  You might explore a tiny ship with an airlock in every room, or a massive ship with only one airlock.  A power outlet might power the rooms right next to it, or those rooms might be powered by another outlet at the far side of the map.  I understand this adds to the ""puzzle"" aspect of the game, as you try to navigate the ship without knowing its layout, but the nonsensical ship designs really hurt my overall immersion.  The risk-vs-reward formula is so random, it's usually better to just explore a few rooms of each ship, then move on.  Exploring a very large ship can be much more dangerous, but probably won't yield more resources than a smaller, safer excursion.  I understand procedural generation is all the rage these days, but Duskers doesn't really benefit from it.  I would have much rather had a large pool of well-designed levels with a clear sense of progression than the infinite number of mediocre levels Duskers seems to be offering up.  The lack of variety affects the enemy types as well.  I found the first three types of enemies within a couple of hours of starting the game, and then after playing for a dozen or so more hours I found... one more.  There's no clear ""late game"" or ""early game"" in Duskers.  You might find the best module for your drones in the very first ship, or you might never find it at all.  Even on the easiest setting, I would often encounter enemies with one-hit-kill attacks right at the start.  Why not have a few, smaller, creepier enemies at the start when the player is just learning, then escalate things to include larger, ship-devouring ""boss"" enemies later on?  Duskers always felt like it was building up to something great, but that ""something great"" never seemed to happen.  Most of my time was spent gathering ""scrap"" (the game's currency), then using that scrap only to maintain the pool of upgrades and drones I already had.   I was hoping I'd eventually unlock the means to craft new upgrades or new types of drones, but that never happened.   Duskers' story plays out through a variety of text logs that are randomly uncovered when visiting the derelict ships.  While intriguing and well-written, I'm not really convinced they provide a satisfactory conclusion to the game's setup.  I never did find all of them, but replaying the game over and over to find the ones I missed didn't seem worthwhile.  There's a part of me that loves Duskers for its unique style and mechanics, but also a part of me that hates it for being such a missed opportunity.   It's a neat idea, but the lack of variety, progression and the nagging feeling that I had ""seen it all"" almost right from the start left me ultimately disappointed.			"

Early Access Review
								Duskers is the most unexpectedly absorbing action-strategy game I've played in a long time. Set aside a couple of hours to learn it, then play it in the dark with headphones. Trust me.Most people hear that Duskers is a game that forces you to type in commands to play it. It's true, but not universally. You have direct movement control over your robot drones with the arrow keys, but to get them to do anything special you'll need to remember a bunch of commands. And you'll need to keep learning new ones as you explore the universe.Anyway. There are two discrete stages to know about in Duskers - the preparation, and the execution. The preparation is all menu-based: you choose the next derelict spaceship on the map to raid (trying to use as little fuel as possible when making each jump), convert salvaged scrap metal into useful stuff, and kit out/repair your drones.The execution is the meat of the game. Here you remote-control your drones through a derelict spaceship to salvage essential fuel, new drones, new upgrades and scrap metal. You have some control beyond the drones too - you can open and close any door on the ship, provided you have a drone with the right skill parked on a nearby generator. If you manage to find ship upgrades, you can also do things like teleport drones around or power bits of the ship without using a drone.Gameplay video:


YouTube™ Video: Duskers gameplay: Salvage & hack spaceships by remote control! [PC alpha game] 

			Views: 1,207		

			Send your droids into derelict spaceships to salvage supplies, but danger lies behind every door in our Duskers gameplay video.		

You move the drones one at a time and type in commands to get them to use their skills, either alone or all at once. If you tell a drone to do something that takes a while to execute (such as gathering every pick-up in a room), you can leave the drone to it while you go and do something else. If you find yourself using the same complicated command over and over, you can programme it into a simple alias command.So why bother automate the drones? Mainly because you don't have all the time in the world. The ship you're boarding will slowly degrade, forcing you to make the most of every second. There will be threats trapped in rooms that may eventually break out. You may even come up with clever strategies for dealing with those threats that require several drones to work together at once. You start with precious little equipment - three droids with (fairly) random skills. To be able to deal with every room of some derelicts, you will need to find new skills to upgrade the droids. So if you're unlucky enough not to start with (say) the interface skill, you won't be able to remote-activate the derelict's weapon system to kill baddies. This randomness does mean some games will be less fair than others, especially near the start. But this is a roguelike, so tough.There are so many emergent things that come out of the way this game is set up, I can't begin to scratch the surface. It really rewards improvisation using the tools you have earned. And it fully immerses you in the experience - from the eerie, quiet background sfx to the way the control system promotes the idea that you're sat on a ship in front of clapped-out, low-tech equipment remote-controlling drones by the seat of your pants in a dangerous universe.Be patient with Duskers - it'll take a while to get into, but it's worth every gritty second.

												Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:A lack of content with no mod support.Duskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. Here's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. --Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. I really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.

												I hate that I can't recommend this game. It's not really that the game is bad at all because it's good. It's quite good actually in making itself out to be a futuristic universe where everything's dead and gone(save the enemies). But perhaps it's too good at that. The game initially feels very forboding and downright terrifying since you've only got a limited number of drones and losing even one can mean game over, but the sense of fear you get fades to frustration as you have no way of knowing how the enemies in the game function unless you die to them over and over again while experimenting, or you google how they work. (looking at you slime)I don't like how fighting enemies works on this game at all. There is a difference between having a threatening enemy that you cannot fight directly and an enemy that will kill you before you have more than a second to react to it being there. The horror of seeing a swarm jump on you is immediately met with frustration because you wonder what you could have done differently upon seeing the swarm and realize that there is literally nothing barring a shield or some other kind of defense that is equipped on the drone. And even then the shield wouldn't help.Let me make an example here so that hopefully you can understand why I'm upset. Lets compare 'finding an enemy' to 'getting infested' in alien swarm. What happens in alien swarm is that you are essentially sentenced to death and there are only a few ways out of it. Number 1 is being healed until the infestation is gone and number 2 is using electric armor. Both methods expend resources making you weaker as a whole, but not outright killing you. In duskers the response to meeting an enemy is the equivilant of instantaneous death. Reaction in Duskers is waaaaaaay to reliant on planning putting you into the position of performing IMMENSE setup with very little reward.In fact I think that is my primary complaint about the game is that I don't feel rewarded at all when I perform the duties expected of me. I am simply like 'alright, one guy down, now to spend another 10 to 15 minutes setting up for the next guy'. This is only made worse by the fact everything in the game breaks and it breaks at ridiculous speeds. I can use a motion sensor in one mission like 3 times and it will barely increment and then I use it once in another and the damn thing is ready to break. How the hell am I expected to progress in the game when I can barely maintain it without performing such tedious tasks tantamount to filing paperwork or examining spreadsheets. Any fun in this game is lost on the random generative manner of the game because it's almost like a puzzle game that is generated randomly and to make up for the random nature the baddies are so incredibly powerful that one ♥♥♥♥ up and yer dead.This game would be a lot better as a non randomly generated experience where puzzles were carefully crafted to test your ability to think and be creative, not request that you spend several hours examining a ship for minimal quanities of scrap materials so you can examine more ships for more scrap materials and hopefully piece together some story that may or may not even be worth it. The mysterious nature of why everyone disappeared isn't really excited when it's presented in text that is literally people going about their day to day god damned business. The little bits and pieces are not worth the effort. The game is so bland when it gets right down to it. There's so few enemy types, ships just blend together after a while and the differences of drone parts and functionality is so minimal. Beyond the great aesthetic there is so little to the game. In the end, the game itself isn't bad at all, but the asking price is WAY WAY TOO MUCH. I do not feel like I got my moneys worth.Also one last complaint, not being able to clear doorways is annoying. Also the game has some annoying bugs like scrap being dropped in between doorways and not being able to be picked up.TL;DR: Game gets stale fast. Not worth 20 bucks. Wait for big sale.			"

In space no one can hear your drone break down. Duskers is a space, strategy rogue-like with a dash of horror thrown into the mix. You find yourself in a universe devoid of life. How the universe has ended up this way is unclear, your goal is to uncover the universes secrets but to do that, you’ll need to survive.From the screenshots, and even from videos, Duskers doesn’t look like much. You’ve got an overview map of the ship which consists almost entirely of straight lines of a handful of colours and then you’ve got a top-down drone view which offers a closer look but still not much in the way of detail. However, what the developers have achieved with this graphic style is an incredible amount of immersion in the game (especially when coupled with the lack of any music in the game, just sound effects). Speaking of sound effects, they’re also very well done. The sound effects aren’t made to be the noises that you’d hear if you were standing next to the drone, they’re made to sound like they’re what the drones’ sensors pick up and send back to you. So, as I mentioned earlier, you have two goals in the game: survive (aka collect resources to keep yourself going) and figure out what the hell is going on in the universe. Both of these objectives require you to explore new ships with your drones. From time to time when you board a ship you’ll find a journal/transmission (which may have been corrupted by varying amounts) which shed some light on what’s happened. The entries don’t have any context so they don’t always make sense but they are pretty interesting to read. Once you’re on-board whichever ship you’ve chosen to explore, you’ll be able to move your drones around the ship and use the modules you’ve equipped them with to help search and collect resources. The main resources are fuel (for moving between ships and star systems) and scrap (for repairing modules and drones) but you may be lucky enough to find new modules, drones and even special modules for your ship. There are quite a few different modules (some of which are essential, you’ll always start with them though) which, when used, will allow you to play around with different strategies for exploring the ship. Among the essential modules are Gather (used to gather fuel or scrap) and Generator (used to power a ship generator, giving you access to more of the ship) while some of the modules may start with or find during a run include Stealth (allows you to make your drone invisible for a short time) and Motion (activates a motion sensor in nearby rooms, making it possible to tell if it’s safe to enter said rooms). Each drone can carry any combination of three modules and there’s no limit to what modules can be carried so if you wanted to have all four of your drones carry a Gather module you could, though that wouldn’t be particularly beneficial.When exploring ships you’re allowed to use four drones, though you can have three backup drones on your ship. For the most part, you’ll be commanding your drones during missions using the game’s simple commands (though there are more advanced commands which can be used for greater efficiency). In fact, it’s possible to play the game entirely using these commands though it can be helpful to individually control the drones with the arrow keys in the top-down drone view sometimes. The commands are really easy to get to grips with and there aren’t too many so they aren’t hard to memorise. The command box can also complete the word for you after you’ve typed in a couple of letters, it’s a pretty simple feature but it does speed things up a fair bit.Exploring derelict space ships is dangerous business mind you. One of your main concerns will be general wear and tear. After a few uses your modules will have an increased chance of breaking and this will continue to increase the more you use it. As I said earlier, modules (and drones) can be repaired but that does require a fair bit of scrap (scrap can also be collected by scrapping spare modules or drones). While wear and tear will be costly, it certainly isn’t dangerous. A universe devoid of life doesn’t necessarily mean a universe devoid of things that go bump in the night. You better watch yourself. Finding all of the resources you need can be a struggle but getting out with all your drones in one piece is the real challenge.The ships themselves are randomised so they come in a few different shapes and sizes. There are also certain types of ships, such as fuel barges and the different types of ships sometimes offer higher chances of finding certain resources, e.g. you’re more likely to find a fair bit of fuel on a fuel barge than any other ship. The size of a ship can range from three or four rooms all the way up to around twenty. The larger a ship is, the more dangerous it is to explore but the more resources you’re likely to find. You can of course leave a ship without exploring the whole thing though. The problem with the ships in the game is that there are only a few different sized rooms so even if the layout of the ship is vastly different it ends up feeling pretty similar to the last ship. This does mean that Duskers can feel a little repetitive, I found that I lost interest after playing two or three missions, but the game is good enough to keep me coming back for more. The other important part of a ship you’re exploring is the positioning/existence of airlocks. Your ship will always dock with a1 (airlock 1) on a ship and sometimes that will be the only airlock that the derelict has, though the usually have more. You can command your ship to reposition to one of the airlocks, this can be useful if most or all of your drones are closer to a different airlock. You can also open airlocks even if they aren’t connected to a ship. This will fill the adjacent room (and any adjacent rooms connected by open doors) with radiation, destroying anything that may be in the room.Just a few more things to wrap up. Each system has a minimum of three or four derelicts and it seems that the number of derelicts increases the further away you are from your starting system. There isn’t a difficulty setting in a traditional sense but there are a few different options you have to make the game easier or harder, such as how quickly modules degrade. You can save (by quitting) at any time but there’s no way to load earlier saves, if you screw up there’s nothing you can do unless you want to start a new game.Verdict Duskers is an incredibly immersive strategy rogue-like that offers unique, challenging gameplay, though it may be held back by the somewhat repetitive ship layouts. If you’re a big fan of space games, rogue-likes or a combination of the two then you’ll probably be happy with a full price purchase (I certainly am), if you’re not then I’d suggest waiting for a discount.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.

												The game is fun and all for a little while, but the content is very much lacking. What at first seems a refreshing change becomes stagnent. The idea is great, the implementation is great, but when it comes to content, it is extremally repetative. Honestly I'm not sure how the creator could expand it, but as it is it is not worth the $20.00 at all, whatsoever. Perhaps $10, or $15 dollars, if you're pushing it. However, if there was going to be more content updates, then it would be totally worth it. But, it doesn't look like that's ever happening, so no. Don't get it. As cool as it is, it's not worth the $20.As a note, after just two hours of playing it began to get boring. Although it is procedurally generated, it doesn't avail to much since it all just feels the same. When you get used to dealing with the four (That's right FOUR) enemies, they are no longer a problem. as such, it's just a boring process that drones (pun intended) on. Actually, I do know what would make it more interesting. If there was a chance to find other survivors, maybe contact them, maybe getting clues or being sent to other locations to find out how to solve this problem, maybe to find a way to get back to civilization that had managed to band together after the... thing... Every roguelike game I've played has an end, though it can be far enough away that you probably won't get there before dying, but there is still a goal. Something to look forward to. It was depressing to just know ""Oh, ok that's what happened... I guess I'll just die now then."" and that's that. Really, so much wasted potential. So many good ideas that I've heard others talk about, with as far as I can tell, silence from the creator. I wish I just knew if there was ever planned to be more content, and if the creator decided ""That's it, I'm done with it"" if he would at least open it up to modders to help expand the amazing idea and base.I just feel like it's still a beta game.

												6/10Scavenge ships for fuel and scrap by strategic use of drones and equipment.Pros:The game is addictive, immersive, and challenging.  Refreshing gameplay experience.  Requires interesting situational decisions, like leaving a drone behind in order to cut your losses or taking risks to salvage a new drone from a ship while it is falling apart. Or it would, at least.  See belowCons:- Feels unfinished.  Game is deceptively shallow.  NO APPARENT END GOAL.- Progression has a hard limit.  You can only have a few drones with a few upgrades.  - Upgrades are too similar in function and none are especially exciting, so after just a couple of games, you get bored with them.- Stuff falls apart so fast.  Drones seem to be held together with cheap off-brand bandages that fall off when they get moist.  When playing this my thought process was ""Hey I found scrap!  I wonder what I can spend it on...oh it's all garbage.  Guess I'll repair my video feed again.""- Only 4 enemies plus a couple hazards (asteroids, radiation).  Boring.- Encountering enemies is too punishing.  Taking a single hit from an enemy can cause 50+ damage to your drone, and require 5+ scrap to repair your drone.  That will very likely take several missions just to find that much scrap.  In most cases, a mission is unprofitable if you take any damage at all.- Some mechanics punish only new players.  For example, never pay to repair a Tow upgrade.  You can just create a new one from scratch for cheaper than the repair cost.  Why is it even an option to repair a Tow?- Feels pointless.  Starts to feel like you only go on these missions in order to fund repairs, which is counterproductive since missions are the reason these drones need repairs.			"

Early Access Review
								There are many ways a game can be immersive. First person games like Mirror's Edge use full-body awareness so you're controlling a body with heft and limbs rather than a disembodied camera. Gone Home, Amnesia, and The Room utilize tactile hands-on gameplay. And then you have games like Her Story and Uplink, where you're not merely controlling a character. You are the character, your computer screen acting as the in-game monitor, a direct window into the game's world.Duskers fits in that latter category and this tactical sci-fi survival roguelike utterly succeeds at delivering an immersive, atmospheric experience,The universe is dead. You are alone. Supplies are dwindling. Welcome to the bleak world of Duskers. As the lone survivor in a galaxy gone silent, you travel from ship to ship, derelict barges and stations and outposts now drifting through space. Fuel and resources diminish with every jump, as you desperately stave off starvation or avoid becoming stranded in the endless abyss.But exploring vessels yourself is too dangerous because, while you may be the last human,...you certainly aren't the last organism. Death lurks everywhere, from alien horrors and active security systems to radiation leaks.So you use the next best option, From your ship's console, you remotely guide drones through the dark rooms and corridors. You view the world through your ship's monitor and the drones' limited, grainy camera feeds, sensors and cameras that can fail or make errors. They act as your eyes, ears, and hands from the safety of your ship. And you don't guide these drones through icons or RTS-style controls, but by typing in command lines.While it may sound archaic and clunky, the command line interface is part of what makes Duskers so brilliant and immersive. Every command must be planned and carefully considered, because if something goes wrong - and it will - you must adapt and improvise on the fly. It gives the game a deliberate, cautious pace, as you command your fragile drones to maneuver between rooms, use motion detectors, gather supplies, power generators, and so on. When you're hurriedly typing in commands as radiation is spreading through an outpost and power is failing and the creatures you had trapped in a room are breaking free, Duskers is at its most tense, thanks to that careful pacing and detached perspective.But Duskers is also a tactical experience. Scavenged gear can be used to modify drones with lures, cloaking, motion detectors, even the rare weapon, but the best tools are the vessels themselves. You can trap aliens in a room then activate a vessel's on-board defense system, or open an airlock to suck a roaming turret into space. Caution and planning ahead are how you keep your drones intact.Duskers mixes moments of unease and fear of the unknown with satisfying strategy and on-the-fly improvisation. Similar to Her Story or Uplink, the command console interface results in an immersive intimate experience. You are the last human, controlling your drones, from your computer.			"

								*** EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: ***I've played Duskers long enough to get a good feel for it and I have to say, sadly, I'm not impressed. Don't get me wrong: I genuinely _want_ to like Duskers with its fun concept of piloting your vulnerable tools around derelict spacecraft from the relative safety of your control station but it doesn't feel as though there's much reason to go looking for fuel, scrap, (possible) drones to either salvage or steal parts from, or upgrades because the chances of actually finding something useful are slim to nil - More on that in a bit. Ironically, you're required to explore in order to continue surviving so it's a catch 22.Duskers is, at its core, a roguelike set in space with cool 80s-looking computer graphics which in and of itself is worth a lot in my book because not only does it look neat, it doesn't get boring because it works very well with the concept. The 'drone vision' with its primitive interpretation of the environment through sensors and crappy audio from drone mics are a nice touch. You genuinely feel like you're piloting a small fleet of drones. You can either manually drive the drones around (something you'll find yourself doing a lot) or the game gives you a command interface similar to a Linux/Dos/Windows cmd prompt where you 'program' your drone to move and perform tasks; essentially queueing-up tasks for it. The command interpreter, for lack of better name, is a bit dodgy though which can sometimes result in commands you queue appear to look correct (at least according to the game's limited in-game help) but actually not work correctly, or at all. This can result in not executing at best, unexpected behaviour or worse: catastrophic mistakes being made. You're actually better off manually piloting the drones for the really tricky stuff. I'd like to see the command interpreter be a bit more refined so you're not left second-guessing just prior to hitting Enter and re-reviewing the command sequence for the fifth time.Another problem I noticed with Duskers after the initial 'coolness' factor wore off, was much of the gameplay relied on dumb luck, not skill. For example, the tools one would use to determine if going in an adjacent room is a wise idea (motion scanner, sensor, etc.) are not only unreliable but you're not even guaranteed to get any of these useful tools to 'look ahead' which means you'll be sending your vulnerable drones head-long into the unknown - As a player, where are my tools to help me choose if this is a wise idea? You're essentially left guessing. This, in turn, not only exposes the rest of your drones to danger, but is almost a guarantee you'll be one less drone going home and making next mission even more difficult due to missing tools (which are scarce as is). Should you lose all of your drones (which can happen in a single mission!!) you're done- Game over. Time to Reset. During a play session of about two hours I reset the game 16 times because of various reasons in which I simply could not continue the game. Either my drones would be trapped in a space station, I would run out of precious fuel (even after jumping because let's face it: The fuel dispensers aren't guaranteed to give you anything) or I would lose all of my drones by sheer dumb luck (bulkheads blowing open and pulling my drones into space, doors not sealing so my helpless drones were either mowed down by some enemy, irradiated or pulled into space). The game does it's best to warn you about these types of events (mostly) but that doesn't mean you can use your skills to avoid it for every situation. The most you can do is try to get out of the craft with your drones or jump to another galaxy in hopes you'll find more fuel to carry on. Also, you're not even guaranteed to find any scrap to keep your drones in moderate working order or repair your ship or their upgrades. The readout of the craft you're going to be boarding has a 'Scrap Capacity' number which, in my experience, has been nowhere near what I've actually recovered from any of the places I've visited. Most of the time I usually find somewhere between zero and five scrap which usually I'd store for after the next mission in hopes I'd be able to repair my drones to a decent health if they made it back. This is assuming they didn't take additional damage.The enemy types in Duskers aren't vast but they do serve their purpose. You basically have to try your hardest to slip past them (manual control) whilst giving the more menial tasks to the command queues (keeping fingers crossed you don't have to intervene whilst performing a crucial sneak which hopefully won't result in you being detected). Your options are either avoid, attempt to outrun or go on the offense against them. For two of the three entities these options work but there is a third type that is so damn fast it makes me jump every time my drone is attacked by one. This one appears to 'leap' on your drone, if it's detected (and it usually is), and is an insta-kill. But again you'd not know if this type was in the room until you happened upon it. I've tried killing this type before: Blowing it up with a mine, shooting it with a turret, blowing it out into space by opening an airlock – No joy. They are invulnerable. Worse yet, there can (and have been for me) been multiple of them on 1 ship so you're pretty locked down and may as well just pack up and leave if you can.Duskers has an interesting back story that I'm really keen on finding more about. The story is pieced together throughout your various plays (hint: You'll restart the game a lot) and the story is cumulative so you've at least got that going for you. As of this writing it wasn't complete but from what I'm gathering it's shaping up to reveal what happened to, well, everyone, as the game developer's promised.Bottom line- Here is some suggestions for the developers:* Rougelikes punish the player for dumb choices BUT the player still has control to make these choices. Duskers doesn't give you any of the tools necessary to approach each (or hardly any) situation without blindly guessing if you're going to make the correct move and prosper. Best case is you'll enter an empty room but that's of no value, generally. Success through repetitive play isn't fun if you keep running out of options 'just because'.* Drones are basically thrown into the jungle without even so much as a butter knife: They need weapons, even cheap ones that don't last long. As a player I would love to be able to get access to at least 1 weapon for one of my drones that will have an effect.* Enemies need to do more than just sit and wait. Often times I've entered a room and there would be something just sitting there in wait, dead-centre of the room. They might do with a bit of patrolling around the room they're confined to.* More scrap. Since the drones are mobile punching bags, it would be fair to throw in a decent amount of scrap from time to time to give the player the option to repair. Again, if the player cannot continue because their drones are falling apart and they've not had adequate scrap: How is that their fault? They didn’t choose to not repair.Duskers is a fun game, but has potential to be something truly unique and great. I look forward to the future updates. I'm going to suggest people save their £15 but should things change in future updates I'd be more than happy to recommend this game. "

Early Access Review
								Imagine you’re the only human alive in the entire universe and you’re stuck inside a spaceship, how do you survive? You get your hands on little drone fellas and you send them to derelict spaceships in search of resources vital to your survival. Welcome to Duskers.The visuals are pretty basic but do an amazing job in conveying information to the player. Still, I’m a huge fan of how the map looks, it reminds me a lot of old sci-fi stuff and it looks like something that came out from the Warhammer 40k universe. Duskers is an excellent example of how graphical fidelity isn’t a necessary condition for a game to be not only immersive but truly wonderful. The premisse of the game is pretty simple, board abandoned spaceships with up to 4 drones and try to get as many resources as you can, preferably without loosing any drones.You can visit different systems on the galaxy map, and inside each system you can travel to nearby derelicts and then board them. As you play the game, you’ll be able to equip your drones with different modules which grant them special abilities, and you’ll also be able to upgrade said modules, as well as upgrade your mothership. These modules can be things like motion sensors, for detecting enemies in nearby rooms, or generators, which can power sections of the old ships.The thing that really makes Duskers brilliant is its atmosphere and how involved you can get while playing. You control your drones via remote control or by typing commands on your console from your secure, albeit decaying, mothership. This allows for quite some claustrophobic scenes, if you can call it that, because when controlling the drones remotely the camera is really close to the drone. The way I see it, the game becomes more tense and a lot more fun when playing in the schematic view. Here you can see pretty much the entirety of the vessel you’re currently at, and it’s best to use when issuing commands via the console. It is the fact that you’re actually typing those commands on your keyboard that make the game so atmospheric and immersive. It is the perfect way to recreate this scenario, it is as if you were actually this lone survivor struggling to survive, if that makes sense.At first I thought it would be somewhat confusing, being able to control the drones both ways at the same time but it is actually not. In order to move throughout the ships you must open doors and sometimes power them with generators carried by your drones. Each door is identified by a code, like d1, d2, d3, and so on. In order to open or close a door you simply type that code in the console. Simple right? The thing is, you have to be careful and slowly scan the ship in order to see if there are any monsters or defenses lurking. If you find a turret, you can disable it by interacting with an interface, which requires a drone equipped for this purpose. In order to get yourself rid of enemies, you can lure them to other rooms and then close the doors behind them, allowing you to explore the room they were originally in, or if you can also open airlocks or activate the ship defense system.Don’t let the looks deceive you. Duskers its truly an amazing and unique game unlike anything I have ever played. It is tense, tactical, atmospheric, it requires careful planning and thinking, and most important, it is a lot of fun. I’m looking forward to see how this one develops! "

												I love the concept of this game, it produces a great atmosphere and some interesting puzzles.  Ultimately though the over-reliance on the RNG just kills it.  You explore endless samey ships and stations, many of which present problems that aren't solvable with your current loadout (which sounds like a nice way to encourage re-visits with new loadouts, but due to limited resources you probably won't), trying to piece together a story before you die.  Then a random event happens and you lose all your drones and have to start over.  I feel the game needs to be more puzzle based with more interaction with the derelicts (interface shouldn't be an optional module, for instance) and something has to be done to break up the monotony of the early game, as you'll see it so much!

Early Access Review
								game is super fun already in Early Access. I think the game play is already there. They are just adding some extra story sound and content and tweaking things based on feedback from Early Access.Buy Duskers If:- you like epic wins...er...I mean epic escapes.- you like strong penalties for death (rouge-like).- you like thinking for your supper.- strategy is your bread and butter.DONT buy Early Access if:- you don't like sharing input with developers.- you mind an occasional bug (though honestly they are few and far between here).

												I really want to recommend this game, but I just can't due to the bugs. This game has a lot of really obvious bugs and a few really game-breaking bugs. It doesn't feel finished. However, if the bugs were to be fixed, I would say you should buy it on the spot.First, the positives. I feel like the game is perfectly balanced. This game is a puzzle strategy rogue-like horror space game - basically, all the best genres. Every mission, and even your actions between missions, feel like an optimization puzzle - trying to make the best of whatever situation you're in with some time to think. However, there are also random catastrophes that can happen over time, making it a strategy game since you have to avoid risks and rush to opportunities. I feel there is a good balance of slow- and fast-paced gameplay - one moment you will be doing nothing but contemplating your next move, and then suddenly asteroids will be sighted or the ship hull will begin to fail, and you have to rush to get out of the way. There's also the potential for your own human mistakes turning a great situation into a bad one very quickly - the enemies in this game are very deadly and are best avoided. Typos are deadly.The main premise of the game is to travel from derelict to derelict gathering fuel and scrap (and completing story objectives). You have to plan out your routes between derelicts, and then before entering a derelict you have to make sure you have everything set up the way you want - it's like the caves from Pikmin 2 where you pick the pikmin you want, and once you've gone in, that's it - you can only swap what you already have and use whatever you find.The art style and sound design are also fascinating and really put you into the mood. You can't see directly - instead you have to rely on a grainy generated top-down image constructed from what little capabilities are left in the various spare sensors you were able to attach to your drones, because the only cameras you have left aren't sensitive enough to work in the dark. Your character controlling the drones is never in the action, instead concealed safely at the console, looking at the screens showing the layout of the derelict and the constructed drone perspectives. FOV is limited, and tank controls make movement feel less direct. All good contributing factors to an eerie atmosphere. You type a command, it executes, and just as you realize you fat-fingered the door numbers, you are under attack. You panic. You're able to close everything down and contain the damage. It's now a rescue mission...You are constantly in a struggle for scrap - things are always deteriorating and need to be repaired or they will break. You can convert things to scrap if you don't need them, but if you let something break, it is worth less scrap. As you go through the game you will find more modules (abilities) that you can equip, and certain combinations are very powerful, but even when you have these powerful combinations, the game still has its ways to throw a wrench in the works and force you to think on your toes. I never felt like I was too powerful or too weak (except for when I forgot to equip an essential module, oops).There is also a great amount of variety - the game has ways to screw up your master plan and force you to get creative with your workarounds. I've experienced and seen some pretty interesting missions. Modules you normally think of as useless could be the key to saving your drones. You'll often have to swap modules between drones in dire situations.If you're new to the game, you will make lots of mistakes. It takes time to see the puzzle logic and develop strategies with which to make your way through the game. If you don't like the initial rough learning phase, I'd recommend watching other people play first - but the initial rough learning phase is by no means bad. The game does have a tutorial and by default hints are enabled to help you learn your way around. I feel the game does a good enough job getting you started that you can learn the rest of the game on your own. There is minor documentation on modules, but for the most part, you need to experiment to understand how they work. Same goes for the enemies.Overall, the gameplay is excellent! ...when it works as intended. There are a plethora of bugs in the game - some benign, and some downright game breaking.- there is a really, really bad bug that can cause random items to be deleted when you load a save or use a warp gate - this can totally ruin your experience and make you not want to play anymore, and is the primary reason for my negative review (see this forum thread)- in one of my attempts at the weekly challenge, the warp gate needed to end the challenge was corrupted and turned into a corrupt derelict which, when I tried to use it, softlocked my game and made it impossible to end the challenge (video proof)- the daily challenges, which are supposed to be identical for everyone, aren't actually identical - terminals may have different commands and transporter signals are random from person to person, as well as asteroids having different effects and hull integrity failures being different. (for proof just watch various daily challenge videos of the same challenge from different players)- the game sometimes lies about the number of infestation types on a ship, typically due to corruption. This is not an intended feature, and can ruin strategies and plans. (video example)- you can't teleport into a room that has been exposed to space even though you can go into it normally- when you teleport sensors from where they're first placed, they can leave a ghost behind- sometimes weird menu screens come up (video example) and random graphics settings are changed without showing as changed- graphics settings reset when you enter a challenge (for proof just try it yourself)- small ships that the game says has multiple infestation types can instead only spawn with one/less (which benefits you, but is still a bug)- enemies can sometimes bug out and remain frozen in place permanently, leading to confusion (video example)- the gather command can stop working forcing you to use the pickup alias instead (video example)- some typos are still in the game, e.g. when a sensor is untriggered it says ""Sensor untriggeredr1"", missing a colon and a space before the room number, whereas the corresponding message for when it is triggered is just fine- the dev has been quoted saying that fuel depots are supposed to have more than one fuel access, but they don't (less of a bug and more of a missing feature, but still - this game doesn't feel complete)- occasional graphical glitches and oddities that make the game feel like it's corrupting in front of you- drones will still try to gather from destroyed fuel accesses, and when they do, it breaks the game in odd ways until a drone gathers from a normal fuel access.This game still needs a LOT of work. In my opinion the balancing is fine, but the bugs need desperate attention. Read the patch notes and decide for yourself if it's worth it in its current state. Again, if the bugs get mostly fixed, I will definitely change my review to recommend this game.Also, despite being a 2D game with minimalist graphics and minor parallax, it is actually quite demanding to your GPU. I've noticed this with other games that use the same engine, so I think the game isn't entirely to blame for a sluggish engine, but it would be nice to see some optimizations after the bugs are all fixed.

If anybody can hear me, please respond.I am a sole survivor of the liberty, a long range scout ship on a mission to discover the cause of a spacial anomaly on the edge of this system. My crew is missing and had to re-purpose some drones to make repairs.Everything that could go wrong has, I have limited fuel, limited resources and have had to resort to explore this sector to look for supplies.Things turned from bad to worse when I realized that every ship and base I have discovered has turned up empty. No life, nobody.  Nothing except some extra scrap and some upgrades I used to further my search.I'm starting to hear noises now on certain ships that I have been avoiding like the plague.Please if you can hear me, i'm low on fuel and I don't know if I can make it out of this star system without help.  I’m encoding my flight plan in this transmission and I have set it to repeat. If you receive it, meet me at the edge of this system and maybe we can find a way out of here, thank you and good luck. Aliens Meets TeleglitchThis game has a mix of panic when entering a room I shouldn't have with the need to type commands to get my limited team of drones out before they all die makes this a very unique and interesting concept for a game. Its also very rewarding when you get the right combination of upgrades and drones to survive for longer periods of time. Due to the games uniqueness, it has a bit of a learning curve though as not all the information to play the game is readily available and I have had the need to watch a few videos and read many of the help sections that are part of the game.The premise is that you are one man on a ship with three drones exploring a galaxy of dead ships and stations trying to find the answers to what happened. Every time you dock, you wonder if this one will be your last, since a single mistake can cost you the loss of your extended arms, ears and eyes.This game requires a lot of thinking and planning before you make any moves. If you are a survival buff I think you will like this, if you hate overcoming steep obstacles you might hate it. Before I bought this game I looked at the negative reviews and saw the complaints about it being to hard and knew right away that I would like it. Im a big fan of survival games like Dayz and Arma so it works for me.After watching the developer's twitch streams I realized I also like the developer's attention to detail and his response to the community on making this a good game. The Good:Interesting Concept.Unique interface.Challenging.EngrossingEngagingSlow Paced and TacticalYou will die a lot (if you like that, think if dying as a learning experience) The Bad:Some BugsNeeds some polish with understanding the game mechanicsMore atmosphere and sound cues are needed to invoke the feeling of isolation and dread.Game mechanics are a bit hard to understand given the uniqueness of the game. ConclusionSome how the topdown approach to this game has a way of not making me feel like my life is on the line.. I think it might have been better to do a 3d approach instead where you are seeing things though the camera in a 3d perspective IMHO. But its not a deal breaker for me.I'm 12 hours in and maybe this is a slow paced game as much as story goes so I don't know yet if it needs more journal entries to move the story. It would be nice if there was audio logs to add to the atmosphere.  I mean I like the concept of reading them yourself as well. I guess that I am used to hearing audio logs in other games which always seems to add to the horror for me. I think then there should be some more hints or sound cues to hint at what is happening, to improve atmosphere of the game.I like the game so far it has a lot of replay value as it takes many replays to get the gist of the game. With limited resources, finding the necessary upgrades, and fuel makes it fun and challenging.8/10. Good work on making a game that stands out.P.S.I launched Fallout 4: Far Harbor on one display but have yet to start playing because  I am reading, writing, and thinking about playing this game instead, and I guess that is a good sign. Its almost like I want to savor the experience?			"

												This game is quite an achievement in terms of how much immersion can be packed into a mere 72mbs.  This little rogue-like gem has mystery, strategy, thrills and a smooth progression that keeps you coming back for another run.If you're looking for some comparison, it's like FTL married with the Alien franchise.

												I survived 200 days on my first try, and it is still my record. I don't know how this fares against other scores, but around this mark, things started going downhill for me very quickly. Most ships I explored by this point were falling apart and contained four enemy types, one of which melts your♥♥♥♥♥♥ coming through the walls without you even noticing that it's there and there is not much you can really do to track or eliminate it (my favourite...). All it takes is for your generator drone to die from one of these stealth attacks and if you haven't got a spare or a remote power upgrade wired in to your ship, the entire mission is quickly borked. All you can really do then is watch your bots slowly sizzle in irradiated rooms, get chewed by bugs or get sucked out of that failed airlock that is suddenly venting everything to space because your genny died and you can't close any doors.SNAFUs happen all the time. There are times that YOU will be the cause of them. I once typed in the wrong door number by accident and ejected my two most favourite drones out of an airlock. The early stages of the game are fantastic; as you wander around, getting used to the awkward controls that are the text console, and learning about what makes the monsters tick, strategising and working around problems that you face when one of your key drones gets bumped off and you're left to do without some crucial gear.Depending on who you are, these hardships might make your game more interesting and enjoyable, or, just rage quit. Certainly for me in my first run through, I found the challenges refreshing. The possibility of losing everything without the safety of a 'do-over' was impossible to ignore and forced me to weigh options carefully, bailing when I didn't want to, but as a necessity. I've had a few times where I've had to say, ""f**k no"" within just a few minutes of a boarding. There is no hand-holding, and I like that.HOWEVER... I'm now at the point where it's not that compelling to play. The large ships with hundreds of empty tiny rooms that you have to meticulously go through using sensors and lures or whatever you happen to have in lieu of a stealth fitted scout, just becomes a chore (even with a decent scout it gets tiring). Like many reviewers, I've found that the procedural generation and RNG lets the game down in some ways. Ships, stations, whatever, all feel like the same thing. There doesn't feel like there is any difference beyond the various ship/station types and classes apart from size. Outposts offer some new challenges (as you lack the ability to dock), but it's just more of the same. Risks and hazard levels can be the same for everything. So can the rewards. You could go to a big station and find nothing, and conversely find a good haul on a ship with only 6 rooms, which you can easily clear in under 10 minutes.The story progression is interesting and compelling. There is no linear way for it to play out, you just collect random text logs from various boarding ventures that the ship computer uses to assemble various theories, from which it then formulates certain objectives you can pursue, with a view to finding new information. It's a compelling mystery that keeps you wanting to find out more, but you have to be patient, because the RNG might grate on you to the point where it becomes an afterthought, and that is not a good thing.So there it is. Some negative some positive. Because I enjoyed this so much in my initial playthrough, had fun with the challenges and problem solving, and because I think the concept is fresh and fun, I'm giving it a thumbs up.I'm not a reviewer, I don't really bother, but I wanted to leave some feedback and a recommendation because I think the dev is on to something, and they deserve some praise for their efforts, which I hope to see gaining some additional features and complexity in the future.

Early Access Review
								I been playing Duskers since beta and it gets better with each update.It’s a space adventure with rogue like elements which has you as the lone survivor of a cataclysmic event that wiped out humanity.You control salvage bots & search abandoned and derelict space craft seeking out clues to what's happened and scavenging whatever supplies you can find to allow you continue your mission.Control of the bots is via a command window and console commands. You can even 'program' your bots to some extent with chained commands which they will carry out in sequence. (Im not sure if you can set conditional commands?) This control method and the low-fi game style adds to the tension as it can be hard to type accurately when running away from a 20 odd ██████ ████ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There are many ways to die, defence █████, radiation leaks, defence ██████, swarms of █████,  a deadly organic ███ & running out of fuel seem to be my most common methods for rapid robot disassembly.Its *very* atmospheric and easy to get absorbed by this game, just turn up the volume, dim the lights and get spaced.Duskers is a great game to dip in a out of,you can play a conituing story, a daily challenge (one ship) or a weekly challenge (1 galaxy) with the challenge modes having online score board so you can see bad you're doing compaired to everyone else!If you like something a bit challenging, loved the motion sensor thing in Alien, work well under pressure and you're a bit of a fan of space sims and exploration then this should be in your library.

												Duskers has the most satisfying core gameplay loop of any game I've played this year (with the small exception of The Swindle). It's one-part survival horror, one-part puzzle, one-part luck, and 17,000 fiddly bits of tactical risk-balancing and nerve-wracking situations that develop organically and put your ingenuity to the test. It's sometimes unforgiving, and progress feels like it's eked out every step of the way, but that's part of what makes your occasional hard-won victory feel so meaningful.... until your next misstep sucks three drones out of an airlock and you ragequit, but you keep coming back anyway because  the next time you'll do better. It's that sort of game.			"

												I liked the core gameplay on offer in Duskers. Unfortunately it feels very repetitive- the range of drone and ship upgrades is pretty narrow and there's very little player agency in what you have. Furthermore, it seems to have a roguelike approach to saving and loading, but then takes many hours of effort to get anywhere, so if you open a door in a bad way one time, you can lose like 10 hours of gameplay. Furthermore, it's very difficult to figure out what you're actually supposed to do in the long term.Contrast this with FTL, which has a much bigger variety of weapons/ships/upgrades on offer, much more player choice, and it's a roguelike but one playthrough takes only a couple hours so there's not that much lost each time. And it's pretty clear what the overarching objective is.It has an interesting core concept, but I think that the execution is fairly poor.			"

Early Access Review
								Duskers is a breath of fresh air in a stale marketplace of copies and clones of genre games. Whether that's the reskinned and retooled horror games we get. Or the sandbox, survival, mmo's that have taken the Steam market place hostage.A procedurally generated universe in lo-fi computer terminal graphics is your sandbox. An army of computerized drones are at your command. Being the last surviving member of a spaceship, you must wield the tools available to you and search nearby destroyed ships for fuel, parts, and upgrades to survive.Duskers does a good job of setting you up for success. The Drone tutorial at the beginning does a great job of explaining the basics of the console and most of the common commands you'll be using. The console also does a good job of auto-filling in your commands, which helps if you're in a tight spot and need to quickly go stealth.Through the use of the console and the visual tactical view of the vessel you have boarded, your goal is to collect resources by going from room to room and gathering scraps of metal, destroyed drones, and precious fuel cells. Drones you find may have upgrades and parts you can take for your current set of drones or they can be salvageable all together and after a bit of repair can join your ranks.Each drone is unique and can be upgraded through a modifications page. There you will also maintain repairs, ammo, charges to different abilities (like the motion sensor) and salvage any extra parts you may have. The salvage gives you 'scraps' which are used in this maintenance.The gameplay is great with a combination of exploration, puzzle solving, and ingenuity you will clear out the ship of any threats and hopefully gather enough resources to survive another day. The puzzle solving changes with every drone loadout and every ship. Depending on what your drones have equipped changes the approach you can take to navigate around enemies, get to a room to power a generator, and clear the map without any casualties.You can manually control each of your drones or using the console give them commands to move to different locations (it actually feels a bit like chess). Upon boarding a ship you first need to take inventory of what you have, if you have the motion sensor use it to check nearby rooms for life before entering. If you don't you may have to think out of the box a little bit. Try using stealth and sneaking into the room to see, if there's an enemy you may need to lure it away to another room and lock it in. Or using the interface upgrade hack into the ship's computers and turn on the defenses and let the ship do the work.After clearing out a ship you must gather all your drones into an airlock and board back onto your ship. Anything left behind is left there, unless you return. From your mothership you have access to other objectives, drone upgrades, and a map. The map shows which Star System you are in and expands from there. From the system to the galaxy and to the universe, there seems to be plenty of broken ♥♥♥ ships out there.I really didn't find anything about Duskers to complain about, maybe some music? However, that lack of music is rather fitting, you are commanding drones on an empty derelict spaceship, so how much music would there really be.Developer/Publisher 'Misfits Attic' took a step back and went back to the basics. Not in gameplay, but in design. Duskers is the ideal minimalists game on the surface. Much like the MUDs of my childhood, it utilizes a very intuitive and engaging style of gameplay. It's a game that gives you full control and any failure is your own.

Product received for free
Space InvestigatorEarlier this month, I played a horror title called Layers of Fear. For those that are unfamiliar with LoF, a very crude description for it could be provided as ""doors, doors, and way more doors."" Duskers, much like its terrifying brother-in-arms, also employs the use of doors as a method of conjuring up dreadful tension. It's a very effective way to incorporate fear of the unknown, and all game developers know that horror junkies just can't shy away from an unopened door. Something so unassuming and innocent will most likely be the cause of your demise. Curiosity just had to get the best of you, but to be fair, opening doors is what Duskers is all about. Actually, opening doors and surviving what's behind them is what Duskers is all about.In this sci-fi rogue-lite strategy game, Duskers tasks you to pilot drones through derelict space crafts in an effort to uncover how the universe became a giant graveyard, while fetching necessities for survival along the way. The story is fed to the player in bits and pieces through data logs from these Derelicts, and although it is the primary motivation for progression (logs/objectives are retainable upon death), the story is somewhat of a backseat experience in comparison to the shining gameplay. The logs are categorized by theories, and delving into these theories by following the objectives and investigation targets slowly, but surely, reveal information on what ultimately caused the devastation of the universe. Some of these logs don't actually clue you in on anything either, but help build the unknown world with remnants of the ghostly past. Daily routine logs, chat logs, and post-mortem logs are only some of what you will find, and they all help paint an eerie picture of the dark and horrific present.Drones Are a Man's Best FriendThese cute little robo-buddies, each with very disarming nicknames, will be sent to board the Derelicts throughout the entire length of the game. You, the player, are seemingly the only surviving human, so naturally, all non-GUI interactions will be performed through these drones for the sake of safety. Equipped with mostly random abilities, each drone will generally have one to three specific functions in its performing capacity, such as: gathering, powering generators, towing objects, utilizing interfaces, etc. How well the player safeguards these drones often foretell how successful the expedition will be. Many creatures of various infestation types lurk behind the Derelicts' doors, and the premise of Duskers' strategy involves around finding a way to lure, herd, kill, or bypass these creatures in order to get what you can and leave.The drones and Derelict exploration will be controlled through console/command programming, although it is possible to also manually control the drones. Utilizing your own ""aliases"" (self-made scripts) can make life a lot easier by combining a lot of common commands into a single, customized command. For the programming-challenged audience members out there, worry not, as there are really only a handful of commands that you have to use, and if you forget anything, quick reference information can be pulled up at any time. Duskers also uses an autocomplete system, similar to your favorite search engine or texting program, so the actual typing is relatively minimal enough that any inconvenience by it is pretty negligible.One of the most common items the drones will be gathering are scraps. In this world, scrap is king, and this utility/currency will be required to upgrade, repair, create, trade, etc. With fairly minimal scrap found in each Derelict, sticking to only one style of strategy will end up putting you in a major pinch at some point. Lures will run out, stealth will lose efficiency, motion tracking will degrade and you will not have enough scrap to repair what you want; not to mention that it can be quite common to have to ditch your favorite drone in order to save the rest. Every now and then, decommissioned drones/ship upgrades can be found in a Derelict and towed back for use in future endeavors, helping ease this burden. This harsh reality of reducing scrap loot forces players to adapt, and keeps the gameplay intense, and tension high.Other than scraps, you will also be hunting down fuel. There are two main types of fuel, P-Fuel and J-Fuel. P-Fuel is used to travel inside a system, from Derelict to Derelict whereas J-Fuel is used to jump to a different system altogether. Every time you enter a new system, the P-Fuel in your main tank will replenish. Traveling outside systems to other points in the universe will require reaching a Stargate. Creative Incorporation of HorrorMasterful use of sounds, console messages, and video feeds create a very real and tense layer of fear, blanketing every thought and action you will have during each boarding procedure. Light moans of the metallic hull, warnings of a door under attack, and radiation causing static feedback are some of the things you must overcome to get what you need. Furthermore, nothing is more mentally jarring than accidentally opening an adjacent or connected airlock and watching the heart-dropping consequences thrust upon your drones in real time...Video Gameplay

 VerdictI did happen to find the early game rather pointless, objective-wise, since I noticed that all logs are gathered upon boarding, rather than upon departure. If I ever got to a point where I needed to reset, I made sure to save one drone alive, that way I could just go on a huge Derelict hopping-spree and gather up tons of logs before my J-Fuel ran out. Eventually, new objectives that forced more direct means of involvement prevent this, but it never made me feel any better about spending so much time on the early objectives. I would have preferred it if the logs were scattered throughout the Derelicts, that way I would have had a reason to actually care about getting into those final and difficult to reach rooms.The mid/endgame objectives come with a rather large spike in difficulty, and this was the point where everything started to get extremely fun. As opposed to aimlessly searching Derelicts, you will now be asked to perform some challenging tasks requiring a lot of fancy thinking. One requires you to board a Quarantined Derelict and lure a live biological creature back to your ship, and another wants you to exterminate and commandeer a specific vessel without powering anything on (no electricity means extremely minimal options). Excluding these types of objectives, the Derelicts will also be much more difficult to explore. Some require Transporters in order to teleport drones from one room to another, while others are infested with some truly erratically moving monsters. At certain points during these expeditions, I swear that my fastest typing speed doubled in words per minute.Misfits Attic managed to successfully utilize rogue-lite strategy and horror elements to create some very interesting gameplay mechanics. Add in a programming aspect and the niche genres mutually reinforce each other to create one of the most unique and addicting experiences on the market. Thus, I am able to easily recommend Duskers to all fans of rogue-lite strategy, programming, or horror games. Duskers’ proficiency in each genre allows it to satisfy those that may only be interested in one aspect, but not another.

												This game is really good. There is such a great amount of strategy involved, and the 'cool' factor is off the charts. There is an amount of desperation akin to This War of Mine and FTL (when♥♥♥♥♥♥is going bad), and the roguelike elements are unpredictable. Definitely recommend. Huge kudos to the developers for making a game that is pretty cutting edge.			"

Early Access Review
								Alpha Review: Even in alpha this game is pretty amazing. I think the creators have done a great job of capturing the feeling and mood of a darkened universe. I got pretty attached to my drones (which I thought was fair enough since they are the ones out there risking their bolts to collect the fuel I need to keep moving, and keep exploring.I thought the different available upgrades for the drones and ship were well thought out and well implemented, and I enjoyed collecting different items for the many different encounters you have.The drone view looks amazing and really ads to the style of game, while functional it is well rounded out with the over view map for the area as well.The game felt easy to understand and get into but remained challenging even after learning all the commands needed to control your drones and environment.As it is still in Alpha there are some things that need to be ironed out but nothing that really detracted from the overall enjoyment I had/ am having with the game, plus as it is still under development I can see it only getting better over time. I'd really recommend this game, and am enjoying playing and watching as it develops.			"

Early Access Review
								Well now, here's an interesting game. It's a strategy/management/puzzle game wrapped in a bit of roguelike with a fantastic coat of low-fi sci-fi. Other reviewers have done a far better job explaining the game, and really it's exactly what it says it is. And don't be afraid of the console/command line, it definitely kept me from jumping in immediately. While it may seem a bit gimicky, once you start playing with it you realize how much it adds to the overall ambience of the game, fitting in deftly with the theme. It's so easy to use that you'll find yourself popping off commands easily, and direct control makes you feel the claustrophobia and emptiness of the derelicts you'll be scavenging for supplies and information. I like new ideas, and I love developers who take long shots. This game has some pretty interesting mechanics, and so far has all the trimmings to become something really special. While the price point might deter some, those who do jump in are in for a treat. Can't say I've ever played anything quite like Duskers, I just hope that Misfits Attic give us enough tools and variety to make it endlessly replayable. I do think that the gameplay alone makes for an itch only Duskers can scratch.			"

												Duskers is a n example of what hacking games should be... and it's not even really a hacking game.In Duskers, you give commands to remote drones via a console as they helpfully explore derelict ships to replenish your ever-dwindling supplies. As you type commands for them to execute, you must navigate them past decompressing sections of ships, hostile alien creatures, and radiation. Careful planning and a little luck are your tools as you strip the abandoned ships as bare as you can before moving to the next one.Now, the obvious relation to a hacking game is that you give your drones all their commands by typing them into a command console, but this isn't what I'm referring to. The thing that makes Duskers such a good blend of tactics and strategy is that it brings a finite set of rules and challenges to the table that can mix to form a wide variety of scenarios. You quickly find that gathering intel before moving forward is a great help, and that there are multiple approaches to almost any situation. Every move is risky, but you reduce that risk by stopping and looking, listening, and scanning, first.For example, your motion detectors pick up movement in a room next to your drones. After you watch it for a while, you think you know what kind of threat it is. You can open the airlock and flush it into space, but that may damage the structural integrity of the ship you're scavenging. There's a door on the far side of the room; perhaps you can open that and the alien will wander away from the room you want to enter. There's also a turret in the room, waiting for you to find a control console somewhere else to activate it.This game makes you take methodical approaches to different situations, letting you come up with strategies you've worked out after gathering as much information as you can. Perhaps your plans will turn out sound, and perhaps not. Either way, you gain experience not only in the game's mechanics, but also in critical thinking and situational awareness.If you like strategy, tactics, or feel that other hacking games you've played are too ""on rails"", pick this game up. You'll be glad you did.			"

												Does exploring derelict spacecraft with remote drones piloted via the command line sound fun to you? Then buy this game. It's exactly as fun as that sounds. (No, really, it's great.)No matter how far you get in Duskers, you're always 1 typo away from having to restart, and I love that. The game is ""fair"" in that if you die, it's generally your own fault, either for mistyping a command, doing something you knew was dangerous and getting unlucky, or some other user error - there's very little RNG at play here (except in map generation), and you have plenty of opportunity to 'NOPE' out if it looks bad before you lose drones.The gameplay is very much what it looks like from the videos and screenshots - you're exploring derelicts salvaging equipment and supplies that enable you to live a little longer and explora some more. It's a resource management game - Scrap is the resource used for almost everything - repairing bots, repairing your ship, funding upgrades, creating new modules, etc., and there's two types of fuel needed to get around the universe - everything comes down to how efficiently you can perform to keep those resources high.The graphics seem to be a turn-off for a lot of people but they're spot-on for what they should be for a game like this. You're viewing the world through antiquated computer hardware, and it captures that feel perfectly, right down to the 'degauss' command.Overall, highly recommend this game. It won't be for everyone, but if you liked games like Uplink, this is probably your cup of tea.			"

Posted: August 6, 2016
												This game is odd. There are horror games which feel entirely claustrophobic. There are horror games with a direct sense of panic. There are management games with no sense of thrill or adventure. And then there is this game. Duskers, if you didn't figure out already, is a marriage of Horror and management game elements with a slight hint of extra typing. You're in space, you don't know what's happened and you piece the story together as you go from communications found logged on the ships you board. The story is surprisingly well written for such a gameplay focused experience, and does help to give you a sense of isolation in the rather large map you're spawned into.The gameplay is the big part here, as there are many different individual pieces that make up the whole experience. Misreading the command log to see if the sensor in r5 became untriggered gives you this sense of sudden realisation mixed with terror. In comparison to another favourite horror game of mine, Alien Isolation, the panic in that game lies in making a break for an exit and crouch walking right into the Alien even after you checked the motion tracker. This is what is so very different about this game. You feel a horrible sense of responsibility (don't we all) over the poor drones you send into harms way, which makes it ever more unfortunate when you try to flush out a leaper and mistakenly leave the door to your generator drone open and simultaneously lose 3 drones because you locked two away behind a door you were sure you could open once the leaper was flushed out. Or when the door next to your only safe room starts being attacked and you have to rush to get all the drones back onto the ship. Surprisingly, the command typing takes nothing from the experience. As someone who takes a lot of time typing, the command system is surprisingly good as I find myself just pressing enter in a blind panic once I finish typing a door close command. There are also so many joys in this game, such as the feeling of commandeering a new ship with 3 upgrade slots or gathering the maximum amount of fuel from a station.However, a few flaws lie in the gameplay, it's not just full of the outstanding elements of this great game. Once you've collected 10-20 scrap in a single mission, you will realise that it cannot repair the schematic view once you have repaired vital modules, leaving you with a chance of being blind. 20 scrap cannot give you the insurance of all of your drones' health back once you've fixed a couple of ship modules. Whilst this can be seen as a vital element, and I would agree, everything decays at an incredibly fast rate which can make module breaks feel a little bit cheap. This is avoidable somewhat by fiddling around with the options menu, which means it's only a minor flaw. One other flaw I have with the game is that once you find a way to deal with the leapers, goo, drones and swarms, you tend to become unstoppable in your pillaging of ships for scrap. Another similar flaw is that the enemy types start to get a bit boring after you've been through a few galaxies. Both of these issues could be fixed with more enemy types. For example, an enemy that doesn't move or show up on sensors/motion, and only attacks drones that have their back to it but destroys any drone with less than 200 health points in one hit then becomes inactive for a set amount of time. That's just one example off the top of my head. Overall, this game is brilliantly done. The atmosphere is surprisingly present despite the retro-digital aesthetic that I enjoy so much. The gameplay whilst a little dull after you've gotten everything is challenging and requires concentrated effort. The fear this game produces is unrivaled purely because it's a different kind of fear. I got this full price, no sale, and feel I got much more than my money's worth. Try it out.			"

[y/n]Do you like games with overwhemling atomoshpere, one that comes with a graphical interface that is again, sucks you right into the games universe to a complete level? [y/n]Do you like playing a game that requires you to think about the way you do things and execute the best plan you managed to come up with? [y/n]Do you like games that have intense real time action thinking and executing, all while trying to survive and achieve the best hull available? one that will allow you continue exploring, which can lead to some of the more intense gaming moments involving keyboard hammering you've ever had? [y/n]Do you like SienceFiction, drones and basic command prompts? [y/n]Are you an intellegent human being, capable appreciating a true masterpiece? [y/n]Do you like exploring, evolving and improving yourself in an everchanging world? [y/n]This game is all of the above and more. Get it, you wont regret it			"

												It feels like you are doing the same thing over and over. Even when you progress the ships looks identical and the strats you employ to search the ship are all the same too. Getting scrap doesn't reward you in any way except being able to keep the modules you have, it doesn't feel like you are working up to anything at all.			"

												I like this game, Kept me on edge often and put alot of stress on me to get stuff done with all the threats you can run into on ship and the thought of keeping my drones alive. I've had many experiences that went horrible due to various reasons such as having my only drone with a generator getting attacked/swarmed or other things because I neglected it for so long and left it there for dead.I've had many times where my drones addons would break-down and I would be forced to test the waters by actively peaking into rooms instead of using equipment to check the room for anykind of presence. These...... Mostly turn for the worst as for I have to make/declare alot of the ship to be condemned to no future exploration for the mission because of my equipment failing when I need it most. I really wish this game could get more recognition because I find it great to play when you got nothing else to do, I just need to find more time to play it...Note: Be wary of a ships condition / Infestation count, I have ♥♥♥♥ed up so many times because of the fact I overlook these factors. Nothing is there to make the experience easier for you, it only goes downhill and you have no idea how you will recover from a major ♥♥♥♥ up. You want to take your time? Sure. Wait too long and you might not get a chance to finish exploring or worse, lose your precious drones.  The ship is like a cracker box, anything can damage it and/or its assets. The dangers dont always lurk within, and asteroids were never there to make the game easier, only harder.			"

Posted: May 22, 2016
												I plan to create a full video review for this game, but here is a short list of my thoughts for now.  Simply put, Duskers is the BEST sci-fi rouge-like since FTL. You are alone on your ship in the middle of space with little fuel.  The only thing surrounding your ship are ghost ships, silent space stations, perhaps even the occasional automated store.  The only option left to you is to remotely control salvage drones to explore these derelict ships in search of fuel, scrap, ship modules, and other disabled drones to add to your fleet.  To control your drones you have to type out commands into a console window, or alternatively you can take control of one drone using your arrow keys.  Typing out commands isn't just a gimmick to make the game stand out though, it is a vital tool to learn.  With the command line you can send out multiple orders to drones all at once with ease (once you learn a few more advanced commands that is).  In order to explore these ships you will need to power the ship's systems with your drones.  This will give you access to controlling various doors and airlocks on the ship, which you will need to use to avoid any xenomorphs as you scour the vessel.  Like most Rogue-likes you are going to die... constantly. But everytime you reset the game you learn more strategies about how to safely collect supplies. If you listen closely you can somtimes hear each unique sound various threats will make when they are on the other side of the room.As you explore the galaxy you will also find various text logs on ships and stations that can be put together to find out what happened to humanity.  Your ship's computer will give you various objectives in relation to the logs you find, which you can in turn complete to learn more about what happened to the galaxy.  The logs are very well written. If the gameplay and visuals weren't already engaging me enough, the story surely sucked me in.  The only story in the game is through audio logs, and for me to say that it's a gripping story means the game has some damn good wrtting.  Overall I can safely say that Duskers is a game well worth $20.  To say that the game is light on content is not entirely untrue, but typing out commands in dozens of different ways and learning to code your own commands (yes, you can CODE your own commands) is more than enough to keep you playing.  I love this game and plan to spend much more time on it.complete review1; publish; recommend duskers; return all home; end			"

												This is a pretty awesome indie title that features excellent atmosphere, very unique control scheme and a challenging rogue-like elements in the game that will make you want to play this through a few times before you figure out what's really going on.In a nutshell, it's a command line simulator that allows you to remotely control several bots that you use to board the derelict spaceships to try to scavenge fuel and resources from but also discover what happened to everyone else in the universe and why you are the only survivor.As you go through each individual wreck, you have to not only manage your own resources, but also make sure that you scan for potential defense systems that may turn hostile or worse...increasingly creepy unusual alien creatures that may kill all of your bots and leave you stranded in space.The most interesting aspect of the game is in how simple yet elegant it is and how great it delivers the story in bits and pieces as you go through various levels at random. It also gets progressively more challenging and as you upgrade your drones and acquire new modules for them, you get to choose on how you want to progress and complete your levels.The main goal of the game is not entirely clear at first, but becomes more obvious after a few playthroughs and since this is a game you can play both casually and with more hardcore mentality as well, I think it will appeal to many kinds of players that don't care much about graphics and would rather focus on a complex and original gameplay design.Learn more by watching this video:

								I love indies. But I was still skeptical about the price when I saw it.6 missions later, finding the one fuel canister that will keep me going for just one more day, evacuating all my scavenger drones before a stray meteorite would hit the abandoned wreck in T-48 seconds. And my brave Twiki covering a door beside the escape route with a mounted turret gun as God knows what continued it's assault on the only thing between it and Twikies escaping robo friends.I had to check the store page cause I forgot what the price was.

SCARY?You really feel like you're on board a tiny spacecraft, completely isolated, with just your drones (who somehow start taking on personality - you care about those little fragile circles!) for company as you explore these rotting space hulks. Try playing it with the lights out.			"

			Alone on a spaceship without any radio signals nor living beings around. All you have is a terminal, your ship and your drones to try and survive.		

So, you wanted to get scared. You wanted to play a horror game. Perhaps a survival rogue-like one? Forget your run-of-the-mill jump scare games, monsters, aliens and other nasties. Duskers will make you fear mere sounds of the ship you've docked at creaking, shudder at seeing flashing red doors and jump at simple beeps of your console.The atmosphere of the game has to be applauded over and over. The graphical nature is simple yet complex. Simple in terms of the console view where you can see the location of your drones, the layout of the ship, the state of its doors and so on. This part is logically clean and very un-Hollywood like, where terminals will be more graphically impressive than any operating system yet look a fraction as useful. The console, coupled with the ambient rumbling of your ship's engines as well as various blips and blops, will reinforce the feeling of isolation. The feeling that you are truly alone in the cold vastness of space, desperately trying to keep your aging ship and failing drones to keep going as you attempt to figure out just what has happened to everyone.The complex part of the graphics is the actual drone view of the ships you board. Since you're remotely connecting to your drones, you can only see what your little workers see with their sensors and cameras. This means you have a limited line of sight and a distorted representation of the corridors, terminals and generators you happen to come across. This view is both beautiful, in a way, and terrifying, as the ships' interiors are a jumble of broken pipes, floors and other machinery. Often you might barge into a room you could not probe for motion beforehand, trying to spot an enemy in order to pull out and shut the doors, but you will instead get spooked by an eerie formation of damaged equipment that might, for a moment, make it appear like you have stumbled upon a hostile entity.The bad guys, in this case, are an unknown. You will have to progress through the story - the bits and pieces of uncorrupted (or semi corrupt) transmissions and logs of the people that had left the derelicts where they are. Your enemy will be unrelenting, unfeeling and without mercy for your drones. Should your greediness to collect more scrap, drones or upgrades get the better of you (which, with the usual scarcity of the resources it often will) and make a mistake of scouting a room you can not escape for one reason or another, the game (or, rather, the enemies) will punish you greatly. Thinking and planning ahead is always a concern and, often, you will find yourself thinking of the worst case scenario, per-emptively shutting doors and moving the rest of your drones away from the unfortunate scout and gatherer.Later on, as you scavenge, the game will provide you with various upgrades, systems and scrap to keep your group of drones going, but never will you become complacent, as the ship you are piloting (you can commandeer some ships you clear out as well) will always have limits in terms of maximum scrap (currency) and upgrade slots. With these limits, you are always encouraged to be smart with your spending and take as few risks as possible while scavenging. However, not taking risks is simply not a part of this game.Every ship you will dock will be dangerous. There are enemies, defensive turrets you can enable and then mistakenly run into, failing airlock doors which will, after opening for the final time, cause all the air in the exposed rooms to be blown out, including your drones, enemies and goodies. Not only that, if you manage to somehow contain the situation, exposing the rooms to space will flood the rooms with deadly radiation, which will adversely affect your drones to the point of them failing completely.In the world of Duskers, danger is always present, risk taking is a necessity, planning is important and feelings of isolation are a constant.And it's a world I absolutely adore.

Early Access Review
								Duskers is a sci-fi strategy 'rogue-like' game about gathering scrap in a dead universe. You sit at a computer in your space ship controlling your drones while they explore derelict space ships, hunting for scrap, fuel and useful tech. The game is very old-school and controlled solely via the keyboard. There are two methods of controlling your drones, either by moving them around with the cursor keys, or by issuing commands to them via the terminal. Using the terminal requires you to memorize a handful of commands like 'navigate', 'gather' etc. As with all good terminals, you can just write the first few letters of a command and auto-complete it, speeding up the gameplay a little. While exploring the rooms and corridors of the dead space ships and stations you often come across hostiles that can damage and destroy your drones. Luckily there are several ways to avoid and/or neutralize them; one way is to just suck them out the nearest airlock. This does however have the unfortunate effect of blowing out everything else that might have been in the room with the hostile. Point being, every action in Duskers has a consequence, and often you have to outweigh the risk with the reward. I've often omitted visiting parts of space ships because I just couldn't risk losing my precious drones. I spend a lot of the time while playing just analyzing the situation and trying to find out how best to explore the ship with the means at my disposal. Sometimes the game throws a wrench in my plans like rupturing a pipe in a room, leaking lethal radiation all over it, or perhaps temporarily breaking the video feed on my drones, leaving them blind. The game might seem unforgiving at times, but I actually think this is good, otherwise I could just learn the optimum strategy and use it every time; some randomness and chaos is good. Also, it sends the adrenaline pumping when several alarms suddenly go off and you know you have to jump ship, frantically trying to type the necessary commands to save your drones, but ending up with 'naivgaet 1 r1' instead of 'navigate 1 r1'. Great fun!The graphics are rather simple but work very well considering the setting. It actually reminds me of the computers from Alien (the movie), and by extension, Alien Isolation. Pure 70-80's sci-fi goodness! The audio is great, with ominous sounds being heard throughout the ship, bulkheads creaking, computers chattering, and creepy unindentified noises. Sometimes you hear a loud groan and an airlock ruptures somewhere in the ship, setting off beeping alarms and flooding the room with radiation. This game really speaks to the nerd in me, as it has 3 elements that I adore: scifi, drones and the terminal. I'm an avid user of the Linux terminal, and this game gives me the same power at my fingertips as the Linux terminal does. I feel like I'm acting more directly with the game through the terminal than if I was using the mouse as in most games. Of course, it does help if you have a good typing keyboard, preferably one that clatters really loudly! Duskers might certainly not be for everyone, but I think that if you like the aforementioned points, you'll love this game. At this point I've only owned the game for a few days but have already played several hours (which is a lot for me) and still find it as interesting as when I first loaded it up. It's a game I can pick up for 20 minutes or play for 2 hours as I wish, and I can easily see myself playing it for hundreds of hours over the next few years. I give Duskers a big thumbs up, even at the current 20€ retail price. To me it is absolutely worth the price.			"

								Bought this game less than an hour after it came out. Have to say a refreshing style of strategy game. The command prompt interface (for any of you that gre up in the DOS age) is unnervingly satifying.You get strangely attached to you little team of drones their shapes and noises.There's something to be said venturing into the unknown, those paniced situations desperatly reorginizing your team entering commands as quickly as possible al to survive. Anyone with a love of Sci Fi, RTS, and the rush of control from your control station will love this game. BE WARNED! it will only hurt that much more when tragedy strikes...Support is quick and helpful, gotta say Great Job JP!Cheers Daj			"

												It's interesting in a weird way. There's more shock value than horror value here. Steep learning curve, imo, because you won't always have what you need to determine the behavior of some enemies and sometimes they kinda just come out of nowhere, and I don't like the idea of consulting a guide for how to combat something unless it's broken.There's this weird ""failure probability"" on equipment you get that doesn't really seem to represent failure at all. Like, it seems like if you have a 3% failure probablility, it's actually 0% UNTIL you get past 15%, then it's roughly 100%, it feels like. I dunno. Maybe I'll run into something later, but that's misleading in its own way.The whole ""I'm a lone pilot in space"" deal kinda washes away when you lose the first time, because how it picks back up is that you still have ALL the logs you gathered from your previous playthrough, so it's like ""wait, how did this new pilot get those? Why is there a new pilot? So there are survivors?"" and it just kinda snowballs from there and ruins the atmosphere. Misleading information I don't really appreciate, but I still find the game to be fun in that it's a survival game from a command console-type control.I think the execution of the game could benefit from a few upgrades here and there, but it's fine as it is as well.AddendumThe way the game works is that you start out in some random ship and system and drones, and you're just trying to survive as long as possible. There's no food or anything complex like that to manage, you just keep going until you lose the means to do so (like losing all your drones).I forgot to add that there's no music whatsoever. That's not a bad thing, though. It helps to focus, honestly. If anything, it's more about ambience here than it is for the music. And you might hear a buzzing noise come from the computer when viewing certain parts like the drone view. The game is causing that buzzing, not the computer in general. Your computer is generating the buzz, though, which, I've found, happens in the drone view.There are objectives that give a sense that you're progressing, but I've read that the main goal is to survive as long as possible. Unlike other games I've played, these ""communication archives"" are actually nice to read, even with the corruption that purposely obscures certain things.There are daily and weekly challenges where you compete against other players to get a high score in clearing out a ship or system, respectively. These are separate from the main playthrough.			"

								A small spaceship docks on the side of a long dead station and begins a process it has carried out a hundred times before. Airlock doors creak open and 3 decaying drones shuffle into the waiting dark, scanning for anything out of the ordinary. A drone heads to a nearby generator and powers up a small portion of the ship. Ancient lights flicker to life and reveal dusty, abandoned rooms to sightless machines. Nearby doors hum with their newfound power, waiting to be opened and to reveal their secrets.The other drones begin searching for something, anything useful. A drop of fuel to make it to the next ship, a chunk of scrap to repair that long suffering drones faulty camera, maybe a destroyed drone full of upgrades or a new addition to the team.A door is opened and a drone begins to move into the next room but there's something wrong with the camera feed, the darkness in the other room seems to be moving, pulsing and whirring.That's no fault.You waste no time in jumping into action, this is a threat that has been seen before. Your fingers dance across your keyboard, commanding the door to shut before the horrors from the other room are unleashed. A finger slips and instead of Door 10 slamming shut Door 19 on the other side of the ship slides open. The swarm flings itself into the room and begins to dismantle the nearest drone. Panicking now you order the 2 remaining drones back to the boarding ship, leaving the 3rd to it's fate. Maybe you can salvage something from it later.			"

												What can I say about this game?  Somehow, it kind of reminds me of the original X-Com games, in that it's deliberately hard and you will fail.  You will fail many, many times.  And I love that aspect.  I loved those games, I've loved many, many roguelikes over the years, and I thought I'd love this game too.But I don't.  I can't really put my finger on it.  It's got all the elements needed to be a harsh, unforgiving game that gives a sense of accomplishment when you finally do well, but it just doesn't.Perhaps that's because there's no actual sense of accomplishment.  Salvaging another ship?  Eh, you're worse off 9/10 times (get one scrap, need 10 to repair your failing modules.  Also no fuel).  Finsihing a system?  As usual, your ship is worse off than before.Perhaps it's because you can have completely unwinnable galaxies to start in, thus causing a good hour long wait until you find one you can actually get through (all your drones died after opening your first door, congrats, time to restart).Perhaps it's the fact that there are a few pretty much 'necessary' pieces of equipment that don't seem to ever spawn (interface, motion).Maybe I just don't like the idea that the point is to use as few of your modules as possible.  Every time you find yourself needing to type 'stealth' or 'trap' or, god forbid, 'remote' for the first time on a ship, you just KNOW you've ruined any chance of actually accomplishing something 'this time'.Perhaps the fact that your drones can literally get stuck between two boxes during 'navigate' commands, forcing you to abandon them, is incredibly iritating to me.Or perhaps I paid for an hd screen, and the blurriness of the game detracts from it and gives me a headache.  The 'retro-future' thing has gotten a little old at this point.Some people like it.  That's fine.  Personally, I think it's terrible.			"

								Great game. I am excited to see it expand over the coming months and hopefully become more difficult as well. I am hoping that ships become more complicated and have more parts to them as well! Having airlocks and different types of rooms would increase the difficulty as well as perhaps give us some more fun commands when working through ships. I got to about 200 days before realizing I was not going to be able to jump back to a stargate since the closest stargate was three jumps away. I guess I found the use for the long range scanner finally. I wish there was a way to make jump fuel, even if it was 30 scrap. I would have sold everything down to 1 drone just to have the chance to recover in a new system. Some mild music in the main star map would be nice. The ambiance on the ships from just the sound is fantastic, but it leaves a little wanting when you are looking through star systems and doing drone modifications. It could use a little bit of a change between those two environments from a audio perspective. Adding delays to the command line such that I can have a drone move to a room and do a command such as interface and shipscan in order would be nice. An option for search or explore ont he drones would be nice so that I can explore rooms without leaving the command line. My least favorite part about the game is manually moving drones around the ship. I have much more fun in the command line view itself. When modifications have upgrades they should probably sell for one or two scrap more than a non-upgraded modification. There have been some ships where goo and radiation wrecked my game within 15 seconds of landing and r2 getting destroyed as soon as I typed begin and let my drones out. That was kind of lame, but I do respect that the ship I landed on most of sucked integrity wise. I always go for an upgraded ship surveyor now so that I can just completely avoid these rooms. Goo should maybe show up on the command line map such that my drones don't get completely surrounded by goo just because I was not manually checking the drones every minute. That could go either way though, it does increase the probability of failing a mission, but it feels kind of lame having my game end over something like that.I was thinking it might be interesting for us to have to clear out our own ship on occassion due to a foreign entity such as swarms boarding the ship. This would give the chance to have an encounter on ships that would look different than the derelict scrounging aspect of the game. Having the ability to research new modifications could be interesting, although I am not sure how that would look. It might be cool to have a flamethrower modification to be able to clear out goo. The only feasible method I have at the moment is opening everything up the the airlock which will allow me to get to the fuel but absolutely wreck everything else.Overall I am hoping the game play becomes more difficult and varied. I love the difficulty and would love to see it get more complicated and difficult. I am excited to see how the storyline comes together and how this will look in terms of gameplay.			"

								In a nutshell, Duskers is a game about ordering giant, semi-autonomous space Roombas to wander around derelict ships, using the finesse of  a 1980's Turtle programmer.  From the safety of your ship, send them in search of supplies, to gather fuel & intel, and to blast them out the nearest airlock when you're feeling randomly sadistic.Fantastic early access game.  I've always been a fan of the command line / hacking game genre... this takes it to the next step by melding command line interface, with the strategey elements of games like FTL and Space Marines.  Active devs and an already well polished UI make this one to watch.			"

												I sometimes sigh a bit after buying a game to discover it is a small download (in Duskers case sub 100 MB) because it can tend to be an indication that there'll be something lacking.  It's safe to say this game packs more satisfaction into its tiny package than many behemoths do.  There is a certain delight in jumping around in space, docking to derelict crafts, and dispatching drones from the safety of your cabin in hopes of insulating yourself from the unseen dangers.  Being forced to make judgement calls of various consequence and urgency depending on your circumstances dials the suspense up to 11.  Being able to exert your command using written directions and basic routines really makes you feel attached to the scenario and serves to pull you deper into the narrative.  Highly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								I played Duskers for about 24 hours back in VERY early Early Access. Then I stopped because it was SO GOOD that I wanted to wait and experience the sekret plot stuffs once the game was complete, rather than as they were developed.Basically in this game you navigate your space ship around a map of star systems containing lots and lots of derelict space ships, using drones to board and explore them. Along the way you need to gather food and fuel, upgrade your drones and spaceship, and try to figure out what caused all the ships to be derelict -- of course you don't want it to happen to you, too.Each ship you explore is like a mini dungeon in a roguelike, with rooms and passageways and doors and airlocks.You can navigate your drones directly/visually, with arrow keys to rotate and move them around. You can also issue text commands to cause them to move or perform various actions. The drones can carry various upgrade modules to perform specialized functions; for example a drone might have a generator used to power the dead ship's systems so you can open doors and whatnot, or a gatling gun for defense. Most of the drone modules are controlled exclusively through text commands.The challenge in the game comes from the fact that you don't have direct experience of the ships you are exploring; all you have is the information relayed to you by your drones, which may be incomplete. Hell, it's pretty much always incomplete. So you have to infer the safety level of rooms before you enter them, and use clever manipulation of ship systems and drone upgrades to defeat the threats without direct confrontation, or in an ambush where the odds are stacked in your favor.It can be a little challenging at first to get used to the command line interface and learn all the various drone capabilities and how to use them; but the learning curve is quite navigable and it is rewarding to get good at it. You can set up aliases for frequently used commands (or just-in-case commands that are too complicated to type in a hurry when under fire).If you do well, you will acquire more drone upgrades, ship upgrades, food, fuel, and information.If you do poorly, your drones will be destroyed, your ship will run out of basic resources, and you will have to re-start from scratch in a new randomly generated galaxy -- death is permanent.It's not for everyone, but if it sounds good to you, you will probably like it.

YouTube™ Video: Duskers (Critical Eye): Panic Radiation 

			Views: 340		

			You control the drones. Or do they control you? This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes. Duskers is a strategy based roguelike that goes the simple presentation route, and is...		

 Summary: It's not going for razzle dazzle in terms of visuals, but it goes for content and gameplay, and it delivers in the slow and methodical gameplay. You're playing a chess match of sorts: keep your drones safe by manipulating the environment and being 2 steps ahead of your enemies. If you're looking for something fast paced, Duskers is not the game for you. Don't get me wrong, some of the best moments of the game happen when chaos hits the battlefield: as you're scrambling in panic trying to figure out what to do. But the game wants you to take things slowly and methodically: because one wrong move will get your drones killed. This game will punish you hard for a mistake, and masochists really will love their time with this game. It's just going to take you a while to get up to speed, as the game doesn't do a good job of teaching you its mechanics, and there will be a bit of growing pains. But if you learn the walk, you'll really enjoy what the game has to offer, especially if you want to exercise your brain. Lists: Positives: The game is at its best when chaos rules. When you've got asteroids hitting the ship you're investigating or radiation all of a sudden popping up, the panic created is a blast to deal with. Strategy takes the center stage, as using your equipment to the best of your abilities. Attempting to outsmart the enemies by opening doors and using the ship's environment is a slow chess match. It's a bunch of fun.   Despite some repetition, gameplay has an addictive quality to it. Not necessarily to a “one more run” mentality, but I found myself easily starting the next game without any reservations. Good difficulty. It's a roguelike: it should punish you, and make you beg for more. Yes, that sounds a little masochistic. I'm a Cubs fan, I like a little pain. When things go wrong, 99% of the time, it's directly your fault. Even if RNG was the cause, you will still feel like you're the one who screwed up.  Like the command line interface that can speed up gameplay. The two different views both provide good benefits, and can help speed the game along.Negatives: The game doesn't do the greatest job of teaching you its mechanics. A small tutorial sets the stage, but with the different equipment and mechanics here, it needed to go a little further then it did. Yes, you want some self-discovery and self-teaching, but this goes a little too far.  When using the command line navigate function, wish that AI was smart enough to not try to go through elements that would damage them.  Do wish for some way to mark the map up from a cleared/information perspective. Yes, the map can change and all, but I would love a way to mark a room that a virus/bacteria is in so I'm not surprised when it starts dealing damage. Some of the visual effects can hurt the eyes. I get what they are going for in terms of presentation, but some of the effects really hurt the eyes. RNG will drive you up the wall at times. It's a roguelike, you should expect that. But even then, you'll curse the Angel of Luck.  "

The trailer drew me in and I was not disappointed.Now there are pros and cons.Pros: The game provides a sense of claustrophobia as you're limited to either your drone's view (which is detailed) or an overview of the entire map (but not as detailed).  You'll switch a lot to be able to see specifically where stuff is and how to position your drones.  And the times when your video cuts off, only adds to the sense of suspense and worry.  You constantly have to scavange derelicts for just enough supplies to keep you going and it's hard to maintain supplies (between repairing and upgrading drones, maintaining their upgrades, getting ammo, and much more)Drones have to work together, sometimes swapping parts to adapt to their enviroment. You'll have to constantly be on the alert for random events (an asteroid strike, broken vent leaking radiation, a malfunctioning airlock) and sometimes you'll have to control yourself and not be greedy or stay too long.There are moments where you'll jump in fear, such as checking a room and out of no where an enemy lunges fromt the shadows to attack you drone, killing it and destroying you vid feed so you can't see what happened. When it comes to enemies... well stealth is keep and one mistake (like leaving a door open a second too long or not closing another door) can lead to you losing either one drone or all. Best of all, the game has good replayability due to randomly generated systems, galaxies, ships, and maps.Cons:It can be difficult to deal with typing your commands (especially when dealing with enemies or radiation leaks or even asteroid strikes) and I've had more than once where I typed a wrong key and opened a door which lead to all my drones being killed.  Another is when you start a new game, sometimes you get bad (for lack of better term) starting equipment which makes the game harder.  Overall:There's so much more which I could go into detail but I'll leave it to those. I found this game wonderful and despite frustrating parts, I still pressed on and was rewarded.  If you're into games with puzzles, suspense, resource management and strategy, exploration and stealth, then this is definitely the game for you.			"

Early Access Review
								FULL review belowRevised after updates+ Command-line and GUI console-based gameplay+ GUI is visually attractive+ Randomly generated universe+ Strategically intelligent- Minor bugs (for now)= Permadeath= Not fast paced= Supplemental live ""game world"" video feedFULL REVIEW:Havent played a ridiculous amount of this game just yet. But I will say, there is not anything else out there exactly like it. Which isn't bad in this case. Mostly being that if I had played something similar I would not have been as interested. The game is not something I can replay till the end of time but if the criteria fits your interest then the money is not wasted.This game, if anything is more like a simulator for those salvage and recon expeditions you always see in movies, except instead of coming back with a magical discovery 10 scenes later, you manage them real time. At first I will admit I was a bit skeptical, but the feeling you get when watching in dread as each drone one by one be converted into spare sparts by a group of organisms, smashing its way through the interior blast doors of this dead ship you have entered in search of loot, leaves you feeling pretty hopeless. Combining console commands and a pretty convincing GUI, the game puts you in control of not only these drones, but also the ship itself. You will slam doors as you escape, fire up gun turrets to obliterate the opposition and even sometimes yourself, flush the dirty alien scum through an open airlock you have cleverly lured them into, all while towing a dead drone back to your ship for spare parts and upgrades.The feeling of consequence definately makes you want to watch your a**. Any drones that are left on the ship after departure, or disabled and not dragged back to the ship are left behind permanently. Your drones will become like little pet projects in which you spend your salvage parts and switch various upgrades into, in order to further your efforts to rid these adbandoned spacecraft of valuables. Improve speed or refill your trusty supply of motion trackers. Equip those new upgrades or repair that drone you rescued from the last hunt.Not once did I find myself feeling bored, and I assume as the game progresses and my drones become further equipped and more valuable not to lose, my interest will sustain. The UI is attractive and the game is smart. The console is really cool but I already like anything console based. Pretty neat being able to generate a command to autopilot your drone to another end of the ship to hack a defense interface, while manually pilotting a drone to gather scrap simultaniously. But know what this game is before you buy it. Looking for non stop action? Want that new thrill that can only be achieved by shredding guts and drenching your war torn body in the blood of your enemies? This game is not for you. Otherwise, redock your ship on airlock a3, risk it all, or decide and leave your most precious and currently disabled drone behind instead, and dont forget to seal a few doors as you go. Just in case ;)			"

												A deeply immersive and bleak roguelike about a wandering omega man and his ragtag band of robo-friends.  You will leapfrog across the known universe, one derelict at a time, and haunt the skeletons of former civilization via remote control and DOS-style command prompts.  Everything you consume--from fuel to tools to repairs--will be scavanged; every piece of information you glean about your hopeless surroundings will be provided through the grainy and deteriorating sonar feeds of drones, threadbare schematics, and corrupted data logs.At about the time you're low on fuel, running a skeleton crew of increasingly fickle drones and their increasingly unreliable equipment on dilapidated space stations and ghost ships, you'll realize the theme of Duskers: nothing lasts forever in this universe.That being said, the game rarely feels unfair.  You're given the tools to survive as you hop from one wreck to the next, uncovering fuel and scrap to help sustain your growing cast of drones and equipment.  You'll never seem to have enough to stay on top of everything, however, and the way you prioritize your repairs and mantain your roster of robots will influence just how long you might last once the meteor storms, hull breaches, creeping radioactive crud, and consuming swarms arrive.  Maintenance and upgrades are appropriately complex systems that opens up the door for a variety of strategies, and the degree to which neglect can manifest itself in your equipment--from the way a drone might start drifting to one side. a video feed might become corrupted, or a module might begin to fail--means that you will have to cope with the hardships of the things you can't immediately fix.Duskers is a roguelike tha provides a wealth of material and choices in a distinct format that really makes you feel like you're sitting at the controls of a commandeered vessel, picking through wreckage via command prompts.  If you've ever wanted to sit in Bishops seat and reenact the desperate moments of Aliens with cute robots for marines, this is your chance.			"

												I've only been playing a short time, but I'm intrigued by the odd-yet-useful interface. I wondered why the file size for the game was so small, but now I know. No frills, no spills, no chills. It's as basic a game as you can play, yet it is both deep and just a little freaky. I'm sure some will complain that you can't use a human-like avatar to explore the multitude of derelict vessels, but that misses the point. Without ruining too much, you enter the game with no idea what's happened, and it remains that way.Or, to mis-quote an old movie line: ""Some mysteries were never meant to be solved, but we make the attempt nevertheless.""No lie, it does take a while to get into the game, since it involves mostly typing, rather than using the traditional mouse/keyboard set-up. I think many will enjoy this, though. It can be spooky as hell at times, and there are frustrating puzzles to spare, but all in all, I'm enjoying this rather much so far.			"

												*Disclaimer*Product received for free for reviewing purposesDuskers is a wonderful roguelike strategy game that, in all it’s graphical simplicity manages to focus on creating a feeling of isolation, intense and sometimes heartbreaking moments, all by just watching your drones on scematic plans. The way of controlling the drones, by typing commands on a terminal, is a very interesting idea that works wonderfully in adding to the whole atmosphere. If the premise of the game interests you, then definitely check it and you will be surprised by what it has to offer.Read the full review on Hyper Light Uphttp://www.hyperlightup.com/duskers-review/ "

												I am loving the immersion on this game! Although I'm sat at my laptop, it's like I'm remotely controlling my robots out there somewhere with only their sensors to give an impression of what is going on.  The temptation to discover what is in that next room is enormous and the dissapointment when Garry is lost with the generator module with not enough scrap is immense.  I've been waiting for a game like this to pull me in for ages, and this does the job nicely.  Radiaton leak... Navigate all r1!!!			"

								Needs work. The RNG is so heavy, and certain modules so nerfed, you will need to hit reset before you do a single mission. 'Motion' can't even detect the room it's in 90% of the time, much less adjacent rooms. Stealth as a module is absolutely required to start off with(due primarily with how useless motion is), and most times you won't start with it. There are other 100% neccessary mods to find in order to (succesfully) raid ships you will need to pray the game gives you due to how nerfed a base mod  like motion is, or simply you have no capability to deal with certain enemies without 1 specific mod.  As the game progresses, RNG will refuse to give you certain ship mods 100% neccessary to progress in the game. Such as quarrintine bypass or transporter to get on certain locked vessels.The 'end game' consists of, as far as I can tell, peddling along till you have to restart because all modules are at impossibly high failure rates to destroy themselves with no ability to repair them because of the game's stingyness with giving scrap to repair things. The logs to ""piece together' what happened to the galaxy are often uninteresting, and you will quickly get enough different ones to know exactly what happened to everyone. Leaving no further incentive but to peddle the RNG bike till you stop getting enough scrap for basic repairs. You can adjust breakdown rates and scrap rates in the options, but I am leveling my judgement at the intended base balance of the game. My judgement is game balance is poorly thought out in effort to force the player to 'diversify' their tactics in a game where you have no options to diversify your tactics unless you've already had the game hand you victory several times over in the form of a wider selection of mods. I've watched developer videos, and he often conflates the game softballing him wealthpacked ships with tactical prowess.  At which point you naturally succeede if you've already had the game hand you every mod you need. As is, the only viable tactic is gaining the ability to safely scout out rooms ahead of time for threats, but the ability to do so is limited. Even if you manage to spot a threat without endangering yourself, your ability to clear it or redirect it is entirely RNG rather than a factor of player skill.  I really can't recommend it. Which is a shame. The gameplay is fun, but the problems with balance dead end even really good runs in to pointlessness after long enough.			"

YouTube™ Video: Vin's Thoughts - Duskers 

			Views: 582		

			A little game called Duskers showed up on my doorstep and I decided to do a little review of it. It's a very unique rouge-like game where you have to salvage the wrecks of starships.		

Duskers is awesome. Very rarely does a game show up that is so unique as this one right here. Duskers is all about manning salvage drones in order to try to keep flying in a dead galaxy.The gameplay is great. It has a suspense to it that feels similar to the movie Alien. There's always some terrible thing just around the corner. One wrong move and you're done for.There's really nothing quite like it on the market right now, and almost every aspect of the game is done perfectly (the path finding for the drones is pretty bad, though. They get stuck on things all the time).Duskers is not a game that you should pass up. It deserves to be as big as FTL was when it came out. P.S. Why in the world is it called Duskers? I don't even know mate, I don't even know.			"

												Although the difficulty curve is absoutely insane, the game was quite fun for the short time I played.User interface was well made and interesting to work with; more ""training"" is probably needed though for players to learn commands and modifications better.Visuals were very interesting and well designed; no complaints in that department whatsoever.Difficulty in the very beginning is no issue but as soon as you move into the second system, you begin experiencing an instant increase in radiation, a drastic incline in enemies, and very little assistance if the RNG is not working in your favor.I understand this game is most definitely tooled for more ""hard-core"" gamers, but for a player like me, the difficulty increase was too uncomfortable to stick with.Definitely giving the production group a thumbs up and props, and if this game features more customization, difficulty management or possibly modifications in the future, I will gladly re-purchase it and play much, much more.

								This game is truly unique and lots of fun to play with so many ways to do things.  The Console/Command Line implementation as one of the primary means of controlling your drones is fantastically satisfying and fairly intuitive to use.  I'm very excited to see this game at full release, but it is also completely playable / stable / entertaining right now.    The devs are active on the Steam forums so you can find details there about what is left to be done.  I recommend keeping an eye on this one if you are looking for a different and satisfying experience with lots of replay value.			"

 Summary: 2D game where you explore a galaxy (map) jumping around and sending your drones into ships/stations to loot supplies and figure out why you can't find another Human being. Destroy and evade hostiles. Avoid accidents and disastors.  Price: You should probably wait for this to go on sale. Pros: Moderate tutorial. Somewhat customized drones and (limited) ships. Option of where you are exploring. Very story driven. Odd survival feel to it. Also a mystery feel to it. Strategy and risk management involves thought. Different difficulties and options. Unconventional game overall. Cons: Minor replay value. Investigating potentially tedious. 2D game. "

								What a superb game! I'm absoultly hooked, the console command adds such a dimension, and just as you get more savvy with it, whoosh - 'Drone 1 has left the derilict' via the air lock..Nooooooo, he was my best drone! The more you play, the more the depth and harshness of poor decisions hit you. the interchangable modules on each drone (3 slots each) really plays a part. The closest so far was sneaking in a new airlock, swaping my 'Tow' module over to remaining Drone and pulling his other two downed mates back in for a hasty escape and much configuring of resources once home on current ship. So much fun and stratagy with powering doors, usuing motion scanners to trap nastys, then firing up defence guns to politley dispose of them for you. Setting traps, again utilizing airlocks to suck bad robots, swarms and rather red stuff before radiation renders room unuseable etc. I've really got into indie games this year, i was always panicing about my graphic card and system specs with high end 3d titles, however, so i really recoomend investing in this great title and casting off any snobbery. Trust me the retro 'Alien & Bladerunner' console beeps along with noise on the video screen really are great. So simple, but such a satisfying game with a little patience. You really feel that remote control and desperation for your ship and drone survival. Still in alpha, can only improve, but so good as it is already. Really wish the developer so much luck with this, dam good show :0)			"

								A damn good roguelike with a FTL feel to it but with a twist. Instead of controlling crew your controlling drones. While they may not scream when you screw up and get them killed you still get attached to the little buggers.The drones are highly customizeable with randomized upgrades. You will need to semispecialize each drone to do different tasks while searching the derelicts.ScoutingPower GenerationDefenseThese are just a few of the rolls your little guys can take.If you need a more in depth view of the game here's my game play review. Defintely worth snagging in my opinion

												Edit: This game has seen many updates since I first reviewed it. The alias function I like so much, now has variables. The story is fleshed out (told through logs that are uncovered as you board more and more deadly derelicts).There are a ton of objectives to get into once you have the survival part down. For example, I'm doing a mission where you have to commandeer a large Mutaki derelict without powering up a generator and wiping the computers. So I can't suck enemies out of airlocks or herd them in to rooms. I have to use a pry while another drone stands by with a turret.There are daily and weekly challanges. The whole game has a great ballance between feeling really rewarding when you do well and infuriating when you lose it all.Over 180hrs in and I am far from burned out. Absolute gem.Original review:I really like this game, and I can see it being popular amongst coders and *nix users alike. There is something called an alias, that at the moment behaves more like a macro. You can bring up a note pad and type in a sequence of commands divided by a semicolon, these are called from an alias you give them, thus the name. --ex. truck = navigate 3 1; tow 3; navigate 3 r1; tow 3This is an alias I'd use to call my tow drone to my explorer and pick up a ship upgrade or other retrievable salvage. They are already fun and full of potential in their current state, but the developers are keen to flesh this system out adding variables and delays for starters. The syntax is simple (a little like tcl, partly because it's not esoteric, or overly complex but is still powerful.. mainly though because you're typing one liners, of commands seperated by semi colons.. just.. like.. in tcl :D). There is a tutorial and starter galaxy but they just cover the basics and from there you are on your own. They have said that they don't want everything made clear and the intention is to have players discover mechanics through playing, reading logs and experimenting.Aliases, as an example, were originally a text file in the games folder with no explanation.The developers really care about making this as good a game as possible, while not trying to cater to a low common denominator. At the moment the community is somewhat niche but robust and I only see it growing.Great devs pushing boundaries with a great game that seems to attract some really great, intelligent people.. Can not recommend enough.			"

												Loading BIOS: Steam Review [Player Class] Duskers v1.04Game played ...     [PASS]Tutorial completed ... [PASS]Repeated meaningless deaths ... [PASS]Review posted ... [FAIL]Critical warning(s)> Spoilers ahead. You've been warned.> Only four enemies with minimal variety in strength or complexity. Everything is essentially able to one-hit-kill your droids. Even when you add shields and turrets to the mix, more often than not you're going to take some serious damage and likely be destroyed. While this isn't bad in and of itself, when combined with the lack of of enemy variety it reveals a rather shallow game, level and story design.> Only 2 types of drones-- 3 slot and 4 slot-- the aesthetics have no game effect and everything else, modules HP, speed, are all stats that can be modified. Additionally, players can only have a maximum of 4 drones deployed and 3 in reserve. (I have yet to find any ships that I can commandere that give me improved stats. This again is an attempt at complexity that falls far short of actually being complex.> While there is some complexity in the drone modules, there are really only a few combinations that make sense. For instance, putting modules that require you to be stationary (generator module to power the derelicts you explore) and gatherer modules don't make any sense-- since in order to power the derelict you have to be stationary, but the gatherer module requires mobility. This is perhaps the one place the game has some complexity, and it only serves to emphasize the lack of depth in the rest of the game.> Procedural and random is the name of the game, there is almost no progression. Story elements are acquired by dying, and repeating the start of the game until you have collected the entire story. There is no middle or end-game. It's just a repetition of the same initial opening sequence over and over and over.> The story is light, delivered via corrupted email/text messages. The game would have been enhanced by the addition of more audio content. Not all derelicts contain story content (email/text messages). With the randomness that is the game, and the absence of a middle and end-game, the story elements can be exceedingly difficult to collect.> The tutorial is weak and not well thought out. Basic commands are given in a single tutorial that takes less than 10 minutes to complete. After the tutorial, you're turned loose with a variety of modules for your ship and drones and absolutely no explanation. This absence of handholding is likely intended to serve to distract players from the absence of depth by forcing them to figure out something that is slightly arcane. For instance-- you're given proximity mines and remote detonation mines, but the explanation of how they work is never provided and when you ""accidentally"" set off a remote detonation mine and it kills all of your drones (and the bad guy) in a room because you had no idea what you were doing-- only then in the relife screen does the command help come up to say ""hey, that might not have been the smartest thing you've ever done."" Which brings me to...> After repeated deaths, the tutorials and hints do not get more elaborate to help players along. Because [I surmise that] repeated deaths is the expected play style.> Derelict maps are completely random and non-sensical-- fuel depots with no fuel storage (not just no fuel in storage-- no actual storage)-- tiny ships with a dozen air locks-- gigantic ships with only a single air lock-- no ability to access any airlock you want (until you discover them from the inside of the derelict first)> Maps suffer from another aspect of shallow game design-- there are only doors and airlocks-- no multi-level ships-- no 'force fields' or 'bulkheads' -- no ways to block vents (and thus swarm). No way to replenish charges for modules mid-mission. No way to drop off modules you take from destroyed drones if all of your drones are full.> Drones require air pressure and are as flimsy to space radition as they are to the pitifully diverse enemies.> The cool upgrades are not provided by any kind of story progression or planned arc-- they're entirely RNG. You could get lucky and get them on your relife or you could come across them.> Everything is constantly breaking and any 'income' you are able to generate is sucked up by repairs. This inhibits any attempts to actually 'adapt' and 'survive.'> The software bugs are strong with this one, including issues with the script language not operating sequentially as it is described to operate. (Tell it you want to navigate a drone back to the home ship and then close the doors behind it and the doors will close at the same time the drone starts to move-- the commands are executed in parellel instead of sequantially as described.) (Per the developer, Fuel Depots should have multiple fuel storage but I just ran a fuel depot with a total of 6 rooms (including my ship) and zero storage.) ///[JIL] Initiate emergency distress sequence? [Y/N] y>Sending distress signal.....On the plus side:You have two novel and interesting ways to interact with the game-- although the top-down camera view around each drone could have only been improved if it was made 1st person-- and the top-down schematic view for the entire ship. The grainy-staticky video UI aesthetic, combined with the ultra simplistic line-based schematic view helps with immersion. This game kicks as when it comes to immersion.While some people downplay the command line interface (and it has problems) and point out that there is no mouse based interface, I think it's actually a selling point. Since the game comes with a pretty cool alias interpreter-- you can chain commands together like alias x=close all -- and then, if you run into a swarm or goo, you can just hit ""x"" and enter and the entire map (anything that currently has power) will be locked down. Your forward drone may be sacrificed (since it's tissue paper) but you can respond to a panic situation with ease. But, if you rely on the complex command line interface (without implementing aliases to simplify) you will definitely pay the price when you panic and make typos.And that's about all of the good things I can say about the game.The game would have benefitted substantially from a first-person perspective from the drones. It would have benefitted from multi-level designs. It would have benefited from more complex map components, even in the blender of a procudurally generated map. It would have benefitted from a more complex approach to enemy development; having multiple tiers of enemy strength.More than anything, the game would have benefitted from having some kind of narrative being told, with 20-30 hand-crafted levels that specifically provided certain goods and upgrades-- added to that, if a specific story ship was provided that could be commandered that would provide the player with a greater overall lifespan, that would have been simply perfect.Summary (TL;DR;) Duskers is essentially a Rogue clone with a novel UI presentation. While the UI and thus immersion is both appealing and well done, it only serves to highlight the shallowness of the rest of the game mechanics and story.			"

												Do you look through your list of Steam games at times and have difficulty deciding what to play?You might be reading this because your all-of-the-games-I-own-are♥♥♥♥♥♥fueled search lead you here. Good.Duskers is unlike any game I've ever played before. The immersion. The feeling of helplessness when you make a bad decision and have to abandon your favorite drone (I'll come back for you Qbert, I swear). Or when you're stoked on successfully looting a ship by blowing your enemies out an airlock into space. The sense of urgency when the radiation alert sounds due to a failing airlock, leaving you with only a handful of seconds to retreat to safety. Or when the aging hull creeks a little louder than it did the last time... or did it? Do you continue into the next room in search of more sweet, sweet scrap? What about that disabled drone your sensors picked up in room R14 on the other side of the ship?Buy Duskers before I tell your girl about it and she falls in love with me.			"

Early Access Review
								YES it is in early accessYES it has its quirksYES It is still worth getting in its early stage.I would probably explain this game as a mix between stratagy and dungeon crawler. Stratagy because you have to plan ahead, crawler because you explore dead spaceships that have long been abandond. Sure the graphics are not so good but HOLY CHEEZE this game is tense. Each room had me against the wall scared to death on what would happen to my poor little drones! You cannot control them directly, and it has permadeth. STRESSFULL.Not only that, the enemies have supprized me on a number of occations. The sound design for the enemies has gotten me on a number of occations, and it adds on to the suspence.You also have to do lots of Ellen Riply manuvers in order to survive. This really adds some great replayability, especially with the intruiging story. Sometimes before I board a ship I get occasional messages from an unknown person, witch adds on to the mystery of what is going on and what is happening. All in all, this is a small indie gem full of susspence, suprise and thinking. I enjoy this game. "

Early Access Review
								I can honestly say this game has caught me off guard. I was expecting a rather limited and un-pollished game, but everything I've seen thus far shows to the contrary. Although, I must also admit that once I got this game, for me was hard to put it away once I started playing it. I started playing at night, and before I knew it, it was dawn breaking through my windows. The games art sytle is riviting and gives just the right tone to express a deep and full experiance to what the game develaper is trying to pull off. As you go through the tutorial you'll realize this game only uses keyboard commands, and although for some people that might seem off putting, I can assure you, the game progresses much faster without the use of a mouse. The game also features a command consule window, for those who like to program, this game is a must, however for those of you out there who have yet to jump on the programming waggon, this game serves as a great introduction for basic concept introductoin. The controls over all are very easy to use, and honestly only take seconds to master. I give is a 10/10 for simplicity, a 10/10 for art style, and an over all rating of 10/10 for initial time it takes to get use to the game. A very well made game, with loads of potential still abound.			"

												In all honesty, this game is scary. Not in the boo jump scares, or the obscene imagery. It is do to a lack of what you do not know. You are operating on your ship at the edge of a desk and a computer terminal. You can only guess to what your drones are looking at, emotionlessly at scenes of grisly horror. This brings up the scarier side of science fiction, the end. All civilizations fall. You are doing everything in your power to survive with no real knowledge of what happened, other than every ship you encounter is dead. Whether the machines, aliens, disease, parasites, or just starvation killed these people. You do not witness the horrors, the machines you send in are the sole witness of many of these people's stories.			"

Early Access Review
								I am impressed.At first I balked at the price tag, 20 bucks seemed a little steep for an early access game of this type.  That was about 10 hours ago and I can easily see myself getting 200+ hours of enjoyment out of this game over the next couple of years.  Well worth your time and money.  Great tension, atmosphere, and strategy/management.  This is a good game to accompany Invisible Inc., another procedurally generated stealther.  Duskers is realtime, not turnbased or quasi-turnbased.  Oddly enough I found myself thinking about the old NES game The Lost Vikings while I was playing Duskers.  Perhaps more so than other roguelikes, this game forces you to press on after a failure.  If you aren't willing to accept a sub-optimal outcome, you're never going to visit more than 2 or 3 systems because of all the resetting you're going to do.  This game is all about developing your own strategy and set of best practices that constantly evolve and change with the changing conditions in the derelicts.  Just when you feel like you've got a good rythm going and you can clear out the derilicts without too much trouble...bang!  Swarm of nanobots!  Asteroid impacts!  Radiation leak!  This isn't exactly an action game, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat - and like some of the best games, it punishes you for being careless, lazy, greedy, or hurried.			"

It is quite satisfying to have your team of drones running around, collecting, herding unknown entities into turret traps, and finding new drone friends to fix up and gear out.

Early Access Review
								This game is proof that graphics do not equate to quality, and vice-versa.While it could be argued that the asking price is just a *little* steep, I personally don't feel any buyer's remorse.  Don't let the Steam play-timer fool you, I've played this game extensively on an external hard drive off of my main computer.  With the most bare-bones of background stories given to you at the beginning, you're tasked with figuring out for yourself what happened to everyone, as well as where (and possibly when) you are as you scavenge through scores of abandoned, broken-down, dead husks of ships and space stations with skittish little drones and dilapidated equipment that insists on breaking down on you at the worst possible times.  The UI is simplistic and a bit strange to anyone who didn't grow up in the DOS era, but it's very easy to get the hang of.  The fact that the entire game is played via keyboard (no mouse input), in my opinion, actually adds to the experience.  Couple that with playing the game alone in a dark room, and you can really convince yourself that you're the one piloting these little buggers remotely from your crumbling safe haven aboard a lone starship in a dead universe.I've seen this game described as ""survival horror.""  I don't necessarily agree with such a label, but more than once Duskers has had me nervously edging forward on my seat, holding my breath as I pry open a malfunctioning hatch, terrified of what I might be unleashing on the other side.  More than once the game actually succeeded in making me violently jump in surprise, slamming on the keyboard like an epileptic orangutan with a hyperactivity disorder as I desperately tried to coerce my uncooperative fingers into typing out the chain of commands necessary to save whatever drones I could, slamming hatches shut to keep the unseen horrors from getting aboard my docking ship.After a while, once you figure things out, the game *does* have a tendency to get a little repetitive, but random mishaps keep you on your toes, disrupting your usual routine once in a while and helping break the tedium before it gets bothersome.  Airlocks may fail randomly, your drones' video feeds will cut out leaving you temporarily blind, a section of a derelict's hull may buckle and allow lethal radiation to leak into the ship you're exploring.  There are few times aboard any of the derelicts where you feel truly safe and secure.To Misfits Attic, I say ""bra-vo.""  Keep up the good work.  I look forward to how development of this game progresses.			"

												Duskers is a game where you travel from system to system, dock to derelict ships and space stations and explore them by controlling drones through a command line interface or piloting them directly. You are a lone survivor in space and your goal is to, well, survive and piece together what happened to the rest of humanity from the scraps of information that are left in corrupted ship logs.The Good:+ The atmosphere of this game is amazing. The player is alone in space and severely lacking in resources. Your ship and your drones break down over time. Every bit of scrap and fuel counts, every mistake can quickly result in drone losses and can potentially be your undoing. So you sit there, open a new door and patiently watch the sensors if anything enters from it. No response. Is the room really empty or does the enemy just not feel like moving? Maybe you did not wait long enough? Or you want to enter a new room, but the main video feed showing the layout of the ship breaks down, so you can only see things from the drone's perspective. Is the door you are next to connected to a safe, unexplored room, or the room your sensors show has enemies in it? The tension is real. + Interface design is great. Most things have to be done through an old school command line. As a result, issuing tasks to drones takes time. Time, which the player often does not have as, for example, a swarm of enemies is coming. Trying to type fast results in mistakes, which can be the difference between life and death (for example, is was supposed to open door d15, accidentally opened door d16 - which led to a room open to space due to a damaged airlock. Two drones went flying into the void...). All of this adds to the tension.+ Plot is done in an interesting way. The scraps of information you find provide hints for several scenarios of what might have happened to humanity. That sets objectives for the player, some of them pretty difficult. Here is the thing though - when you fail (lose all drones or run out of fuel), you reset the game. This places you in a different place of the universe, but keeps your progress plot-wise. So even if you fail (and you will), you don't lose what you've achieved so far.The Mediocre~ Difficulty. This game is difficult as it is reaaaaally easy to make a mistake, resulting in the need to restart. Personally I do not mind, BUT you can sometimes get screwed over by random chance, which is not cool. More on that later.~ No definitive answers. As you uncover more information about what happened, you begin to realise there is no clear answer. There are subtle hints as to who the player is, several possible scenarios for the destruction of humanity, but no clear cut solution. I like the way this is, but if you are looking for definitive answers and a feeling of closure, you will be severely disappointed.~ Level design. All of the ships, space stations and outposts are rectangle shaped and flat, though the specific layout is randomly generated. This gets repetitive after a while. Duskers could use more variety in this department. Two ideas to spice things up come to mind: ships with multiple levels of variable size and rooms for specific purpose (engine room, bridge etc.) with loot based on that.The Bad:- Imbalance. There are upgrades both for the ship and for the drones. Some upgrades make the game much easier (Stealth), other are pretty useless (Stun). It doesn't help that some upgrades are basically variants of each other (Trap, Mine and Stun for example)- Random generation. It can ruin some runs for you due to several resons. First of all, some objectives require specific drone / ship upgrades or ships. I once spent several hours travelling the universe to find the Transporter (needed to access Outposts), and when I finally did, the nearest outpost was on the other end of the universe. Secondly, ship layout can often screw you over. Don't want to go into details as to why, but if the starting room is small and has no door open, you might as well just leave. The risk is not worth it. There are also issues with clutter on the ship, which can sometimes block the path to parts of the ship or otherwise provide annoying pathing problems for the drones.Overall, I do recommend the game. It has a slow, methodical pace (aside from short bursts of panic) and a tense atmosphere, which I quite like. However, it is not a game for everyone. The deliberately ""clunky"" interface will scare off many players.			"

												Purchased during ""Early Access"".I don't know how to talk about why I like this game so much without feeling silly, but I am going to do it anyway.You know how in science fiction movies (especially those like Alien), where you would watch people operate various systems and such with funny looking interfaces?  This game seems to be made to engender the same feelings I got when I would watch someone ""work"" on a starship computer.  It is a really neat experience (for me) to type little command linesand watch stuff go.  That's it.  I feel like I'm operating MU/TH/UR.  And I love it.  And if you don't want to type the whole command, it will complete it for you.It has a nice, leisurely pace, cool graphics, neat sound (what little there is), a cool story...and a degauss function.I guess I would  say this has a bit of ""retro-futurism"" appeal to it. The CRT monitor-like graphics andtyping, being a bit quaint?  I dont know.I like it.  It makes me feel like I am actually doing something as opposed to the almost passive way I use a mouse.  So...if you want to type some and look at grainy images, I totally recommend this.			"

												Not sure I can say that this game was satisfying.  Sure, initially the game was enjoyable and a blast to play, but after a while you get used to typing the same commands over and over and seeing repition in the level design.  Eventually, many small bothersome details will stand out to the player, and all of these in tandem spoiled my experience with the game.  For what it's worth, this game is not enjoyable.  Maybe I would go easier on it had it been $10, or even $15, but with its current price tag I can't bring myself to forgive its shortcomings.			"

												I used to design machine control systems in the 80's and 90's and the Duskers interface is exactly like the ones that existed back then - only a LOT nicer.   I say this because it gives the game a feeling of a real simulation.  If there were real robots on the other end that you were controlling it would work exactly the same.  It's a level of immersion that you usually don't get in this type of game.  You have a lot of control over what happens, but when things go bad you'd better have a plan in place because there's no time to think on your feet.  The game rewards careful planning and a systematic approach.   There is constant tension because your robots don't do anything unless you tell them to and typing is your only form of communication.  It makes you both detached and very involved at the same time.  When the unexpected happens, your survival depends on thinking straight and typing straight.  That combination makes each event a nail biter.The randomness of the equipment that you find and the fact that stuff wears makes you constantly adjust your loadouts and strategy.  It's a challenge to outfit a team that's flexible enough to handle whatever you find on each wreck. You don't know the layout until you're already on board, so figuring out what to take and which robot carries what is a mini game in itself.Your robots can swap and equip upgrades on the fly, which is very useful.The command line system is very flexible and you can create aliases to make your own commands.  This is pretty powerful and there's a couple of commands you should definitely make to keep yourself alive longer.  They are  ""run"" which makes all your robots go back to the shuttle, and ""slam"" which shuts all the doors.  Those two commands will usually save most of your robots.  ( I always use robot 4 as my power robot, so my ""run"" command only sends the other three robots back, otherwise the doors won't close if my power robot disconnects)  There are a lot of interesting ways that you can deal with the aliens and as you play you'll come up with some pretty clever solutions.  At first the game mechanics seem pretty simple, but there's a lot of emergent behaviors you can take advantage of to solve problems.There a lot of depth to this game and one thing I really like is that each ship exploration only takes between five and fifteen minutes, so it make a great filler game for when you have a free moment here and there.Giving this a big thumbs up for it's very unique approach, constant tension, and how it encourages creative solutions.

								This game...Do not take my low play time lightly, there are two reasons for this:1) I am trying to save some of the game for the Let's Play I intend to do soon2) I am addicted to this game in college (External Hard Drive)So, without further adieu, allow me to begin to bore you with opinions! :D------------------This game is AWESOME. For anyone who loves to play challenging, time consuming, rewarding and involving games where survival and discovery is written into the very fabric of the game then this is for you! Set in a weird future where we enter a future to discover what happened in the future and prevent the future (I think) this game takes strategy to a whole new level compared to most other Rogue Likes you can find out there. (Looking at you FTL @.@)One of the weirdest things I have found about this game so far is that, despite all logical thought, ""I truly began to care about my drones!""I know, weird right? But all their goofy beeps and bloops really grew on me, to the point where losing one was a hit to the heart. :/ (I will miss you forever Matthew...)Anyways, if you need some gameplay peeps have made some on Youtube already and I will be diving in head first soon also, so keep your eyes out!Peace, and don't let your face be nommed by space virus bug flying annoying fast red bleeps.

So, for those of you who wish to take the journey with me, feel free.

			Views: 904		

			*Note* Duskers released May 18, 2016! Grab it for 10% off until May 25, 2016! I'm excited to see Duskers finally come out of Steam Early Access and fully release.		

My impressions so far are very positive.  The commands are easy enough to remember and the auto-fill feature is nice to speed things up a bit.  Additionally, I liked the ""tank controls"" for the manual movement of the drones.  It feels like it fits the game atmosphere well.  I love the fact that the game is a roguelike, but I am dreading it as well.  RNG is always a difficult thing to deal with.  So, you have to have that love/hate relationship.  :D  I love the visual style, the sound effects, and the need for strategic thinking as you explore.  We'll see how the next few weeks go, as I dive deeper into the game.  :)			"

												I wrote a full review of the released version which can be read on Christ Centered Gaming.https://www.christcenteredgamer.com/index.php/reviews/pc-mac/6231-duskers-pcBelow was written from a build from Steam Early Access:TLDR: My drones are dumb and only do something when I command them to do it.  Will command console again.Claustrophobia is an immediate feeling I get from this game.  And fear.  The same feelings Ripley had as she trawled through vents of the Nostromo listening to the creaks and clunks, wondering if terror is lurking around the corner, as the motion scanner bip-bip-bips away on a vector based fuzzy screen.There are no aliens in Duskers.  No more alive that is.  Only drones.  Which are about as friendly as the Xenomorph in the Alien movie.  In fact the whole universe appears to be barren, made in to a junk yard, with nothing but derelict ships left scattered all around.  With no sigh of organic life, other than yourself (You’re not a robot, right?).You are in command of a ship with limited supplies.  With a handful of drones and a limited amount of supplies there is little chance of survival.  Several wrecks appear on sensors; ready to be boarded one at a time to gather resources and supplies, to fuel your journey out in to space and repeat the process.Your drones board a derelict ship.  It’s not the first time you have done this and you know it’s safe to move out of the airlock and in to the first room.  Lucy, Carl and Wendy sit quietly, awaiting your command.  A few resources are scattered on the floor.  You instruct Wendy to gather them up, while Lucy is commanded to investigate an open door.  As Lucy enters, your view screen flickers for a moment.  You wonder if she is being attacked briefly.  The room is empty and you know it, just a glitch on the monitor.A generator is found in the second room and get Lucy to power it, allowing access to other rooms behind the closed doors.Noises clang and bang around you; the sources out of sight.  It’s several hundred years old; the structural integrity is not what it used to be.  Or perhaps there is a hostile drone wandering around, lurking, deeper inside the ship?There are 3 doors leaving out of the generator room, the one you came in from and the other two closed.  Carl has a sensor which can only be dropped and left to scan the room it’s in.  If only you had a scanner to check the surrounding rooms for movement.You contemplate your two choices.  Turn back or open one of the closed doors to proceed further in to the bowels of the derelict.  You feel lucky today, ready to take on a bit of risk.  You flip a coin and open the door fate has determined for you.  You hold your breath for several seconds, watching the door with your eagle eyes.  Nothing appears.You start breathing normally again.  Typing on the command console, you look away to watch the keyboard, to order Carl through the new route.  Carl chirps as he accepts the command to move through the open door, then a different chirp you hadn’t heard before.  You look up in horror.A drone swarm has surrounded Carl, his life dropping rapidly.  You hastily command all back to the airlock.  Never have you typed so fast before.  Lucy gets swarmed as she tries to leave the room.  The swarm made quick work of their first prey and poor Lucy isn’t going to last much longer.  The airlock door slams shut behind Wendy, closest to the airlock you managed to save her before the swarm could reach their final quarry.  You breathe a deep sigh.  Two drones lost, along with their equipment.  You wonder if the supplies Wendy scooped up will be enough to fix Bob, towed out of the last derelict, to scavenge the next derelict.  It’s gotten lonelier out here.Note: This is a preview of the Early Access Beta.  A key to the beta was kindly provided by Misfits Attic.			"

												Looks and feels fantastic and could have been a deep tactical thinker. Instead, it's like playing russian roulette with 5 bullets -- the game never gives you a fair chance and all your tools are broken by design. Take motion sensors for example: You MAY start with 50 or perhaps even zero. They only work on 1/4 of the rooms to begin with and as the game progresses they become even more unreliable. Do everything right, be fast, careful AND be damned lucky with what chances you take and the game punishes you with random events like the entire ship flooding with radiation that kills everyone. Oh and I almost forget, this is in the beginning of the game. I played for two days and never once got past the second system. Screw this.			"

												The game idea isn't bad but it is repetitive and sometimes grindy to get the upgrades/modules you need to further the logs your collecting. The game does feel too zoomed when controlling the drones manually even if the drones sight view wouldn't be to edge of the screen it would look better to me. The alias system really should be renamed to macro's as was confusing at first what it was.Spoiler-ish: The logs you find are interesting to read but unfortunately they all end up inconclusive. I looked up online later after not being able to further the theories and found out I had all possible log files related to them. I later found a thread where the developer said there would be no clear ending to any of the theories because they didn't want to force an ending on the player. To me this was very wrong to do as the game currently has no ending and you just play until your bored. This happened to me after 10 hours of playing the rest was trying to just get the log files and find the ending. If you want a proper ending avoid this game.			"

												Duskers is outstanding!  The post-interstellar-apocalypse atmosphere and storyline is very enticing, and the way they blend falling-apart technology between aesthetics and gameplay is very convincing without being frustrating.  The occasional glitch (or recurring crash on macs -- search ""rainbow glitch"" on the forums for workarounds) can even seem like a natural occurance.Most importantly, the gameplay is very well balanced, giving the intensity of real challenges and permanent results .  Efficiency and cleverness can get you into a situation where ships seem easy, your fleet and inventory grows, and the storyline rolls along.  Yet a lack of caution or a careless mistake can leave your team of drones decimated and all but destroy your hope to succeed against difficult enemies.  The resulting difficulty keeps things fresh.In healthy rogue-lite fashion, if you do get defeated, you ""Reset"" your ship, starting again with less challenging opposition and less equipment, but continuing the story line where you left off.   The result is a challenging and long-lived game, without overwhelmingly frustrating scenarios.			"

												A great game that invokes a sense of claustrophobia, dread and sadness (At the loss of your precious little drones)Waking up aboard a derelict starship, you control drones from a terminal using a command line interface to explore other ships, stations and planets to not only survive, but to uncover clues as to what happened to everyone and everything.HIGH replayabilityEASY to learn I've lost far too many drones for letting myself get too comfortable and feeling too safe.Great game at a great price.9/10 Would lose a drone to the vacuum of space again			"

Early Access Review
								There are a few game mechanics that I think subtract from the experience a bit. More detailed review and suggestions at http://steamcommunity.com/app/254320/discussions/2/458604254448526590/All things considered, this game easily maintains a high level of realism. However, I don't think that opening an airlock and exposing sections of a spacecraft to vacuum should let in ""radiation,"" let alone flood all connected compartments with radiation permanently. Also, I don't think radiation behaves like a gas, as it does in this game. If the radiation mechanic is there because of the game's story, then fine. But I think it would be much more interesting and fun to treat the radiation mechanic more realistically. I'll be looking forward to a configuration utility to selectively toggle game mechanics on and off, namely radiation. It drives me crazy the way it works currently lol.Roguelike, fun, slow paced puzzle game interspersed with moments of terror. Overall great game, but I feel like the price point is a little high. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.I give this game a tenative but well-deserved thumbs up, 7.5/10			"

												I believe you don't know the true meaning of horror while typing on your keyboard unless you play this game.And what i mean by horror is the unspeakable dangers that lurk inside those derilect spaceships/stations/outpost as you may try to scavange many items, disabled drones, and perhaps gather clues to why the universe seemed to have become an apocalyptic graveyard.   You can only control most of the drone's actions by commands and keyboard arrows, one at at time.  think of this as simple programming.  you give the command for the drone to do it's thing or whatever tools it has. the wrong move or wasted oppurtunity could spell disaster for your exploration endeavors.Oh and infestations aren't the only things that oppose your drone fleet....

Early Access Review
								I'm not a fan of games (in general) that make you type out commands or memorize recipes, mainly because I have a very bad memory and play/review a ton of games.  By the time I come back to a game I've covered, I've often forgotten the basics. I have to say that this game took me by surprise as it isn't as hard as I thought it would be.  It seems as though I got around with just a few basic commands, though there are advanced ones and (thankfully) a help menu available.  My favorite part is trying to figure out how to loot the ships I come across whilst avoiding the enemies, though I have to admit I am also enjoying the discovery aspect as in, what will I come across on the next ship?  Long story short, I can easily give this a recommend.

Product received for free
												Misfits Attic, the developers and publishers of Duskers, have kindly given us a key to review their game. Any opinions are strictly my own.At first sight, Duskers looks like something that you would scroll past, not thinking twice and, if you did happen to think twice and decide to take a closer look at it, you would most likely think “this looks rubbish, I would never play it and it sure as hell doesn’t look like it’s worth twenty dollars.” Although that is an unfair assumption on what may be a very interesting game, we are all guilty of it. Even your neighbor’s cat. This game is a very good example of the common phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover,” because even though you may think it looks old and boring, it is far from it.Upon launch you are greeted by a menu that looks like command prompt, or the interface of an extremely old computer. Extremely old. Think dinosaurs, then think before that. That old. The interface is relatively easy to navigate, that is all I can really say. It doesn’t support mouse input, but with all the shortcuts it is very easy to get use to pressing “P” to play. There isn’t much visual detail, but really, you can’t add detail to something that isn’t meant to be detailed.The next thing you will be greeted by is the map screen, and I would like to point out that after several hours of playing, the game is huge. It took me thirty minutes to get through all of the abandoned ships in one area, then I had to jump to a different one. The second one had twice as many ships to explore, which were more difficult so that took about an hour and thirty minutes. The third took even longer and so on. It is in no way a small game. In fact, it is quite the opposite.The gist of the story is that you are a human stranded in the middle of nowhere, using a computer to remotely pilot some drones into infested ships, trying to gather fuel and scrap to make more trips to more ships whilst trying not to lose your drones to what lurks inside. You hear and see what your bots hear and see through equipment from the 70s, which baffled me a bit at first. At first I thought “space exploration is very clearly a thing of the future, especially travelling through galaxies. It has been nearly fifty years since we first sent man to the moon. We haven’t gone much further than the moon. Where we stand in the tree of technology has come extraordinarily far. Add a few generations onto that and we are exploring other galaxies and supposedly, we are using microphones, monitors and interfaces from the 70s. #RantOver.”I was very wrong to think that, because after actually playing the game, I realised that if it weren’t for the old timey feel of the game, Duskers wouldn’t be the beauty that it is.You control your drones and the surrounding parts of the ship you are searching using commands. For example, d1 opens up “door 1,” navigate 1 r3 orders “drone 1” to navigate to “room 3,” etc. The game consists mainly of these sorts of commands unless you’re manually controlling your drones, which you will need to do frequently to make sure you can easily assist your drone’s escape if it gets into a pickle.Don’t worry, you won’t be restricted to the two examples above for the whole game. They are the commands that you will most likely use the most as they are essential commands, but your bots also come with upgrades. Upgrades add features to your robots, such as generator which has one of your drones use a power inlet to feed power to the surrounding doors, rooms and interfaces, motion which detects enemy motion in the surrounding rooms and drone’s best friend, tow which allows the towing of almost dead drones and other objects back to airlock 1 to return to your ship, and a bunch more that I can’t fit into one review. You can obtain more upgrades by swapping with dead drones that you can find in derelict ships.The infestation is the game’s backbone, what makes it suspenseful and exciting, what makes opening a door scary and what you must constantly be checking for. This is the reason motion is drone’s best friend, because if you don’t check before you open a door and there is an enemy behind it, your mechanical pals might not be coming back. Ever. Duskers being a rogue-like makes it even scarier, one wrong move and you have to start all over again.There are more threats than just the infestation, such as security drones which are just as bad, drone swarms which you should steer clear of at all costs, bacterium which multiplies towards you and leapers, which as their descriptive name states, lunge towards you dealing immense amounts of damage. There are also environmental threats such as the vacuum of opening an airlock causing your drones and enemies to fly out of the room, and radiation, caused by having an airlock or doors blocking already irradiated rooms open for an extended period of time.Don’t worry, hope is not lost if you are in a situation that is going downhill faster than a fat man on a bobsled, there are ways to keep your drones from being destroyed by organic and mechanical life. If you needed to get the enemies out of the room fast, you can use the “Sonic” upgrade, which sends out a sonic pulse that repels organic threats. Maybe you want to attract enemies from nearby rooms to get their attention so you can explore the room they are occupied in, which is when the “Lure” upgrade comes in handy. You can drop a remotely detonated explosive device to blast the threat to pieces if you have the “Trap” upgrade, but if worse comes to worst, which is bound to happen eventually, you can use the “Shield” upgrade which negates incoming damage to the drone that has it equipped (not completely, but maybe just enough to buy you some time.)If you think you’ll have trouble and need a bit of reassurance, there is a “Difficulty Options” section under “Options” where you can change a bunch of stuff. I suggest you don’t, because it takes away the difficult and original “Duskers feel,” but it’s there if you want it.Duskers doesn’t have save/load points, instead it overwrites the other save points with the current one. There is no way to save to an external file so you can re-load if you think you might lose some drones in a ship or have misclicked on something and spent half your scrap fixing a drone you wanted to trash. That means if you make a mistake, you can say goodbye to your game. I ended up accidentally travelling to a ship I had already explored before. Whoops! Bye bye two days worth of fuel.The game is astonishingly (and surprisingly) atmospheric, which I believe to be one of the key elements in any game. Duskers is a great example of something that can be as simple as “controlling some robots through a screen that the 70s thought the future of technology was going to look like” being this amazing.Overall Duskers has impressed me a lot and I’m sure if you get past the common first glance scenario it’ll impress you too. There are a few minor issues here and there but if you get past them Duskers is truly an awesome game. It is an experience you won’t forget any time soon, I certainly won’t.I rate Duskers 9/10 Australian flags.			"

You're transported into a lone, sweating survivor, hopping from ship to ship with the hope tthat you'll find enough to move on to the next... to eventually understand what happened to everyone.

								Duskers is in Early access, so this review is subject to change with the game.Disclaimer - Key for this game was provided by the developer for live-streaming / Review purposes.""Pilot drones into derelict spaceships to find the means to survive and piece together how the universe became a giant graveyard.""The description for Misfits-Attic new game, Duskers.This game had snagged my attention from that description alone.It also tells you everything about the game.A. You control drones.B. Universe is poopered all over the place.C. Unknown Variables that tend to lead to your death.In this game, you start with a merry band of drones. Most often named Sarah, Brandon and Matt for myself. You float your ship up to other not really working ships, stations or military facilities and then you send your drones in, and you scout. You find things to get you to the next ship, if you're lucky. And if you're unlucky there will be a monster, or enemy drone that blasts your drone(s) into oblivion.The game has almost a puzzle like quality to it, where you have to provide power to the ship so you can open and close doors to explore. If you can funnel an enemy into a location where there is a gun and you can interface with the ship, you can kill it. If all else fails you can open an airlock and suck the thing right out. Just make sure your drones aren't in there when you do. Also make sure that you close the doors quickly before radiation floods the ship.The coolest part of this game, to me, is that you control your drones with the arrow keys for movement. Once they're in position you then issue commands via a terminal. If using your arrow keys isn't something you enjoy you can also go to the schematic (overhead) view of the ship and move Donald the wonder drone (drone 1) into room 4 via keystrokes [Example command: Navgiate 1 r4].The game is immersive in a surprising way, from the subtle ship noises to the drones whirring away.On occassion mistakes were made, and I understand why they were my fault. Activating a defense turrent while Drone 1 is standing there tends to end poorly for drone 1. Opening the airlock with your drone there, as mentioned before will suck your drone out to dance with Dave among the stars.First time I did that I forgot to move my ship to a new airlock, and I moved all the drones to the adjacent room to airlock. Opened it, had no more drones.Fwoosh. You're going to start over a lot, but when you have to do so you get to keep the logs you find from the ships, but that's all. After enough exploration or dying, in theory you'll have discovered a wonderful story.If by some miracle you can make it out of the first area (kidding, it's not that bad) then you get to go to new and exciting locales full of things wanting to kill you too. Maybe not full, but exactly where and when you don't want them to be there.There are ship upgrades that you can equip that give you things like better scanners, or the ability to power a point without having to leave a drone on it.The developer is active in terms of replying, as well as when I was streaming it they came to sit in and see how I would solve problems, offering advice and tips where applicable.At the time of this writing, this is another Indie game that caught me off guard, and I'm glad it did.Were anyone to ask me if I would recommend this game, I would say yes. Without a doubt. It has provided me with moments worth remembering, some,  if only because I had failed.I can't wait to continue to get lost in space.			"

Early Access Review
								I recommend the game, but I'm also biased because I'm really into programming. It's a space roguelike, proceedurally generated which means the difficulty will fluctuate depending on luck, and with a refreshingly minimalist visual style.In some ways the game is still somewhat unforgiving; there is permadeath and on the overworld screen I pressed enter and acidentally jumped to another galaxy, which spent all of my fuel, so I wish I'd been asked for confirmation first.Besides the unfinished aspect and an odd crash when trying to record using fraps, it offers quite a bit of charm. I'll go into the highlights first.1. It's real-time. Turn-based games are beginning to show their age and this instead has several time mechanics; a stealth tool that drains as it is used, enemy AI that moves from room to room, radiation that damages your drones and infiltrates rooms until you close the door, time-sensitive events such as a door suddenly becoming inoperable, etcetera.2. It's all about finding more fuel. I expect a magical fairy will not land to give you more fuel when you run out going to a rig that didn't have any more for you despite your praying, and so each jump to another node needs to be calculated in advance. While this isn't convenient, it gives the game some realism, and makes you think about what it might be like operating a real drone out in space somewhere and how to make your sparce resources work (Think Apollo 13).  3. It reminds me of the matrix. The third movie, that is, since the matrix number 1 and 2 were not really robotic but rather about virtual reality. But I suppose green lettering is really all I've got to back that up.4. The command system is intuitive. You can type ""Na 1 3"" and it means navigate drone 1 to get to the room drone 3 is in. It auto-completes. It generates. It tows the husk back to the ship. This is very necessary really since nobody really wants to just play a tow-truck simluation. (Airport simulator cough cough). Instead the foundation has been laid for good things.some gripesThe fraps crash issue... it couldn't resolve some resolution bug.The lack of confirmation screens and/or random disasters just being a game-over scenario.Almost painful visuals. Yes I know that it's perhaps part of the appeal, but I'd rather look at grey walls than neon lights. Having said that, textures have been done already, and so a game that provides us with maximal gameplay and minimal fuss is pretty neat.Here, see my video:

												Duskers is to Alien what FTL is to Star Trek. I think that sums is up pretty well. I just had my first big meltdown. I was being cocky, leaving all the doors open behind me. Well when an alien swarm got loose that didn't help a bit. They took down the drone powering the derelict, which made me doubly screwed. One drone with stealth hauled♥♥♥♥♥off the ship, dragging my disabled power drone with it on the way out while the other two were attacked. My heroic stealth drone went out to try and tow someone else back to safety, but he never made it back... Maybe I can repair my downed power drone and go back for a daring rescue...			"

Too bad, the drone you just lost was the one defending the generator...So you want to escape! But you really needed this fuel units...Maybe if you go there quickly with your last drone...And when you finally got the fuel you wanted, you still have to go back to your ship!...By the way, is it normal that the airlock just behind you is blinking red???...And you just lost your last drone! :DSeriously, the game is really fun! You just have to be good at typing words really quick on the keyboard if you want to survive...By the way, I'm myself a network engineer, and the feeling of the drones console really feels like network devices command line ! If you ever use the console mode of a Cisco device, you will love this game !!! ;)			"

												This is a cerebral game that challenges you to logically think your way through problems while carefully weighing the costs and benefits of each choice. Suspense is maintained through  increasingly difficult systems and each playthrough never quite the same. Fallout players will appreciate the scavenge-upgrade-break-repair side of the game and sci-fi fans will love the carefully crafted atmosphere and continual updates from the committed developer. Load it onto a USB and play it in the library between classes if you like, but don’t be surprised if you catch yourself playing it till 3am on an expensive rig that’s built to run your other $500 in “high end” games. You have been warned.Duskers dumps you in the middle of a post-apocalyptic futuristic universe where everyone seems to have disappeared for no reason. Follow the trail of logs and you’ll find the creepy stories and notes that piece together what happened, or you can just fly around looting and booting. Some updates can make it difficult to get the ball rolling, like when a sudden radiation leak wipes out your drones or it suddenly becomes impossible to find fuel. There's not much in the way of a tutorial either, and the trial and error can be frustrating at times.It’s remarkable that so much can be accomplished with so little. And not from a Minecraftian “just get used to everything being cubes” point of view either. You actually feel like you’re running a makeshift drone salvage operation from a crappy monitor right after society bought the farm.You will laugh. You will cry. Your typing will improve. And you’ll never make it to Diamond City. Example:You begin on your ""ship."" Mind you, it's represented by a 2D map of where you currently are in your local volume of space. You’re low on jump fuel, and experience has taught you that it’s most commonly found on space stations. There’s one on the other side of the system, but that’ll cost you four of your six remaining propulsion. You could also try your luck with the two abandoned salvage ships that lie between you and the space station. There might be a a replacement for poor “Wall-E” the drone who was accidentally blown out the airlock on your last salvage run (not speaking from personal experience). You’re feeling ballsy, so you hit “t” and catapult your starship across the system toward the station, which is instantaneously registered in-game by the green triangle disappearing from your current location and reappearing at the station. Great. Your palms sweat in anticipation.Looking over your readout, you see that it’s a Class “B” Station, which you’ve come to understand is usually about 20 large rooms and a few hallways laid out in a square or rectangular fashion with lots of airlocks to dock to around the edges. A lot of ground to cover, and easy territory to lose a drone in, but the wreck’s only 121 days old with 2 infestations, so there won’t be too much radiation leaking through the hull and there won’t be too much “wildlife” to worry about. The eerie atmospheric hum is starting to get to you.You hit “board,” which brings up your drones and the names you’ve given them. “Tom” is your front man with a stealth module that lets him go where he pleases without drawing aggro. You found his assistant, “Jerry,” a few runs a go. He’s more triangular in shape and you’ve added quite a few speed boost modules and a tow attachment so he can loot the rooms that “Tom” has cleared. “Zoidberg” has a power generator that powers the doors and consoles on the ghost ships you board with. For the most part, he sits in the room with the power inlet while you play chess with the rest of the map. You wish that he had died, not Wall-E.Your drones are repaired 100%, you have all the modules you need, and you’re ready to go. You hit *Enter*, the screen goes black, and there’s a loud clack of metal and hydraulics as you dock with the ghost ship. A detailed readout comes up  that would normally tell you if the ship was a pirate, military vessel, or other designation, but this is a space station, so there’s not much to tell. *Enter* A fade from black bring up a top-down view of your ship’s pitifully small drone hold, small box connected to an airlock with nothing but the the black unknown beyond it. Tom, Jerry, and Zoidberg await you command in iridescent blue text. Typing *stea” auto completes to “stealth” and Tom’s corresponding module begins slowing ticking down from 100%, rendering him invisible. *a1* Airlock One opens, represented by the splitting of a yellow box labeled as such. The console reads out “Commencing Salvage Operation.”*1* You take manual control of Drone One (Tom), your camera centering and following the little object. Using the arrow keys, you steer “Tom” into the unknown, a small beam lighting the walls and debris in front of him.He’s through the airlock. *a1* Airlock One closes, trapping him in.There’s nothing amiss in the first room (r1), so you *a1* and *nav 2, 3*, calling Jerry and Zoidberg into the room. The AI takes over and the other two bots smoothly glide into the room to join you.*stealth* Tom’s stealth module deactivates.*gen* auto completes to “generator” and the drone that carries it, “Zoidberg,” saunters over to the power outlet and powers it up. There’s a whirring noise and the map of the ship lights up, or at least the rooms that are powered now, anyway.You motion scan the next room and it brings up nothing, so it’s probably safe. You send 2 back into your ship and lock the door on him so if something comes charging into the room when you open the door you’ll only lose Tom and Zoidberg. There’s nothing hostile in the next room and there’s no vents for radiation or “fly swarms” to leak in from other parts of the ship. You call in Jerry to pick up the Scrap lying on the ground and link up to the computer console on the wall with his interface module.With power and an interface, the console tells you the rest of the layout of the station, where the remaining scrap is, and, ooooooooo-- a nice looking pile of jump fuel two rooms over. You run a motion scan and two harsh beeps and some frantic red scan lines tell you that there’s something nasty in the next room over. You could go around it, using an adjacent hallway, but you’d rather go through it and kill the thing. You don’t have any weapons to engage whatever’s in there, but there’s an airlock in an empty adjacent room. Someone’s about to go the way of Wall-E.*c14* The door between the infested room and the empty room opens and a few seconds later the baddie takes the bait and moves into the new room. *c14* Now he’s sealed in and the path to the jump fuel stash is open. But hey, this is your station now.*a5* You “air out” the monster’s room, setting off alarm chirps and warning messages that room 6 has been exposed to the vacuum. Flashing yellow hatch marks fill the room. *Smile*.*a5* The airlock closes before the red laces of radiation can leak in. The yellow lines flash more slowly as atmosphere is restored. Scans show that the room is clear.A hot minute later, Jerry is slurping up all of the jump fuel goodness that the station  has to offer. A warning message comes up: “Asteroids incoming” with a list of rooms that can be hit and the likelihood that they will be hit and exposed to the vacuum. The current room is rated at 84% chance of impact. Time to go. *dock a5* Your ship undocks from a1 and reappears docked to a5, shortening the trip for your drones to return. *a5; nav all r1* a5 opens and all of your drones autonomously make for the mother ship. *exit* You ship undocks and you live to fight another day.Enjoy this great game and don’t be shy about converting anything you don’t need into scrap. You won’t regret it.Good hunting.			"

No no r2's too narrow""Drone 3 destroyed, Drone 2 taking substantial damage""They're cut off! I can't do something""close a1 ; exitThis game, Duskers...... Only what 7 min......the flipping drama of keeping all your drones, then everything hits the fan ducts. You can't type in the console fast enough to get serial commands through.. - So you jettison your ship from the derelict airlock leaving the wreckage of what you knew was the closest thing to search party.You can't see what hits you. You can't save them. You can't lose the ship. You can not advance....It was just 7 mins... It was just one derelict... It was just one unseen shadow....Given that I've played my share of survival horrors and strategy - what a shellshock. The horror of making a decision in helplessness and surprise. In the very first minutes of getting the game.  Stunning in the most crawl-into-your-ship-room-and-shiver-over-the-wreckage.However experience does kick in, when you notice the random play and bleak scenario that can make turns and runs more a crapshoot than a fitting risk and reward. My very play is proof as I got a very moviesque run right from the jump. If Misfit can stratify the randoms and generation - this will make Dusker very good the long run as player's detective sense will start wanting to kick in and unravel the ""world"". Moments of relief should be too hard to fight for when you always playing in hostile territory.I'm curious what balances will come next. As this is an core review, Duskers fits very well in the sci-fi library of players and I hope the it will get the key additions to further age this title into even more of great play.P.S. Players, please don't burn out trying to get that good play, this game IS harsh - take your time "

												A lot of potential. Intriguing and interesting. However, there's no storyline, no ending at all. You just do pretty much the same thing all the time: explore derelict ships using drones that break down too fast. The game needs an ending and perhaps variation to escape boredom. The first 10 hours of gameplay are really interesting, though.			"

												Excellent roguelike. Simple to play, hard to master. This game has a very slow pace to it. You will be spending a long time slowly progressing through this game, and once you learn how to manage your drones, what upgrades to bring, when to flee, when to be greedy it will become a smooth experience. Once you explore a few ships you will experience all this game has to offer (for the base gameplay). But the adventure and lore is very interesting. The risk of opening one more room without the proper tools is exciting, and most always makes me lose a drone.The minimalist visuals and UI make for a very imaginative experience and you get lost in the management of the drones and planning.Highly recommended. For 20$ you get game with a great amount of replayability and things to discover.			"

Quick Summery+Game delivers the experience really well.-The graphics will put people off, but I think they will miss out.+Delivers shocks and tension better than a lot more expensive games.-The control methods is not going to appeal to everyone.However I think the controls are fundamental to the experience.Initial ImpressionsThis game is really fun Sci-Fi puzzle game. You can say it is a rogue like in some ways as there is an element of death and having to restart. But you are often able to come back from mistakes so I don't think this is the kind of game that fits the rogue like genera as most people would define it. While you can be killed because of a mistake much later on, the game isn't so brutal as to kill you immediately unless you are really unlucky. There is an element of luck to it for certain, but you really need to think of what to do with the information you have and weigh up the risks as well. You may find that pushing to get something extra or exploring 'one more room' is not worth what it could costs you. It may sound silly, but leaving with what little you found is often the smart thing to do than risking one more room and losing a valuable drone(s) or much more.The game is seen primarily via the terminal of your ship or through the augmented cameras of your drones as you manually control them. The only true image you have is this drone camera which also provides the sounds of the ship or station you are exploring. While normally this kind of disconnect usually reduces the impact of things that happen in the game. This limitation instead manages to genuinely make exploration tense and far more foreboding. This forced reliance on your drones for your survival makes you really fond of your drone team. At the start you'll have three named drones which you can rename if you desire. Each drone will have different equipment equipped and may vary in some stats (health seems to be the main stat difference early on). They also have different designs and can look unique amongst themselves, which helps give them 'personalities'. Making one drone your explorer and another a recovery drone will entail different levels of affection and a strange bond forms because of this. It may be more to do with what each drone has equipped and what their loss will mean initially. But after a while you'll not want to lose them, or at least I didn't.My first exploration drone was called Anthony and he was a brave little soul. He would go delving into unknown rooms that I wasn't always sure if they were safe or not without complaint. Stupidly at one point I accidentally killed him with the defence gun of a ship I was exploring. I had forgotten to disable it before I moved him into the room to pick-up scrap and he got killed because of my input blunder. I dutifully sent in Derek who had a Tow to recover him and take him home to the ship. While Anthony wouldn’t be used during the rest of the ship exploration I was glad he wasn't lost to me. He had done his job so many times I had genuinely grown fond of him and his three friends who had been with him for so long. Perhaps it's because I am reliant on them so much that they feel like important members of the crew, and while they are fundamentally replaceable they had earned my respect. I ended up losing my entire team and failing at a later stage due to my own errors. This fondness however had changed how I approached problems and exploration and I assume from now on I may play completely different again.The graphics are really great for what they are representing. But I don't think they will appeal to a lot of people because at a glance it doesn't look like much at all, and they may just dismiss this game. Which is frankly a real shame as it is genuinely a really unique experience to play and it manages to deliver more tension and shock than a lot of horror games have done in a while. The game sets out to do something and it does it really well, it reminds me a lot of the Alien films and games. The premise is one of real interest and lends itself to the idea of trying to survive against the unknown. All without hugely expensive graphics and effects, with really simple and well thought out designs.The Drones are controlled via command line inputs, and while you can manually navigate you will always use the command line to interact and pick-up things. For a lot of people this will be a really annoying thing and I can imagine a lot of people will feel the controls could be changed. But I think the controls are central to how you play the game and the experience as a whole. It is very close to what the poor survivor is using and creates the feeling of having no real direct control on your fate and reliant on the drones is the key thing that makes this experience work as well as it does.

Early Access Review
Really fun rogue-like experience. I hate when people compare games to certain titles that are destined to be classics such as FTL or Binding of Isaac because it almost feels like people are trying to lure that particular crowd into something lesser. In this case, I can definately feel FTL in here. Not anything near a copy, just that addictive space kind of deal. Essentially, Duskers has the anxiety of the Aliens movies with the VHS camera fuzz and unknown things moving through dark corridors. You are working through what looks like a DOS prompt terminal. You use keywords to control the drones. The main problem with this game is that you cannot capture the awesomeness through LetsPlays or trailers. Trust me, I watched hours of this to try to find out why its getting rave reviews. I was bored watching it - but fortunately playing it is a whole other deal.Pros:+Really fresh game mechanic that creates awesome puzzles+Commanding the drones through the prompt makes you feel like a boss. A hacker boss to be precise.+Graphics work and minimal sound are great+Uncovering the story of what happened is really cool and edgy+Quite addictive - 'just one more go' kind of game+I love games where all you need is the keyboard - perfect for laptopsCons:-It is expensive, which makes it difficult for people who are on the fence (perhaps they should have a one level demo)-I am just entering mid-game, so I am sure more will come up I see myself playing alot of this.

								A delightful throwback that will have you cursing Mavis Beacon's name as your fingers betray both you and your faithful drones.  It's remarkable how some very rudimentary (not primitive, rudimentary) imagery and clever game play really build a feeling of desperate isolation and dread.  Behind every airlock and door could be death or salvation.  But it's salvation that's short lived, as you must keep scavenging to survive.  It's not  a matter of IF everything will stop working and leave you stranded in the inky black, but WHEN.			"

								I still only somewhat know what I'm doing, but I was instantly mesmerized by the game.  As a prorgrammer who grew up in the 80s, the DOS-like (or bash-like if you prefer) environment, and handy features like autocomplete for text you're typing, really show a very solid attention to detail.It does feel a bit strangely quiet at the moment right now (no music at all), and I'm not sure if that's intended or not.  It's certainly creepy.  But the sounds beyond that are quite good, although I understand from the dev progress bar thingy that more is to come.The graphics really do make me feel like I'm looking into The Matrix in a lot of ways.  It's sort of what I imagine you might get to see as a blind person with really bad prosthetic eyes.  This is, of course, the point -- differnet of your robot guys have different sorts of vision and different sensors, and that definitely gives a varied feel to each.I like the way that I can detect enemies in a nearby room and then do things to encourage those enemies to leave that room and go somewhere else.  I have no idea what they are or what their danger is, but either way I don't want to meet them, and I don't.  So far. ;)This definitely has a feel unlike anything else I've played before, and I will be playing more, no question.			"

												Duskers is a game about exploration, with a similar 'gather scrap to survive' theme to FTL, set in a post-apocalyptic decaying universe. The game's uniqueness lies in the way you interact with the derelict vessels you scavenge from - rather than set foot on them yourself, you control a number of drones remotely via keyboard commands, viewing the ships via a top-down schematic. The drones' different abilities are provided by modules that break down over time, meaning you have to react inventively to an ever-changing situation. Obviously, the ships aren't totally deserted, and avoiding the various unpleasant inhabitants means treading a fine line between fear and greed - you'll run out of resources if you play it too safe, but greed will get you killed very quickly.Duskers is a superbly atmospheric game with a randomly-generated 'campaign' as well as daily and weekly challenges. Although the game will throw surprises at you, it never feels unfair - if things go wrong, it's probably your fault, either through carelessness or greed. If you relish the tension of Alien and you fancy a roguelike that's a bit different, Duskers is definitely recommended.			"

												I have been watching this on let's plays for around a month just waiting for a sale to buy this game, it looked so cool and immersive to me! I loved the style of strategy and the gritty computer graphics and just the concept in general of this game, it really has a unique beauty! However I am a computer science graduate student… I like console command stuff… BUT this game is not hard if you can understand how a basic command set works like “navigate 1 to r5” aka move droid 1 to room 5 then you’ll do fine! Seriously worth buying and trying out for the concept and experience alone. My one thing I don’t like about this game is 20 bucks is steep for the content for me personally, I purchased this on sale for 16 and well… I think 15 is an appropriate full price for this game. It is truly fun and unique but 20 is just kinda high.To sum it up, Duskers is an awesome fun game with unique gameplay and cool techie mechanics. If you can spare the 20 dollars it’s a very satisfying experience even if the price is a bit high.			"

												Duskers is quite the gem of a game. It's very sure what it wanted to be and aimed for it, and I can assure you that it is every bit as fun as it is tense. And oh boy, does it get REALLY TENSE. We're talking your abs are tighter than you ever thought possible with sweat on your brow, all the while your fingers are shakingly awaiting the immediate and sudden need to belt out a command to slam a door shut to save your drones from certain destruction.Meanwhile, or even when this is NOT happening, you are pensive. Scared, since every single room could be the very last you ever open. Relying on equipment that may be working perfectly, but will eventually start going faulty, and may even fail entirely mid mission, forcing you and your terrified little harem of drones must adapt to the situations at hand.Weapons exist, but are few and far between. I have yet to find even one that wasn't a mine or trap of some kind. That aside, you have your brain, your other tools such as motion sensors, the ability to access destroyed ship terminals to scan for items, scraps which are used as currency and are also the only way to repair or buy anything, or use the defense turrets (If there are any) to remove the hostile entity. (There are more than one. I've encountered 3 different types so far.)The enemies have this air of mystery about them. since the only way for you to ""see"" the world is through the grainy, often glitchy camera of your drones, it only adds to the suspense as you inch closer to what could be your next big pay off, or your last inch you'll ever inch.The atmosphere is spectacular, the premise is nothing NEW with the whole ""Last man alive? In space!"" situation, but it's executed in such a unique way, being that you are NOT the save-it-all badass solution to the problem, but rather, more frail than your very own drones.All of this, and you feel like you're actually the guy running the drones because they game operates entirley through an interface similar to the command prompt on any PC.I absolutely love this game. It's one of the only rouge-likes I've ever enjoyed. Even with the deaths being permanent, and there is no real progress aside from the mystery to solve (Which you keep uncovered logs per death) there are no levels or stat progression. Only you, the upgrades you put on your drones, and your skill as an operator.In a way, this reminds me of Dark Souls. Vaguely, with that similar feeling of ""No matter what, move forward.""Because in the end, when all is dark and hopeless, will you sit and whimper, awaiting your inevitable demise as all that you knew fades into the deep, endless blackness of space? Or will you cling to life, and crawl your way to the answers you seek?After all, is it not but our fate as humans to ever be drawn towards knowledge? Even if you are the last human alive, wouldn't you like to know the answer? ""What happened to everyone? How did the galaxy become a graveyard?""TL,DRFantastic atmosphere, very few games beat it in my eyes. Even Triple A.Amazing execution for a simple idea.Intriguing story that poses itself more as a question to be answered.Rouge-like elements are solid.Your game has an effect that you can toggle, that makes it look like you're on an old CRT style screen.>navigate all r1navigating all drones to r1>a1airlock 1 closed>exitare you sure you want to disengage boarding with this vessel?

								Duskers is a roguelike dungeon crawler in which you remotely control drones to salvage derelict space ships.  Upgrade your ship and drones as you survive and outhink the various enemies.The art style is very ""programmer"" and nicely done.  You issue commands to your drones through a text console.This game is very unique and quite challenging. I highly recommend it.  This review was done in the early access state of the game.			"

												this game is amazing, the style of play with the top view tank controls, with the simultaneous typing to open doors to try to escape whatever horrors you find beyond the doors of the hollow starships. this game creates an amazing atmosphere by tapping into the fear of unknown, the game has different types of enemies and it wont tell you what type is beyond the door, you might find a (these are my names for them i dont know their actual names) phantom, a leaper, or a robot. and each has its own ai, and without knowing what it is you will have to rely on luck to not die. for instance the phantoms can sort of see you when you go invisible, meaning your screwed if you try and avoid it using that, plus the cryptic and corrupted messages that have unitelligible words, that you can try and figure out using context clues or using what few unaffected letters were left in the word, all in all I LOVE THIS GAME. you should totally buy it.

												Duskers is a... unique game.The ""retro-futuristic"" feel is something I find very appealing, the idea of getting out into space not equipped with the best technology, or at least not the best software. Gameplay can become fairly repetitive, as all resource managing games (or the specific sub-genre of wander through the universe in your space ship) tend to do. The true meat of this game is scavenging though, not resource management; after all tere are only so many things to do with the two kinds of resources you find. Scavenging is strategic, careful, planned, and tense. You have to be careful not to lock your drones in, cut them off from escape, release threats, or leave anything untouched. The threats (and how to deal with them) is where Duskers shines, the magic trick being hiding a game in the vein of Alien (the movie, the first one) inside Out There or FTL.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutely fantastic if you love Rogue-like games. The mechanics are brilliant, and the subtle world building is pretty much on point throughout. It's the first rogue-like where I don't want to look up any strategies/story elements so that I can really uncover them myself organically. Cannot recommend this enough.A slightly longer breakdown: (tl dr: Failures are your own fault, but make more interesting choices)The extra level of abstraction between ""you"" and your interaction with the world really makes the game outstanding. At times you feel like a puppetmaster as you scoure the ships and stations with efficiency, removing and avoiding threats. And then in the next moment you'll open a door without thinking and it comes crashing down. It leaves you with just enough time to realize what's happening, but maybe not enough to save yourself. And when you do slip the game doesn't just end the decision tree. Instead you have the chance to fix your mistake, provided you're clever enough (an brought some common tools).Also check out alias, it lets you make your own commans, which is great for automating some of your routine tasks & creating emergency protocol.

												At this stage Duskers shows huge potential. The roguelike is perhaps fustrating but we have gotten used to rather easy games. Duskers change this. From the constant break down of upgrades, drones, video feed and with enemies in every ship you're pumping with adrenaline at each door opening.With that said I am also getting a LOT of bugs. From crashing to distorted views I have had to quit multiple time in the short playtime I have had. Combine that with the roguelike of the game and you find yourself unable to enjoy Duskers. Such a shame. If this is fixed I would definitly recommend it.			"

												As if XCOM, FTL, and DOS BOX had an orgie and the result was this exact situation.PROSAmazing original design - The basic game play loop is clear spaceships and scrounge for resources by using your drones all the while evading and destroying enemies, expand the capabilities of and maintain your crumbling space ship with your limited (and I mean LIMITED) resources, make strategic decisions about where to go next based on objectives and fuel and solve the mystery of what happened to your universe by uncovering various data logs and completing special objectives. If you haven’t tried it I would HILGHLY RECOMMEND this game if you are into indi rouge likes. At least check out an LP of it, if you don’t think its worth the asking price.

			In Duskers you pilot drones into derelict spaceships to find the means to survive and piece together how the universe became a giant graveyard.		

PROSTense game play - You will have to use all of your senses and concentration to not die. Isolate threats, blow enemies out of air locks, stealth or shoot your way through randomly generated space craft to grab fuel and scrap. Perma death is a very real where just one little mistake can lead to complete disaster.Cool Meta Game – Upgrade repair and maintain your ship, its equipment and your precious drones between missions. This area of the game is really cool, and the decisions you make here will determine your chance for success in the tactical view. Explore the universe and try to unravel the mystery of why you’re the only one left in it. Your♥♥♥♥♥♥is going to break, a lot, so be careful in what you repair and when. There is a ton of depth in the strategic screen; it really reminds me of xcom. Prepare carefully and you will have success. That is until you leave a door open and inadvertently let aliens destroy your drones because you weren’t’ paying attention!Slick controls- You have the ability to script bot behavior using dos like commands or control them directly with arrow keys. Instead of clicking buttons to activate abilities you have to type something like : Navigate 1 R2; gather all 1. It really helps with the immersion and feeling generally that you are alone on this spaceship sitting at your console using your robots to scour for resources. The way you control them is both intuitive and super cool!  When you try to use your mouse the game gives you an unsatisfying beep, and nothing happens. This game is nearly completely keyboard controlled, and it really is very cool and different!Critical thinking skills required - Each level is basically a logic puzzle as you clear enemies and space ships. You have to take calculated risks and use your drones ever changing abilities to clear rooms. The game really forces you to pay attention to every detail on every move in both the tactical and strategic screens. Each move has both risk and reward. A successful run requires you to calculate both accurately.CONSThere is only one real con to the game, and that is that the objectives to actually beat the game are not very well laid out. If your going in blind and you don’t read the wiki it is tough to figure out how to go about solving the games plot. You will get data logs telling you to do certain tasks. Like go to a specific type of craft and scan all the rooms. There isn't a real good way to track what needs to be done. This con doesn't detract from the fun of the game, as you are mainly trying to figure out how to just survive, let alone completing the objectives. It would be nice if this was fleshed out a little more.SAVINGI don't know if this is just me but I noticed that I was unable to save from the tactical view.  You can’t really save state, but if you exit the game it will save your current progress. However if you save in the tactical view it will not save and boot you back out to the ship screen. This could be fixed in later updates hopefully. Just save AFTER a mission, and you will be ok!			"

												TL;DR great idea but game as it is at the moment is not worth 20€The game has a great idea and it would be fun to play as a side game for 3-10€. However there are bugs and downsides that just makes this game feel like some demo your game developer friend send you: The alias editor writes an S to the file when you press ctrl+S (for saving the file). I know this is just a small bug and bugs happen all the time when programming, however this is a bug that everyone should notice when testing the feature he just implemented When starting the game the default Unity Launcher appears. This is generally not a bad thing if it would have an actual use however screen resolution could be easily set ingame, graphics dont seem to change anything and the input section consists 90% of ca. 50 times the same setting ""Take screenshot"": F12 When looking at a wall and pressing W to move forward with your drone you constantly bug into the wall a bit and out again. This a VERY common thing you see in many small Unity games however this is NOT what I would expect from a 20€ game. The game does not explain essential parts of it. A very common feature in the game is the upgrade failure rate. One might think if you use a Motion sensor with failure rate of 20% chances are 1/5 the result is wrong etc. However it actually means there is a 1/5 chance that AFTER the mission that it will be gone. The worst part about this is that the creator is aware of this misunderstanding https://redd.it/4j4iuf "

												Without a doubt one of the most pulse pounding, gut wrenching sitting at a keyboard simulators. The noises one hears through a microphones of their drones, the buzzing of space flies, screaming of spiked pixel monsters and the agonzing screams of the damned coming through the airvents as you try to navigate, loot and maybe comandeer long forgotten ships is without a doubt frightening.I suggest trying out every tool as quite a few are better than others, along with an enemy variaty that are made to counter specific tools and playstyles.10/10, suggest clicky keyboard for immersion sake.Personal gripes, wish more drone models, vision and beeps were available as these certainly repeat and upset over the lack of seasonal skins besides halloween.

Each playthrough is just as fun as the last, and the graphics and controls used really drive the whole experience home.Update:I've been getting better, my best recommendations to new players, use the heck out of stealth, take everything incredibly slowly,a ways close doors behind you, keep uneeded drones in the ship away from possible danger.

								This game is fun and rewarding. The developer has obviously put a lot of thought into this project, and it will be great to see the finished product. Especially, I am looking forward to (hopefully): better AI pathing when using the navigate command; a slightly shallower difficulty curve re: module failures occuring not at all to multiple failures within a few minutes of exploration (several drones lost multiple modules while powered down and still in r1, with a1 closed, which doesn't feel realistic to me); more module variety and more upgrades for the modules; differences between drone bodies, besides the outline and report sound, like speed vs starting hp, etc.; more compelling reasons to commandeer ships than just mission completion/ upgrade slots, like special perks on different ship types; tweaks to the console input for better keyboard response and maybe some visual options like placement and text color, etc.; more variety in early mission ship layouts so it doesn't feel redundant when restarting. Otherwise the gameplay is solid if a little daunting at first. I rarely take direct control over the drones any more unless it is at the start of the mission, since you have to unless the first room is revealed, or when needing to position a drone in a specific way.

								This dystopian future space exploration game is very strategy and risk/ reward ratio oriented. You control up to four drones at a time either by the arrow keys or by using the game's command line interface. This command line is actually very easy to use and offers to autocomplete most commands after typing just the first few characters. Anyway, you are stuck in space with  nobody around you besides old security bots and several kinds of aliens hiding in the old  derelict space crafts scattered around the universe. You must scavenge these ships to keep your drones and ship running. If your drones are put out of commission, ""Its game over, man. Game over!"" You will get sucked into the game as you can only watch from afar as  hostile aliens or bots (as far as I can tell, none aren't  hostile)  rip your drones to pieces or as a critical upgrade fails when you thought it could last just a little bit longer. Overall, this is a great game. GG Misfits Attic!			"

Perma death is a very real where just one little mistake can lead to complete disaster.Cool Meta Game – Upgrade repair and maintain your ship, its equipment and your precious drones between missions. This area of the game is really cool, and the decisions you make here will determine your chance for success in the tactical view. Explore the universe and try to unravel the mystery of why you’re the only one left in it. Your♥♥♥♥♥♥is going to break, a lot, so be careful in what you repair and when. There is a ton of depth in the strategic screen; it really reminds me of xcom. Prepare carefully and you will have success. That is until you leave a door open and inadvertently let aliens destroy your drones because you weren’t’ paying attention!Slick controls- You have the ability to script bot behavior using dos like commands or control them directly with arrow keys. Instead of clicking buttons to activate abilities you have to type something like : Navigate 1 R2; gather all 1. It really helps with the immersion and feeling generally that you are alone on this spaceship sitting at your console using your robots to scour for resources. The way you control them is both intuitive and super cool!  When you try to use your mouse the game gives you an unsatisfying beep, and nothing happens. This game is nearly completely keyboard controlled, and it really is very cool and different!Critical thinking skills required - Each level is basically a logic puzzle as you clear enemies and space ships. You have to take calculated risks and use your drones ever changing abilities to clear rooms. The game really forces you to pay attention to every detail on every move in both the tactical and strategic screens. Each move has both risk and reward. A successful run requires you to calculate both accurately.CONSThere is only one real con to the game, and that is that the objectives to actually beat the game are not very well laid out. If your going in blind and you don’t read the wiki it is tough to figure out how to go about solving the games plot. You will get data logs telling you to do certain tasks. Like go to a specific type of craft and scan all the rooms. There isn't a real good way to track what needs to be done. This con doesn't detract from the fun of the game, as you are mainly trying to figure out how to just survive, let alone completing the objectives. It would be nice if this was fleshed out a little more.SAVINGI don't know if this is just me but I noticed that I was unable to save from the tactical view.  You can’t really save state, but if you exit the game it will save your current progress. However if you save in the tactical view it will not save and boot you back out to the ship screen. This could be fixed in later updates hopefully. Just save AFTER a mission, and you will be ok!			"

												TL;DR great idea but game as it is at the moment is not worth 20€The game has a great idea and it would be fun to play as a side game for 3-10€. However there are bugs and downsides that just makes this game feel like some demo your game developer friend send you: The alias editor writes an S to the file when you press ctrl+S (for saving the file). I know this is just a small bug and bugs happen all the time when programming, however this is a bug that everyone should notice when testing the feature he just implemented When starting the game the default Unity Launcher appears. This is generally not a bad thing if it would have an actual use however screen resolution could be easily set ingame, graphics dont seem to change anything and the input section consists 90% of ca. 50 times the same setting ""Take screenshot"": F12 When looking at a wall and pressing W to move forward with your drone you constantly bug into the wall a bit and out again. This a VERY common thing you see in many small Unity games however this is NOT what I would expect from a 20€ game. The game does not explain essential parts of it. A very common feature in the game is the upgrade failure rate. One might think if you use a Motion sensor with failure rate of 20% chances are 1/5 the result is wrong etc. However it actually means there is a 1/5 chance that AFTER the mission that it will be gone. The worst part about this is that the creator is aware of this misunderstanding https://redd.it/4j4iuf "

I am new to mission based games that include strategy,  I have fallen in love with these types of games.  This game is challenging for a beginner, but so interesting you just want to keep trying.  :)  I recommend this type of game to anyone who wants to get their thinker back thinking.			"

I'd wholeh has a heartedly reccomend it if their was more content in the game. Unfortantely, while it has a decent amount, it's not enough for a lot of people. Still, If piloting salvage drones against unknown creatures in a dystopia space universe, where everyone has gone missing sounds like fun to you, I'd definitely suggest picking this one up.			"

												Let's be honest, I like this game for the command line interface but it could use some help.That said:- it isn't really a horror game, it is a puzzle game.  You're trying to figure out how to collect the resources without getting killed.  Also, you only have so long on each ship.  Then a random pipe breaks, a exterior hatch gives way, an asteroid hits the ship, etc....- not being able to revisit a ship sucks.  If you have the fuel why not....- it has a steep learning curve, 2 minutes of training; then good luck- I think it would have better suspense if the remote camera where in first person view instead of top down.  It could still have the same level of detail, but what drone besides the Google mapping vehicle has a 360 degree sensor mounted above it?- the gathering bot needs to have a scan feature that would allow it to sense everything in a room.  Switching back and forth between overwatch view and the top down remote camera just so I can run around all four corners of a room to detect items really killed the immersion.Finally, if the story of the game is that you are at your console remote controlling your drones, then the interface could use a few tweaks.   I don't image that it would have been that much more work to create a ""desktop"" for the interaface and the individual pieces be indiviual applications.  After all, it acts like your booting a computer when the game starts.  Why not take the extra few steps? "

												A great game about boarding ships for sweet salvage with remote-control drones under your command from an external ship on an old 1970-80s console. Challenging your progress; a variety of enemies, environmental hazards, and mistakes on your part to be avoided and tackled on your journey to find out what happened to everyone.Duskers is predominately played in an tactical birds-eye view using a command line interface, with you occasionally needing to take direct control of your drones from an overhead camera in order to navigate past obstacles and arrange your (largely) automated defences. This really adds a lot of character to the game, and really sells the Alien(1979) theme, as you try to guide unseen hostiles away from salvage (drones/repairs/upgrades/fuel), and avoid direct contact where possible/unprofitable.The game goes on indefinitely and lore could be better in my opinion, currently there's a lot of quests/""theories"" competing with each other to provide context, negating how plausible the universe feels. I was disappointed that there's currently no way to discover data during your operations as I might expect through consoles and salvage, rather you are awarded it afterwards for completing actions before/after. Meaning beyond the grind to accumulate some sweet♥♥♥♥♥droids, I was missing out on a narrative hook. Regardless the tutorial is pretty good, and I can imagine many technically minded individuals will get a kick out of using the command-line interface to move their handy little minions, I certainly think it suits the game and plays well, but this defiantly won't be for everyone. There's enough in the game to warrant picking up for atmosphere and mechanical quirk alone, so I hope the game sees a lot more support and continues to be iterated on in future, but I was very pleased with my purchase.

												SO...If you don't already know, Duskers is a game where you control a crew of drones via a console. Basically you have to memorize a bunch of commands to control your little friends.What are you telling them to do?Well, you're telling them to open doors, power generators, move (duh), interact with interfaces, place bombs, activate stealth, teleport, shut airlocks, tow broken drones, and much, much moreSo what's the goal?To find out what happened. The story starts off where you wake up from cryogenic sleep. You're all alone, aside from 3 drones. You have to fly from ship to ship, gather whatever you can, and all the while, figure out what the hell happened.WHY DOESN'T THIS HAVE EXOSUIT???Because it doesn't really focus on combat. The aliens in this game are strong, but easily tricked. With upgrades you find, it won't be hard to trick them. Final words?It's good just buy it you stubborn ♥♥♥♥			"

												This is a fantastic space rpg thriller. You play as both a spaceship captain as well as his drones (who obviously do all the heavey lifting). You command the drones which visit hulks of abandoned spaceships and you have to piece out why all the other spaceships have been abandoned. You get to level up the drones and add abilities to them. The drones face challenges when visiting the hulks which force you to make quick decisions concerning how to react and which to save if the enemies are getting too close to the airlock.I'm writing this review only 90 minutes in and already I'm loving this game.

												Duskers is a pretty interesting game. You spenn the bulk of the game mavigating your drones around derelect ships in search of food, fuel, and information as to just what went wrong and wiped out seemingly most of the galaxy.The wierdest part about the game is how the diconnected nature of controlling your drones and combing through wreckage seems to inspire some form of dread in you. I honestly wasn't expecting to feel any sort of tension playing a salvage simulator, but it just works.I'd definitely reccomend this to anyone who enjoys FTL-like resource management in their roguelikes.

												Mechanics (8/10): simple enough. The In-game controls are simple and easy to remember (for instance, if you want to open door 18, the command is d18. Easy, right? Or if you want to send some drones into the room behind door 18, which in this instance is room 7 [R7] just type in ""navigate [insert drone numbers or names here] R7"". And if you are feeling like a keyboard ninja and want to get all of that in one command, just type ""d18; navigate  [insert drone numbers or names here] R7"". Semi-colons are like spaces in this game, letting you put multiple commands in for simultaneous movements, or even in some cases for chain commands (I think there is some way to actually put in some sort of ""logic"" code with alias's, but I am not certain how)!Enemies (6/10): I believe there are four infestation types in the game currently, each with their own fighting style (sentry drones just outright attempt to shoot you, ""brutes"" charge at you, ""swarms"" obliterate you (but have audio cue's as well apparently), and ""slimes"" continually duplicate and begin to fill rooms, possibly trapping you in a certain area! To be honest, I really don't like the whole ""swarm"" idea, as often when I play games I don't bother to use audio, and having enemies that do a ridiculous amount of damage and can chew through doors is just a bad idea all-round.Modifications/Drone upgrades and repairs (6/10): the idea of modifications is great, it gives you alot of different strategies and customization with your drones. Why is my rating only a 6/10 on this area of my review then? Because repairs. Your drones constantly get malfunctioning cameras, which you will need to repair just in case something bad happens and your cameras go out (thats a whopping seven scrap too!). Your mods also degrage, giving it a ""10%"" chance of breaking for example (oh, by the way, breaking doesn't mean ""It malfunctioned! You cannot use this item for the rest of this mission. It literally means it breakes, it is unusable and can only be salvaged for one scrap (normal mods are three scrap). That really hurts the game-play in my opinion. So if you don't spend your scrap on repairs, what do you spend them on? Well, maybe we could be able to craft mods from scrap, and not just ""tow"", ""gather"", and ""generator"". I am talking about every modification in the game, both for ships and drones. That way I can finally get interface and other great mods that will be less based on random chance.Maps/Space travel mechanics (ehhhhhhh..... 3/10) I know it's supposed to make you play more strategic, trying not to run out of fuel and stuff but..... in all honestly, it doesn't add anything to the experience for me, and in a way kind of ruins it. The idea isn't bad, but trying to be strategic with your fuel implies that you can actually find fuel, and enough of it. Not to mention the ""quarentine"" and ""transport required"" mechanics, because while transport is a cool idea, it should be at least garenteed to have one target be a room with a generator.Do I recommend this game? Absolutely! It's definitely unique in its style and game-play, and because it hasn't been out long, I'm sure the dev team will do their best to balance some things and add others.			"

Early Access Review
								More Reviews/Impressions @ TheVideogameBacklog.comWhile I’ve had my fun with Duskers (not to say I’m finished by any means), it has led me to create a different category for these types of games. Let’s just say there are those games where you go into it expecting to die and die a lot. Then along comes a game where you can play multiple levels cautiously and then out of nowhere up and die or be screwed outright from progressing. You don’t see it coming because the danger lurks somewhere deep in the game… waiting patiently for you. So let’s break it down; in my head there are Rogue-Likes and there are Secret-Rogue-Likes. Duskers is in that second category. (They’ve done some tweaking for that though.)So there you are in space… some kind of apocalypse event happened and you are traveling the universe in search for answers, fuel and scrap metal for your journey to… wherever the heck you are supposed to end up. You start out with four drones equipped with different abilities. Some of these abilities are super useful while other abilities and their usefulness lies hidden in a tactic that you haven’t either needed to explore yet or can’t fathom. Either way, in your exploring you’ll find other abilities that can be towed back (if you’ve got that mod) to your ship or picked up off of dead drones (God rest their little metal ghosts).They say you’ll get attached to your drones. This is true for some, but I think in my own way I’m only attached to their usefulness to me. Let’s say I’ve got a drone named Lucy and she has my Gather mod and experiences “death by a turret” (or a bunch of deadly red blocks or radiation or an air lock and on and on…) while exploring; in all these cases but the last, I can take a drone in and swap out another mod for it or just straight take it. I’ve gotten used to only having a few mods on each drone (since some mods have failed me). I can leave Lucy to lay lifeless on the floor since I’ve got what I need now. This may seem heartless, but if you don’t steel yourself for the cold, hard truth of this lifeless universe, you may find yourself crying from time to time. Duskers‘ cause (whatever it is) needs you to be strong! Leave no useful mod behind, but a drone… well you can’t drag a dead one anyway so get over it.On and on you explore different ships of multiple sizes and setups that will have you watching which doors you open and running from unknown enemies. It’s fun to make it out with your salvage, but I’ve not quite figured out how to scout a ship for 100% of its supplies successfully yet. I’m always leaving a ton of useful salvage according to the mission summary report at the end. That’s not to say I haven’t uncovered the whole ship, but my ability to see everything is not 100% somehow. It’s like I’m missing a mod that sees secrets. I’ll get it eventually right…. right?Score: Support This Title!It’s eerie, mysterious, exciting, fun and extremely frustrating at times (although they may have patched some of the “your everything on your everyone just broke” out of the game recently). I do enjoy Duskers and would recommend it to those who like a bit of thinking in their games. If you like games that can’t really compare much with anything else: Duskers! Really, I’ve not played anything else that really gives the same feeling and games like Duskers are the reason indie games are home to some of the best gaming experiences out there today. Now if you don’t mind, I’ll just get back to guiding my drones to their deaths. After all, if you love something, you’ve got to let it go.			"

												This game is a *little* FTL, a bit of Covert Action, a bit of Aliens atmosphere, and a bit of new stuff (to me, anyway). Lots of fun, a bit of a learning curve as not everything is 100% documented or explained (I recommend just experimenting a few times before making a serious go of things), and there is a bit of a story that persists across deaths to keep you going. The interface that you spend most of your time in is brilliant - it felt very natural to me (it may not be for everybody, it involves a simple but versatile command line - actually very much like LOGO now that I think of it). You may want to turn off some of the graphical effects just to save your eyeballs.			"

												Review submitted 26th Dec, 2016_______________________Duskers is a tactical rogue-like science fiction where you awaken from some form of suspended animation into a universe that has suffered from a mass-extinction, leaving you as the last known person alive. You're tasked with compiling data regarding the causes of the event by exploring and scavenging information from abandoned, derelict vessels and space outposts.Equipped with three remotely-operated drones, you board the vessels in search of fuels to sustain your travels, avoiding the automated defence systems of the derelicts, alien lifeforms, radiation as well as the constant threat of malfunction from either your drones or the derelict itself, potentially rendering your drone's subsystems non-functional, or pipes and airlocks bursting, releasing lethal doses of radiation into the vessel.I myself would highly recommend playing in this very unforgiving environment as Misfit's Attic have got the atmosphere absolutely spot-on. Just a warning, there are potential jump-scares if you're not careful with what doors you open.			"

												The concept and game mechanisms are simple enough but that isn't to suggest it isn't an enjoyable game. One of the aspects I find quite handy is that it's easy to pick up and put down without needing to commit huge chunks of time.It's a neat concept that I think has been done pretty well. The interface seems appropriate, the only thing that isn't clear at this early stage is what kind of progression the gamer will feel they make over time. I've read of criticisms that the missions become repetitive but I'm not at that stage yet so it's all still fun.For me at least this makes a refreshing change from all the games out there where it's all about the graphics and supposed realism and forget to focus on the gameplay.

												Similar to FTL, But...No pause, substantially less offensive options, a heavier reliance on scanvenging to survive, a focus on usable actions that decay on frequency of use, and an immersed horror environment.Yeah, similar... but all these different mechanics makes it substantially different.

								At first duskers seems oretty forgetable. but give it an hour or so and it soon gets complex. Tl;Dr at end.The premise is that the galaxy is near enough void of all human life and you are to search derelict ships in order to pice together what caused this sudden end to humanity. To explore the ships you take control of a squad of up to 4 active drones and salvage what you can whilst avoiding hostiles.Dealing with the hostiles is, for me, what makes the game great. Every hostile can be dealt with in some form or another but so can you. As an example i had a drone with a stealth upgrade and equipped with a gatling gun. At first it was great but then you find slime and your whole way of life comes to an alarming crash.Issuing orders is done through a command line system (dont worry its pretty simple). The command line system does not allow split second actions. If your drone gets jumped on you have to type furiously to save it, as well as the others, from certain death. You will often find yourself with a drone going through a door and getting attacked because you have forgotten to take one of many precautions, before you know it the drone is dead and the hostile has promptly moved through the open door to reign havoc.Its not all positive at this time in developement. Currently there is very little hand holding other than the starting tutorial. No database of hostiles or anything. its not game breaking but i will put this down to early access. There are very few bugs (i've not seen any).The biggest downside though is the lack of information about the world you are in. Although i am not really that far into the game i still feel you could learn more about the world. The best way for me to describe it is by comparing this to deadnauts where you can learn every last little detail about everything. However im sure this will be remedied in the future.Lastly The devs are very active on the steam forum. I think a dev has replied to every thread i have read!Tl;DR+Solid addictive gamplay+Large choice of strategies+Rougelike+CMD line system is cool and adds a sense of peril to your encounters+Simple but effective graphics+few bugs-Tutorial is the only help you get-Would like more info on things like hostiles and backstory (see deadnauts)-Some gameplay features feel like bugs when you first start out.

												The concept and game mechanisms are simple enough but that isn't to suggest it isn't an enjoyable game. One of the aspects I find quite handy is that it's easy to pick up and put down without needing to commit huge chunks of time.It's a neat concept that I think has been done pretty well. The interface seems appropriate, the only thing that isn't clear at this early stage is what kind of progression the gamer will feel they make over time. I've read of criticisms that the missions become repetitive but I'm not at that stage yet so it's all still fun.For me at least this makes a refreshing change from all the games out there where it's all about the graphics and supposed realism and forget to focus on the gameplay.

												An intruiging game that can best be summed up as ""FTL: Faster Than Light meets Alien: Isolation"", combining the former's top-down layout with the latter's gameplay style of using a combination of stealth, motion sensors and lures to find and either bypass or redirect the monster(s).I really enjoyed it, and this is coming from someone who normally doesn't care all that much for roguelikes.

												Duskers is a unique game. A really good unique game :)To be honest; I'm not a fan of strategy type of games, I mostly prefer First/Third person action games BUT Duskers really grabbed my attention.The first thing I immediately loved in Duskers is retro-futuristic/lo-fi (I think that's the right word) style of visuals. The console panels remind me of terminals known from movies like Alien and I always liked these type of old 8bit terminals. The gameplay really surprised me. I didn't know that typing commands into console while watching top-down view can be interesting. But in Duskers it just works, and it's really interesting :D I'm writing this review after 13 hours of in-game experience, but I already know that I will spend much more hours in Duskers.BTW: If you didn't know; the Duskers is indie-game made by very small group of people. But still they managed to create a really good and unique game. Just imagine what they could do with bigger team and budget :DI can recommend this game to the fans of action-based-strategy games, people who like deliberate planning and these who like 8bit style of retro terminals. Even if you're not a fan of that kind of genre, you can still give it a try. Just run it in windowed mode (or on second display) and play with it, while doing something else on main screen.			"

												Sci-Fi SRPG a la FTL mixed with a FNAF-like, stripped of jumpscares.  I love this game, but it's not gonna be for everyone.It's a roguelite, or roguelikelike, or whatever terminology you wanna use.  Which means you're gonna find yourself in a corner and having to [R]eset through no obvious mistake of your own.  Which to me is only a problem if I don't know that going into the game.  You CAN turn off 'permadeath,' but even if you leave it on like a big boy/girl, the story/journal entries carry over so you're still progressing the story.And what little I've seen of the story is doing a really good job of egging me on.  Some good hard sci-fi stuff here.The action is a slow burn.  Tense, but not frantic.  Uncomfortable but not jumpscary.  Which I love.  I'm gettin old and I can't 360 noscope noobz like back in the day, so having something I can take my own time with is nice.But that's not to say it's boring.  It doesn't get the adrenaline running often, but it does always have you feeling just a little tense.  Why can't your motion sensors detect beyond that door?  You COULD drop a probe, but you've only got one left, and you're short on fuel, but if there's a...something...back there, you're gonna lose an irreplaceable drone....Lots of fun.

												In my first 2 hours I of playing this game I started out well, got some new upgrades, 2 new drones and some scrap. It was going pretty well.Then it all went horribly wrong.After using a drone with stealth to investigate a room with uncertain motion results, I found something that saw right through the cloak. Naturally, said drone ate the dust. Then it a desperate attempt to get the drone back and continue exploring I decided, ""I know I'll vent the ship. The thing that attack me must be closer to the airlock so will be sucked out first!"". So I type the neccessary door commands and open the airlock. Here's where the problems really begin. I don't know where abouts the hostile is, so I don't want to close the airlock too early. Then I hear a loud beep and look at the input console, ""Drone 1 is being sucked out into space."" Well there goes my only gather module and stealth module. Then if that wasn't good enough, the door that was separating 2 other drones from vacuum gives in. Out those two go. So in one boarding exercise, I've lost 3 drones, not secured any more scrap or fuel (of which I'm scarily low on at this point) and lost all my good upgrades.This game can provide a shock without having to resort to jump scares, and it's horror comes from something other than fear of having jump into your face, it's horror of the unknown, of what you'll find through that door, of whether that next outpost will be the one where the product of all your work will be lost. And that, to me, is way more intense than having something thrown in your face occasionally.			"

Duskers is a rogue-like dungeon exploration game where you pilot drones into derelict ships in outer space to scavenge for scrap metal, fuel, upgrades, and the answer to what caused the universe to become a giant graveyard.Duskers sets an air of complete and total mystery. In fact, not only mystery, but horror as well. To start you off, you're taught the very simple control schemes of the game; Issue orders using a command line, and control your drones with the arrow keys. Simple, intuitive, and easy to get used to. But as soon as the tutorial is over, you dive right into the ever-expansive universe of Duskers. With nary a directive but to board what ever ship you happen to start near and gather precious scrap and fuel. Immediately you can begin to feel just how lonely this world is. How haunting it is. The only way you experience this world is through the very vulnerable camera feeds of your cute little drones as they carry out your every command, and the occasional corrupted text log that leaks to you vital, yet fragmented, information. As you begin to explore and test out the waters of the unknown, you begin to realize that though you're alone, you're not safe. Not in the slighest. Normally that realization comes from the sudden beeps, screeches, and explosions from your most favorite drone being torn to pieces by another drone or an unidentifiablly gruesome creature.The atmosphere that Duskers sets for you is an inticing one that is hard to pry yourself away from. The sound design of the creaking ships, quiet groans and chatters, occasional whirrs from machines and drones alike. It sets the perfect environment of adventure and mystery. Duskers incites in you an exhilaration to explore and conquer these derelict space ships and stations. An ever-gratifying sense of accomplishment when you bring back a disabled drone, uncover a text log that paints you a story of it's previous inhabitants, or when you find an invaluable upgrade for your drones or ships, even when you mercilessly slay a corrupted defense drone or outsmart one of those terrifying creatures. Duskers likewise will instill into you fear as a nearby bulkhead door breaks open from a creature attacking it, or the panicked beeps of one of your drones suddenly being attacked. It will make you panic when you open a door to a room you thought was empty, only to be confronted by an enemy jumping at you from the shadows. Furiously smashing at your keyboard as you try to close doors, command your drones, and attempt to save as many of your precious little bots as you can. It will give you an air of hopelessness as you watch your last drone become disabled in the bowels of a ghost ship, its camera feed slowly failing as the last of its life drains away. It will rip your heart out when you have to seal a drone in a room crawling with infestations just to give the others a chance at survival. Regretting every keystroke as you type ""exit.""Duskers all in all is a thrilling and addicting game that keeps you coming back for more. Dying, though permanent, doesn't feel like a loss. On the contrary, you feel like you're only learning more and becoming more experienced.Seriously, after spending quite a few hours being sucked into this game, I absolutely love it. I can't wait to fire it up and play more. I can't wait to uncover the secrest this world holds. I'm excited at the mere thought of this game! Misfits Attic did a phenomenal job in the design, and I can't praise it enough. It's challenging, it's rewarding, it's exciting, and it's terrifying. They nailed the atmosphere and the environment. I sat for hours with a friend watching it over my shoulder as we explored, groaning in anguish as we lost drones, cheering when we escaped near death, and jumping at the sight of some enemies.			"

												Duskers is honestly a kind of game I've been searching for over time. I fondly remember playing Moria, Rogue, Nethack, and Angband back in the day on my old DOS and early Windows machines, and this is probably the best spiritual successor to those classics that you'll find on Steam.You start off with a handful of drones in various states of disrepair, totally alone in the universe. Your objective is ostensibly to piece together what happened, but ultimately your primary goal is to survive by scavenging what you can, making repairs when you must, and always, ALWAYS thinking about the consequences of your actions.Do you open that last door, hoping to find a motherlode of scrap, or do you cut your losses and move on to the next ship, just in case Door #3 holds some alien obscenity waiting to eat the faces of your robotic proxies? In so many AAA games that boast freedom of choice, actions do not really have consequences. Not so with Duskers. Every decision you make, every action you take can make the difference between survival or clambering back into your cryo-pod and praying the autopilot takes you to a nicer neighborhood on the next go-'round. Duskers is tense, sometimes nerve-wracking, and ultimately one of the better thrill rides I've been on. The retro interface sets you back from the action, but only just far enough for you to think a few four-letter words as red status messages blare across the command console while one by one your drones' feeds go dark and you struggle to slam doors, use lures and traps, and  save what you can. Your trusty ship sometimes also proves untrustworthy, and my nerves have started singing on more than one occasion when the main map feed goes dark as I try to herd some xeno terror into the nearest convenient airlock. Explore. Scavenge. Survive... and try to figure out just what in blazes happened to the rest of humanity.			"

												I had a system worked out to explore the derelict wrecks strewn about the stars. It was simple, always check the motion detector before opening a door. If anything was moving, then I would leave the door alone and search elsewhere. Duskers is not a game about getting comfortable with a system, it is a game about improvised solutions and the all-consuming entropy of an uncaring universe. The motion detector began to wear out with use, and sometimes the readings were... inconclusive. Once, ""Inconclusive"" meant ""Danger"", and I found out the hard way.The creature fell upon my drone with a thud, followed by the beeping of alerts as my terminal informed me that Drone 1 was reporting damage. I tried to move my drone back through the door, and to shut the door on the creature, but the doors of interstellar craft are built with the same high technology as elevator doors, and they refused to close as the creature and my drone were obstructing them. My video feed grew garbled as the beast smashed my drone out of commission, its twisted metal husk still blocking the door.I considered sending one of my other drones to tow the wreckage back to my boarding craft so I could repair it, but that risked having the creature destroy two drones instead of just one. I considered sending the drone to at least salvage the equipment that my stricken drone was carrying, but I wasn't sure if the creature could move past the broken drone or not. There was only one thing to do; I had to get rid of the creature before I could try to mount a rescue operation. I looked at the schematics of the ship, and realized that there was an operable airlock only a room away from where the creature had made its nest. I typed the commands to open the door to the adjoining room, and the airlock. My terminal beeped and announced that the rooms were exposed to the cold vacuum of space. In an instant the creature was swept out into the void... as was my damaged drone.With one mistake I had lost both a drone, and my motion sensor. I made do though, because defeat is not to my taste. On my next excursion I brought along a suite of deployable sensors that I had salvaged earlier. They could only scan the room they were in, but that was alright. I took to scouting by placing a sensor in a secure room, retreating back to safety, and then remotely opening a door to an unexplored room. Then I would wait, and see if anything wandered out. That waiting, the uncertainty of whether the room beyond was actually safe, or if I had simply not waited long enough, was possibly the most nerve wracking experiences I've had at my computer.			"

												Great fun, for a while.  It is a good noodle flexer for a little while but lack of possibilites makes it fairly boring after a while.  It'll be a good pick up when I have nothing better to do next semester at school but I can't dedicate time to it.  This game needs more upgrades and upgrades to upgrades and game progression.  The enemies need to become more diverse as the game advances.  There needs to be more tactile ways of eliminating enemies with upgrades.  More events could mix things up too. Maybe drone ships that latch to airlocks or someting.  Overall, worth the buy though.			"

												Before we delve into too many details, I have to say that 2D games have never appealed to me as much as this one has. When I first looked at some of the gameplay, it looked quite bland, as in drained of color and seemed very boring. But I decided to give this game a chance and It did not disappoint. Duskers is a control-based game that gives you real-time control over all the events occurring on your screen. Although you may only be looking at a monitored-simulation, it truly gives a feel of one being present at the scene as this is happening. To the objective of the game: As the pilot of a small ship, you are tasked with the job of exploring and unveiling the truth behind what has happened to the other humans aboard ships that are merely drifting in space. Boarding these ships, you may find subtle clues or messages (datalogs) that may shed light to the disappearances or what might have happened. Utilizing drones and a variaty of gadgets they come equipped with (all customizable), you pilot these units aboard frigates, freighters, and numerous other ships alike in order to accumulate necessary resources to keep your own ship from failing while at the same time, uncovering the mystery behind the disapperances of the crew members of these ships. But here's the catch: You aren't alone.There are... these... things that are on board those ghost ships with you. And as far as I know, all of them are entirely hostile. They will attack your drones on sight and destroy them. The trick behind figuring out how to navigate around them either stealthily or to eliminate them will be up to the player to discover.			"

												Great concept and idea. The game is set up very atmospherically, starting with the controls and the graphics. I needed a short time to get used to the controls (not difficult, just different, not intuative), but the the way the controls work, really add to the whole atmosphere of the game.In itself, the game is many times replayable. Even after 7 hours, everytime I open a door, I fear what is behind it. So I tend to proceed with caution.  The gameplay doesn't tend to change, but neither does it of any AAA title. CoD/BF/CS -> you just shoot your gun, the gameplay never changes. Here, you slowly getting pieces of a puzzle, that will uncover, what the heck is going on in the universe, and why are you all alone. While this happens, the game gets more and more difficult. Your stuff break, so you will have to salvage more parts. You will have to swap vehicle, as your spaceship is starting to get used up. You will have to make careful decision, on what you spend your slavaged parts, and whether you really HAVE TO use an upgrade and risk it to break, or you can survive without it, and you don't have to repair it useing up the few parts you salvaged.I can only recommend this game. Don't expect a shooter à la ""Alien Swarm"". This is a tactical/strategy game involving little to no shooting.			"

												I do know Tim (the main dev), but I've played this game both before and after launch & am really happy for him w/how well it turned out!The blend of command-line interaction and manual piloting of drones is a really good feel.  Unlike most power-fantasy games, you're quite vulnerable in this game and direct-force is almost never the best option.  That gives you a really strong sense of heightened alertness as you try to cerebrally work your way through a very hostile lanscape (space-scape technically?).As a programmer and occasional sys-admin, I think he really nailed his implementation of a really powerful command-line.  It feels just right & he took the time to build in a bunch of the really picky shortcuts (repeating commands, tab-completion, ctrl+a/ctrl+e, etc.).Overall, great game. I can see why so many reviewers are lining it up for their Game of the Year.			"

												Conceptually, this game is excellent.  You want to get caught up in the command-line interface and vector graphics on what feels like an old CRT, because they set the tone so well -- watch the beginning of the second trailer.  You've probably never experienced a horror story through that lens, right?However, the game ultimately suffers from a pretty undisciplined RNG.  You can start a game with motion sensors but be on a ship where all adjacent rooms are unscannable.  Or maybe you end up on a ship where you can't reach the fuel room because the power inlets are in an unfortunate position and you don't have the tools to overcome that situation yet.  It's fun to methodically crawl a ship, dealing with the threats you encounter -- it's not fun to realize that it's about to come down to luck, and you need to open a door and hope nothing lunges through and cripples your drone.  Or that it's not down to luck, but it's going to take half an hour to make sure you checked out the whole ship.  (By the way?  You can't save and quit during a misson without abandoning the current ship you're exploring, and there's no cloud save.  So, if you need to do something IRL mid-mission, I hope you don't mind leaving the app running!)The things I'm describing aren't lategame content or high difficulty settings.  These are things you can encounter in the first two ships you explore with the difficulty settings all set as easy as it goes.I really want to like this game.  But the game doesn't do quite enough to guarantee that each playthrough feels fair, which really kills my desire to stick to it and learn.  I would be delighted to hear that the devs got the time to take a pass at rebalancing and re-polishing this, because it has great potential.			"

												Duskers is fun in an alt-game style using console commands to control your fleet of salvage drones through puzzles.  There is a real-time aspect that is paced just enough to allow you time to enter panicked commands and flee / react accordingly.  This cadence for difficulty balancing works well with this hybrid mouse/console action game.  It's permadeath, but you maintain your research (discoveries and quests) across lives.  There's drone management and ship management with upgrades and seizures to keep things interesting.  You never have enough fuel so exploration is at a premium.However, for me the game ground to a halt when the organic, viral enemies were introduce mid-game.  These mobs replicatre rapidly in-room withouth showing up on motion scanners, and their silent growth can make holding a generator active with a drone impossible, as well as block off access routes and become impassible.  It was just too much of a wrench thrown into the game which sucked the fun out of it as well as derails your own cautious grind towards greater power.  After a few attempts, I found that at this stage the game required so much micro-management (and cursing) that the earlier, fun think-and-react style play disintegrated.  I eventually put the game away as it just wasn't enjoyable anymore; despite its potential and promise.  And if a game just goes back into the abyss of your Steam library, then what good is it?  That's why I don't recommend it.			"

												As the last survivor of an unknown cataclysm you have to play detective, piecing together clues that you gather drifting around a vast graveyard of space derelicts, somewhere in the universe. Did I say last survivor? Sorry, I meant last human survivor.To achieve this task you remotely control a tiny squad of crack drones, entirely through a command line interface.Wait, what, a command line interface?Don't worry, the commands themselves are very simple, easy to learn, and the console auto-completes as you type so you only have to type the first character or two of each command. If you're a fast and accurate typist, however, you'll certainly have a bit of an advantage here.But the absolutely glorious thing about this (on the surface slightly bizarre-seeming) design choice is the sense of immersion it manages to create. Through static-covered camera feeds across failing communication lines you observe every bit of action at a distance, yet I felt far more connected to the world than in any game of recent times. You geniunely feel like a lone operator, sat bathed in the glow of a terminal, watching helplessly as your last drone is yet again decimated by some unseen threat. This is sci-fi horror at its best. The low-tech aesthetic evokes the classic Alien. The gameplay itself is a satisfying mixture of strategy and puzzle as you figure out how to avoid, contain or destroy threats with the limited tools available. You are forced to regularly rethink how you approach situations as your equipment breaks down requiring you to discover new ways to use the various drone abilities together. But whatever happens there is a sense of fairness; every misstep, every failure, every tear shed for a lost drone, it is always your own fault; for not planning properly, forgetting some detail in your strategy, misreading the situation, or just entering the wrong damn command.As a big reader of science fiction I can also say that the writing is truly excellent, as you piece together the events leading up to this mysterious cataclysm entirely through slightly garbled text logs which always drop just enough hints to grow the universe a bit each time and generally keep the story moving. One of the few games I've played where the hunt for text logs actually makes total sense contextually and is expertly woven into the core experience, rather than being simply an afterthought to flesh out the exposition. My only only gripe is that the various strands of story you are uncovering never really quite tie together into a full and proper conclusion which is what I was expecting ... instead this is left as an exercise for the player to simply piece together on their own or in forum discussions. Which, in itself, may have been an entirely intentional design, and is certainly somehow in keeping with the bleak hopelessness of the situation you find yourself in.One of the most original, gritty and genuinely tense gaming experiences I've had in a long time, absolutely terrific.

												Full disclosure: I received this game from the developer for free about a week before the official release. But I've been sent a lot of free games, and this is the first one that I've played at least a little bit every day.I love Duskers. I love enough that I made it a main, daily series on my channel. To be honest, I've loved it since I first fired it up. The day I got it, I only had time to quickly check it out, so I played the Operator Tutorial, and that's all I needed to know I wanted to do a full Let's Play that turned into daily uploads. I'm currently on Series 3.\


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play DUSKERS - Series 1 Part 1 - Unmanned Survival Horror! 

			Views: 7,290		

			Unmanned Survival Horror! An ongoing Let's Play broken into series. Each run in this roguelike will be a series, broken into daily parts.		

Duskers has a lot of bullet points that really strike a chord with me: Post Apocalyptic: Everyone in the entire universe is dead, except you (and possibly one other person? I haven't quite figured that out yet). Your job is to find out why. Retro-future Aesthetic: The entire game is played via a video feed from your drones and a schematic view of the ships you are exploring. The game seriously reminds me of scenes from Alien and Aliens, watching the vents or tunnels through retro-future display screens as the action unfolds. Creepy: I've talked with the Developer, Tim Keenan of Misfit's Attic, and when I asked him if he meant to make Duskers as creepy as it is, he said ""No."" and laughed. Your drones can only see what is in their forward arc, and the sound and atmosphere of the game can have you on edge from the moment you leave the safety of your docking bay to the moment you type ""exit"" and get the hell off that ship. Metal creaks and groans in the distance, generators whirr and fuel storage units rumble and clang, and until you know exactly what each sound means, it can leave you afraid to even move, let alone open the next door. Tense: Opening a door is a gamble almost every time unless you have the most advanced and upgraded modules to know what's behind it. And even then you really only have a vague idea that something is there. It takes time and effort to figure out exactly what it is unless you bite the bullet and take a look. And often, when you open that door, it's already too late. When you absolutely need to get into a room because you haven't found enough scrap, or you haven't found the fuel storage yet, or you need to get to the room BEYOND that one because you know there's a spare drone waiting for you to tow it back to your ship, but your motion sensor reading for the room is inconclusive, the tension is crazy. Proceedurally Generated: The ships, their layouts, their rewards, and even the galaxies and systems they're in are all generated proceedurally. This means that every. single. run. is different. Difficult, but Fair: You could absolutely beast through one ship, completely scour it for every piece of available scrap and fuel, find a bunch of modules and inactive drones to add to your boarding party, then dock with the very next ship and everything could go to♥♥♥♥♥♥in the first couple rooms. With the small exception of one or two pretty OP configurations, the game is punishing to those that fail to take the time to assess their situation and take proper precautions. But don't take too long, because some of the derelict ships have been floating in the void for a long time without proper maintenance, and things tend to break when you least expect it.In short, Duskers is an amazing game, with developers that care about the game immensely. The story is brought to you in the form of scavenged data files from the derelict ships you dock with, the quests of the game being ""Theories"" on why the universe is suddenly a graveyard. The game even has Daily and Weekly challenges, the former being a single ship, and the weekly being an entire galaxy, with global leaderboards, giving the game infinite replay value. For 20 bucks, you'd be hard-pressed to find better.-Restless Corpse "

								Leave the mouse alone! This keyboard focused remote control sim-of-sorts is incredibly well done and completely fascinating. Watching videos may not quite do it justice, but you'll control a series of drones through spaceships while salvaging what you can to continue on, all through remotely operated devices requiring keyboard terminal style inputs. While it doesn't have a dense text parser like old Sierra games, it does require specific keywords (and is very helpful in reminding you) you'll need to type to get the job done. Great game already, can't wait to see how it progresses in Early Access.

												I have to give this a Positive review first off, that being said I will be honest because if others had not been honest with their reviews I would not have bothered to have jumped in on this one.This Master Peice is a Gorgeous work of art, you settle in for an axious adventure into unknown peril, commanding drones to explore derilict space crafts strewn through the procedurally generated universe.The Devs are truly awesome, I say this because I see them responding to people and questions in their Dev Forum, they care about what they have created, and truly it is a master peice, so uniquely designed that in the area of Unigueness and Authenticity this Game is truly one of a Kind, you wont find anything like this if searched through seven hundred titles early access or not.I have seen ALL the negative comments on the Steam review here, and I spent a week mulling what they said over and over, however scroll through them all and chew on those reviews where more than 20 hours have been spent in game, and consider well what they have to say.The Mechanics are fairly basic, but the Command Line Controls are not without a fullness. I like the challenge to get through each mission, the antagony of not knowing if I will make it scavenging for Fuel Sources, Scrap and Delightful Upgrades and Additional Robotic Members of the team. The Enemy is Unknown, and you WILL encounter it, it is merciless and if you don't keep a cool head you will loose you best Robot Buddy if not all of them and your only desperate asset for survival.The Game is like nothing else I have ever seen, it is a dream. If you like to think about movement along the lines of designing ideas or methods of exploration in hostile environments or trouble shooting to maneuver around an extremely efficient uttelry over powering enemy this game is something you should not waste any time on.I feel I am kind of rambling on, because I am about to continue with my second attempt to get a long ways into things and discover what the heck happened to all of humanity, This game may seem like it's bare bones, but all the speculation you could ever produce through watching the Video Streams and Reading these reviews will never grant you the satisfaction that we have gained through spending the 18 Bones and enjoying a truly AWESOME and Fantastic Game Developed upon some extremely fascinating Ideas, I am looking forward to where this one is going, Long Live Duskers!!! :)			"

This game is groundbreaking.Not only does Duskers feel like a game that could get kids into coding, but each new progression in the story makes playing very interesting.You find yourself being taxed while inputting commands and trying to keep all your drones alive in this survival game.The horror aspect of this game really must apply to younger players...If you're young this game might be a nightmare.If you're older, this game is a survival challenge.Currently the game is very basic (with some brilliant visuals) and plays like a randomly generated rogue like strategy game. Using drones and their equipped skills to explore derelict ships really creates a sense of desperation: One minute you've got a full team of drones carefully scanning though a ship and suddenly the whole team is wiped out with one wrong door open.What this game really leaves you wishing is that there was more of it. It feels like you're at a computer terminal in a world like Alien or Dead Space.Your monitors can fail, but there is no ""camera feed"" option for the drones, (a single point of light and a drone perspective being the only way to navigate). The game makes you wish there was more depth, which only shows you how good the mechanics are.If you haven't already, go buy this! It's great! There is nothing like it out there!			"

												I have to give this a Positive review first off, that being said I will be honest because if others had not been honest with their reviews I would not have bothered to have jumped in on this one.This Master Peice is a Gorgeous work of art, you settle in for an axious adventure into unknown peril, commanding drones to explore derilict space crafts strewn through the procedurally generated universe.The Devs are truly awesome, I say this because I see them responding to people and questions in their Dev Forum, they care about what they have created, and truly it is a master peice, so uniquely designed that in the area of Unigueness and Authenticity this Game is truly one of a Kind, you wont find anything like this if searched through seven hundred titles early access or not.I have seen ALL the negative comments on the Steam review here, and I spent a week mulling what they said over and over, however scroll through them all and chew on those reviews where more than 20 hours have been spent in game, and consider well what they have to say.The Mechanics are fairly basic, but the Command Line Controls are not without a fullness. I like the challenge to get through each mission, the antagony of not knowing if I will make it scavenging for Fuel Sources, Scrap and Delightful Upgrades and Additional Robotic Members of the team. The Enemy is Unknown, and you WILL encounter it, it is merciless and if you don't keep a cool head you will loose you best Robot Buddy if not all of them and your only desperate asset for survival.The Game is like nothing else I have ever seen, it is a dream. If you like to think about movement along the lines of designing ideas or methods of exploration in hostile environments or trouble shooting to maneuver around an extremely efficient uttelry over powering enemy this game is something you should not waste any time on.I feel I am kind of rambling on, because I am about to continue with my second attempt to get a long ways into things and discover what the heck happened to all of humanity, This game may seem like it's bare bones, but all the speculation you could ever produce through watching the Video Streams and Reading these reviews will never grant you the satisfaction that we have gained through spending the 18 Bones and enjoying a truly AWESOME and Fantastic Game Developed upon some extremely fascinating Ideas, I am looking forward to where this one is going, Long Live Duskers!!! :)			"

												What I love about Indie/Small Studio Games is that they are usually willing to try something experimental. This is no exception.PremiseYou are a spaceship captain piloting drones through derelict ships, fuel depots, and other outposts. Your mission: to find out what happened to humanity. The story is delivered via text communications retrieved when exploring these wrecks.GameplayThe majority of the gameplay takes place between 2 views, a  vector graphic map, and an overhead view of the active drone. The overhead camera has a variety of filters on it that simulate interference between the camera and the player as well as highlighting the area visible to the drone. The camera and the map may become unavailable for periods of time as things degrade. The overhead camera allows you to control each of your drones using tank controls, while the map allows you to monitor all drones at once. In both views, you have access to a console where you can enter commands to any and all drones, create aliases, and issue multiple commands in parrallel using semicolon seperators. It's a powerful tool but missing a few features, like the ability to move drones out of the way without having to go into the overhead cam view to activate tank controls. In addition to tank controls, each drone can be equipped with up to 4 modules, each of these modules add additional functionality to each drone. These features vary dramatically, the console can be used to access help on a modification to learn how to use it. Some features will protect your drone, or give it offensive capabilities, or allow it to better sense its surroundings, but some allow you to interact with the derelicts by providing power, to open doors or turning on defensive turrets. Your goal is largely to maintain a supply of scrap and fuel so you can keep playing. Your ship, drones, and drone modifiications will decay over time, a large % for each mission they're used on, and a smaller amount for each use within the same mission (I think), and the only way to maintain them is to gather scrap. Probes, sensors, and derelict ship commands can reveal extra scrap, but it doesn't seem to be enough to maintain everything indefinitely, and you may get unlucky and have something break early. I havent mentioned the enemies yet, and there are a number of them with various difficulties, but hey, I'll leave you to discover them all. In most cases, you'll want to avoid them, herding them about the ship to allow you safe passage. This was kind of a long summary, but the gameplay is like 99% of this game, and none of it is 'standard', the next sections are shorter.Graphics The graphics are simple, I feel the amount of distortion on the overhead camera is a little over the top, you can luckily turn down much of the settings if you start to get eye strain. All in all, the graphics didnt feel all that atmospheric, despite the filters, and after a short time, all the corridors and rooms started to look alike. But the graphics are not this game's selling point.Sound Simple, largely made up of beeps, a few sound effects and a little ambience. Like the graphics, this is not the game's selling point, and that is just fine.interface The user interface is strongly tied into the premise of the game, an ability to type accurately will serve you well, as well as a good memory for the command key-words. I do think the game could have utilized the mouse a little more in menu navigation, but that is such a minor thing. I'd love to be able to have fine control over a drone from map view, just so I could move it out of the way, or closer to a destroyed drone for looting.Overall, I recommend the game, it's unique and very fun until you get tired of the lack of variety. I'm not sure if I would recommend it at its full price though. while I do think you can get a decent amount of gameplay for the money, there aren't many games in my library where I can go from over-the-top enthusiastic to bored in under 20 hours.

												You left a door carelessly open. A ""thing"" sneaks in, mauls your generator drone, rushes into your docking shuttle, and wrecks your tow drone. A warning rings out that an asteroid is about to collide with the derelict. You need to get rid of the thing, salvage what you can from your generator drone, and escape the ship. You enter a series of commands: maneuvering your drone to a strategic spot; dropping an explosive trap; retreating; and opening a series of doors to lure the thing to the bomb. Seconds tick by. Your motion sensor detects the thing next to the trap, and you blow it up. You frantically type commands to head back to the docking shuttle when alarms ring out: the asteroid has hit the derelict, right next to where your last surviving drone is, and it gets sucked into the vacuum of space. You, the drone operator, alone on his ship, hundreds of kilometers away from the disaster, wails in despair. You order the shuttle back to your ship. Maybe you can salvage components from the destroyed drone in it. Maybe you can jury rig the other, broken drone that has been sitting in your cargo hold for weeks, and try to find another drone on another derelict to give you a chance at survival. You have a remote power upgrade on your ship; this can substitute to your lost generator drone. There is still hope. Everyone else in the galaxy is dead, but there is still hope. You repeat the words to yourself, aloud, unable to believe them. In space, no one can hear you weep.			"

												Duskers has so much potential. That's why I can't reccommend it. It's disappointing. It promises a lot, just by virtue of the way its made, the way it plays. It's a piece of quality craftsmanship. It makes you think there's a greater mystery, there's more technology and loot to be found. That there's a whole universe out there to be explored.There isn't. Just asteroids, death and another Reset.The story is flat and simple. The lore is nonexistant. There is no progression. Once you get past the initial ""WOW!"" of controlling a game with psuedo-unix commands, you'll realize what I mean. The concept of the core gameplay is well-implemented, but shallow. The drones are all dumb, literally. You cannot program them in any way, shape or form, and considering the reaction speeds one would need to beat the enemies in this game, that'd actually be useful.A one-trick existential pony that promises a lot and absolutely does not deliver. Beautiful concept, but once you look past the surface, you find a whole lot of void, just begging to be filled.			"

												I don't think words can do this game justice.  Part Alien (the flick), part FTL, part light damage control sim.... but, no that's not quite right.  This is a game where you have to make agonizing decisions and every piece of equipment that you have grown so attached to will break down and become useless (or you will spend yourself into oblivion trying to keep these parts functional). Unlike so many other procedurally generated games, this one has a great atmosphere and has given me a good scare on a number of occasions. Come for the cool retro-future atmosphere, stay for the desperate attempts at staving off a cold death in space. With drones, no one can hear you scream (or beg for your video feed start to working again).			"

The game plays a bit like FTL, so there's a lot of strategy and planning involved. You really have to plan every single move or you will regret it immediately.

												Duskers is a fascinating twist on the roguelike genre. In Duskers, you explore spaceships instead of dungeons, and you do so by remotely controlling robotic drones.


Bisqwit Plays Indie Games: Duskers 
A Video of Duskers
By: Bisqwit

			In Duskers, you explore and scavenge space shipwrecks using drones that you control with tank controls and commands that you type on keyboard, like in Roguelike games. I tried the game out. It runs on Linux!		


Pros (as of version 1.03):• Fascinating concept• Simplistic graphics• Gentle introduction to simplistic non-turingcomplete programming• There is no reaction time involved, just your ability to plan without typos• The noisy camera view, and the fact that catastrophic failure is nearly always one typo away, definitely helps set the scary tone• Reasonable installation size for a modern game (around 250 MB)• High compatibility: Works on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows, and hardware requirements are not high (requires shader support though, so older GMAs are out of question)• Keeps you busy for dozens of hours, although I fear it might get a bit repetitive• Game is still being maintained and updated, so new content and bugfixes are to be expectedCons (as of version 1.03):• If you get bad framerate, the game will randomly ignore your typed keys, making it for a frustrating game experience• Game price seems unreasonably high (right now 17€ with discounts)• Plot fails to engage the player early on• No Steam trading cards• No musicTL/DR: Pricey scary roguelike IN SPACE. Explore shipwrecks, control robots by typing commands. Works on any computer that can run Steam.			"

Early Access Review
								I personally love the idea of rouge-likes. games that mke your actions have immediate results and consequences.But there is a line. a delicate line, a line once drawn can make or break a game.This line is what makes or ruins rouge-likes for players. My friends and i call this line RNG GodIn FTL you can come out of warp into a sun covered with a metor shower having to fight a allready hard foe, with next to to survive it. Thats crossing the RNG lineIn duskers you start off with three drones with one of a few starting set ups. this chooses FOR YOU, which tactics you will employ early in the game. you can try to do your own thing but you are extremely restricted by your starting gear.I have had a horrible time with the RNG line in duskers, just like in FTL you can be randomly screwed over with the flip of a coin, reguardless of however skilled you are.My worst experiance by far was a 1 hour and a 1/2 run where i tip toed through 6 ships to get another drone and an interface moduel to make raiding ships easier. EASIER, not easy.The very next ship i go to to start employing use of the new drone and tool. i shift airlocks to deploy a drone elsewhere in the ship and suddenly : RADIATION COMING IN THROUGH THE HULL. directly into the room with all 3 of my drones who are basically keeping eyes on the entire ship. Before this mission the ship scans said the hulls intergrity was GOOD. If you randomly change the paramiters of a mission where a constant is known beforehand to be reliable its a sucker punch. This is a prime example of Random difficulty spikes that ruin fabulous games.I Do NOT recommend this game because of the exsistance of such extreme, random, and game breaking spikes like this.A space bound Astroid strike give you a chance to either turn tail or continue, the enemies are fantastic, you can find them and dispose of them multiple ways, even the sudden rouge enemies deciding to open doors they dont like is fun and keeps you on your toes.But you cannot come out of left feild with a random sucker punch.So TL:DR The game duskers is fantastic, from its look, to its form to its story you peice together yourself. I barely even see it being a early access game, it FEELS complete. And i will be playing it for weeks to come.Sadly it is another rouge-like with unpredicable absolutly random difficulty spikes that players will quite likely be unready for, and it may cause undue frustration and a game over.I do not recommend it unless you are patient, want a game like this for the sheer intrest factor or are a masochist who likes being occasonally sucker punched.

												RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG.  Once you get the basics down, which takes maybe a couple of hours and one or two resets, it becomes painfully obvious that this game is a glorified version of Solitaire, where it looks like you're doing things but in reality you never have any real choices and what happens during a playthrough is dictated entirely by the whims of the RNG.Exploration this game gets very repetitive very quickly.  Every derelict is the same.  Some upgrades are almost absurdly more useful than others.  Find turret, shield, stealth, interface, and remote power upgrades early and you'll go a long way.   But most of the time you'll just limp along carefully avoiding enemies until you inevitably die anyway.Eventually you'll run out of scrap, fuel, find yourself in a constellation with almost no boardable ships, find your drones stranded by radiation that cut them off from the exit, have your scouting drone get trapped in small or cluttered a room with an enemy and not be able to escape before its stealth runs out, or you'll just typo the wrong door and you'll die and it's back to the beginning.  Very few of my deaths did I feel were my fault nor did I feel I could have done anything to prevent them.  But even then there's no real progression so aside from your losing your drones it doesn't feel like much of a loss and whatever snippets of the story you've found remain.			"

Take this review with a grain of salt.I really wanted to like this, and I may fiddle with it a bit after writing this to see if it grows on me. I dig the aesthetic of old CRT monitors and controlling my drones and ship with a command line. It's a neat touch how each drone has slightly different video outputs, encouraging me to use scanning mods on the one with a whole 2 color displays, and leave the blind one as the power generator. It's really cool how I'm forced to build some kind of working strategy out of a ragtag collection of parts, and still feel like I can handle most situations.Emphasis on ""most"" I understand that you're never really supposed to ""win"" rogue-likes. You build up strength and capabilities over time, and so do your opponents. Eventually your growth will taper off, while your enemies continue to get stronger and overwhelm you. This game doesn't feel like that, though. I've gone through two games so far, and each time my team gets wiped, it's not because the enemy gradually became too much for me to handle, but because the game threw some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at me that I had no way to counter. First time it was because an asteroid destroyed the only airlock back to my ship, and the second was because an enemy ate the doorway next to the first room, and then all of my drones before they even got off the docking ship.I didn't lose because I pushed my team to their limit, took one too many gambles, and ultimately made one fatal mistake; I lost because the game decided I was going to. Even by rogue-like standards, that's not fun.			"

												This is a very interesting game. It's got a unique gameplay style where you can issue commands to your drones in a command prompt or use them manually one at a time.The art style and sound all fit together nicely and you can get right into this one, which gets a bit scary when suddenly things go wrong.I love how unique this game feels when playing. It's not every day that a game so interesting and unique pops up on steam, this one takes a bit of learning but it's worth it for the experience I would say.I would recommend this to anyone who likes Sci-fi / exploration games and enjoys the challenge that you can get from rogue-like / rogue-lite games.(First Impression video below)

			This is a neat sci-fi rogue-lite game called Duskers. It just came out of Early Access and the devs sent me a copy to try out.		

 I am not very good at this game but it's fun and very interesting for sure. I couldn't make it that far into the game but from what I saw it looks to be a very deep and rewarding experience.			"

												Awesome first 2-3 hours, but then you realize there is no real progression, no end game, no goal. You are basically just boarding ship after ship to get scraps to maintain your current loadout, which gets very repetitive very fast.Feels like a beta for now. However, the concept is so great that I really hope the devs come out with some real mid- and late-game content.			"

												I got this game because Cool Ghosts said it was good and.... it's not. It's incredibly boring. The puzzles range from tediously simple to impossible. The core of the gameplay seems to consist of restarting every time you run into a ship with a radiation leak or something and then just hoping that you don't run into another. There isn't really any skill involved, unless luck and patience are skills. I listened to Quinns and Matt rave about this game for over an hour and I'm still not sure what the appeal was meant to be. I wish my generosity had run out an hour sooner so I could have returned this thing. I'm someone who loves FTL and XCOM, two games this one keeps being favorably compared to, and there is just no contest. I'd rather play two hundred more hours of either than spend another second with this hunk of junk.			"

												Like other's already said, I hate it not to be able to recommend this game. It get's frustrating after a few rounds and I really tried to like it. The concept is great, the feeling is great, the audio is great, ... but YOU REALLY NEED TO BE A MASOCHIST to play this game. It's even with easier settings (e.g. enemies do not use vents) pretty hard. The RNG is also very frustrating sometimes. E.g. you must find a new ship cause your old one is going to break, just before you clear the last room - beep, beep, airlock a2 going poof or door not closing anymore - aaah wtf, why suddenly now?And i find it sometimes unlogic that you are so EXTREMELY *sigh* limited in a ""space travel"" game and the longer you plan your actions, the more gross things will happen (well, the ship is floating years without things happening, and suddenly out of the blue, an asteroid will hit it?)Why shouldn't you be able to go back to an already visited ship?Why do you have to find an interface module (and cannot build one) to be able to access terminals?You visit a dozen ships, why cann't you maintain your current one with those parts and only switch to the next old banger?In general the durability system is too harsh in my opinion. The ISS wouldn't last a day and Dragon X would fall apart after a launch in this game ;o)			"

												im early on into this game only just starting my first foray into the dead universe of duskers and im already loving it. It perfectly executes the atmosphere of infinite nothing, no more humans, the only organic things that still exist are relentlessly trying to kill you. And let me say the first time I encountered a hostile entity it jumped at me and made me jump out of my chair and across the room.you play the role of a drone operator sending salvage bots into the many dead ships you encounter to scrounge what you can to survive.play wise this game really nails the simple but deep control scheme switching between more precise direct control and the less precise more effecient console commands. It can also really lead to some tense moments, frantically driving away from a threat. The metagame of ability management and the degradation of drone tools and the drones themselves can at some times be rather annoying but it herds you into trying all sorts of different playstyles to clear ships.Tl;dr its a fun game, will scare the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you sometimes  im still looking over my shoulder every minute while playing  the meta games fun and the mechanics are solid.  Totally Recomended  "

												Genuinely enjoying this game so far. It's been a hectic time playing it. The gameplay is polished and feels amazing. There are jumpscares and battles happening throughout, when an infestation rushes you and you were not expecting it. I've had two total wipes so far, which is pretty good for me in these games. It's a random start, and random generated ships, galaxies, and the like so it has lots or replay value. Would recommend to just about everyone.			"

												Honestly, this is one of the coolest games I've played in a long time.The whole goal is to move from system to system, salvaging and leeching off as many derelict ships as you can (hint: every single ship is derelict). It's a bit hard to tell from the trailer, but the entire game's actually closer to a hacking style game than anything. While you can pilot drones around manually, you can also type in commands to navigate drones from one room to another, and every single action you do (from gathering stuff to opening doors to interfacing with terminals) has to be typed out. The typing ""controls"" are actually very simple and straightforward, and they seem to function quite well without any major issues (except some pathfinder issues, but it's not that big of a deal).This is the perfect game if you're looking to be the last known survivor, in space, without actually ever doing anything yourself			"

												Like a lot of games today, this game is hard. You loose. A lot. You spend an hour exploring a ship and do it all perfectly... and get nothing from it. But as I said, being 'hard' isn't a new thing or even a bad thing.Unlike a lot of games today, this game is fun. Dynamic puzzles, exploration of setting, great atmospherics add to it. Like a lot of great games, the complexity is emergant rather than coded in the gameplay. Control is simple, display is simple, information is easily and readily available. And it won't save you. And you'll want to go right back in.If Mini Metro is fun but lacks a sense of immersion or a sense of dread, this game is for you.			"

												Great puzzle concept and atmosphere. It's a cerebreal version of System Shock 2, and just as scary.But the developers tell you up front to tweak the difficulty settings until the game is satisfying, and this is a big red flag telling you the game is  still ""early access"", even if the label's been removed.There's also not much content, no ending, and no satisfying conclusion. I also see some newbie UI mistakes in the ship plan view. The layout needs to be cleaned up.Needs more work.Maybe a sequel will allow the game to reach its full potential.			"

												An interesting deep space strategy game, though a bit pricey for $20 in my opinion. You control a team of up to four drones with a variety of upgrades into ships, space stations, and outposts. You have to salvage these places in order to repair/upgrade your drones as well as repair/upgrade/refuel your ship. Only problem is that there are always enemies on board that you need to take care of. The above doesn’t sound too hard in principle until you take into account that you almost exclusively control your drones through a command line, typing in commands. If you are playing this game you might as well just unplug your mouse because you can’t use it. You have to be carful about what you type and you need to be accurate because a simple typo can destroy all of your drones. That is why things should be taken slow and carful, because if you make a mistake and one of your drones is in trouble panic will make it even harder to type.  If you like enjoying yourself please, take all the difficulty settings and turn them to zero. By large request the developers eventually added difficulty settings as before ‘normal mode’ meant perma-death, if you make a mistake you either have to cut your losses or restart from scratch. Even on easy mode I’ve never had enough resources to waste on anything. Since the universes, galaxies, and systems you explore are procedurally generated, you are always at the mercy of RN-jesus. I enjoy the game a bit, though I play it in bursts because it tends to get tedious, which is why I recommend you wait for a sale.			"

												This game is wonderful. I'm serious.DISCLAIMER: I Program computers in my free time when I get bored of video games. My opinion will be skewed by such, you have been warned.Duskers asthetic is ♥♥♥♥ING WONDERFUL! Seriously! It reminds me of the old computers from days of yore! I LOVE IT TO DEATH!Duskers has a wonderful tension to it, specifically in the OH♥♥♥♥♥♥situations that crop up here and there. It sets a wonderful atmosphere and has a deeply interesting world with what little I've seen of it thus far. You use drones to explore derelict ships and scavenge for resources. It's a spectacular experience as you yourself are not directly inside these deathtraps, but the loss of a drone or failure to gather fuel is a constant threat. These risks and threats still feel very immediate even though I can continue if I lose a drone, or don't find scrap.Do not attack the enemy head on, you will loose countless drones. If you want a FPS or something with lots of shooting, go buy an FPS. Duskers is about being resourceful and intelligent.You control your drones through a direct control (arrow keys) and a shell (Command Line). You can only drive a drone with the arrow keys, to do anything more you have to use the shell. It is rather simple and the game has a quick little tutorial, it isn't full blown programming but I still love it to death. A quick example of how one uses the shell> navigate 1 r15> gather 1 allthat would send drone 01 to room 15 and tell drone 01 to gather all the scrap in that room. It's a rather interesting little system. Along with these goodies there are upgrades, modules, etc, etc, etc. ALL THE LOOT! (Yes, you can also find disfunctional drones to tow back to your ship, repair, and use in future scavenging runs)However, loot can break. So you have to keep scrapping unneeded loot to keep your good loot in working order or it will become worthless scrap!There is equipment for drones, and ship upgrades. A great deal of the ship upgrades are very, very, useful. And I have eyt to run into a single drone upgrade I dislike (but the stealth and shield upgrades are my favorite). Plus, you can commandeer a derelict deathtrap if you can remove all hostiles from it. These ships can have all variety of goodies!Then, there is my favorite part. The Alias system.You can do some very, very, barebones and very basic automation of drone control with Aliasing.A few ExamplesA simple shortening of the navigate command for 0# $#!+! moments.nav=navigate $x1 ($x2) ($r1) ($d1)A simple alias to return a drone to the boarding vesselhome=navigate ($x1) ($x2) ($x3) ($x4) r1Scan and gather the room a drone is currently ingatherscan=scan $x1 ; gather $1 allTow a disabled drone back to the boarding vessel (haven't tested this one, made up on the fly)getdrone=nav $x1 $x2 ; tow $x1 ; nav $1 r1 ; tow $1Etc, etc, etcThe game is ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful!Oh, and a quick note, yes, you can suck stuff out an airlock :D:D:D:D:DPssst! A quick extra thing!Disabled drones still have a video feed! I let you think about how that is useful on your own!			"

												Curator Review:Duskers is a Real Time Strategy game blended with Rogue-lite aspects in a Survival Horror atmosphere. Take control of drones and explore derelict ships to find out why the universe is a giant graveyard. Just what apocalypse has beset this place now seemingly only occupied by you and your enemies. At a 7.5/10 I thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend it as an option for all rogue-lite  and survival horror lovers.

												If you know what Computercraft for Minecraft is, then you have an Idea how awsome a Consolebased Drone-Operator game like this can be!This game resembles a symbiosis of a puzzle and strategy game with technical depth and subtle but serious Horror elements. The gameplay core consists of survival through gathering of Fuel and Scrap in (almost) deserted Spaceships & stations. But these space entities hold tremendous Horrors for curious scavangers. Upon entering the deserted floors of these drifting relics These Horrors await beneath every door. Use technical assistance to reveal threats and trick or even exterminate any hostile matter. You may start out with few of these Gadgets but soon your drones will be up to any confrontation. Upgrades and scrap awaits the bravest of drone Operators.10/10 would type ""begin"" again "

Duskers is what you get when you combine the methodical, brutal progression of FTL with the nuances and unit management of a top-down tactics game with basically, a DOS UI. And it's AWESOME!You don't know who you are or what's happened in the universe you're in, you just know that you have control over various drones with different capabilities and you must move from derelict ship to derelict ship, salvaging what you can, avoiding or cleverly overcoming the unknown but deadly adversaries you'll find and trying to make your way forward and find out just what happened.Duskers doesn't hold your hand but also conveys a lot of knowledge to you organically over time. What can be called the tutorial passes super quick and you'll continue to learn bits about managing your drones in each new level. Everything is done with the keyboard and largely on a command line, which has a limited command set and an intuitive autocomplete function that makes it easy to learn and a very efficient way of directing your units. You drones can be damaged or destroyed but can be repairs, as can other broken down drones you'll find along the way. Each has a set of equipment that bestows different abilities and you'll need to mix and match to get the most out of every salvage operation.Like FTL, this is a rogue-like. You can limp along as far as you can get but when you're dead, you're dead and the only thing you carry forward to your next playthrough is your increased knowledge. The similarities and inspirations of FTL in Duskers are obvious but it's also a very different experience and stands out well in its own right.Duskers kicked my♥♥♥♥♥in my first playthrough on the live stream but I really enjoyed it and plan to go back for plenty more. If you like tactics games and FTL, this is a no brainer. Get it!			"

												A game with an amazing concept, but it's a very flawed gem.There are two major problems with the game.  First:  the game is 100% randomly generated as far as I can tell, which means that you  could very easily start out with no chance of survival.  You can start in a system populated mostly or only with ships you can't visit, and the other nearest systems can have the same sort of population.  The ships you can visit may have something, but there's also a chance that there won't be anything you can collect there, which means that there is a very real chance every time you go in a ship that nothing will be there.  Which means that you will wear out parts and drones.I don't hate that it's difficult; I hate that the complete randomness (as far as I can tell it's random) can force you to lose from the get go, and it's the futility that gets to me.  I've restarted several times because of this, and that really wears on me.  I don't want to play if something is impossible.  Hard, yes.  Terrifying, yes.  Impossible?  No.Second problem adds to the difficulty, and that seems to be that the AI for the organic enemies is triggered almost entirely by motion.  Yes, there is a bit of salt in my critique, but just hear me out.  You can open a door, and go inside while cloaked, and you can find an organic enemy, which won't move until you close the door.  If you go back through the same door later on the same enemy will be sitting at that door, which is weird when you consider that animals would be exploring the room after you've already shut the door in their face.Another random problem happened, which I can only assume was some random bug.  I moved a drone back to the shop so I could re-dock it at another spot.  After docking I left the doors closed, but the drone that was in my ship started taking damage, which would have been impossible considering that the doors were closed.  MAYBE.  The developers allow for space-borne enemies to get inside through the airlock (I moved the ship because something was going on with the airlock).  BUT.  My ship and the ship I docked on would both have airlock doors...  neither were open.  So I would just suggest that the developers make a patch.  You'd have to open two sets of airlocks (one for your ship, one for the ship you are boarding.  It would be annoying, but more realistic.I don't want to give up on this game.  I'm going to keep playing this game, because I really, really hope I'm 100% wrong.  The concept behind this game is so amazingly simple yet so amazingly terrifying.  Just bear in mind, if you want to buy this game its appearance is deceiving--you might get an easy start, or you could get crushed right out of the gate.			"

												I've always wanted a game about being some kind of a drone operator salvaging derelict spaceships and you can imagine my surprise at actually finding a game that lets me do exactly that. Not only that, but it has an intriguing story to it, which I haven't completed yet. The game gets quite hard after a few hours, and I've had to reset a bunch of times after a few month break between tries.			"

Repeat.This game does not forgive. But it is fair. It does not kill you. You do it all by yourself.Is it hard?Not that much really. But like any other rouge-like, it is good to know that you are going to die quite often.Then you are going to learn basics.Plan ahead.Experiment.And most important of all Have fun. I did.8+/10			"

I already have recommended this to others.  I met one of the developers at SF Playcrafting last winter and told him that I might buy it down the road.  Lo and behold, I am satisfied.  Thanks.			"

												This game is just amazing.The story is immersive, I can't feel the time passing at all. Once I start the game, I must use an alarm to force myself to stop playing for the day and do something else.It may prove to be extremely challenging, and though I am a person who prefers story over gameplay, the creators did an outstanding job balancing difficulty and story. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone, and once you buy it, give it some time. It's going to be frustrating at first, but you will eventually get addicted to it. Thank you Misfits Attic for making this game!			"

												I bought this game along with a bunch of other rougelikes durring the steam summer sale of 2016.Then I ended up playing for the next four hours without realizing I forgot to eat dinner, and until I fell asleep at my desk.This is taking into account the fact that I have actual diagnosed chronic insomnia.This game is far far more immersive than one would expect, and will delight fans of unforgiving games such as Darksouls one, or the sort of people who always played Jack and Daxter with the difficulty set to maximum at all times.Five stars- would die again.

												the game is fun but it is virtually unplayable if you do not start with these specific conditions Drone mods: gather, generator, tow, interface, and motionStart condition: not on a quarantine or military ship and in a system with no quarantines.I have only had those conditions once out of over 100 resets, played for quite a few tense and enjoyable hours until mistakes were made. after that I have not had a single set up that has lasted more than one ship for various reasons. I can't say I recommend the game but at the same time I can't say I don't I know it is supposed to be rogue like but even rogue like games are all playable at teh begining.			"

I'd love to give this game a huge thumbs up but right now it's just a shame that these issues make it a bit dull and unplayable at times. These can be fixed by the devs surely?			"

												Seems like it could be quite a great game for the right person.  For me it is a little too slow moving and difficult/tedious to control to be a good candidate for a roguelike.  I was on maybe my fifth ship and accidentally activated a defense structure in the room I was in because my kid was distracting me.  Killed most of my drones.No problem I will just load up a save, oh no saves.  So there was an hour wasted.  That is ok not all games are for all people.  This seems well made and interesting, and maybe if I had gotten further or the controls were less annoying I would have stuck with it.  As it is I have dozens of games I can play, no need to spend time on ones I don't love.			"

												Let me sum this game up...The first two or three hours made me insane, had to restart a couple of times due to ""unforeseen consequences"" as radiation leaking pipes blocking the way, monster bees crawling through vents appearing in rooms you thought they were safe, ships making strange noises and suddenly breaking apart room by room, failing air vents or simply because i had no motion scanner and was rushing into a room without preparation and caution getting my drones slaughtered one by one resulting in facing the inevitable.But now I reached a point where I explored a dozen ships, some of them quite huge (30+ doors) and still learning tons of things. And it is awesome!You really get used to the basic commands (especially when you are already in the IT business) and learn to combine them quite fast, though i kinda miss the ""shortened"" commands as when programming switches for example... ""sh run"" is short for ""show running configuration"" and works as the long one... and in this game where time is of the essence (in my job too though ;-) ), it can be kinda frustrating typing ""nav"" for ""navigation"", pressing space to complete the command, following a number for the selected drone(s) and a destination; although the latter is really shortened effectively.This command/GUI of the game also is completely(!) seperated from mouse control, so do not even try to use it - it simply does not work. For me it's kinda fun, reminding me of the good old days, where the keyboard does the job.Though I could imagine some will frustrate facing immediate death and not being able to start a ""LoL-like mouse button♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; to rescue all the drones.In short: This game has a HUGE learning curve. Or you die. Simple as that.Also noticable: The basic tutorial teaches basic stuff, necessary stuff you must know while sleeping. It is neither the only stuff you have to know, nor is everything explained in the more detailed ""help"" register.It is all basic. There are many drone addons you will find that are not explained, enemies are completely out of the loop regarding explanation (what are they, what can they do, what should you definitely not do when facing them).Nevertheless, you have choices of course. You can set quite a lot of parameters defining the difficulty (e.g. you can have an easier (not ""easy"") starting point or directly a punch in your face, basically).And then there is this tense atmosphere... Although your life is not in direct danger (you have your drones), you kinda evolve into feeling like in ""Alien: Isolation"" all the time - at the latest when you realize that a closed door between your drones and a known infestated room is in no way an assurance for their safety.I would say a 9/10. Worth a buy, though I still have a little keyed up feeling regarding the price tag... It's worth 15€ - don't get me wrong.But looking at its non-Steam-Summersale price tag of 20€ for complete 2D graphics (though they are great and fit here!), whereas other great 3D games sell for less or the same, it made me thing twice before buying it.Still: It IS on sale now, so get it :P			"

												An altogether impossible game, for the most part. I can understand there is a challenge with these types of games, but come on. If you start without certain equipment, you\'re basically screwed. If you run into too many ship with baddies in the beginning, you\'re screwed. If you run out of fuel because none of the ships you search has any, you\'re screwed. There seems to be just the slimmest combination of equipment, ships, drops, and baddies that will allow you to survive the game longer than a half hour or so. I wish I could have figured this out two hours ago so I could get a refund.			"

												Well that's £13.50 poorly spent and a lesson in not believing that ""Very Positive"" overall user review. Instead of periodic saves you get Reset; and it means just that, after a few times getting 2 or 3 salvage trips into the game and losing key drones to the ridiculously fast red things. The propsect of going all the way back to the start with randomised abilities on the drones was just too frustrating and dull to contemplate so I gave up. The experience isn't tense, it's annoying; I buy games to enjoy them not to be continually reset - where's the fun in that. At the speed it downloaded there's only about 20 lines of code and no graphics to speak of so a save command doesn't seem like too much to ask. The command line novelty soon wears off as you discover that to close a door in the face of a rapidly advancing red splodge that you don't get to see until the last minute and that your motion sensor didn't warn you about requires a down arrow plus a typed command. The most skilled touch typist on the planet is unlikely to be able to achieve that.Take my advice - buy 3 pints of beer, it'll be better value.In light of comments and my sense of fair play I thought I'd edit my review after giving this another chance. I spent a couple more hours and actually It's worse than  my previous thoughts. That said read Distantflight's review which is fairer and kinder than the game deserves.An example: After a dozen or so resets both to overcome the random spawning of drones with sub-optimal loadouts and to see if it was possible to get an ""interface"" in the loadout (it wasn't) in order to use all the terminals that proliferate on ships that you visit. More resets when I didn't survive more than 2 ship vists because the game is hard for an old bloke with a job who has a life but enjoys a bit of recreational (look it up) gaming. Anyhow, I thought I'd cracked it - back on first boarding, should be easy. I new there was a red splodge in a room and I set myself up to retreat through two doors and trap my adversary in a room. It should have worked, a straight line so the counter intuitive arrow controls don't confuse me door close command typed in only waiting for a single keystroke. Drone retreats indistinct enemy follows - brilliant, what a game - just about to exit door 2 and press enter... red streak across intervening space, instant kill. There's such a paucity of resources, salvage and spare drones as well as modules that a player can't absorb the casualties or the repair bill and move on. >Duskers_ Explore . Repeatedly Reset . Stop Playing .			"

THE GOODFantastic interface, control/gameplay, atmosphere. Frustrating design: cannot bring myself to keep playing.Interface & Control - Typing to quickly get drones to perform their actions, setting aliases to combine commands. Fantastic and refreshing gameplay. Could easily do this for hours.Atmosphere. - The sound of the droids in 1st PoV and it cutting away when you swith to ship view is fantastic. Many small details to the sound made when moving or colliding give an amazing feel.THE BADDesign, however, is frustrating. On the minor side is that scrap (required to upgrade and keep your parts working) is on the low side. This is workable if your skilled and careful, at least in the early game and feeds into the atmosphere. Some will prefer this style, others won't.On the major side is when that idea is taken to far: the main view, which is critical to being able to do almost anything, degrades with your ship. Unlike droids which as they degrade you can repair (contributing to the fantastic atmosphere of trying to keep everything together) the video feed cannot be repaired and you must abandon the entire ship. Repeatedly. It works counter to the atmosphere of the game and breaks immersion all in the name of forcing players to utilize a mechanic.OVERALLVery interesting idea, hampered by a few questionable decisions that completely ruin the fun and atmosphere.If you get it for free, give it a whirl to experience some unique mechanics, but I wouldn't pay money for it.

												Faults:- weak, if any considerable narrative- monothonous- gamebreaking bugs- grossly overpriced [20€], worth 10€Apart from that, Duskers is a minimalist in design and narrative, immersive core science-fiction difficult and unique rougelike tactical play with a puzzlegame heart. The user interface is somewhat complicated with a DOS-style console to enter commands, definitely requiring precision, but fun if you know how to handle it. Fortunately, it is graspable.What you do in Duskers is you loot derelict spaceships in a mysteriously devastated, extinct post-apocalyptic world. The narrative regards solving the question of what has led to this state, with the protagonist just awoken from a cryosleep. Since the derelicts hold danger, next to lore and precious scrap, drones are used to penetrate them.All in all, a good release with exceptional potential, delivered simplified, sometimes recklessly. 7/10 wHATs grade. Could be so much more only with adding to the narrative, but the entire production neither seems particularly rushed nor lacking anything special. It is just slightly missed, as if a blurry image, but still recommendable to fans of science-fiction themes and demanding tactical challenges.			"

												A solid alpha that calls itself complete...So in essance your are paying $19.99us for what is essentially a flash game.Don't get me wrong it's a great game, it's aesthetically pleasing, and has great mechanics, but it is overall a flash game, and as such I think it could do with a price drop, considering that other games such as depth, subnautica and the long dark which have a considerable amount of content, are all in the same price range as it. Money for value, I put it at about $7.99usthis is not me trying to dis the game, i truly think it is a great horror game... and i do reccomend it, however that is only the case if you are brought up on beluga caviar and moet... and as such you should get more than what you get for the price.

Early Access Review
								I have just played 1.7 hours of the game so far and was enjoying it from the start. A game that makes you think how you should proceed. I've never been one for rogue games but this had me hooked, at least at the start.By the time I got to the second system arbitrarily imposed gameplay mechanics suddenly appear. The first one was a compartment that started to flood with radiation. I didn't hang around to find out whether this would continue to flood to other parts of the ship. The second was enemies that spawned INSIDE a room I had already secured. Where they came from I can't say as all doors were shut. The third and final nail for me was artbitrarily disabled doors. One minute they work, the next they don't. Presumably down to the actions of enemies trapped inside, I'm not sure.That was enough for me. I thought it was going to be a strategy game, planning your way through a ship and instead it turns into a rush into the ship and grab what you can while you can game. Shame as I really wanted to like this game but if the ruleset changes randomly each time you play then that's not fun for me. RNG can be unfair I admit but getting sucker punched, as someone else put it, ruined it for me.			"

												I am a software developer, which is the main reason I decided to buy this game, however the commands available in game and the actual programming is almost non existent: there are some simple commands such as ""go"", ""scan"", ""grab"" etc. - things that you would normally do with a single click in RTS games there is a possibility to create functions, which accept parameters - this is nice there are no in-game commands to read the state of the map - when I do scan, it highlights the rooms with different colours, but no way to retrieve this information using a command there are no arrays, loops, if-statements, variables... this game has nothing to do with programming. You could actually take any RTS, replace selecting the unit using left mouse button with typing ""select XXX"" and you would get Duskers in result... becomes highly repetitive and boring after 2 hoursWhat I would like to see in this game? A possibility to write a complex script, that once executed would allow to finish every map, without any further interactions.			"

												This game is ridiculous. When you are on a mission, you HAVE TO complete it, otherwise if you quit, you not only lose all the progresses on that mission but also, ridiculously, CANNOT return to the mission as the game says that you have already explored the ship and can't reexpolore it... How does that even make sense? Why on earth can't I return to the ship on which I have already landed? Fix this problem or give explanation to it or I won't touch this game any more.By the way, if you hate permadeath, don't buy this game; it doesn't have save and reload options to rewind any mistakes you make unless you restart from the very beginning.

It's still under development but it's very obvious that the developer(s) care about it a lot.  I cannot wait to see what it's like after it leaves alpha; supposedly the next update is going to expand on what you can do with ships that you commandeer as well as focus on increasing the difficulty in mid/late game.  I don't play roguelikes very often, but this one was a gem worth grabbing.			"

								Bleak, eerie, and merciless, Duskers feels like Uplink had a lovechild with Aliens; all at once making you feel very clever, while reminding you at every opportunity that you are doomed. Despite its ""early access"" status, the game appears quite polished; the controls are smooth, the interface looks good, the general design of everything is firmly cemented and during my first two hours, I did not encounter anything that felt overtly *lacking*... though some more story content (ship logs and so on) would not go amiss.Recommendation for playing:Name a drone ""Wilson"".

								Absolutely fantastic game!! I couldn't be happier with the thoughtful integration of game and realism. You actually feel like you're in the world, not just through visual immersion, but actually through the gameplay! I've never played a game where the physical gameplay immersed me in the world. That's TRUE immersion!From the very opening, the entire thing brought me back to the amazing DOS days of programming my computer to say 'Hello' to me in Cyan colored font using GW-BASIC. A true homage to the glory days of yesteryear.If you're looking for a rougelike birthed from thoughtful care, you've found it. If you're looking for real strategic depth, a wonderful rabbithole of functionality that illuminates the deeper you delve, and complete immersion... this is your game. It's like a concept album from Dreamtheater, or something.I actually found myself becoming strangely attached to my drones, the futher they salvaged inside the hulls of empty vessels, the more I became frantic I'd lose them to some sinister thing lurking behind a bulkhead, forcing me to engage my thought to find clever ways to adapt to the circumstances. And the futher in I went, the more I discovered, and the better at the game I got: a true hallmark of a good game.My drone, with its little light beacon of hope against the black searching for... ..something.

Also, as things are very early alpha it is certain things will change over time.That out of the way, the retro sci-fi mood is perfect. Things can be a little frustrating, as the game UI tends to make you work to get information out of it, but that is actually part of the challenge. Because of the clunky controls the game is something of a puzzle game.Let me explain what I mean: The tools you have at your disposal are likely to be a random mish-mash of what you happened to be able to grab. You also have no real idea about what challenges you'll be facing until you actually get into the ship. As such you need to be able to predict what steps you need to take in order to succeed and figure out some way to use the particular capabilities at your finger tips to meet your challenges.A lot of times this means taking actions preemptively since the last thing you want to do is scramble to type in commands when you are already under attack. It also means that intially you are going to have a fair number of deaths as you learn what type of threats there are and completely new ones surprise you.			"

								Duskers is a game about inanimate object attachment, you will become attached to your drones, that is no question.A moment before i decided to write this i was piloting a drone named 003 or 'Tim' through an unexplored room, opening a door i saw an object that seemed to shift slightly as my little buddies scanners observed it, promptly i reversed 'Tim' back the way he came and shut the door, i felt secure in the fact that i hadavoided the danger and saved my little buddy.Then his video feed promtly malfunctioned.Almost instantly i felt my heart drop into my stomach and through the command interface ordered him back to a secured room, shutting the doors behind him.After several tense moments his feed came back online and i let out the breath i'd been holding.Like i said, inanimate object attachment.Also the whole Explore, Adapt, Survive thing is here too.I was exploring a ship when i came across a hostile entity, i was forced to adapt through the sudden loss of visuals, Tim survived because of this adaption.So i guess this game delivers on it's tagline.

								Best game I played in a while. I really like the minimalistic scifi/lofi/alien UI look. The console interaction makes it feel... realistic in a way. The abstinence of music and only the very subtle soundeffects of the drones give it some kind of ""horror"" and with the simple style most of the scaryness is only in the players head, which is great!Thanks for such a great and unique experience. Looking forward to the updates!Best played with headphones in a dark room :)			"

								Okay if you are older or a fan of claffic text adventures this game would be a perfect mix between FTL and an old Infocom game called Suspended Animation.  I have yet to encounter a bug... at least not a programming kind of bug.  everything I have encountered in the game I have wisely kept on the other side of a door, which I have heard isn't always possible... and venting the airlock can destroy the generator inlets, consoles, and items in a room so be careful... and atmospheric radiation spreads and I havent figured out how to properly deal with it as of yet.  I beleive it spreads through air vents so be careful about poisoning your salvage target...   10/10  just a freaking awesome thinker's game.Edit: the steam forum in-game button seems to have crashed it... may not be related to my crash, but minor and easy to avoid if so...Edit #2:  The game quickly ramps up in difficulty in the second sector and on some ships can be a bit of a time race.  10/10 would kill my drone again by activating ship defences while my drone was in the same room.

								This game is awesome. If you played space hulk orwere a fan of the alien franchise, this game is for you.I played for about 3 hours until my drones broke, I ran out of fuel and pretty much lost the game. I cried manly tears, weeped and then started all over again, because I was hooked.This game is still in development, and is still comparatively barren with features, however, the procedurally game world means there will never be a shortage of new ships and galaxies to explore.I love the idea of being the last person in existance, with only my drones to be my eyes, gather supplies and for all intents and purposes, keep me alive.This game is worth the $20 I paid for it, without question. I am excited to see what the future holds for duskers and it's developers. Keep up the great work!!			"

								SummaryThis game is essentially chess... in outer space... and you cant see the opponent's pieces... and the chess board is an unknown variable.Long story short, you're some sort of researcher, setting out to try and figure out what happened in a catastrophe, and why. You're given several hypothesis, and your job is to board derelict ships left behind in the catastrophe with automated drones to find evidence to support or disprove each hypothesis. Only problem is, every ship is a massive unknown, and presents hazards, including organic enemies of different forms, hull breaches, spontaneous radiation leaks, and just plain dumb mistakes, all of which can get your cute little drones killed. To avoid such hazards, there is a progression system. Your drones are given a variety of upgrades to suit your play style, including stealth upgrades, support upgrades, and combat upgrades. Your ship can be upgraded as well, allowing you to perform drone tasks remotely. Of course, you must search derelicts to FIND these upgrades. It also requires skill with your environment. Every derelict has doors that must be powered from outlets, and then opened and closed. This gives the player the ability to lure enemies into empty or useless rooms while you get the loot. On top of all this, you, as a researcher, have been dumped here with minimal resources. You must scavenge for your fuel, and scrap metal. Worse still, much like in real life, your equipment falls prey to wear and tear, and you must keep it well maintained.Progress and upgrade your ship and equipment, survive for as long as possible in the depths of space, prove your cunning plans against foes and obstacles, use strategy on a universal scale, and piece together murder mystery style clues find out what the hell happened to everyone. That's a pretty good combination, one this game pulls of well.InterfaceThe UI is perhaps the most beautiful part about this game. It's all done in 1980's style retro computing. No mouse is used, everything is done with keys, and you control everything by typing in commands to a command bar like some sort of programmer. As for visual information, it's basically done in the style of top down false color ultrasound images. Use of this kind of technology is actually quite plausible on drones and robots, as it provides them 3d images, espescially in the darkened interiors of a derelict space ship. It has a unique combination of being high enough resolution to know what's what, and how to get the job done, while also being low enough detail to leave the interior of the derelicts up to the imagination. And rather than simply being the same overused retro pixelated visuals common to indie games, these visuals are the first like it I've ever seen, and they have a logical reason for why it might look like that in real life. If you like not only sci fi, but 1980s style retro sci fi, this is a must have.NegativesThere are very few that I have. Being an early alpha, obviously there'll be the occasional issue, and it probably has less content now than it will later. For example, I found a glitch where the map had old ships frozen on the screen while I was looking at new ones.The only REAL complaint I have about an actual decision the devs had on gameplay is an inability to revisit old ships and star systems. This has twice caused me problems in the 2 or 3 hours I've played the game.For example, I ran out of fuel to continue in one star system, so had no choice but to jump to another. The problem is that you're given new fuel everytime you jump. This leads to an exploitable game mechanic, where in a player could have infinite fuel by jumping constantly. So, I understand  why they dont let you jump back to an old star system. But this essentially left me with 5/8 ships in my last system unexplored. There's a pretty simple solution here, why not just ONLY give new fuel when you jump into a NEW star system?Another example would be when I accidentally left 2 drone upgrades (including my only tow) on a ship because I switched the wrong direction when swapping with a dead one... AAAAND of course I couldnt reboard right after to pick them up... Now THAT I see no reason for. Only thing I can think of is devs want the player to keep moving forward, probably to really feel the consequences of mistakes, but truth is, im not so sure it's possible to ONLY move forward in a strategy game. Both of these mistakes of mine could've easily been preventable or recoverable in real life had I simply gone back after the fact. But that's just not an option in this game. Anyway, I think this one particular restriction in the game is the ONE thing the devs should probably reconsider.RecommendationsI'd reccommend this game to anybody who likes strategy games, puzzle games, management games, murder mystery plots, progression systems, science fiction, or retro sci fi technology. Basically, if you like Xcom, you'll like this game. If you're looking for something that's fast paced and exciting, then this game probably isn't for you (though it has its scary moments). This is a game you can sit down, and RELAX, playing for hours, and using your head more than anything else, much like chess.Gameplay Suggestions to DevsI see potential for a few cool new features.1.) Co Op multiplayer.Each player has their own 1-2 drones (limit to 4 drones means limit to 4 players). Sometimes players can use their own ships at the same time, allowing for multiple ships. Players can work together to solve a puzzle. This game feels well suited towards encouraging teamwork, much like the co-op in portal 2.2.) Competetive multiplayerI could also envision competetive multiplayer. There could be a matchmaking system that pits 2-4 players against each other on a massive ship, with 4 drones tops each. Players can either take the run and gun approach, or use stealth to do things like throw enemies out the airlock.Door control could mainly be done through interface computers, which would make those of strategic importance. Whomever has control of the computer in an area gets control over certain doors.3.) Finally, I'd like to see logs and clues become more of a focus in the game. Mainly, I'd like to see it be the case that players aren't just GIVEN logs upon docking, but instead, are required to search the ship to track down logs. Or better yet, even physical clues. Things like dead bodies or mysterious devices that can be towed back to the mothership for analysis. You guys could go full on NCIS with the game, and leave it up to the player to track down clues to solve the mystery. I think doing this would also provide a greater motivation to play. The main motivation now is exploration and progression. Throw in the tantalizing clues of the story you're creating, and they simply won't be able to quit. It would turn the players into a criminal investigator, who have to use their own intuition to find and determine the meaning of clues.----------------------------------------------------How this game has only 34 reviews is beyond me. Even in mere early access, it's well worth those 20 bucks.			"

Early Access Review
								Duskers is the next game from studio Misfits Attic and represents a huge departure from their lighthearted puzzle game a Virus Named Tom. This time around, a dark desolate future awaits you with your only allies are drones and a lone command console.(This review is taken from the Alpha of Duskers, which at this time is version .21.  Screenshots and impressions may not represent the current version of the game. You can buy Duskers on Early Access now and the developers are hoping for three to six months of updates and work before officially releasing it.)A Dirty Future:Duskers’ story takes place sometime in the far future, where you awaken as the sole survivor of a ship with only a few days of fuel left and no clue where you are or what happened to the rest of humanity. Your only option are derelict ships, stations and more with no signs of life for you to explore. Aiding you is a set of basic drones that come equipped with upgrade modules that let them perform specific tasks.Duskers' universe is entirely procedurally generated when you start a new game and you are given a random assortment of drones and upgrades. The universe is broken down into systems and then sectors that have places for you to explore. How it works is that in each sector, you have a limited number of proportion jets to move within the sector. When they run out, you need to enter warp via fuel cells in order to replenish them, fuel cells are found on ships and if you run out, you will be stranded.With a procedurally generated universe, a playthrough of Duskers can take vastly different turnsEach derelict is also procedurally generated and before you enter one, you'll be given an idea of what it is, how long it has been adrift and if there are any infestations or enemy types on board.All this is presented using a dirty tech aesthetic; where even though you're in the future, there are basic readout screens similar to the movie Alien. The game's commitment to this aesthetic is great and it really helps to set the mood; not only that, but you can play the entire game using a keyboard thanks to it.After selecting your target and equipping your drones, it's time to step foot into the unknown and where Duskers takes the dirty tech aesthetic even further.Command Prompt:The gameplay of Duskers is all about commanding your drones to explore and recover useful information and resources; however you're not going to be seeing the universe for what it is. Instead, the entire game is played through the viewpoint of your command console and all footage is fed to you via the drones' camera system. You can directly move a drone via the keyboard, but to do multiple orders and take charge, you need to use the command console.On the bottom right corner of the screen, you have a command prompt that lets you issue orders to the ship and the drones themselves. Opening and closing doors require you to type in the door code into the console and you can command multiple drones to move via ""navigate"" and the drone numbers. You can view the entire schematic of the ship via the spacebar; this allows you to see all room numbers and their respective door codes. Upgrades which are attached to your drones can be used by typing their name into the command prompt and there is a help guide for more information on what they do.Ship exploration hinges on your use of the command prompt and keeping an eye on the schematics to figure out what's going on The upgrades are very important as they are your sole means of interacting with the world. ""Generator"" and ""Gather"" are the two big ones at the start; the former allows you to turn on generators to power up sections of the ship and gather lets you pick up scrap and fuel.Things start out innocently enough, as you find upgrade modules that you can take back and even more drones to take into a ship, but then things change. You'll soon find that the universe is filled with hostiles of a variety of types, and they are out to destroy your drones and your only means of survival.Duskers shows a lot of promise as an up and coming rogue-like, even at this very early stage of Alpha. I'm curious to see if or how the game's mechanics will be expanded upon and what things will be added to give the game a greater plot.(For more reviews, videos, and podcasts on a variety of games, check out Game-Wisdom[Game-wisdom.com] "

It rewards careful planning and punishes rushing into it fairly. The mechanics behind it are solid. Pros: -Good art style-Excellent mechanics-Good sound designCons:-Minor bugs-The insanily frustrating inability to re-visit ships you've left / game crashed while playing-Needs more features, (This games early access so I can't even really call this a con.)

								Great innovative game but: game progression is a matter of luck or bad luck in my case. Flooding, undetected enemies and I already got killed all my drones several times. My drones had no defense yet because I just had no time to harvest any skills and perks yet!! When commandeering a new ship by accident( clicked commandeer in stead of cancel) there was no way to apply ship upgrades ( a bug I guess) which made remote powering impossible. So I had to start all over again. (I just save my complete Dusker folder in My Documents regularly to a save folder and overwrite the My Dociuments folder)I played the 0.26 future update to which is a lot better balanced, but it does not let me save the game progression :-(			"

												This game is good, but certain elements could use polish. Still worth a buy if you've got a few bucks to spare, but my problems are as follows:The camera limits your view downwards when opening doors, so if you're unfortunate and can't peek from the side, or up - you're inherently disadvantaged.Swarms being a brutal enemy is fine, but their hitboxes regarding opening and closing doors is clunky and rather broken. Often times I've found myself trying to close a door with them clearly outside the doorway, only to have it claim to be ""blocked"" and having me get wiped out. When your timing is spot on, it's sad to watch everything crumble. It's a risky, skill based play, but they seem to interfere with doors regularly.Slimes are also a fine enemy, but I find that late game they're all I run into - and it ruins the overall feel of the game. The lack of a true endgame is a downer to me, but it's not a big deal to others - so I'd say it's subjective.			"

								This game is amazing! I am not just some fan boy, I seriously believe this game has potential. The Developer obiously cares about the game and various community suggestions. The idea is great, and is being expanded in a way that makes sense rather than trying to please everyone, but it makes sure to give freedom of choice, both in difficulty and in how you play it. The keyboard-only controls makes it a great game for laptops, and gives it an old-type feeling along with the graphics. The game makes you stay on your toes, but doesn't test your typing speed. Even the story telling is great!			"

								Such a fun game! One day i was watching Quill 18 streaming Duskers and I knew I had to buy this game. Awesome game that uses simple commands to control drones in order to explore derelict ships. Simple in concept, but super addiciting. The devs are awesome too and release massive updates on a weekly basis.			"

Early Access Review
								Here's how I like to pitch this game.Imagine you're a programmer stuck aboard a spacecraft in deep space, all alone.  All you have at your disposal is a small hord of futuristic roomba-like drones.  Your mission is to survive using these robots.  You have to bord derelic spacecrafts and raid them for loot. Some of these ships are dangerous, many of them have alien infestations.  You have to take a bunch of souped up roombas and turn them into space marines.   It's strange, it's funny (well... I find it funny) and it's wonderful.			"

												I want to bring up a point that perhaps no one else will. Duskers is yet another great addition to the indie landscape, but it has an invisible immersive side that it asks you to participate in that is a bit refreshing in the world of game-design. There's a lot of real, added gameplay depth on top of the hard-coded rules the game sets forth for you,But it provides an optional layer of immersion that it politely asks you to take part in, to sustain some of its gameplay.You can read my review and watch a video where I heavily edited my voice to sound like I was on board the ship in Duskers at: http://www.zero-friction.net/2016/05/24/duskers-asks-you-to-isolate-yourself-in-its-dead-universe/Turn off the lights, bump up the audio and get into it, like a good movie.

												[Revised 6/5/16]  Previously I reported this as not recommended but it was due to a bug which prevented saving the game. (Obviously bad news.) Game does allow for saving progress in between ""boardings"" which is all I wanted.Game is great. UI is very minimalist which is both evocative of the setting as well as easy to learn. Biggest difficulty I face is my own adrenaline and the impact it has on my abiltity to type the commands necessary to save my poor little drones!  Also, typos which open the wrong doors allowing swarms of evil baddies to kill off drones on the other side of the ship are bad. Losing key abilities because I failed to repair them before they finally failed completely: again, very bad.The ""plot"" in the background of figuring out why all this happened and where everyone went is a minor factor. Would be more interesting if the computers on the ships I visited could reveal more information through ""Interface"" ability, etc.  (Maybe they do later on in the game???)Definitely one of the most fun and immediately enjoyable games I've purchased lately.

												Enjoying the game so far. only issue i have with it is the enemies are extremely fast. and when your typing to move your drones around quickly its impossible. I dont really get why they give drones varying health values since once you get hit by one of the infected things they are dead anyway. Personally, i think it would be quite a bit cooler to have slower enemies. they also allow for that ""run, run, run!"" moment, since its currently, open door, and everything dies.			"

												The short of it: an innovative game with great puzzle-solving features, but with one major issue that brings it down a bit.The long of it: Duskers is a game right up my alley - a sci-fi horror environment where you're a lone human on a starship forced to loot derelict starships to survive in an universe that has seemingly gone dead... though not entirely, as the derelicts have ""occupants"" of sorts. The drones you use become your companions and your lifeline, and the game's rogue-like nature means that you never know what to expect, forcing you to problem-solve and change strategies on the fly. Honestly, I really enjoyed the core gameplay, even through the frustrating moments when luck conspires against you and your hard work comes crashing down. Even though the game uses a typing interface for most of the drones' commands, it's done pretty well and with plenty of helpful information. But there's a serious con, at least for me, and yes there's ***SPOILERS*** here.The game states that your objectives are to survive, uncover the mystery of humanity's downfall, and see if there are survivors out there. It actually LIES about the last two objectives. You have a bunch of text logs that get uncovered as you explore various ships in various ways, expousing theories on what happened. But I began to get suspicious about where things were going after ""solving"" one theory that went nowhere, so I went a-Interneting. Turns out, there's no true answers, no final confrontations, no hidden sanctuary. The game really is only a ""survive until you can't"" kind of game, and that is a MAJOR letdown to me. The best rogue-like games I've played, like FTL or The Binding of Issac, had end-games, conclusions. You felt like all your failures, all your frustrations, were heading to something. Here, there's just endless ruin. I intially played through the frustrations because I thought the game had something at the end to offer. If it had been advertised as just a survival game, if it hadn't pretended to be more than that, I might not be as disappointed. I stopped playing as soon as I found out the truth, and that definitely knocks that game down a few pegs. ***END SPOILERS***Verdict: I'm still recommending it despite my disappointment, because I did enjoy the hours I spent playing. The gameplay is novel and addicting, and pretty polished at this stage. But I will say that A) if you buy it, know that it's a game of endless survival and nothing else, and B) you might want to wait for a sale. "

												By happy accident I found this absolute gem of an indie and it's so damn enjoyable that I wanted to throw my first Steam Review up just to make certain this game receives some praise and attention.  It's tense, clever and drenched in the kind of sci-fi terror that makes you uncomfortably paranoid.  The keyboard only UI is very well done and I constantly feel like I should be playing it on a monocrome IBM XT just to further burn in the mood.  Just absolutely pitch perfect.			"

It oozes with atmosphere; the interface is novel, fun, and fits with the theme of the game perfectly; the graphics are spot on; there's a depth to the tactics and strategy that I've only begun to explore (and the game is really good about forcing you to explore it by cleverly restricting your ability to rely on one technique for too long). Just buy the game already, you won't be disappointed.			"

												One door leads to the fuel and scrap you so desperately need, the other is filled with nightmares. No motion sensor readings, no signs of life in either. You either get the supplies and leave happy, or you lose all your drones, and any hope of survival. You know that if a game can evoke the feelings of terror that a horror game should, simply through a few text commands and feedback, that it is truly something special. An amazing game that is equal parts exploration and survival horror. There are a few big bugs, but it just left early access, and is in version 0.01.			"

												What can I say about this game. Well for starters, this is a game where the entire thing looks like its from an old DOS operating system. The style of this game is what drew me to it, because I love retro style games, and this is one of the first that looks like its from an early dos computer, where there is no advanced graphical content (well not much graphical content at least). Your job is to sit in front of a computer, controlling drones with dos command prompt style commands to move the drones, use upgrades, interface with computers, etc, to find salvage, more drones, and most of all, fuel. The game is simple, you lose your drones, you lose. enemies come in a small variety, about 4 or 5 types, and you have to use door commands, motion detectors, stealth, and so on to try and either lure enemies to kill them, get them out of the way, or trow them out of an airlock (warning, you can get sucked out too, as well as any salvage, broken/disabled drones). I can say that this game will appeal to anyone who loves old dos command prompt controlled games, as well as anyone who loves games like FTL, who want something a bit harder and more simplistic at the same time.

												I have never been more terrified of a single game than I have in Duskers. While not a ""horror game"" itself, there is nothing more scary than watching all your hard work, decisions, slow methodical advancement go to hell because of one error in judgement or even, heaven forbid, you can't enter the commands fast enough because you screwed up and now you're trying to fix your mistake fast enough as you fat-finger all the keys...Luckily, the game has Rogue elements so the information you collect throughout your many playthroughs (and there will be many - fat-finger goofs or not) will contribute to telling the overall arching story (which seems like it's asymetyrical in it's advancement, but I can't be sure (Which would be an impressive feat if it was)) and actual objectives in the game as well. This is one of those games that makes the player the actual player, rather than the player playing a character (try saying that 3 times fast). The game doesn't beat you over the head with this and actually pulls it off quite well.  Story time: After one particular screw up (which I managed to save the majority of my drones) I had to wait for the ""flickering power sources"" in the ship to randomly flick on in the room I was in so I could activate a teleporter. No problem, I'll just wait a while. An hour later I realized that the derilict itself was powering down and I experienced all kinds of interesting things along the way like random asteroids that may or may not collide with rooms in X minutes. Loss of video feed from drones and overview. Random doors breaking open as things crawl around on the ship I was in... It was a nightmare, and by far one of the best accidential experiences I think I ever had on a game.All in all, I would tow this game to my ship again.			"

Each derelict is a challenge and sometimes nothing can come about because of it. That being said, the game so far is something I would describe as quite fun.			"

												Duskers is a unique little rogue-like game, where you type in simple commands to explore the world.It captures the spirit of the Alien movie franchise and can be as punishing if you don't thread carefully.I've sat many a night in frustration as my drones were destroyed one by one, because I made one mistake, and not fast enough on the keyboard to correct it (I am no coder, thats for sure). Lots of ragequits. But I came back to it. Because at the core the mechanics are solid and fun.The only thing left wanting are more varied and unique (map) locations and a ton more drone/ship upgrades and skills. But Duskers is very much a game for the gamer who likes tactics and command consoles... and I certainly didn't know I would like command console gaming.			"

												Have you ever wanted to feel like Ripley from the original Alien?  That atmospheric tenseness that consumes you, that feeling of uncertainity, that overpowering sense of dread?  You are a drone operator aboard a slavage ship.  Your drones are not outfitted for combat.  But you enter an abandoned ship knowing full well that there are threats inside.  You need the scrap, you have no choice.  You need the fuel to continue your crawl through an empty universe.  A threat could be in the next room, or the next or even that room you thought you cleared.  Your drones take damage, you carry on, your drone modules break, you make it work; you do the best that you can because you need to keep persevering.  Aside from the incredible atmosphere, Duskers is a thinking man's game.  You choose how to best collect scrap, fuel and explore the universe.  Every ship provides new challenges but also multiple methods of solving them.   There isn't a best method of playing this game.  One approach might work best for one enemy type and completely useless on another.  You have to keep adapting and weigh risk against reward.  This is the best $20 I've spent on a game in a VERY long time.			"

												This game is Alien Isolation meets Uplink/Hacknet meets FTL. If you like command line hacking games, buy it. If you like space roguelikes, buy it. If you like survival horror, buy it. The graphics are intentionally limited to provide immersion, you really feel like you're the last hope of humanity, and the breadcrumbs leading to the story are enough to keep even the people that hate walking simulators going.Only thing I've noticed: the commandeer command needs to be explained better. I found out about it from the Wiki. In the first starting area that is hand-crafted you should be in a puddle jumper with no J-drive and like 10 scrap capacity. You should have to commandeer one of those ships to keep going to forcably introduce the mechanic.			"

												Bought this game and loving it. Reminds me a lot of the original alien game for the Spectrum (and the 8-bit aliens follow-up) with the suspense element - you never know whats going to be in the next room or whether the doors are going to fail. Gives a real sense of panic.Love the retro commands - yes they're a bit clunky but effective, straightforward and totally what you'd expect as  1980's bladerunner-esque vision of the future.			"

NEW UPDATERead this paragraph before reading anything else. The rest of my review is from when I first bought the game at the 1.0 release. I am now reviewing it a week later, and some improvements/discoveries have occured. Firstly, they seem to have fixed the door glitches, second, there actually is a way to get the same easy start every time (under difficulty settings), and thirdly, you can make the enemy types reset when you restart, too. I still think there needs to be a more in depth tutorial, because you see different kinds of dangers in the normal gameplay which appear to be environmetnal but you can't be sure (green blobs, etc.) and the effects of depressurization and flooding with radiation, as well as countermeasures, need to be discussed in the tutorial.The First Few HoursWhen you first load up this game, you're bound to be excited about the concepts, being alone in the universe with a mysterious breakout happening... What's bound to happen? Well, you'll start your first ship salvage with zero infestations, a quick resource grab that gets you moving a bit on your feet. Then, you'll have to plot your moves more appropriately as every other ship is infested and your drones are vulnerable. As you explore each ship, you may uncover a log relating to what triggered the incident, which you can look back on later. It's a very unique situation, and the gameplay style is just as unique. For the first few hours, this game is pretty enjoyable.The BUTOnce you play past the first few hours, this game quickly becomes repetetive and painfully difficult to progress in. You'll probably be very likely to use the Reset option to start over. It doesn't restart a salvage though... It restarts the universe right after the event. You're back to square 1 with a different drone loadout. And that safety net of an infestation-free ship NEVER returrns. For every reset, your first ship is already infested, and a lot older. The levels are a lot harder, and it's really frustrating to try and progress because sooner or later, you'll be bound to make a single mistake that ends up costing you your entire drone fleet. And there's only 1 save file. Oh, and sometimes enemies can kill your drones through CLOSED doors.ConclusionWhile this game would make a great short-term arcade game, I feel ripped off having paid $20 for it. There's not really a chance at progressing very far if you ever reset (which I have) and the enemies are sometimes prone to glitching (at your expense). Short summary: if it's on sale for less than $5, it might be worth your money. As for what I paid, I wish I was still in my return window.			"

												I rarely recommend a game but this is an exception. Some people don't like this game because they say that its too hard or to random but in my opinin this is what makes this game so interesting. Through the randomization it never realy feels the same and you never know what awaits you at the next ship so you naturally want to explore. In my opinion this game really plays and feels like FTL (Faster Than Light))  and someone who likes FTL will definitely like this game too!			"

												Duskers is a game unlike anything i've played before. I am a huge fan of permadeath and procedurally generated levels and this is righ up my alley. The game is very tough, but every time I screw up (lose enough drones which makes me wish i was dead) I know that it was my fault, that if i would have been a bit more careful or a bit more clever, I would have succeeded. Having to type commands was a bit annoying at first, but after figuring out how ""alias"" works, it is much easier and I am able to easily execute a series of complex commands by just pressing a few keys. For the price tag, this game is a must buy if you like hard as nails games and having to think strategically.			"

												Even when you turn down all the difficulty options, its still very difficult and unforgiving, like FTL. But its also very unique. Don't let the comparisons to other roguelikes fool you, though. Its not simply ""more of the same"". Its very unique. I also love the visuals. From the images it looks 2D, and I admit the gameplay is just 2D but the visuals are actually 3D with an overhead view. As you move around the perspective changes slightly, and you can see its actually 3d models and enviornments. And here, noise and post-affects are used as part of the gameplay visuals. They aren't just cosmetic like in all other titles. As the game emulates you viewing your environment through a sort of radar system.As a programmer I'm not scared away by the command line. And in fact I enjoy it in this game. You can control the robots yourself. But having that option to line up commands for them, lets you do more than one thing at once. Which is a real boon in a game like this.I highly suggest the Duskers. But I have to admit, there is a good chance you won't get very far in each playthrough. So I stress buying it turn a sale. Half the retail price, won't have you cursing bricks when you keep dying. The retail price will.			"

												I'm seeing a lot of reviews that don't recommend this game, so I think for a good review of this game, it should start with a few caveats of WHO WOULD like this game (actual gameplay review is below the line of dashes, 4 hours on record at the moment):If you like Rogue-likes and the frustration, permanence, and perserverance attached, you could like this game.If you're the type that explores every single room, douses every fire, finds every secret room, and will circles dungeon crawler levels over and over again to give the best chance of survival, you could like this game.If you like micro-management of units and inventory equipment analysis and forethought, you could like this game.Lastly, if you have a niche enjoyment of using keyboard and command lines, you'll LOVE this game. (ex: navigate 1 r2;stealth;d14 would make your drone use stealth, go to room 2, and open door d14 simultaneously)----------------------------------------------------Gameplay:  7Graphics: 8Audio: 10Replayability: 10+Atmospherically terrifying, danger lurks everywhere and a single mistake can end your run entirelyUnlike any type of game I've ever played. Unique interface and gameplay, but familiar dungeon-crawling mechanismsHigh difficulty that demands precision and forethought. Something as simple as assuming there's just 1 enemy in a room or leaving a door open can end your game.The devs really understood what they wanted and designed this game with that in mind. You feel like you're alone in a hostile universe doing everything remotely to survive.-So far, I have very little to complain about.  The commands and controls are tedious, but your immersion in the game can completely forgives that.  This game could be considered a sci-fi post-apacolyptic simulator in that regard, but there are things that can get tiring, like retyping 'navigate' over and over and etc.Thus far, it seems that there is a very unfair fuel-to-scavenging ratio. At least for me, I have ended up perfectly completing 2-3 derelicts (like levels in a dungeon, exploring derelict ships) only to find out there wasn't enough fuel to scavenge and my run is now dead. I might be missing something, but I have scoured the menus and help/tips manual to no avail.  The only thing I could find was something about commandeering a ship, but I have yet to discover how. This could solve the problem though.So all in all, I would rate this game very highly.  I will certainly revisit this review after some more game time, but I am absolutely loving it.  Comparing this game to FTL is deserved but somewhat apples-to-oranges.  Duskers is more like clearing the aftermath of FTL, once that universe has died to some giant plague. I feel simultaneously alone, lost, and powerful controlling my drones and creating traps for enemies.I will come back to review this after more time, but so far, I am absolutely loving this game.  "

								A diamond amongst the rough. A nice little survival strategy game that is actually good.You play as a drone operator wandering a universe filled with derelict ships. Your mission is to travel this universe and find out what happened to humanity.-Pro's-*Great Graphics*Nice little story*For an early access its pretty damn good, all the items fit together nicely.*Actually takes some effort to keep all your stuff.*Doesn't spoon feed you the way other games do. If you lose something you lose it for good.-Con's-*Game is pretty barebones, but still great!*The degradation of your modules is way too high and really does need to be lowered/balanced.*Not a huge amount of ways to customise your drones at this point of development.*No mouse input (Doesn't really need it but makes it a little awkward to use).*Clunky UI*Would also like to see more modules, levels, aliens and overall more customisation for both drones and ship.*Side note actually: Really not worth the $20.00 at this point in time, id wait for a sale. Maybe in the future it'll be worth that kinds of investment.Overall I rate this game a 7/10 as it stands, I actually enjoy playing this for large amounts of time and never really get bored. Would like to see more stuff added which im sure is on the way. Can't wait to see where the game goes in the future!			"

Early Access Review
								Duskers is the next game from studio Misfits Attic and represents a huge departure from their lighthearted puzzle game a Virus Named Tom. This time around, a dark desolate future awaits you with your only allies are drones and a lone command console.(This review is taken from the Alpha of Duskers, which at this time is version .21.  Screenshots and impressions may not represent the current version of the game. You can buy Duskers on Early Access now and the developers are hoping for three to six months of updates and work before officially releasing it.)A Dirty Future:Duskers’ story takes place sometime in the far future, where you awaken as the sole survivor of a ship with only a few days of fuel left and no clue where you are or what happened to the rest of humanity. Your only option are derelict ships, stations and more with no signs of life for you to explore. Aiding you is a set of basic drones that come equipped with upgrade modules that let them perform specific tasks.Duskers' universe is entirely procedurally generated when you start a new game and you are given a random assortment of drones and upgrades. The universe is broken down into systems and then sectors that have places for you to explore. How it works is that in each sector, you have a limited number of proportion jets to move within the sector. When they run out, you need to enter warp via fuel cells in order to replenish them, fuel cells are found on ships and if you run out, you will be stranded.With a procedurally generated universe, a playthrough of Duskers can take vastly different turnsEach derelict is also procedurally generated and before you enter one, you'll be given an idea of what it is, how long it has been adrift and if there are any infestations or enemy types on board.All this is presented using a dirty tech aesthetic; where even though you're in the future, there are basic readout screens similar to the movie Alien. The game's commitment to this aesthetic is great and it really helps to set the mood; not only that, but you can play the entire game using a keyboard thanks to it.After selecting your target and equipping your drones, it's time to step foot into the unknown and where Duskers takes the dirty tech aesthetic even further.Command Prompt:The gameplay of Duskers is all about commanding your drones to explore and recover useful information and resources; however you're not going to be seeing the universe for what it is. Instead, the entire game is played through the viewpoint of your command console and all footage is fed to you via the drones' camera system. You can directly move a drone via the keyboard, but to do multiple orders and take charge, you need to use the command console.On the bottom right corner of the screen, you have a command prompt that lets you issue orders to the ship and the drones themselves. Opening and closing doors require you to type in the door code into the console and you can command multiple drones to move via ""navigate"" and the drone numbers. You can view the entire schematic of the ship via the spacebar; this allows you to see all room numbers and their respective door codes. Upgrades which are attached to your drones can be used by typing their name into the command prompt and there is a help guide for more information on what they do.Ship exploration hinges on your use of the command prompt and keeping an eye on the schematics to figure out what's going on The upgrades are very important as they are your sole means of interacting with the world. ""Generator"" and ""Gather"" are the two big ones at the start; the former allows you to turn on generators to power up sections of the ship and gather lets you pick up scrap and fuel.Things start out innocently enough, as you find upgrade modules that you can take back and even more drones to take into a ship, but then things change. You'll soon find that the universe is filled with hostiles of a variety of types, and they are out to destroy your drones and your only means of survival.Duskers shows a lot of promise as an up and coming rogue-like, even at this very early stage of Alpha. I'm curious to see if or how the game's mechanics will be expanded upon and what things will be added to give the game a greater plot.(For more reviews, videos, and podcasts on a variety of games, check out Game-Wisdom[Game-wisdom.com] "

								Duskers is a rogue-like, real-time strategy game based around a survival aspect where the player is expected to scavenge, build, upgrade, and maintain his or her team of drones whilst exploring the deep and recently emptied recesses of space. Dangers are plentiful, and often times lurking within your blindspots, waiting for you to make a mistake or become just a little too comfortable with your surroundings. Only by piecing together fragmented and corrupted logs from derelict ships can one find out what exactly happened and why you seem to be the sole survivor of an undefined disaster.Is the game fun? At its core, yes. It successfully assumes the role of a rogue-like by making each playthrough somewhat different than the last with randomized loot and map, but not all the ships are randomly generated. If you're a fan of rogue-likes and find the notion of a slowly developing story to be a good reward for your efforts, this game is exactly that, and development for it is still on-going which is promising.However, I strongly urge people who're unsure about the game to look up Youtube Let's Plays before purchasing it. It is extremely unforgiving, and sometimes even outright cruel with random, unjustified punishment - and for C$ 20, this is a big factor to keep in mind.			"

Keep in mind that the pacing of duskers is rather slow. You can play for hours and still feel like there's so much more to do with little to show for your progress. Each derelict is a challenge and sometimes nothing can come about because of it. That being said, the game so far is something I would describe as quite fun.			"

												Sci-fi Survival in-Space game, for true lovers of space simulations and survival tense genre games.You play as lone survivor struggling each day to find resources to sustain your ship and drones. A very simple concept combined with this unique lonely dark survival space atmosphere, tense, and immersive while you travel along the deep space searching for derelicts, life and answers.The unique and special touch of Duskers is the way you live and play this theme. You control drones through abandoned ships and derelicts scavenging what you can to survive. And you control them through line-command OS, hacking systems, tasking commands and piloting them the way you want.The chalenge is great, your decisions need to be perfect and fast... or you will not survive. The dangers in space are huge! From Ships with thousands of years that can collapse in any second, sucking your drones through the space if the wrong airlock is opened. Or something run off your precious drones in the dark firing all moving sensors toward your shutle. Immersive, panic environment, that remember old Alien themes, with simple graphics, this unique game can give you a couple hours of entertainment.Because the unique style behind this genre, i recommend that you see some footage from the gameplay before you buy, Duskers, i hope this game can evolve to a bigger game and explore this thrilling environment exploring this concept with huge potential!Perhaps one day.. we can see a bigger universe to explore, more advanced sensors in the drones, more complex commands and tasks, and a good narrative behind the scenes.Enjoy "

Short summary: if it's on sale for less than $5, it might be worth your money. As for what I paid, I wish I was still in my return window.			"

												This game is Alien Isolation meets Uplink/Hacknet meets FTL. If you like command line hacking games, buy it. If you like space roguelikes, buy it. If you like survival horror, buy it. The graphics are intentionally limited to provide immersion, you really feel like you're the last hope of humanity, and the breadcrumbs leading to the story are enough to keep even the people that hate walking simulators going.Only thing I've noticed: the commandeer command needs to be explained better. I found out about it from the Wiki. In the first starting area that is hand-crafted you should be in a puddle jumper with no J-drive and like 10 scrap capacity. You should have to commandeer one of those ships to keep going to forcably introduce the mechanic.			"

												Initially i was a bit reluctant on buying this game, but after watching some YouTube videos I bought it and I'm really enjoying it.The command line to give commands is simple but really makes the difference.It's not terrifying but some times an alien appears from where you simply don't expect and this keeps the terror atmosphere.In short the game is simple, but the idea is amazing and most importantly it makes me happy.In short: buy yours, you won't regret.

												Enjoying the game so far. only issue i have with it is the enemies are extremely fast. and when your typing to move your drones around quickly its impossible. I dont really get why they give drones varying health values since once you get hit by one of the infected things they are dead anyway. Personally, i think it would be quite a bit cooler to have slower enemies. they also allow for that ""run, run, run!"" moment, since its currently, open door, and everything dies.			"

												Sci-fi Survival in-Space game, for true lovers of space simulations and survival tense genre games.You play as lone survivor struggling each day to find resources to sustain your ship and drones. A very simple concept combined with this unique lonely dark survival space atmosphere, tense, and immersive while you travel along the deep space searching for derelicts, life and answers.The unique and special touch of Duskers is the way you live and play this theme. You control drones through abandoned ships and derelicts scavenging what you can to survive. And you control them through line-command OS, hacking systems, tasking commands and piloting them the way you want.The chalenge is great, your decisions need to be perfect and fast... or you will not survive. The dangers in space are huge! From Ships with thousands of years that can collapse in any second, sucking your drones through the space if the wrong airlock is opened. Or something run off your precious drones in the dark firing all moving sensors toward your shutle. Immersive, panic environment, that remember old Alien themes, with simple graphics, this unique game can give you a couple hours of entertainment.Because the unique style behind this genre, i recommend that you see some footage from the gameplay before you buy, Duskers, i hope this game can evolve to a bigger game and explore this thrilling environment exploring this concept with huge potential!Perhaps one day.. we can see a bigger universe to explore, more advanced sensors in the drones, more complex commands and tasks, and a good narrative behind the scenes.Enjoy "

												Great concept, love the look and ""retro"" UI. You are a salvage ship operator, looting derelict ships using drones and a keyboard-only, command-line interface to control them. You can give them orders to follow or pilot any one drone directly via a top-down view with limited visibility. All commands can be issued from either view during a salvage operation. The general idea is to see how long you can survive.There is plenty to do in this is game, but it is relentlessly unforgiving. Expect to get hammered by the RNG a [i[lot[/i] -- sometimes you just plain have bad luck. Making progress is slow and ""grindy"", even with difficulty options (nice touch!) tweaked toward ""easy"".  The cost of upgrades, repairs, and/or equipment is high. Often, when you do seem to be making decent progress, a random hazard (of which there are many types) just crushes you so far back into the weeds you might as well have been killed (yes, it's permadeath if you do).Each derelict can only be visted once. Since each derelict is procedurally generated, its difficulty can vary widely. The game does give you some information (size of the ship, number of different types of enemies, etc.) that helps in general to gauge its difficulty, but sometimes it's best to just grab what you can and run, as the game wisely advises you.It's also possible to get stuck while salvaging a ship, not dead but unable to do anything.  In such situations, you can quit and restart at the point before you stared exploring the current ship, but you cannot explore that same ship again.This game has a ""puzzle"" aspect to it as well. It requires a lot of thought and careful planning, and the ability to react quickly and decisively when things go pear-shaped. The game does let you pause to think, but you can't see anything useful while paused. I expect to be playing this quite a bit. There's a lot to do in the game and it's clearly going to take a while to discover all of it.			"

												[Revised 6/5/16]  Previously I reported this as not recommended but it was due to a bug which prevented saving the game. (Obviously bad news.) Game does allow for saving progress in between ""boardings"" which is all I wanted.Game is great. UI is very minimalist which is both evocative of the setting as well as easy to learn. Biggest difficulty I face is my own adrenaline and the impact it has on my abiltity to type the commands necessary to save my poor little drones!  Also, typos which open the wrong doors allowing swarms of evil baddies to kill off drones on the other side of the ship are bad. Losing key abilities because I failed to repair them before they finally failed completely: again, very bad.The ""plot"" in the background of figuring out why all this happened and where everyone went is a minor factor. Would be more interesting if the computers on the ships I visited could reveal more information through ""Interface"" ability, etc.  (Maybe they do later on in the game???)Definitely one of the most fun and immediately enjoyable games I've purchased lately. Two enthusiastic thumbs up.			"

												Duskers has an astonishingly eerie atmosphere and engaging gameplay, full of uncertainty and apprehension. You never know what exactly might happen and if you will make it out alive, but you can be almost certain that SOMETHING WILL go wrong. And you WILL have to improvise. Quickly.Duskers is also designed so that if you're lucky in a mission, you never actually SEE the monsters (but you KNOW they are there) which makes the game 10 times as scary. The way Duskers does this so remarkably well is why it is one of the most thrilling games I've played in a long time.			"

												Well ... honestly well worth the money. Reminds me a lot of FTL while not copying FTL and really inventing something new. So ... what's like in FTL1) Rogue-like2) Constantly low on supplies and jumping from system to system, hoping you'll have enough fuel3) Use your mind to deal with enemies which are not trivial.4) Micromanaging your ""crew""What's different?1) Dark atmosphere2) You command a group of drones mostly from a terminal interface (thank God for aliases!)3) Story is quite rich compared to FTL. Of course depends on how long you can survive ... but it's interesting getting bits and pieces of information that help you puzzle what the hell is going on.4) If in FTL you could say you were a taking a role of a ""captain Kirk"", in this game you're more of a hacker ... an engineer, armed with only your wits to survive the wastes of space... kind of like Scotty. Or Scotty with knowledge and skills of Edward Snowden :DIf you enjoyed FTL and want to see FTL from a bit different perspective, give it a shot. It's worth it!Also the game runs on Linux, which is really big plus for me.			"

												Back in the day, I loved playing Alien Breed on the Amiga. Duskers takes me right back to that late night high-pulse terror. It's the loneliness. The emptiness. The not knowing what hides behind next closed door. With minimalistic, simple means, Duskers builds such a suggestive atmosphere. It's a rich and scary universe viewed through grainy video feeds - until it all blacks out and your drone has been destroyed by something unnameable. Great stuff.			"

												I'm a fan of rougelikes. This is a roguelike, horror, sci-fi, quasi-hacking style game that involves controlling a couple of bots salvaging some derelict spaceships.Unlike other roguelikes however (except maybe Telegltich) this game requires quick reactions alongside well thought out strategies in order to survive. When a creature starts attacking a bot you have seconds to decide what to do, so if you didn't think it through already you better be able to type fast or your bot is dead.Get the scrap or run away - get the resources but risk dying in the process. So yea, if you like roguelikes and the interesting style of roguelike this game is, get it.			"

												Great strategy game, that has a great 1970/80's Sci-fi feel. The text based commands are easy to learn and add to the urgency if something happens when your typing furiously to save your drones. The schematic and drone view are both good, the drone view is very reminiscent of Alien and Aliens, due to the similarities ebtween the targeting system of the auto turrents and the  smart gun and adds to the asthetic. The story so far is a little obscure but that could be down to my small playing time however it does feel from reading the data records that you collect something is unfolding however ive yet to see to much of it.Overall its a great game for fans of strategy especially if your looking for something a bit different and its definitely worth taking a punt (go) at.

												I was never a fan of the retro-fad that seems to be so trendy in the game industry today (and, frankly, sometimes it seems to be just thrown in as a facade to cover the lack of effort / resources), probably because I'm gaming since 1991 and I'm quite fed up with the style: It was not retro, it was what computers could muster. I'm pretty sure that if NVIDIA was around by then no one would have really liked to build everything like it was made out by 2D Legos. I'm not a fan of puzzle or strategic games either...but Duskers was able to make me love things I don't usually like! You're a pilot, stranded with just a little bit of fuel remaining in a galaxy of shipwrecks, your only chance for survival and for understanding what the hell happened is to board said wrecks and use your remote drones to explore them. You control your drones and the movement of your ship on the starmap with a simple keyboard only GUI and the simplicity of the graphics here is really immersive: it feels like you're in one of those sci-fi universes where for some reason technology evolved staying true to the 1980s aesthethics. It feels like the voice-activated computer that Deckard uses to analyze pictures in Blade Runner, or one of the terminals from Alien. The only video feed you have is a simple top down visual of your drones exploring the boarded shipwreck and the only audio you have is the crackling of the statics and the simple audio feeds that your drones make announcing their movements and actions. All the thrill of the game is in clever exploration: every shipwreck you board is unknown terrain, every room potentially filled with aggressive...things you will never be able to name. You know you need that damned fuel and all the scraps you can gather to keep your ship and your drones up and running, but you have to keep your drones safe. The nicest thing about it is that you can be as creative as you like: maybe one of your drones can set mines and you can use it to neutralize menaces by luring them in ""armed"" rooms or maybe one of the drones can access terminals and command the defenses of the boarded ship. Inside the lonely hulls out there you can also find some downed drones to add to your small remote army and acquire new abilities to face the next jump in the galaxy. Towards survival. Towards the unknown. You are alone, in the whole vastness of the cosmos and the drones are your only friends, they are your eyes and hands and what separate you from a lonely, awful death...P.S.: Once I screwed during exploration and I blissfully hit the ""Reset"" option thinking that it would have restarted the scenario...boy I was wrong! It resets the WHOLE GAME! Be advised!			"

												This game is tough, I mean seriously tough. One mistake and it's all over, it makes FTL look like child's play.The start of the game can be a bit RNGish, you need a bit of luck just to get a toe-hold in the game but if you can survive the first few ships you should have the ingredients to continue a long way - or until you make that next small mistake.The look and feel of the game is great, hugely tense and claustrophobic. Much is made of the command line interface but you soon get used to this and it just feels the ""right way"" to be playing a game like this.I'm very much enjoying this game.			"

One of the most innovative games in the past decade.The roguelike randomness gets on my nerves a little, but that's the genre for ya. As a person without a lot of time, my tolerance for trial and error is rather limited. Thankfully, there are a lot of difficulty controls that really help counter-balance all of that, though, so it's a relatively minor gripe.			"

												Bought the game and really enjoyed it. Sadly I was forced to ask for a refund as I play on macbook air, and the rainbow glitch basically made the game unplayable.Would repurchase in the future if this issue is addressed -but it seems like, based off of what I've found, that that may never happen. Bummer. I suppose that's what I get for using a mac haha			"

												Duskers has an astonishingly eerie atmosphere and engaging gameplay, full of uncertainty and apprehension. You never know what exactly might happen and if you will make it out alive, but you can be almost certain that SOMETHING WILL go wrong. And you WILL have to improvise. Quickly.Duskers is also designed so that if you're lucky in a mission, you never actually SEE the monsters (but you KNOW they are there) which makes the game 10 times as scary. The way Duskers does this so remarkably well is why it is one of the most thrilling games I've played in a long time.			"

												Imagine that all those ships you blew up in FTL were salvaged by a drone scrapping crew.I play this at night with headphones where I can pretend the stakes are much higher. Highly recommend. "

												Great game. The feel of the game is unlike anything else I've played. The retro sci fi looks really resonate with me. It's like being in a really good alien game.			"

												Really great asthetic, encountered an annoying bug with one of the abilities pretty consistently but the game is still really good, with quite a unique way of telling a story (not that the story is the focus of this game, mind)			"

												If you own a Mac DO NOT WASTE your money on this game. Until the developers or Apple solve the video issue it's just crappy.  Especially when your in a larger ship which takes mor time to exploit and your display takes a big dump.  If your on a windows machine it workd fine and plays well.			"

												I loved this game, but the outrageous wear and tear on components when you use them takes all the fun out of it.  It punishes you when using the tools at your disposal, making only a few of the components really viable.			"
