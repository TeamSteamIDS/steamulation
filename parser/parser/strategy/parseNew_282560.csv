Early Access Review
								Here we go;Bad SimulationBad FramerateBad GraphicsBad Communication from the DeveloperPoor future planPoor bug fixesPoor codingPoor attempt at pleasing everyonePoor attempt at keeping what an RCT game even isPoor Game life it's had due to having 3 seperate developers.Overall i wouldnt recommend this to anyone. If this changes in the future than fair enough but as it stands now its is not a full product. Releasing this product as a full game is ridiculous and i wouldnt be surprised if Trading Standards in the UK fined the publisher and/or Steam removes it from its services. The game did not live up to anything originally promised along with the fact that it has had basically no optimization done too it throughout the entire time of it being in Alpha. Not only that but releasing this a day before its competitors when its no where near feeling like a full game just goes to show how much of a waste, scam and poor attempt at trying to make your own market with an already estabilshed franchise went for this publisher/developer.

Early Access Review
								Honest review incoming if you want seriousness.I really wanted to give it a thumbs up...The game is enjoyable, not great... but enjoyable. Unfortunately, yes there a ton of issues which are making it feel hardly worth 20$ even. They give you a warning that says it's early access and to expect some issues, but there's more than ""some"" if you will. I'll break down some basic pros and cons (I have not played RCT3, my last was RCT2 if that helps judge any of you guys looking to possibly jump back into this franchise.)Pros:- You still get to make a theme park and make rollercoasters.- Menus seem pretty clean and pretty easily navigated.- Some of the customizable options for paths and such are cool.- Probably couldn't be stated enough, the spline with coasters has so much potential and upside if it works, but still seems a bit too frustrating at the moment.- UGC could make this insanely awesome once implemented.Cons: (Yes, there's quite a lot, but it's just things I honestly think they could improve on and make this game much much better.)- Lag... This is arguably one of the most frustrating issues noted. Switching around in the menus seems to just not sit right at all with the game. There's so many points in the game that lag becomes an issue that as much as I'm trying to ACTUALLY play the game with a positive outlook, I physically can't...- Very minimal customization options. (Mostly scenery things, but a few others)- Path creation is quite annoying, putting a stand or booth down or whatever non-ride hut you put down.. if it doesn't form a line you should have the option to automatically have it connect to the path at the easiest and shortest route. Creating a super small path 1 inch away from the building and not being able to connect it gets very frustrating. (I'm sure they already know this.)- Coaster creation again. I can't even make a basic loop on a coaster anymore. Some of the prebuilt pieces offer some neat designs/ideas but they ultimately feel kind of lame. I figured they'd have an option to add a ""loop"" and then you can choose the metrics on it.. but you have to do some funky spline work that right when you think it looks good and you budge just a hair, the whole piece you just spent messing with is all messed up. Adding a straight track with spline feels ridiculously hard when it shouldn't be.. They need to have some snap options or something to help the building process of coasters. Simplicity honestly goes so far if it works (which I know it has in previous games). Honestly, I could explain so much more.. but I'm just assuming they're working on trying to fix the relatively poor custom coaster design process. Such a good concept so poorly executed. :(- Pre-made coasters feel half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that's being generous..... Not even going to get into that.- Not sure the bigger park staff huts works any better. (I could just be confused one how it works..?) I had a small mechanic hut near some rides with 1 employee, switched it to 3 and it felt HARDLY any better to fixing the rides. I finally get to the bigger mechanic building, employee 10, and I literally feel like it's producing 0 work. It'll have like 1 ride repaired when 5+ are broken down right next to it. Not sure again if I'm dumb or if that's just not working. Eventually rides get fixed, but it takes much longer than I think it's supposed to be.- Campaign has some very bad issues. If you want someone who hasn't played your game before to really get into it, you have to give some better direction and descriptions. ie... you don't get all coaster style options right away, you should be able to highlight over the items you don't have and it tells you how to obtain them. One of the biggest issues, though, is the freezing/""GG games over"" pretty much after you get so far. My buddy and I both bought 2 expansions of land to our parks and that seems to be the sweet spot that you have permanent game issues. His saved game in campaign no longer loads, and mine takes about 3-4 minutes to load my park and then another 2-3 to become functional as the screen is froze trying to load it. (I have a very good computer and internet connection, as does he). Once I finally get in, it's just consant issues, to the point I can't play the game.- Deleting is a nightmare. If you ever get that feeling in your stomach trying to do something super simple but it's beyond frustrating... prepare to get that feeling.. a lot. You give the delete a bulldozer emblem... make it a bulldozer, let us just cruise over those trees and bushes with ease... Obviously we want confirmations on deleting our rides and such.. but don't make it take 40 minutes trying to clear some land.- I actually tried the music for some of the rides. C'mon...TL:DR review, should you buy?I want to say yes.. buy, but I don't feel comfortable doing that. The game has SO much potential.. it's 2016, right? It has a lot of issues, and if they're open to ACTUALLY reading reviews, I think they can knock this game out of the park.Unfortunately, everyone knows a game is defined by it's launch (sad but true). And this one failed pretty hard. It's labeled early access, but I've played much less developed games in early access that ran better.BUT!!!! Don't give up on this game. Give them some time, enjoy older RCT games. Companies typically respond pretty well to issues, we'll assume they'll do the same. I'll continue to attempt to play the game and keep up with some updates, but for anyone looking to invest... wishlist it and let the game get to at least a playable state. "

Early Access Review
								Rollercoaster Tycoon is an important game for me. It is that game what I install everytime something bad happened, when I'm ill or when I want to destress. Install RCT 1, 2 or 3 and you have a smile on your face in a minute I can guarantee you.The game has it's own character. The colors, the happy peeps, balloons and the cartoony artstyle without being a casual game at all is proven a strong a concept and I think after many years this game is still a lot's of gamers favorite. It was RCT that I saw on friends PC's screens, even on them who never play any other video game.RCT World fails in every aspect to reproduce the freedom and creativity and addictive feeling of the older RCT games.Even when the game did not suffered from technical bugs, 3D glitches, broken sound/music, bad optimization and way too less content it was a bad game. It's missing spirit, comedy, freedom and everything what makes the RCT series great.The peeps are boring to look at. They don't have any style themself. It seems the dev team could not choose between realistic and cartoony and choose to design a mix of photorealistic characters with cartoony movement models. Everything moves too fast even on slow setting on a slow engine. I did met the sys req. for the game (the minimum) but whatever graphic setting I use after I place my first rollercoaster the game can't deliver anymore.Object placement and path placement is ridiculous. The terrain tools very user unfriendly. You can't place path where you want, even if it seems to fit perfectly the engine don't allow you to place anything on random places. Tools you have like a grid and a snap grid makes this even more worse.You can only place objects directly to the ground. You cannot place anything on top of something else. You can't even place banks, lights, carbage bins anymore on paths when the path is higher then the ground level. You can not build anything anymore in the game itself. (It's advertised that you can build anything in any other 3D tool and import it).There is almost non to zero customization. You can't choose the main building, the entrance building, thematic entrances, place of entrances etc etc. It's all setup for you so the only thing you can do is build a prefab item. No creative building anymore.You can't assign staff, can't train staff, can't change the colors of them. It's all setup. Same for food stalls, ticket stalls, peeps etc etc.The management tools are not complete. The menu to read info about your parc is very hard to read. It's just a plain spreadsheet directly imported from the engine to the game. No nice menu's, no humor, no cartoony style and just a plain and simple click and place building game with a tycoon parc theme around it.Last but not least the amount of content you get at the moment is 1/30 part of the original RCT games. You have 6 rollercoasters to choose from, 4 different terrain types (instead of 18 in RCT 3), a few thrill and a few junior and family rides. All rides are fixed and you cannot change anything yourself. But even if you could the amount of content provided by the game itself is so minimum. You can choose between some rocks and some trees and a handfull of decoration pieces. Theme parc building should be something that makes you happy and should be happened smooth and relax. This game is slow, frustrating, ugly and simply misses anything that could make a game like this fun.			"

								Buy Planet Coaster instead. This game is a buggy, laggy cash grab defacing the Roller Coaster Tycoon name. Planet coaster is developed by Frontier, the original developers of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 and they are doing an excellent job. If you don't believe me there are plenty of lets plays and player made videos of the betas that look far and away better than this game ever will.			"

Early Access Review
								Most of the positive reviews of this game are getting down voted out of existence, so I am going to try and be as fair as possible.  Most of the negativity surrounding this game is based on how overwhelmingly buggy it is right now.  That is 100% true.  But it’s still an awesome game.        I can already feel all those negative fingers twitching over their keyboards waiting to drown me in hateful comments, but let me explain my reasoning first.  I agree: THE BUGS ARE EVERYWHERE.  Early access may even be a little misleading in this one.  When I hear early access, the first thing that comes to my mind is one of those new indie games that’s totally functional, but needs a lot more content.  This is not that.  This is early early access… This game is Super ****ing Mega early access.  We are basically alpha testing this bad boy.  If you are not willing to occasionally fight through bugs or lose a coaster once or twice, don’t buy this game.  The fact that they are still charging full price for something so incomplete is my biggest issue with the game right now.  Almost every aspect of this game has at least one significant issue that needs to be worked out.        However, I ended up giving this a thumbs up because all of the problems are seem to be superficial.  When they are fixed, I am 100% sure this game will be fantastic.  All the bugs, such as, the faulty AI, the wonky EID ratings (excitement/intensity/nausea), the path placing issues, etc. that everybody is complaining about are all very fixable.  I have played many games (early access or otherwise) that were just inherently bad.  Bad concept, bad controls,  un-navigateable menus, bad whatever…  But keep in mind, this game is Super ****ing Mega early access, and the core of the game, the most important part, is rock solid.       And what is the core?  To me, the most important part of any theme park simulator is the coaster editor itself.  I have seen many negative reviews claiming that this one is over complicated and hard to use.  I struggle to even wrap my head around these claims.  When I first started playing this, before reading a single review, my first thought was, “Man, this coaster editor is ****ing amazing! It’s so easy to use!”  I hate to step on people’s toes, so I’ll stomp them instead.  If you put any actual effort into figuring out how to use to use the editor instead of giving up after 5 minutes, anyone in their right mind would be forced to agree that this is by far the most elegant and free form coaster editor yet.  There are practically no limits to what you can do.  Besides, even if the node editor somehow isn’t for you, the prefab piece editor is still present and works just fine.  Although I encourage you to take all other complaints and reviews you read seriously, it is important to me that everyone laugh in the face of any person that says the coaster editor is hard to use ;).  Kidding…  By the way.  But, seriously the coaster editor is awesome.	Since the other reviewers have so completely covered the specifics of the many bugs, I don’t feel compelled to cover them in my review.  In any case, I am confident that given time, they will all be fixed.CONCLUSION	This game is not even close to being done and full price is fairly unreasonable.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  Give it more time, it’ll get there.  But if you’re like me and you get a kick out of seeing a game in its early stages and watch it fill in, give it a go.  If you want to give a game a negative review because its buggy while in early access, maybe don’t buy early access games in the future…  You clearly don’t appreciate the development process.  (people complaining about the bugginess to price ratio excluded)			"

Early Access Review
								This game is awful - strike it off your wishlist. Dev's say it's ""over 50% complete"", but IMO that statement is crap and they know it. Atari's community management staff also need a lesson in etiquette and accepting popular opinion (more on that below).To start with the game briefly, it's not even close to 10% of what RCT3 already gives us. Yeah, I can hear the fanboys screaming ""oh, but geek - it's early access"" - and it is - but nothing has improved since that original alpha. I stream this for just 2 hours’ yesterday, and despite the graphics and textures looking like something from 1995 (even on highest settings), FPS barely struggled to nudge far past 50 on a system with an i7-4790K and SLI GTX 970's. Peeps were also blurry up close, or moonwalked/stutter across the map if you zoom out to far. Foliage and other assets were pixelated (trees actually look like Minecraft) up close, and often just disappeared randomly for no reason. Staff also don’t work and scale of buildings is way off. A drinks stall is larger than the carousel for example. Don’t even get me started on the apparently fixed coaster builder. There's no banked corner pieces of track in any rides for a start, and motion paths look very rigid for the coasters. It doesn’t look natural. Then there's Atari's community management. Want to make a thread saying the game is not great? It gets deleted. Make the thread again, you get perm-banned from their site. Mention Planet Coaster on their Twitch and YouTube streams/channel, get purged buddy. Go look at the forums on their official site - it's all full of praise and users defending the title. If they perhaps put as much effort as they do in moderation into the game itself, it wold probably be a lot better.Save your money, buy Planet Coaster or just hold off on this until it's finished (if that ever happens). There's a very, very long way to go and they have no money. How do you think this game will turn out? I have a rough idea...			"

												Don't get this game. This game is NOT made by the original creators of the RCT franchise. It's made by some no-name dev studio that's still trying to figure out the RCT vibe.UI is trash, its full of bugs, it doesn't offer much customizability outside of the realm of the old game (RCT3) released in 2004, it runs like a pile of crap (you need a monster machine to get any kind of useable framerate. I'm on a gtx 1060/i5 4670k and I can't push 30 @ Medium settings).One of the major downfalls of the game is that it relies too much on the Steam Workshop and User-Generated Content (UGC) to support the game. If the devs would actually bother working on some of the rides in the game, they might have a game worth $30. But at the $50 pricepoint that they're asking for, you'd be better off flushing the money down your toilet. At least you'd get a little entertainment out of watching it swirl down the toiletbowl.The game is absolutely not worth the money you'll end up paying for it. If you want a *real* RCT-style experience, go with PlanetCoaster. It's cheaper, and infinitely better. AND it's made by the same guys that made the other RCT games! Why are you still here reading this?! Go buy PlanetCoaster!TL;DR: Don't buy this game. It's trash compared to PlanetCoaster.EDIT: The price has been reduced from $50 to $35 since the initial creation of this review. It is *still not worth it*, go pay the extra $10 and get a good game that's actually worth your money!			"

Since its early access release, the game has improved a lot. However this is not enough yet and I still cannot recommend this game in its current state. You will be better of playing RCT3 or Planet Coaster.  Yes, the game is finally playable and you can indeed have some fun in simply slamming rides down and charging people. However, the more you play the more annoyances pop up. Luckily for you, I made a list:Lets start with the positive:+ Huge improvements made since the first early access build+ I like the floating smileys above the visitors heads that tell you if they need something, shows what is needed very clearly.+ Quick and responsive UI and placement of paths and path scenery (These were my biggest annoyances last time.)+ Good framerate, maxed out on a GTX 1080 always 100 fps or higher.+ The physical water simulation is nice.The unsure points:~ Graphics have improved a lot, but compared to Planet Coaster they aren't great either.~ The guests have transformed from zombies to real people, but still aren't anywhere near the level of Planet Coaster.~ Famous people visit your park with twitter like #responses~ Rides and scenery can be unlocked by spending tycoon points. These points are earned by completing special and usually easy challenges. However if you just complete your challenges there is nothing to unlock very quickly since you simply earn too much points. This makes it a useless feature.The bad:- Famous people dab if you please them......... something that will only be funny for a month or so...- Mission objectives don't check the state of the park if you place an objective item before the missions opens. So you build a mechanic stall and afterwards a mission tells you to build a mechanic stall. Then you have to build a new one since it doesn't recognize the first.- Physical water moves way too fast- Camera height is based on terrain height, so if you have a steep valley and your camera middlepoint moves through the valley, the camera will lower significantly even though you were just scrolling through the map.- Many problems with terrain covering paths- You cannot delete scenery when building, you have to use the delete tool which is annoying.- Why can paths be curved, but queue's not???- No freedom in ride entrance/exit.The very bad:-- Many simulation problems, namely:---- A notification tells me: ""Congrats, Twister 1 is very popular"", so I check the ride which tells me: ""Total customers: 1""....---- Mission: ""achieve park beauty level 100"" -> place 7 very misplaced flower beds and mission accomplished..---- Max people in the park seems to be limited to your 'fame level' which rises when you please a famous person. Too bad they only visit like once a year. So if you have a great park but don't have any guests you simply have to wait and lose money until a famous person turns up allowing you to have more guests in your park at once.---- Closes coaster that was open, cannot reopen coaster since I do not have the money to purchase the coaster?!?---- Famous person comes with 'family' says the message. In the end she comes alone and doesn't even want to pay 2 euros for a ride and rages... Time to fast forward to the next famous person to come in...-- Cannot combine scenery, only special piece by piece stuff can be combined. For example, topiaries cannot be used to make a large flower bed.-- The music, the game only has one song in 6 variations which are not that great either.....-- Zoomed out guests seem to move with 1fps while the game runs at 140 fps...-- Had many crashes and freezes of the game or/and my pc with this game. Could be related to my overclocks but I don't have any problems with other games.Original review 31-3-2016:Please people, do not buy this game in its current state! The first release was a buggy beta, okay, no problem just fix the annoyances it before going public. Then they extended the releasedate with 3 months. Great! I hope the game will benefit.  But nope, almost all of the complaints made with the pretty unplayable beta 5 months ago still remain in the game. And if a developer does not fix the main problems in the game within 5 months I lose my trust in this game becoming anything great. I tried to like it,  I really tried, but its clunky controls and camera ruined it all, just like in the beta.I had such high hopes, especially with the extended release date and the great competition that is Planet Coaster and Parkitect. I hoped that they would learn from those games and see how it should have been done. But no, the controls are still clunky, the game still sound terrible and  the worst is that most anoyances like fence placement still hasn't been fixed. It's not that they didn't do anything these months, they implemented the peeps, more rides, a piece by piece coaster builder, a strange campaign and graphics options. But no fixing the main problems...So in short, if you want to play a new game like Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, buy Planet Coaster which is in early alpha right now on their website and if you want to play a game like RCT1/RCT2 buy Parkitect which is also in early alpha and should arrive at steam in a few months. But please don't be as stupid as me, please don't buy this game in its current state. I really hope they can turn the sinking ship around and still make a great game of it after Early access.			"

Early Access Review
								While Planet coaster is vastly superior in terms of graphics, object placement, freeform coaster building, ride and peep animations, terrain, bugs/crashes, and a charming atmosphere even at its alpha stage, we still have to wait until the end of the year for a game with any sense of challenge or park management. In the meantime we have to hope that RCTW improves to satisfy our park management cravings while we wait.These pros and cons are against other major FINISHED park management games like RCT 1, 2 and 3.PROS (THINGS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THEY WERE 12 YEARS AGO):-There are curved paths.-You can build a truly freeform coaster if you have the patience of a saint.-The water dynamics are so impressive that I assume that they were already part of the Unity Engine and not the RCTW developers.-There is a car park at the entrance. I like thisCONS (THINGS THAT ARE WORSE THAN THEY WERE 12 YEARS AGO):  GRAPHICS AND UI-If there were no curved paths in this game, it would almost be GRAPHICALLY IDENTICAL to RCT3 (2004!)- I get memory leaks where the game eats up to 26GB of my RAM. I am guessing not all players have 32GB ram to deal with this issue! -The interface looks VERY bland. I am not asking for candy crush but I’ve seen accounting software that looks more exciting than this.PERFORMANCE ISSUES -My FPS is actually fine for the first 1000 peeps on max graphics. As soon as I get over 1500 peeps (easily achievable with 2 of the 9 park tiles), my game becomes unusable. The game freezes for 5 seconds every 30 seconds, crashes around every 15 minutes, and takes over 2 minutes to save the game (no joke).(I have i7 3930K, GTX 970, 32GB RAM, SSD)-Once my park starts to be a decent size (3 tiles or 2000 peeps) the game can no longer save or open it without freezing. -I have not heard anyone with over 2000 peeps in their park claim that it is running smoothly.How can I be motivated to spend time building something that I can no longer use once it starts to get interesting?  PATHS-Building paths can be a pain when connecting to other paths or building up or near hills. -Changing the path material means destroying anything connected to those paths (LIKE SHOPS) as the game will not allow you to place the path directly next to them again.   To fix: Add a material paint brush tool in the path menu and avoid the issue altogether.-The game is SO PICKY when it comes to snapping benches, bins and shops to paths. They won't snap to positions that look perfectly acceptable and by default they seem to want to snap off the path onto the grass.    To fix: Allow intersecting geometry and free placement of path scenery and allow shops to be freely placed much closer to the paths. Let your users judge what is intersecting and what looks good for them.  PEEPS & STAFF-The peeps animations are very wooden and they don't walk as families or groups like they did 12 years ago.-Peeps sometimes stop walking in queue lines and hold up the entire queue for a few minutes.-From birds-eye level the peeps stutter around the park at 2fps-Sometimes all the peeps in the park disappear all at once and gradually start spilling in through the entrance.-Staff are often seen sliding around the park without moving their legs like ghosts.-Staff are often seen walking adjacent to the paths, phasing through all the scenery like ghosts.-Mechanics are often seen congregating at ride exits, phasing through each other like ghosts.I am pretty sure the staff are ghosts.  RIDES-THERE ARE NO LOG FLUMES-THERE ARE NO TRANSPORT RIDES, how hard can it be?-While you can build rollercoasters piece-by-piece like you could in RCT3, parts like helix sections, loops and barrel rolls are missing. -Coasters built or edited with freeform tools lead to a very un-smooth ride when finished. Something as simple as a descending helix can be a nightmare to build smoothly. -Adding a lift-chain is way harder than it needs to be.-It is not yet possible to change the colours of shops and non-coaster rides. -The pre-built coaster stations are much larger and more realistic than RCT3 but you cannot choose where to put the entrance and exits.-Tweaking an existing coaster can be dangerous. Clicking on a section of track to make a banked curve sometimes causes the camera to move which causes that piece of track to move way out of place. You then have to spend ages putting it back into place to avoid an unwelcome s-bend in your coaster. To fix: GIVE US AN UNDO OPTION! Alternatively, allow us to lock certain axis’ when needed.-Deleting parts of a coaster can be very tiresome after it has been built. -Building pre-built coasters from the menu is an absolute nightmare in any park that is not perfectly flat and barren.To fix: Give us an option to snap lowest part to terrain height and automatically bulldoze any scenery that would get in the way. At the very least allow us to see the ride supports during placement so we can see how ridiculously high off the ground the base of the coaster is going to be.-Pre-built coasters do not display any excitement/nausea stats.-All my coasters have ridiculously high nausea ratings while I think it looks quite safe.    To fix: allow us to see that nausea heatmap on our ride while we are building it if we want. At the very least, give the guests time to visit a toilet at the ride exit before puking everywhere. There are never any staff nearby to mop it all up.   TERRAIN-Adjusting terrain under rides or roller-coaster supports is totally forbidden-There are very few terrain materials available. This is like an hour’s job for a texture artist.-There are no waterfalls like there were 12 years ago-You cannot build tunnels like you could 12 years ago  SCENERY-No building blocks/wall sections like in RCT2&3. I don’t want to have to trust an amateur Maya modeller for well-optimised and decent looking models without ridiculous stats from the steam workshop every time I want to build architecture. I want to design things myself. Look at what planet coaster lets you do!-Selecting scenery items freezes the game for up to 5 seconds each, and occasionally CRASHES THE GAME ENTIRELY   To fix: if you don’t have budget to optimise your game any further, at least allow autosave.If you can bear these problems for a few hours, zoom out and look at your park from above with all of its curvy paths and freeform coasters it can actually look quite realistic. The fully working park management aspect is a fun challenge and is just as addictive as the original games.Since no other title can claim both of these points at the same time yet, yes I would recommend this game to keep you busy until Planet Coaster comes out at the end of the year, after which, you will probably never touch this game again.However, as I am unable to open saved parks (loading screen crash)  and experience memory leaks after they start to get big I cannot yet recommend this game.

Early Access Review
								Started with the open sandbox. Quite enjoyed it. There were a lot of bugs and glitches, but no dealbreakers as it's still early access.But when I started a scenario and looked at the way those parks are built: horrible. Seriously, who builts a park like that?!The coaster builder really needs some work. When I build a coaster over water, it crashes. When I try to make a coaster as realistic as possible, it crashes for unknown (probably ridiculous) reasons. The prebuilt coasters are built really bad and therefore should definitely crash, but they don't... They really look like a 2 year old designed them.Other problems I encountered:- Peeps couldn't enter a coaster, the entrance was properly built but it seemed like there was an invisable barrier.- You can only adjust the direction by 5 degrees when building a coaster. Normally this wouldn't be a problem for me, but sometimes it gets stuck at (for example) 42 degrees when you need 40 degrees, so you get ugly wobbles in your coaster.- Coasterphysics when it comes to speed: it just keeps going... really could use some more loss of speed over the course- The breaks on the coaster builder don't make sense: you can't fine tune them at all, and are almost impossible to use midcourse- Result of the break issue: running more than 2 trains is almost impossible- The image rocks a lot sideways when riding a coaster-  Paths are difficult to build: when you want to connect two paths, it restricts you in only a few possibilities.- The game randomly crashes: so be sure to save your progress often!- Peeps keep walking around hungry, even though I placed an abundant amount of foodstalls/restaurantsThis list could go on a while.For now, I wouldn't recommend this game, as it's not worth the price.I really hope these problems are gonne be resolved. I know it's still early access, but there are so many problems which make me question if it will be fixable.			"

								I REALLY, REALLY wanted to give this game a good review. But, I can't. Even after reading all of the negative reviews, I still couldn't believe that RCT would be a bad buy. However, it was.The graphics are pretty good. There is room for some improvement, but over all, good graphics.This is where positive remarks come to an end. You can't build buildings. You can't make your own pavillions or themes. I miss that. The path system is pretty clunky. You sometimes can't connect to specific places. No tunnels. Want your roller coaster to go through a mountain? You can't.It just feels like this game is trying to be to slick. With that, it fails.			"

												!!BEFORE YOU BUY!!You should be aware that this is not the only RollerCoaster/Amusment park Simulation available at this time. Planet Coaster is another game in direct competition with Roller Coaster Tycoon World. I've played the early access versions of both games  and based on my experiences I feel that Planet Coaster is a more polished and ready for release then RCTW. Because I have not had significant time playing full builds of both games this is not a full review.  I simply want to help alert buyers of options before they buy this product based on the Roller Coaster Tycoon name. Prospective buyers should research both games and make decisions based on their own opinons and findings. To anyone confused I hope this helps.			"

								As a fan of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series after 11 years since the last installment this was absoluetly heartbreaking. The peeps don't look as what would be expected, the realistic coaster supports are just never there with any of the games in the series unless modded in. The limitations in the options menu is saddening. Seeing the difference between Planet Coaster and RCTW; RCTW isn't the same and its missing quite a lot for what this game use to be. As a fan i'm heartbroken to even suggest to anyone who could be a fan as well. I'm giving it a chance and hopefully the developers will listen to its fans who have patiently been waiting for years for the next installment and make this series worth playing again. Its gameplay has some good ideas within the game, but it greatly needs improvement. I'm giving this game a 6/10 in my opinion. It has a long way to go.			"

												I would have to say that the series has been my absolute favorite series I have every played EXCEPT for this game.This game I bought early with the expectation that it would live up to all of its predicessors and introduce modern hardware to the mix. It scrapes by as a very eh game.The good:* The rollercoaster editor is actually pretty great if you come from an art background and know how to use splines.* The graphics look pretty good.The bad:* The graphics settings are horribly broken on my system (dual monitor).  * The game fullscreens on a monitor that does 1080 but limits the resolution to the max of my other monitor which is a different aspect ratio so it looks terrible. There is no apparent way to override which monitor it chooses for fullscreen.* There aren't many rides and now with the story mode released it feels like a free to play game where you get internal game money from playing and completing objectives, you then spend that money on rides, attractions, and scenery. I just want to build my parks up like I want without the distraction of dealing with this overarching store. (This is just my nitpick and person preference, some may actually enjoy this)* The ""story"" thus far feels overpowering to the actual fun of running a park. Instead the whole thing is playing out like a tutorial of how to do every little thing in the game even though I figured it all out in early access and there is no way to skip or rush through it, you have to tediously do it all.My advice: This game is absolutely not worth $35. If you are paying it thinking its going to the same creators of the previous games, that is also not correct. The original creators don't even agree with this games current ownership. Frontier created the last game and did a great job in my opinion. Since then they have created planet coaster which looks pretty great, I believe I will be moving over to that game instead.			"

Early Access Review
								Time for an honest review. Normally I would not have recommended this game when it first released, but over the past 2 weeks the game has been updated with bug fixes and optimization that has steadily improved the experience. The fact is that this game has a solid base to build off of, and that is what people need to take away from it. I own both Planet Coaster and RCTW, both are hardly finished and both, in my opinion, have a positive future ahead of them. Also, Hats off to Nvizzio for keeping in touch with the community and rolling out updates as quickly as they can. With all of that said, I'll list my pro and cons.Pros-Coaster editor/maker in this game is EXCELLENT, Sure its a bit finnicky sometimes, but it's damn good and can only get better, I prefer it to the piece by piece editor in PC, it's one thing I hated about RCT3. -Decent variety of scenery to start and I'm sure this will be expanded upon-Solid amount of flat ride content with a new one coming every 2 weeks in Major patches (Yes, I believe them, they have stuck to that schedule so far)-I'll probably be crucified for this, but after the latest update..graphics have improved markedly, and I'd expect that to continue-The Management aspect is there, could be better but it's decent for EA.-Terrain tools are easy to use and effective, need an option for underground building though.-There is more but I'll leave it at that for now, new update is scheduled to be rolled out Tuesday or Wednesday next week so I'll edit this review at that timeCons-Peeps need work (Animations/texture/etc)-Optimization at this point is a bit shaky, people across a wide array of system are getting mixed results, once the park gets large it really starts to slow down, apparently this is getting addressed in next patch, I'll update if that is the case-Pathing is shoddy at the moment.-AI behavior is pretty poor in the current build, mechanics don't always fix rides, janitors are slow, etc.-Water quality sucks. lol.-Can't change ingame graphics while in your park. (Seriously guys?)-Can't place scenery on elevated paths (Again, really guys?)-Coaster ratings need work, every coaster I make is a vomit comet-General bugs and such-Overall, I'd recommend this based on the rate it is improving and the committment Nvizzio has shown to the franchise. I'd expect good things as time goes on.			"

												This game is abysmal. I'm a life-long fan of the RCT series and RCT:World has♥♥♥♥♥♥on them all from a height before promptly walking off laughing into the sunset with one finger raised. Getting it working? A challenge. It doesn't like doing simple things such as loading, or playing for long durations without a crash.Once you get it working, it's riddled with bugs and has captured next to nothing from the original games. It's clunky, riddled with UX screwups such as only being able to place fence panels one at a time, ah you know what? I can't be bothered with this review. The game's shocking, DO NOT WASTE £30.00 ON IT.If you want RCT:World, buy Planet Coaster - one of RCT's original teams have built it and it's highly rated. If you want a classic feel, try Parkitect. Save your sanity and money, U-turn here. I will never buy another Atari release after this complete scam they call a game. Just another early-access money grab.			"

								I tried to give this game a legitamte go. Go in with an unbias take on the game.Yes, this is Early Access, but nothing in this game feels like it will be special when it's done. It's essentially a worse version of RCT3 without a grid system. It's also much more awkward to work with than RCT3.Planet Coaster is the way to go with this generation of theme park games, it doesn't have everything yet, much like this game, but what it does have is stunning. It looks beautiful, it runs beautifully and it has a clear vision.Please avoid this game.			"

												Pre-ordered this one on the reputation of it's earlier series that I had a ton of fun with... Was accepting of the bugs during the beta.But this game is now live.  During the tutorials I had it crash twice on my high end system running at normal levels.Went to sandbox mode, more bugs in the camera as I could not unlock my view from a peep that had left the park.  After I figured out a work around 10 mins later the game crashed as I was waiting for a special peep to get to the park so I was doing nothing special.  Time in this game reflects the time I spent playing the beta with a few mins of crashing after the game went live.Do not purchase this game...  Even if they publish bugfixes I would no longer trust the makers.I would not recommend this game that I had high hopes for.  look for Planet Coaster as an option.			"

												I don't write many reviews, but after playing this game for the past few months I have to say I am sorely disappointed. It wasn't until after I purchased The Early release of this game did I learn that Frontier had nothing to do with this and that Planet Coaster was more of the successor to RCT3 than thos game. I came back periodically to see if game play had gotten any better, and while certain aspects did improve, overall it was a very BLAH experience. I really wanted to like this game but sadly the developers could not pull it itogether. I finally broke down and bought Planet Coaster today and I am totally convinced that Atari made a huge mistake in not keeping Frontier on as a developer. PC is BY FAR the better game in every aspect.			"

								I'll make this quick.  Here's a list of Pro's and Con's:Cons:No walls to build structures with.Poor range of textures to paint the terrain with.Cannot create tunnels for rides, paths and queuesCan't change the look of the stationsCan't change the look of the park gatesDecor offering only consists of 1 lamp post and 5 candy canes!Only 5 Facades!No smaller parts to create our own centre pieces with (ie. a large rock skull). Instead there are just large pre-made centre pieces to use.Again, no smaller parts to create our own specialty pieces. Just pre-made ones to use.Coasters cam is not smooth and feels jerky around corners. (no I don't mean frame rate)Coaster building can be irritatingly fiddly at times.The delete tool is terrible, you can only delete one item at a time.Removing small bushes is really difficult.Small choice of coasters.Not a massive graphical leap forward since RCT3.Some texures look shocking close upCrashed a few times when placing paths (but this is an early access game).Other than the coaster builder (spline) there are no improvements over the RCT3.Pro'sCoaster builder (spline based) could be great if the mechanics are ironed out.Looks visually better than the video that was released a year or so ago.Shops are okay.Summary.Don't waste your money on this just yet, hold off for 6 months in the hope they add loads more items to play with. It's a very steep price to pay for a game that feels like it's still in alpha. It's not a complete broken mess as some other reviews suggest, it's just got very little content to keep you interested for more than 4-5 hours. My general feeling is that the developers are completely missing the point of what people want out of a theme park simulator - it's like they've sucked all the fun out of the game by taking away the creative freedom of themeing a park. By themeing I mean creating something from scratch, not simply placing two pre-made centre pieces side by side! My main gripe with it is that it's doing anything to build on RCT3 - even if they add lots more content, it will only be on par with the previous game in the series.  "

								Gave this game a fair shot with over 20 hours played, but honestly, it's just terrible. The new PbP builder is ok if you can get used to the clunky control system, the trouble is the rest of the game is dire. It feels pointless spending time making nice looking buildings only for horrible looking peeps to walk through and micturate on the foundations of the building you spent hours fighting the game to make. Outside of the PbP builder the rest of the game is a rotten cabbage. The peeps roam around aimlessly in an eternal hunt for food stopping only briefly to hate your rides and urinate on your pathways. The coasters look, feel and sound weird (that is of course when they're actually working, which is rare). The staff management system involves you peppering the park with terrible eye sore buildings for each service which spawns a selected amount of staff that’ll walk around at running speed being completely useless. The entertainers are as about as entertaining as a hemeriod and look absolutely terrible. Overall the game just looks and feels rubbish even when you take into account the fact it’s an early access title. You might be tempted to give them the benefit of the doubt because this is early access and could be improved at some point to which I’d advise you exercise caution. They’re wasting time adding features like the PbP builder rather than focusing on improving the core game first. They’ve had many months in which to do so but they’re clearly more interested in adding shoddy looking attractions and more features so they can advertise a bloated feature list in the final game. The game is so broken that it would require such a radical redesign of everything to fix it that they might as well release it as a different game entirely. If you’re a fan of the theme park sim genre this is one to avoid, any of the other games are far more enjoyable. RCTW is the first game I’ve played where I found myself just wanting to do household chores instead of playing :( "

												EDIT: Got the game to work. Finally.Another edit: Lagspikes when picking something to place. Really? Lagspikes everywhere...""Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."" This is what steam is telling me to do if I'll write a review. Well, ok then. I was about to curse the crap out of this title. But I'll keep it polite, for steams sake.Oh and don't think I'll be adding any fancy headers to this review. The devs didn't put effort into their game so I won't put effort into my review.Where to begin. Ah yes. I'll start with the early access period. Since that's when I bought this game.I've got something important to tell you about this period: The game actually started and I could build a park!!! Yea, I know right?! It worked somehow! That is, until the game couldn't keep up with all the things I placed and the park actually getting busy. At this moment. The framerate dropped, and at that point I usually just quit the game. But hey, no hard feelings. This was Early Access after all. It's still under development and I knew this.Fast forwarding to the present...Full release is finally here. The game is complete and playable. Or is it?Well. For me it's not. The only working thing seems to be the play button in the steam client. After that, I get a black screen with nothing on it except for a working ""alt+tab"" steam overlay. I thought I might've been the problem. So I went to the discussions board and guess what. I wasn't the only one with this ""black screen of death"". The devs even put up a sticky, explaining what to do to fix the issue. And guess what again?! The fixes didn't work! So now I'm stuck with a game I paid €31,99 for and I can't even play! I trusted these devs. I believed in them. Even when things, close to release, were still buggy or not even working. And they didn't fix♥♥♥♥♥♥So. This game doesn't work for way too many people. This isn't some rare bug that's happening. This is just another ""broken on launch"" game like so many others nowadays. This shouldn't be a problem. But it is. If anyone is reading this, I recommend you to wait till tomorrow and buy planet coaster. It looks like they do have a working themepark game that happens to be 10x more advanced than this excuse of a game. Hell, the game was more advanced in their alpha while this was in the beta.Remember. Today is the day Rollercoaster Tycoon died.Yours sincerely,An angry customer.			"

Early Access Review
								Before reading this be aware that i also own the alpha of Planet coasters but gave both games a very fair chance.I purchased RCTW because it was due to release last december well before planet coaster release date.The beta came out and well i thought it wasnt bad, and that they were just hiding the features from us to keep as a suprise, turns out its cause they didnt actually have anything. In its current state this game is completely unplayable. I have an absolut beast pc but the game lags so hard all the time even with an empty park that i cant play for more then 10 mins. Path making is the worst iv ever seen in any game PERIOD, is the snap function some sort of inside joke? because its ALWAYS ON. paths do as they want and there is no room for people to get creative as there is no clipping allowed, the grid system is just some sort of crule prank and the peeps animations are reminisant of early gameboy graphics. Don't get me started on placing buildings, just.. just dont. it's not even worth explaining how frustraing and down right crap it is. One pro i will give this game is that the way you build coasters is really really fantastic, its so simple and feels so natural to me. Shame the game can only achive 2 fps on a 980ti and i7 so you cant enjoy that either. It honestly has gone backwards from the beta weekend. Please Atari get a new developer on this ASAP as Nvissio seem to be the most budget and clueless group to ever make a game.Playing the alpha of Planet coaster, well it already has a ton more content, far better graphics and runs like a dream. It leaves you to create anything you can possibly imagine. trust me when i say you should pick it up its just the game we always dreamed of, made by the original devs of RCT3 and their passion /  love and attention clearly shines through on planet coaster.EDIT: alot of people say that the 2 are totally different games, but that isnt the case at all, obviously they have differences but they are the same. its crazy not to think that. My biggest beef is that this game had a release date last year! and what they have now is easily 1 or 2 years away from release. As well as cheating all the november beta testers who i bet are all the ones leaving the negative reviews as i am.			"

												Where do I start - I'll keep it simple. I have been a strong supporter of RCT since the day RCT1 was out - and couldn't wait for this installment. Sadly, Atari have not listened to the community and decided not to spend the money on a proper software house, like Fronter, who made RCT3. Instead, a decidedly poor version has been created. The beta looked promising, but it went down hill from there. The graphics are awful, the scalling is all wrong, the audio works randomly, the frame rate on a high-end machine is poor and the over all experience and ambience of the game is a total let-down. This does not keep the RCT franchise going. I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game to anyone - especiallly when the competition (Planet Coaster) was so much better, in every single way. I've just deleted it from my PC. Waste of money.			"

												Been gaming a long time--since the text-only version of Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Own and played all the RCTs. Got into this in early access and gave it chance after chance after chance. Bottom line after a hundred hours? It's just not a good game. It's resemblence to the previous entries in this franchise is vague at best. There's no real financial engine to speak of. Peeps behavior is erratic and un-human. Graphics are okay but just okay. I want to say the price point is too high but I'm not sure I could recommend it at any price.At the end of the day, it's not fun. It doesn't have to be giggly, wacky fun--it can be challenging fun. But it's no fun. Really, don't be tempted. Steer clear. Sorry. I'm disappointed, too.			"

												They lied period. The things and the fun they promised, they did not deliver. All that public feedback went to waste as they never listend to anything. The only good part about this game is their rollercoaster builder and the park lights, that's it. Everything else is a complete and absolute mess. Even with all of their upgrades before full release the game is an absolute mess. I bought this game in early access and I will never make that mistake ever again, especially when it comes to Atari games. I feel like i've been manipulated and robbed and I've never felt that way before about a game. They kept making all these grand promises even from last year this time when it was originally supposed to be FULLY RELEASED!, and still the game is a complete mess. I wish I could honestly get my money back, I should have gotten a refund when they went into early access, but I believed their promises instead of the many people suggesting I should have gotten a refund. I preordered the Deluxe Edition and that's a lot of money down the drain just to get something not even close to what was promised. I'm really sad. :'(			"

												This is the worst RCT game ever created (and I have played them all since the first version). I would have taken a refund over writing a bad review, but since Steam refused, they earned it.The gameplay is glitchy (when it runs), and the graphics are awful. I have a 3.6ghz i7, 16gb ram, with an nVidia 4gb video card. I regularly play games much more taxing (like Diablo 3) with 0 problems so there really is no excuse. After dealing with the initial failures (constantly locking up before the game even finished loading), then the actual in-game crashes/graphics errors, I can definitely say this product should be a free demo until they figure out what they are doing. It should never have been offered as a pay item in this condition.I understood that the game was 'a bit buggy' when I bought it--that is one of the reasons I think imposing a time limit on the refund is absurd. Most of us were wating to see if the game ever became playable, and not just jump-ship--I have learned my lesson. Next time, I will request the refund at the first sign of problems, instead of waiting in hopes of someone actually fixing the problem--that way I do not exceed any time limits. "

Early Access Review
								Oh god. No. This game is not good.Graphics: Graphics are better than launch but still not good. Occasionally the game will freeze for a second and once it un freezes all the shadows and lighting are gone.Peeps: No. They have no facial animations, the textures are trash, the models are trash, the animations are HORRIFIC. The peeps don't ever even walk in groups. No families or anything. They walk around the park alone and horribly. (I don't think 8 year olds go to parks alone Nvizzio. Just saying.)Coaster Builder: Best part of the game. But thats not saying much. You can make some cool things, but it's very finicky. The physics are much of a pain. The sounds of the coasters are HORRIBLE. The coaster cam is jittery and not smooth at all.Buildings: There isn't any piece by piece building system. The premade buildings are a pain to place, not very good looking, alot of them have pretty much the same exact design with just a small little change to signal that this is a differnet building than this other.UGC: Arguably the best part. To me this is the only thing that is going for this game.Paths: No. They don't even want to connect to 90% of other paths.Performance / Optimization: Trash. The optimization is not good at all.Overall: This game is not worth the money. Spent less than half of the money for the full version of Planet Coaster. Its SECOND ALPHA is much more polished and has much more features than this game that was supposed to be FULLY RELEASED in December of 2015. Buy Planet Coaster, it is the true sequal to RCT3. "

Early Access Review
								RollerCoaster Tycoon World (Early Access)This game is heart breaking to say the least, as a huge rollercoaster tycoon fan I was greatly disspointed with the outcome.Unfortunately, it comes down to the ""cons"" outweighing the ""pros"".Problems i've encountered while playing the game:-The park guests: They are unrealistic in the way the move around the park, they constantly glitch and get stuck in queue lines which holds everyone else back. Seems like 1 out of 3 of them ether puke on the floor or throw garbage, making it impossible to keep up with the cleaning of the park. You can't pick them up anymore. I could go on.- The park workers: Picking them up is very choppy and not smooth. having to find them instead of having a menu with all of them listed get's frustrating. Because so many guests seem to want to litter and puke every 10 steps you need an army of them to keep the place clean. You can no longer set them to be in a certain area ( was nice to set them on specific, always messy paths.- The FPS: The frames per second of the game dramatically drops after you get over 1000 guests (which can happen within the first hour or so of playing). And yes, I have a great gaming laptop that should allow me to run it. It becomes unbarable and unplayable after just an hour or two of building up your park.Lack of customization: Can no longer render the buildings or coasters a different color. Can only select a small number of pre-made buildings. designs of pre-made buildings seem lazy, copied like other buildings with slight changes.Roller coaster building: It all feels confusing and complex and it's so difficult to get it exactly the way you like it. It should be a simple build consept first, and if you feel really creative, go into the expert custom mode. You can no longer change the train cars, or how many train cars you can have. The train stations are too big.My personal thoughts: I believe they really wanted to deliver a great game but unfortunately for everyone it just isn't up to par. RollerCoaster Tycoon has been one of my personal favorite franchises since I was a kid, and to me a game like this shouldn't be about graphics, but more about the gameplay, the options, the customization. I think all those qualities suffered because they wanted the game to look pretty, which is unfortunate because the game will even make the strongest of computers lag and make the rollercoaster tycoon experience unenjoyable. Little glitches here and there can be easily fixed, but from what I can see so far, the major issues are irreversible at this late stage of the game, even at early access.It pains me to say this, but I do not recommend this game.5/10 Rating-Darkwisemonkey			"

								  It is a real shame this game does not run as intended. I really wanted to like this game. The developers could have easily put another 6 months to a year into the game before even putting it on Early Access.   Ive played a solid 12 hours so far. It always starts out great, but as you grow your park the glitches keep coming. Peeps walking aimlessly to no where, there is no control over park staff, paths CONSTANTLY moving on me, cannot delete some paths for reasons i cannot understand. One of the biggest bugs is saving your game, logging out, then coming back later. It takes about 20 minutes to load up sometimes, a lot of the time as soon as its loaded it crashes instantly. Ive had a start 4 new parks because my saved games would not load. If it does load, its a mess, paths moved and uneditable, terrain changed drastically, peeps in the middle of nowhere. Its very frustating building a park and borderline impossible to continue after leaving and coming back   With all that, there is a lot of potential for the game. The graphics look great for a RT game, the rollercoaster building is absolutly amazing, the possiblilties are endless when building. There is actually a good amount of content, rides, coasters, stands, scenery. The game itself looks and feels great at short glance, but in the long run, it needs so much more work. I would recommend buying this in 6 months time so they can work out the glitches.			"

												So I got the Beta test and, well it was a Beta test, there were some bugs but all in all I think the game has a pretty solid base. The new Coaster builder is a little confusing at first but once I got the hang of it I had a lot of fun.To those who are demanding refunds, at least give it a chance and wait until release before wanting your money back. They released this beta test for a reason, to find bugs in what is likely the buggiest part of the game, so at least have the faith to give them until release to judge it.			"

												I had very high hopes for this game. Like most people I grew up playing the RCT series. I have very wonderful memories about those games. However this game did not really give me very good memories like I had as a child. I bought this game back in June and it is now November. What has changed......NOT MUCH!!! This game is still very barebone and restrictive unlike Planet Coaster which I waited to buy till now. Why? I actually hoped and believed the game would be better. Unfortunately it is not and still plays as if it is in an alpha or a beta. Path glitches, very unsmooth gameplay when riding coasters, the coasters feel fake, and in the scenarios half the time I failed them because the special guest never found the dang restuarant or ride they wanted or thought it was too expensive. Im still going to play this game to compare how it is to planet coaster but I kinda have lost hope in this game as it still does not have water rides or transport rides at launch.			"

								So many of the faults of this game have already been gone over, so I don't have to repeat most of them.... As a lot of others, I bought this game solely because I have enjoyed the previous versions (RCT2 is my favorite). So I didn't even read the reviews of RCTW before I did the advanced purchasing. What a mistake that was! As someone previously stated, why in the world can you come out with a 'deluxe' upgrade when the main game is so uncomplete?? There are no transportation systems either - monorails, trains, trams, etc.! So I agree with the majority: Don't buy this game! $50? (well, $49.99 - still a ripoff) Would I recommend this game: Absolutely NOT!			"

The 8 hours I've spent ""playing"" have actually been multiple attempts at running the game. I waited about 45 minutes each time, trying to open the game and then it crashes, for a total of about 8 hours. When the game does run, it is extremely lagging and crashes less than 2 minutes later. The worst part is that Steam wont give me a refund. I've tried for a refund several times and they refuse every time even after I tell them that I have never played the game because of the lagging and crashing and refusals to load.			"

Early Access Review
As of August 14, 2016I was really looking forward to the next successor, but this is a failsessor at the moment. I've been keeping track and reading every new ""patch"" they put out. But I haven't played it in a few months now. I just looked it up on YouTube to save me the headache and I watched Olli43 give it another shot. (He put up a vid about it on July 6, 2016) To his and my disappointment, the path systems are still a mess, the game is still not optimized for full sized parks, and the peeps literally 'float' around like ghosts from a short distance away, I guess to make up for the fps. That doesn't really work given that the engine needs a complete overhaul.In fact, this game needs to be completely re-done. Do yourselves a favor (whoever is the publisher, maker), take this game off Steam. Rework EVERYTHING from the ground up and start over. These parks are so bland and boring. You can't customize hardly anything besides placing a limited amount of assets. I guess they rely on us to make all of the cool stuff. What a lazy approach. And what happened to the days when it was like RCT 1,2? They had assets and scenery out the wazoo!My money is on Planet Coaster. Yeah I said the name, this game is miles behind them! PC is way better than this. Now prove me wrong. Oh, and PC is coming to Steam, so watch out RCTW.I want this game to be great, I really do. But I fear the worst right now. I mean, look at the reviews on here. An overall rating of Mostly Negative with an approval rate of 33%? That is a lot to bounce back from. That's why I'm suggesting to just start over.-Good dayChief			"

Early Access Review
								We're sad that we have to give this a thumbs down. My husband & I have been Atari fans since we got our first Atari Game System back in like 1981. Anybody remember Pong? Yeah...we're old...We bought the Deluxe version of this back in Nov thinking the release date would be Dec 10th.  We aren't upset about spending that money, however, we're shocked at what this has turned out to be so far.The Pro's1.) Early Access- good on Atari to recognize that they needed to put something out there.2.) Performance- we have a great computer that my husband built, so no performance issues like others have had.   Occasional choppiness, but hey, it's a computer game.3.) Graphics-the parks actually look really pretty.4.) Coaster builder- far from perfect, but we actually made several cool coasters & each one took less & less time. The problem is that both the coasters & the pieces to build with are disproportionately large & the test stats are way off. (What exactly is the safety rating about, does anyone know?) I hope some of this is fixable & being worked on.The Con's1.) Navigation- we shouldn't have to use the keyboard to scroll around the park. It's not 1989. And can I please have an Undo button? I make a lot of mistakes!2.) Music- I know Matt said they're working on the custom music, but can we please put a rush on that before my head explodes? The music from RCT3 was so superb, I'd love to be able to import that into this game. Does anyone know if that's possible?3.) The Vomit- really? Every peep pukes coming off every ride? And now they pee on the path if they can't make it to the rest room? Sorry, but it's disgusting & childish.4.) Paths- we don't even know what to make of this. Very cumbersome. And we can't place buildings right on the main path. Not liking that at all.5.) The Peeps- it's like Night of the Living Dead went to a porn flick. What's with the weird moaning? And can someone please make the kid stop crying? I think my ears are bleeding. The peeps have no personality at all. They don't appear to be happy, sad or anything in between.6.) Rides- again, many seem disproportionately large. It just seems as if things aren't properly scaled. The fact that we can't move the entrances & exits is very odd. Why not? Also, the rides seem pricey, so why do we have to purchase the sign going over the ride?7.) Complaining- there's too much of it. It appears as if you all have taken a page from the first Zoo Tycoon, & not a good page. The animals were great in that game, but the peeps made me stop playing because of the constant complaining about things you couldn't even fix. Please don't make that same mistake with this game. 8.) Buildings- way too many restaurants & the builings are huge. Seriously, who goes to an amusement park thinking, ""Gee, I hope I can get a great Moo Goo Gai Pan while I'm here!"" And if you eat sushi, then get on a roller coaster, you're an idiot. No wonder there's puke everywhere. Don't get me started on the huge, ugly, unnecessary employee buildings. I hate this idea. But the Dev Blog dated April 1st states they will also be adding an admin building. And where are we supposed to place that? We have no room left in the park to place a rolller coaster, and with the park entrance being so huge, can't we just pretend that's where the employees go to rest? It's just a game, it doesn't have to be that realistic, it just has to make sense.9.) Breakdowns-is it just me or did the rides start breaking down as soon as I opened the park?10.) Entertainers- Oh. My. God. This is the worst thing of all to me.  The Dev Blog dated April 1st said the entertainers will amuse guests while they're queuing. I mean no disrespect, but did you guys actually play this game? I watched one exit their building, walk down a path, enter a queu, interact with exactly no one, turn around & go right back to his building. I told you those employee buildings were a bad idea! And I'm sorry, but that huge, hulking, ominous, predatory owl looking thing is just scary. Remember the shark entertainer from RCT3? My husband & I still love that guy. We named him Jerry. We would turn the game to its lowest speed so we could watch the kiddies laugh & jump up & down as he tried to bite their heads off, then he would joyfully skip away, with his little red sneakers on! So cute. Yeah, that's all gone, along with all the charm, cuteness & personality that was RCT3.We don't know what this game is, but we do know that it isn't RollerCoaster Tycoon. We have nothing but faith in Atari to make this right. We will continue to play, for what it's worth, and will amend our review as we see fit. Thanks for listening!PS- I'm not kidding, can I please have Jerry the Shark back???4/7/16-So, after today's update, still awful. Oh sure, the peeps LOOK better while they're peeing on my path right in front of the rest room, but my janitors are still ineffective. I do think the mechanics are working faster & I do appreciate the flat map. They have a long way to go before this review comes out of the thumbs down status!5/24/16-So I went in the game today for the first time in weeks. Sorry-still awful! It's not even interesting enough or fun enough to waste another minute playing. RIP, RCT.11/28/16- Holy crap, they took this thing out of early accesss??? Yikes, sorry to have wasted $60.00 on this. My husband & I are done with you, Atari. Considering we have been fans since you first started in 1974 & we were just kids, you can imagine our disappointment. Funny enough, we also own Planet Coaster & aren't impressed with that one either, although it's better than this nonsense. At least they weren't ridiculous enough to have peeps♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the path. Shame on you, Atari. Good luck digging yourselves out of this one.			"

								This is plagued with so many issues that i cannot recommend this game at all for the time being. Other reviews have stated in more detail why and what performance issues there are.This is just another case of an unfinished game brought out too early for ""Early access"" regardless of its current state. My MSI afterburner shows in game as my GPU at 19% / CPU at 10% and my Ram at 12GB yet my FPS was horrendus hovering around 9 - 13 FPS with only a single tile filled and a second tile part filled. I wouldnt mind if i had a low end system but running an i7 4790k - 16GB 2400Mhz Ram - GTX980ti and installing the game on an samsung 850 EVO SSD....just tells me this is poorly optimised with little progression since its release.I'll be honest, i made the mistake of thinking that frontier was behind this at first, considering how i love RTC3. Luckily I only paid £9.99 for this on the site that shall not be named so i can live with my mistake. Seeing how good RTC3 was and how good Elite dangerous is I think this game is going to be abandoned in my steam library and I'll happily pay 3x what i paid for this for Frontiers upcoming Rollercoaster development.Sorry Nvizzio Studios this is a poor effort and shouldnt be on steam for the price it is.

Everything from the peeps, rides, paths and their over-hyped piece by piece system. there's always something wrong with it. and don't believe the whole ""well it's in Early Access so it has an excuse to be crappy"" well what Atari doesn't want you to know is that they were planning to release this game at the end of 2015! claiming to only need to do some last minute polish. So why the jump to Early Access after claiming that it was ready? Planet Coaster.So what am I getting at here? If your going to buy an in-depth and deep simulated game with limitless creative possilbilities with the passion of its developers to back it up, go get Planet Coaster. Roller Coaster Tycoon World isn't even good enough to wipe your own backside with.			"

								Kind of fun. I would wait for release. Too buggy right now. Lots of frustrations. I can't even play it anymore because the load and save buttons don't work.  Their forums registration server has been down for weeks so I can't even report the bug. They only want your money right now.			"

								Long time fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, this one however sucks so much its not even funny. If you want the true ""RCT4"" look at Planet Coaster. Planet Coaster is created by frontier, the same developer that made RCT3 and so far its an amazing game. This game (RCTW) is maybe worth $15 bucks at most. Its a waste of time and money.There are so many bugs and lagging issues that are not being fixed. Instead of fixing the bugs, the devs just keep adding more♥♥♥♥♥♥Fix the ♥♥♥♥ing game first you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												The biggest dissappointment of 2016 hands down!  Even worse than No Man's Sky!  Aside from the mild update in the graphics this game has nothing to offer that RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 doesnt, in fact it has less.  First Off Game Performance is not great.  I will says its better than when it started off in early release but still even on my 1070 I get some stuttering when panning around the map.Secondly, The one thing I loved about all of the RCT games was park management, this version however has next to no park management.  Sure you can do some things but not nearly to the level of detail or variety that you could in previous versions.Thirdly, You cant customize anything.  In all Previous RCT games you could customize your stalls, rides, etc.  Nope not here, in this game what you see is what you get no more.  You cant change the colors of the rides, the lights on the rides.  You cant choose the color of the ballons that your balloon stalls sell, you can choose the types of foods your stalls sell, or what goes on your foods, none of that is here.There isnt alot of content here either, the previous games had a ton of content but again not with this one.  This version of RCT is but a pale reflection of what the original games were.  It seems to me that they went the extra mile to produce a watered down, pale reflection of what the previous games were.  I cant imagine what would make a company look at the success of its predecessors and say, nah we dont need that.  Bottom line is if you've never played RCT in any other form than you might like this game.  But if your like me and were expecting a better and greater version of a legendary franchise than your better off looking else where, this game aint got it.   Crappy launch combined with the shady way they marketed this game and even put out retail copies of the game while it was in pre-release is enough to make me swear off Atari and any further iterations of this game forever.  RCT died with this game RIP RCT!			"

								Without going into great detail it just seems like a 'mobile' type game. Animations, options, and optimization all seem incomplete. There are many limitations, like when you place a ride the entrance and exit are built in...things like that just limit the creativity, and isn't that the whole point of sim games? Overall the biggest thing is a lack of polish, especially when compared to another game coming out with the initials of PC.			"

												I was on board with this game since early alpha, and dear god was it a mess. and I checked back every few months to see how they improved it.   There were little improvements here and there, but it was like a kid failing with low F and who keeps turning in extra credit to improve his grade.  It helps, but still not great. Now official release comes around, and now its like a bland relationship thats noone's fault its sparkless, so you just keep saying, I'll just stick it out for a little longer. maybe things will get better right? its not bad.. just I don't know if I'm happy here. Things never get better, they never get worst, they coast along content but not really enjoying yourself.TL:DR- This is the most adequate of all mediocre average experiences that ever made someone vaguely complacent.

								Just another voice to add to the chorus of negative comments about this game.  I own all versions of Roller Coaster Tycoon.  I also own No Limits 2 and Planet Coaster (alpha) so I have a pretty good vantage point for comparisons.  I have no ties or loyalties to any of the dev shops making roller coaster builders.  I tried over and over to make RCTW work for me.  Yes, it does technically run but it is just a plain bad overall experience.  Even after waiting to allow more dev time before playing again, I was sorely disappointed.  This is an absolute waste of money.I know it's been said many times already but Planet Coaster is where you should set your sites.  I have no affiliation with Frontier whatsoever but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see they have their s**t together. "

								Unfortunately Atari dropped the ball big time with this game. I purchased it when it was still due to be realeased in full and not EA. Once it moved to EA, they gave us only a few hours to test and get a refund. Luckily I did, but know of a bunch of people who are stuck now. Atari please honor those who want to get a refund. It is not right on how little time you gave us. As for the game overall, the graphics are decent and as I have still kept up with the development, they have added a bunch of decent features. Then comes to this release date tomorrow.....not a wise idea. Heck check the forums. This game has made some progress and the only reason I can think that they are rushing to release is another theme park simulator game is coming out the the 17th. I personally like it better (Planet Coaster) as I loved RCT3. Planet Coaster is from the same developers and they have kept me and other customers very informed and updated. They did announced their release date before RCTW btw. I'd love to give this game another shot down the road, but from the feedback I've heard of current players, it just isn't worth it.			"

												(Buy Planet Coaster)RCT4 as been in development hell since RCT3 came out, a few years ago, Atari woke up and announced 2 RCT games, a PC version, and a mobile game (Yes, its bad)Since then, RCT World has been around 3 dev studios before being released, and it clearly shows, the game looks nothing like the original trailers which makes me expect that Atari forced the companies to start the game from scratch (Maybe each time)This game is a buggy, slow loading, bad performance mess, the only reason it was released was because of frontier announcing Planet Coaster (Frontier, who made RCT2 DLC and RCT3)The only interesting thing about this game, is that it runs unity, which makes the workshop support a little different (Because people can just give 3D models to the game and they turn into scenenery, so you can have nearly anything)			"

								Do not, I repeat do not waste your money on this game.  First time I've ever written a review on here but that's how disappointed I am by this game.  It has some many glitches in it, graphics are terrible (possibly worse than Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 which came out years ago) and for a game is just not enjoyable.  Feel so conned by this, though have now learned my lesson as the game is just not ready, I guess, hence Early Access, which from a major developer is pretty shameless to still charge full price.  This game will take months and months to fix, do not spend your money on it, I made that mistake and am now regretting not getting a lovely bottle of Malbec which would have been so much more enjoyable.  By the time they get this fixed, Planet Coaster will be out and that already looks 1000x better.  Please save your money, don't even think, ah I'm sure he's wrong, I'll give it a go, I repeat, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! ;)			"

												The game can't be compared to Planet Coaster.It's lacking in so many fundamental ways, and it seems that is in it's core, which will never change.It's a mobile game at best.That may be satisfactory for many people though.It has not brought much new to the table, and it even lacks quite a few things from RCT's past.The coaster builder has it's merits, and it's flaws. The sound design is terrible.Coasters sound like metal carts rolling down an empty marble floored hallway, with little to no nuance in regards to to the action. They sound the same on an air-time hill, as they do at the bottom of a fast, high-G trough.The paths....they dictate what you can do most of the time. You'll run into ""no, not there"" more often than not.Many of the ride animations are incorrect, if you are a fan of authenticity. Many of the rides are just ugly as well. Take the radioctive, glowing in the daytime ""Wave Swinger"" for instance. Boy is that an atrocity to behold!The newly ""re-designed"" peeps are still terrible. The animations are just bizarre. RCT 2 introduced peeps in pairs, and RCT3 introduced Groups. RCTW decided they should go back to the begining, and only have single peeps. Unsupervised children, no less. The peeps will wander around aimlessly through your park, and ignore the very things they are looking for. You have no clue how to satisfy them. The emoticons (REALLY?) floating over their heads are there to help, because the peeps are emotionless. It's good that they redid the scenarios for shorter play ""missions"", because the older your park gets, the less the peeps care to ride anything, even for free.Forget trying to attract as many peeps into your park as you possibly can. Most average computers will start catching on fire at around 3,000 peeps. The rival game becomes unplayable at around 15,000 peeps. that's FIVE TIMES THE CROWD!!!This game really has no soul, at all. There is nothing endearing to draw you in. Instead, it is rather off putting.I do not recommend this game to anyone. I voted it as ""Worse Game of the Year""			"

												I have been a fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon ever since the first game, and I've played 1, 2, and 3 almost religously. RCT was always a favorite of mine...that is untill this installment. I eagerly awaited for RCTW to go on pre-order and I pre-purchased the deluxe edition the day it was available. During the betas, the game was unplayable...but I had hope that upon at least early access they would have most of the bugs worked out and the features that I know and love would be availabel. Clearly I was duped. Here the game is ""finished"".....which is a laughable statement. The bugs are terrible, there are no water rides, transport rides, or dark rides. The learning curve for building coasters is STEEP...like about as steep as a dive coaster's first drop. The coasters don't even have shuttle mode. The Piece By Piece Building tool is horribly insufficent, and it just doesn't feel like the same series that I know and love. I honestly had hope with the node system that finally I could REALLY build the coasters of my dreams, make the buildings and scenery I had fantasized about....I believed I would be able to make coasters with the great scenery and storytelling that Disney does so well at thier parks. Nope. The potential for buildings and structures is severely limited. The amont of scenery items is decent, but nothing like the past titles. Building a working and fun coaster is a treamendous chore, requiring so much trial and error, when before it was more inuitive, despite the grid system. Do yourself a favor, and save your money. If you want a theme park sim that actually is fun, I do suggest Planet Coaster, It's defintly different than RCT, but in my opinion it flows much better, runs smoother, and the scenery and buildings potential is what I have been asking for for years. I think PC still needs more work, but it's miles ahead of RTC.			"

												Release Review 11/18/16: Game blacks screen while starting, I know this going to happen and decides that Planet Coaster and Parkitect is the best games beside this pile of crap. Atari hired the wrong guys to do this game and ruined a game series that almost runs through two decades and people love. Once again, DON'T BUY THIS GAME and go and buy yourself Planet Coaster made by Frontier or if you have a machine that can't handle it then go Parkitect which is made by a small group of indie devs. Remember that you can also buy RCT2 on Steam and install OpenRCT2. NOT WORTH THE $35!Review Update (4/2/2016):So I have played the game again when it came out as early access and they added flat rides into the game but it doesn't meet any of my expectations. The coaster builder is laggy and physics are so horrible. The game crashed on me when I have my park while in load of 1,950 guests which is total disapointment, I had that problem on RCT 3 most of the times on my older machines. I run a PC with a GTX 760 2GB VRAM, 16GB of RAM, and an 2nd Gen Intel Xeon and it would lag like crap while building a coaster. October Beta Weekend 1 Review (11/2/2015):This is probalay the worst game that you would buy for $50. I feel like they are rushing to push this game out and they have over a month left to complete and polish it so it looks like $50 but not this piece of unstable crap. When I test ran my coasters that it will crash on random parts of the track. Yes, this game doesn't have any sense of physics what so ever. When I put tight banking that I get a message ""slope too steep"", this is the first RollerCoaster Tycoon games to not introduce grid building. The game will crash and freezes at times and I guess it has something to do with the camera modes.Well, I can't really expect or recommend this to be good just for the $60 I have spent (I have bought the Deluxe Edition) if there's any improvements. If this game came out this way then I will feel very turned down and regretting myself buying this game that won't work at it's price. If you want a good roller coaster management game then try to get either Parkitect if you like RCT 1 & 2 style or if you have the money then go and get Planet Coaster Early Bird or else wait. PROS:+No grids unlike the other RCT games.+Different size stalls+Curved Paths+A bit of good lightingCONS:-Poor phyisics on the guests, coasters, and flat rides.-Coaster builder can be very laggy.-Game will crash if your park is in heavy load or the game won't handle the graphics.-Limited music selection-The lack of objects to build buildings with scenery.-Coasters would fail if not built correctly.-Brakes can have a very strong force into them.-Terrible Graphics and Shadows			"

								This game is beyond awful. This game crushed my hopes and dreams for a theme park game with 'tycoon' in the name. Planet coaster is where i will be spending my future money. Tycoon World lied about the gameplay. Its not at all as intuitive as the trailers or gameplay had shown. I was roped into buying the deluxe edition which came with all prior tycoon games. I played the world beta. It was awful. Then played it again a few months later after it was delayed. I thought they would have fixed the issues such as pathing, placement and coasters always flying off the track (touchy little buggers). Nope! I attempted to get my money back but was denied since i played the old tycoon games more than 4 hours. What a rip off. I have no faith in Tycoon World or the developers. I feel cheated and lied to. Just awful.... so sad.			"

								Extremely disappointed in this game, but hoping it will improve by the time release date comes around. The rides and shops available are extremely limited compared to the older games--no transport rides like monorail, train, elevator etc as in Tycoon 1,2 and 3. Terrain editing is not as flexible as it used to be, either, and they've taken away the undo button which is also extremely annoying especially when it comes to terrain editing. Not as many different textures available for the terrain either. Don't waste your money with the early access, wait until the final game comes out if you are really feeling optimistic. Good thing I at least got it for less through an employer discount but still a waste of $20.			"

								After reading so many negative reviews I thought ""Stop your ♥♥♥♥♥ing, there must be something good about the game."" And there is. Building a coaster works great! The freeform mode enables you to go loose on your wildest imaginations. After building an awesome wooden coaster I was satisfied with, I thought it would be time to form the scenery. So after going to the scenery and clicking on a rock -Hey wait, where is my rock? Wait, is anything still happ- NO! game crashed because you clicked on a rock.Does a scenario like this bother you? No? Great!Do you like a very pixel-like ground to refreshen your nostalgic feelings of RCT 3? No? Perfect!You want to have a futuristic park where earth has been invaded by robots and have human-like robots in your park? Well, look no further. This game has it all!I'm sorry for being so sarcastic. Honestly, I went into the game with a positive vibe, but this game just is not going to do it for me. I'm also sorry for comparing the game to Planet Coaster, as everyone is doing, but once you play this game you know why everyone is falling back on planet coaster. The alpha already looks incredible and their scenery building options already surpass RCTW. Please, save your money. It IS a waste of money.			"

Planet Coaster is by FAR the better game.I purchased RCTW back in 2015, when it was going to be released in December.  I played the beta, and then I was sad.PC is better at the ""tycoon"" functions, its path building is WAY better, the graphics are better, performance is better, and peeps are better.About the only thing that RCTW has that PC doesn't is that the ability to purchase more land.I guess the most important thing for me is that RCTW feels like work, not play.  PC is fun, I want to play it.  I find myself dreading RCTW and looking forward to PC.  Because of that, I can't recommend RCTW.			"

								I'm another stubborn buyer. After seeing all negative reviews I still wanted to see myself. First 20 mins ""this isnt so bad"". 3 hours later after running 20fps on my 970/4.2ghz/32 ram I am frustrated. The coaster builder is beyond terrible, so frustrating trying to build anything. Good luck placing buildings down that connect to your paths. The most frustrating thing to me so far besides frame rate is building paths. Everything i do is invalid and you cant simply delete a path that i know about. You have to click bulldozer, click the path, click paths icon, click the path you want, then build again. Honest opinion from a franchise fan is it's a huge step back from RCT3. Looking to buy Planet Coaster.			"

												I bought this game over a year ago and remained optimistic throughout the beta and early access cycle. Even while the final version was downloading, I was hoping Atari would pull the rabbit out of the hat. That optimism was immediately shattered when I was greeted with a black screen on launch. Luckily I was able to find the problematic files and delete them. Yes my reason for this is mostly over that one bug, which apparently affects only people who installed the game while it was still in early access. But it's not the fact that the bug exists and prevented game play, but the handling of it by the Atari and Nvizzio. When I found out I was unable to play, I immediately took to the community page and found the post saying the release was out, accompanied with instructions on deleting a file if you have problems. That didn't work. Instead it took me deleting the entire folder. Then I watched as developers and producers spent the day telling people to delete files in hidden folders and edit the registry. These are things even Microsoft advises against, especially editing the registry.We are talking about a bug that could easily be remedied with a dozen lines or so of code and a hot fix. Instead the developers opted to have users jump through hoops, access parts of their system that shouldn't be accessed by the average user, and risk doing irreparable harm to their operating system. This is one of the biggest failures in not only public relations, but also custom service I have ever witnessed. I have been doing development for 30 years and the past 15 years has been as the owner of my own company. If I ever even dreamed of taking this approach to a failure on my part, I would expect to close the doors the next day, and rightfully so. The latest release in the series I have loved for years has been fatally plagued by this decision from the publisher and developers. I was hopeful for improvements and expansions to RCTW, but after the lack of response over yesterday's problems, it's painfully obvious that we most likely won't see these, when they won't even fix a bug that was known at release, and causing a PR nightmare. Shame on Atari and shame on Nvizzio.			"

								There's a lot of arguing going on right now, but the fact that almost every negative review has the words ""Planet Coaster"" in them is worrying. I'm going to try my absolute hardest to give a review on the game without resorting to comparisons. Any point of interest I place an asterisk (*) at the end of is possibly subject to change, and reflects the March 30th launch only.The good:Coaster builder - Very useful and well-made. The color safety guide is also very helpful for setting up your coaster in advance as well, so that you can know what does, and does not work.Area themes - Adds an interesting way for scenery variation to effect certain areas. Also contains variations of each building as well.Steamworks support - Modding adds unlimited potential in every game.Terrain editing - Excellent terrain manipulation tool. Not really much else to say without adding pointless padding.The okay:Paths - We finally have curved paths, along with several variations. Only problem is that it can occasionally get wonky with terrain collision, or pathing intersection. No curved queue lines, sadly.*Scenery selection - Decent amount of stock scenery with the base game, however certain themes such as Sci-Fi are lacking in options. Modding could fix.*Difficulty - This is bad for me, but some people prefer it easy. I'm a veteran of RCT and RCT2, so I prefer biting my nails when it comes to funding, however just building a small portion of the park, and working on a coaster can set you for a good while in terms of funds.The bad:Fences - Fences are badly implemented. Can only place them one at a time, and at angled intervals. Hopeful they will add line tools, or at least an option to place along paths.*Staff - Staff control is basically minimal at this point. Place the building down, select how many you want hired, and hope they do their job, let alone efficiently.*Performance - There are certain options to minimize graphical load in exchange for increased performance, however certain tools, will bring your frame rate to a crawl under certain circumstances. (EX: Path tool works fine unless it's clipped to an existing path, in which case my frame rate drops by at least half.)*Graphics - Not great, to say the least, but they could be much worse. I don't really come in to Unity games with high expectations, though.Overall, it's not as amazing as RCT1 and RCT2 obviously, but I do like it more than RCT3, which I never really transitioned into. On launch, it's a 6/10 for me. I'm curious to see where the future updates will bring this though, as I really do see potential.			"

												Grrr!! This game is so frustrating!I really wanted to look past all the negative publicity for this game, and give the devs the benefit of the doubt, but there are so many issues that I've noticed, and I've only been playing for about an hour? The controls for one thing are so unintuitive, and I've been trying to tweak them for the last 20 minutes. Who defaults ""Q"" for right and ""E"" for left rotate?!? And I tend to frequently change game speeds, so I always enjoy the 1,2,3 controls in most games, except this game that's not the case, and there is no way to assign keys to change from pause to speed 3. Instead, I keep having to tap on TAB. Not a huge issue, and I can look past that.Placing scenery now. It looked so simple in the trailer, but when I attempt to place scenery, it doesn't automatically lock onto the nearest snap location, and instead makes me scroll through degrees of angle and direction until it finally finds a snap spot. In cases that there are only two snap spots, why not just snap one or the other, why should I have to scroll through the rest when I can't place my items between anyways?When I attempt to place scenery, it always seems to be defaulted backwards, or upsidedown, so 9 times out of 10 I have to move it around until it faces me. Wouldn't it be simpler just to have scenery face me first, then let me move it around where I want?Unlocking scenery and rides now. Fine, it's the developers decision to lock everything up and force you to play through the scenarios, unless you play sandbox. But I want to build a park, and turn on research, like all the other RCT games before this one, but I don't see the research option on here at all. I enjoyed that aspect of the game, and having rides unlock as I'm playing just adds more fun to the game, in my opinion.Placing scenery and objects. I was trying to add objects to the path, and for some reason it picked up a peep and threw him in a deep ravine, so I went down looking for him, and did not find him anywhere. Did he fall through the ground? I was getting a warning message that an ""entity is under water"". So I tried to remove the water, and he was nowhere to be found. The warning went away though. Personally, the message could have said, ""Peep is under water"", or ""Help! Peep is Drowning!"" Something funny like that. I still can't explain how I was able to pick him up and throw him into the ravine while I was rotating an sign object that was clipping through the path, and looked awful... Unfortunately this appears to be an unfinished game, and for the price, I think it's too expensive right now. There would need to be a major overhaul of the entire game engine to make this game somewhat intuitive and user friendly, but at this time, it's just frustrating, and hard to have fun with it.So, at this time, I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.

												Epic fail. I was determined to play though this game despite the many, MANY game-breaking bugs. I had to replay many of the levels multiple times in order to fulfill the level requirements. Sometimes, an influencer would just never show up (you can't advance without influencers). Sometimes, an influencer WOULD show up and then just run around without fulfilling his mission. Occasionally, peeps would refuse to get on some of the rides (or all of them). Often, the game would require me to put down 4 hat shops or 2 family rides (just for example)  but would fail to recognize when I completed those requirements.Still, I persisted. For most of the game, I found ways around these inexcusable inconveniences. I had to play certain levels 3 or 4 times, but eventually, I figured out how to complete them despite all the bugs. Unfortunately, my luck ran out on the last 3 levels. 2 of the last 3 levels just would not let me complete some of the requirements no matter what I tried and no matter how many times I replayed them. The final level WOULD NOT LOAD. Like ever. I've never even seen the final level because the game crashes every time I try to load it. I spent many hundreds of hours playing RCT3, so I was determined to get through this game at all costs. Call me nostaligic. I was willing to overlook the game's many cosmetic issues and minor glitches. I was wiling to replay levels and to invent workarounds - something I shouldn't have to do (obvi). But even with all my stubborn determination, I was unable to complete THREE buggy levels. I've owned this game since alpha, and I've put off writing this review because I hoped against hope the developers would fix enough of the bugs to make this game playable. Unfortunately, that's not the case. This game is broken. Don't waste your money :(			"

								Ughhhhhh. I tried. I truly tried to like this game. It just isn't happening. The coaster designer is either really buggy or incredibly hard to figure out. The lack of content is appalling. Gone are the classic flat rides and thrill rides. No go karts. No log flume. No bumper cars. No mouse coaster. No transport rides. It is a glorified version of RCT 4 Mobile. It is useless to try to build a park because it lags even the best machines. The path system is rubbish. The free-form placement is not that at all. It a money grab. Do yourself a favor and go grab PLANET COASTER and Parkitect. Atari went all EA and murdered a classic game. It is heartbreaking. 2/10 don't click buy, it's a scam.			"

												The game was pretty good in Early Access. It improved with every update for a while. Then the update before the Full Release, it started crashing trying to load any park (saved or new). After the offical release I followed the recommended steps to avoid problems with switching from Early Access to the Full Release and it still crashs. I waited for the last update before writing a review and surprise it still crashs  trying to load a park. One small difference with the last update is opening in sandbox mode it loads the park for about 5 seconds before crashing. I even tried uninstalling the game twice and reinstalling but the game is unusable. But hey, the game menu that loads looks pretty good I guess.			"

								Some of the things that were super easy to do in RCT and RCT2 are so difficult to do now.  I don't like how you can't delete trees or scenery just by left clicking while building rides.  Also, trees and scenery aren't automatically deleted when placing track like it used too which makes it difficult to build.  When building roller coasters it will say invalid location and it isn't very clear why it is an invalid location.  Is it because it is too high?  Or are there trees/scenery in the way?  The bulldozer tool is also very hard to use.  It's hard to delete small objects.  I find myself clicking on items 10 times before it actually deletes.  This game honestly is a pain to play.  The new track building tools are cool but not very easy to use.  This game needs a lot of work.			"

								I really wanted to love this game, but it is really bad. The graphics are horrible, the gameplay is dumb, there are basic things that you can't do, like lowering the terrain or trying to build a ride if there is scenery on the way. I know it is an early access game but for the price and considering the amount of delays the game has had you can easily come to the conclussion that the game is far from done. I'm sad that the RollerCoaster franchise has  ended in a game like this. This is not what the developers promised so many months ago.			"

								Please save your money and buy RCT3, a much better game that has a lot better camera motions. While riding the sorry excuse for a coastercam, the camera jolts forward all of the sudden. The coasters themselves make no sense because when it says intensity Im not sure we have the same understanding for that. The amount of detail is amazing, infact you can zoom right in and see lots of little details about the peeps but thats the only good thing about the peeps. The peeps complain about EVERYTHING, I had ~50 peeps in my park with all wide paths and they complained it was crowded.Please keep in mind that this game is in fact /EARLY ACCESS/ but it's no good right now. I played about an hour and have now requested a refund because it's, in my opinion, not very good.If you are going against the 1,066 negative reveiws (as of April 4th 2016 at 8:25PM).. Make sure you have a VERY beefy computer. I'm above the minimal requirements at got ~20-15 FPSPlease developers work really hard, because what scared me was this game was almost the full release 5 months ago.			"

												I really wanted to like the game, but I just couldn't. From the framerate issues to lack of piece x piece content just irks me. I understand that the devs are trying to push User Generated Content, but it's a pain when there isn't much to offer in the form of stock content, combined with the fact hardly anyone actually plays the game let alone people creating said UGC. The minor tweaks they did to the ""peeps"" really did nothing and any other optimization went to pot. I ended up pre-ordering Planet Coaster and it's sad that even the alpha of that game offered more than this did. I just wished I could refund this game, but I didn't purchase this from steam directly. Note to Steam, keep the 2 week limit, but increase the time played limit for your refund policy for cluster**** games like this.			"

Early Access Review
								Very, very disappointing.  I have wasted my money!!!The developers have departed from the very successful player placing of ride entrance and exit in favour of the fixed variety which makes formal or neat park design virtually impossible.  Add to this the peculier pathing which forces odd angles on path junctions.  Every park will end up unplanned and  higgledy-piggledy. There seems to be no concession to disabled players with too many actions dependent on key pressing which many disabled gamers cannot do or can achieve with only great difficulty and in my case pain.  Shame when the older RCT games and so many other games allow for this.  (Just two examples of many:- The Sims or, for a real cheapy designed by a very small developer, ""Good Folk"".)  All or almost all actions should be available through use of the mouse as a secondary method of playing.Rotating of rides is unbelievably slow and cumbersome even for those with full use of their hands.  My son gave up in frustration within a few minutes of attempting to place rides.My advice to the developers is - Back to the drawing board.  Though, it will be a very long time before I consider buying any new versions of RCT.			"

								Here’s the thing. I paid full game money and got a pre-Alpha build. I expect more from Atari. This is why you see everyone everywhere saying not to pre-order games. Reminds me of when the new Sim City launched, now Maxis is dead. I get that we’re on the 3rd dev now but this is insane.Don’t buy this game. It is not worth $50.First off the graphics are sub-par, at best, and even on low settings the frame rate is awful. There are terrible issues with building scale, little food stands being as big as full rides for starters. There is barely enough content to make a themed section of a park.I basically used up all the rides in 2 zones. You get 9 zones. WTF am I supposed to do with the rest of the zones? Make my own coaster with 20 FPS and a terrible coaster builder? The coaster builder sucks. It is not intuitive. It doesn’t let you add special tracks easily; you can’t make the kind of coasters you want. I was trying to make a simple Six Flags Superman style ride. Can’t do it. RCT3 could do it. How does a full version of the game not have at the very bare minimum what the last version had? RCT3 came out in ’04 and you want me to believe you can’t have all that stuff added into a new game in ’16?!?! If they had just taken RCT3 and put it into a new engine so it looked better and ran smoother, I’d be more happy than I am with wasting the money I did on this garbage.Pathing is awful. There is a lot of really weird snapping and even using the grid it’s hard to make straight lines. Curved paths almost seem easier which doesn’t make sense.The delete tool is garbage, and… oh what’s that you want to play one of the scenarios? Cool. Have fun trying to place rides anywhere. If there are trees or tiny little bushes you can’t plop stuff down, you first have to use the god-awful delete or move tools to get rid of the plants. One by freaking one. You would think you could just right click and the game would know you want to delete that stupid bush but apparently that’s too much to ask for.The list goes on and on. You can’t get your staff to do what you’re paying them to do. There is literally no guidance for how to please people or how to keep them from puking after every damn ride. Even the giant slide. The economy is dumb.Don’t buy this game. Odds are Atari is going to pull the plug on it rather than give it dev time it needs. You would literally be better off taking $50 and and burning it for the few moments of heat it provided you. "

Early Access Review
								It has been some time since the release of RCTW Early Access and I feel the game has reached a level where a review is warranted. There have been many negative reviews, and I can see the frustrations that led many to leave such, but a lot of those seem to have dismissed the game after a few moments of play. Not giving the game a chance to show off its potential.And in Early Access, potential is what we want to consider, The foundation that RCTW has laid is such that it may very well grow into that potentail we can glimpse. Should UGC become full, and each day we see more pieces added, should Piece by Piece building with the UGC be solved, and each update we see that happening. Then the foundation could lead to overwhelming success.At present, for those who are creative, the park builders, I would say the game has enough that you can find many hours of contentment playing it. For those who are problem solvers and want to play scenarios, we are not quite there yet with needing AI to balance better, with the scenarios to be tweaked better. But for the $50 price, it is closer each to day to be the successor to RCT3. At present the trajectory that it is on, may never get us to being equal or better than RCT3. But perhaps one rung below it. Though should more coaster types, more rides, more more more be released, then it might even surpass RCT3 for at present the graphics are better. Should the gameplay expand, UGC be optimized and the others items that we can see the potential to better happen, then yes, we shall have a GAME!			"

Early Access Review
								In its current state RCTW is a complete flop - there I've said it. I am keeping in mind that this is an alpha, however; it is stil just as dissapointing to me. When you look at Roller Coaster Tycoon you recognize a franchise that is well known for being composed of quality games. Well I'm sad to say that after RCT4 - Mobile and the Alpha of RCTW that this may now be a false statement. As a lifelong fan of this game (I've been playing it since the original and since I was old enough to understand how to play video games) I am remaining cautiously optimistic about the future of this game, I see its potential and the ability of the community to greatly improve each other's experiences through the vast network of custom scenery objects now available on the Steam Workshop.In its current state I'd rate the game no higher than a 5/10 and here's why:- The coaster builder is VERY clunky, occasionally it becomes impossible to continue building as you need to use the presets to place a piece before you can freeform it. This causes issues when your piece wants to dive underground, yet you wish to freeform it and keep it above ground.- Staff buildings, now some will say this really isn't an issue (and I agree to an extent) however, by making staff members simply components of the building we place we lose our abilities to both customize them and set specific routes for them, two things that were nice about RCTW's predecessors. I do like the idea of the staff buildings and it adds a little more realism, however; for it to work for me the same level of customizability present in its predecessors must also be available.- FPS drops, now I have a top of the line computer (one capable of running Fallout 4 on near maximum graphics settings) so running RCTW shouldn't be a problem for my computer AT ALL. Unfortunately the reality is that I'm plagued by random FPS drops and ""input lag"" at least 70% of the time I spend on this game. The worst part is that it happens in almost entirely empty parks - Atari you really need to work on this.- Lack of flat rides, I understand that this is an Early Release (alpha if you will) however it would be nice to have some more generic flat rides that aren't soo heavily themed. Perhaps an option to toggle what the ride's theme is? I'm not sure if anything will be done about this but if you're going for one specific theme your options are quite limited.- Scenery placement, all of the previous games had this issue as well. Planet Coaster is the only one I've seen that has done this right soo far. I'd love to see scenery that we can place anywhere so that we can properly theme rides/areas. What is the point of having a giant tree with a hole that looks as though you could run something through it if you can't put anything through it?- Lastly I'd like to say that I feel this game should be MUCH farther along than it currently is. No I do not know anything about video game developement and yes I know there were three developers working on this game. Nvizzio, if you're reading this please take what I've said and will continue to say as constructive criticism. I love the RCT series and I want to see this become a AAA title, but right now I see a game that is waiting to die upon release. RCTW was originally announced to release in Early 2015, it is now Early 2016, and we only have an Early Access. Slow and steady wins the race and making a quality project is 100% always better than rushing out unfinished garbage, however; I feel a year of delays for this game is enough. Nvizzio, Atari, this is crunch time. The community will not continue to stand for delays, you're already losing your fanbase to Planet Coaster. I'm not saying rush a finished project, I'm saying make sure you do this right in a timely fashion. The fan uproar that you see now and the fanbase's lack of faith in you is only the beginning if you really mess this one up.To conclude I would not recommend this game to anyone, not until some serious work is done. I will continue to mess around with it but I really doubt I will play this anywhere close to as much as I played the past three. If you want your money's worth now I'd buy Planet Coaster or Parkitect. Although honestly who knows, I have faith in the team at Nvizzio that they truely want to deliver a AAA title for us fans and I'm willing to ride the storm out and see where they take us.			"

												In short... A dissapointing let down and waste of money.I bought this game knowing that it was early access, but liked their vision for the game, enjoyed their previous RCT games and wanted to support them. I installed the game, played it for a little while and decided that it wasnt at a good enough stage yet, but left it like that, 3 months later, i did the same again... 4/5 times later i could see lots of room for improvement, especially alongside Planet Coaster.Then it happened... Planet coaster was coming close to it's release date, and the RCT:W devs had a panic... they'd spent so much time and money developing yet another game was coming that did it better. They had a decision to make, should they take their time, learn from others and fix their game? or should they do everything they can to rush an unfinished product to market in a bid to steal peoples money? Yep, you guessed it! they announced a release date a week prior to that of Planet coaster, and charged slightly less for the game.Having had the game in my library for so long with 8 hours played, im not entitled to a refund... Leaving me rather annoyed that my money has been stolen and my good will has been taken advantage of.I should have seen it coming really, they pretty much pulled the same move with TDU2. (Hype it up, release utter drivel, not give a crap)The only plus side is that they are trying to continue on with this title, so it could suddenly become a great game... and i could win the lottery.

												I bought this game 1st day of early access release. I purchased under the impression it would be several months while the developers released features and fixed bugs. During the almost 8 month wait, I believe 2 flat rides were released, and a few pieces of scenery. PxP was a huge step in the right direction & UGC is a fantastic feature. However 90% of the releases were bug fixes & updates.  I held my breath for the final release, but only to learn that they were releasing it a day earlier than Planet Coaster. Finally realease day, the game will no longer take 10 minutes to load a sandbox map!  I'm gonna be so excited for all the new rides and scenery & shops!!!........ But it was the exact same content as the early access, just the story mode changed. I dont care about story mode. I want a huge selection of flat rides, water rides, transport rides. It has none of that. Unless this game comes out with a release with a crapload of new rides and shops, I can't recommend it. The only thing this game has going for it is the UGC. I'm sorry, but Planet Coaster is what this game was supposed to be.  "

												Yeah, I dunno... It stood between Planet Coaster or this one and I wanted to give the original a try, despite all bad reviews. I wanted to make my own opinion, hoping this game would bring more original RCT-feels and nostalgia, however it does not. It just feels wrong all from the start. I tried it once or twice, not even immersing myself into the game fully because I completely lost interest. The game lacks soul. It stirs so far from the original series in a way I can't even comprehend. To me, it looked like Planet Coaster was ""too modern"" and complex in its design to bring that same feel, and I for some reason liked this game's graphics better? Now I can clearly see I made a mistake and it is the other way around. If you are like me, then remember the bad reviews are there for a reason, and not just because of some silly bugs (which, according to comments, are completely gamebreaking, however I did not play enough to see any bugs - I just didn't like the game enough on its own account).

								I cannot recommend this in its current state, and I fear I will never be able to recommend this. If you haven't bought this - don't until it gets better. Even though the game makers have said multiple times on the internet they are authorizing refunds throughout all of the Early Access period on Steam for people who preordered if they don't like the game, Steam Support is going to be nothing but unsupportive of you if you try to take advantage of this offer.On the game itself, the graphics are subpar, and honestly I would say they're on the level of RCT3. The coaster builder is everything but intuitive and easy, as you have to repeatedly try to make it work, lift hills are not automatic, there are endless ""special"" pieces that are only special in how massive and hard to make fit they are, etc. The paths are unuseable most times as they will not even connect where you want them to. I could go on but most other reviews do.Bottom line, only buy this game right now if you want to throw away $60.			"

												Bad game. Dont buy. This one not even was at gamescom.... Do yourself a favor, buy parkitect and planet coaster instead....## updated 2016/11/16Game is now ""full"" released and it is SAME CRAP!Worst Dev's EVER! Even worst than No Mans Sky or Cities XXL!!They don't listen to gamers communityThey dont accept negative criticsThey  ban for stating our opinionThey ban for criticizing the gameThe release of RCTW is same thing as EA no improvements no nothing!Bad graphics, bad support, bad updates, bad marketing, bad trailers, bad release.Go and get Planet Coaster instead or Parkitect - even this one, is loads of times better than RCTW.## UPDATED 2016/08/31 ##Tested latest pxp update, same crap.1200 peeps and the game still becomes unplayable and then crash consuming almost all memory in the system.Also Pxp is the crappy copy of the one in Planet Coaster.They even added the same stores style as planet coaster to build the custom shops / building.Also they have reserved a slot on track station exactly the same (at least the faded screenshot) as Planet Coaster.Again, DO NOT BUY THIS!! ALSO THE GRAPHICS = AAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!! MY PRECIOUS DISK SPACE!DELETED FROM COMPUTER ONCE AGAIN!! ## UPDATED 2016/08/27 ##Transcript of a comment i made on this review to @Scoot_in_FL:All those who bought the early bird edition (alpha/beta access) of Planet Coaster, received 3 updates on alpha 2 (2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 and 2.3) and along with all these 3 updates, new content, many stuff players were asking, and many fixes those players were reporting..all this on all the updates!Right now, we have the Alpha 3 (Planet Coaster), which has everything the RCTW, less memory leaks, 95% Stable, 99% Smooth plus tonns of many stuff!! On the first day of alpha 3 on steam, with workshop content semi-properly (but well) implemented, received the first hot-fix update!BEFORE the beta, Alpha 3 will receive more updates, more fixes, more hotfixes and possibily more content.On the betas the same, and finally on the Final Release Even more content that weren't presented to us on Alpha's!!! So yeah, withing 3 months you just received new content, new fixes, new updates, and many new stuff!!  "

Early Access Review
								As so many of my fellow millenials, I grew up with RCT in the late 90's and early 2000's. It is a great franchise and still loads of fun. All of you may know that the fourth installation in the series was avidly awaited by many a fan. After a troublesome development history, yesterday the game came out in early access. It is facing stiff competition from Planet Coaster and Parkitecht, so comparisons between the two are inevitable. Nevertheless, in the promo-video's, dev-diaries, etc, the devs vowed to come with something worthwhile.So what came of it? To put it bluntly: An unfinished, unpolished alpha-build that is rife with bugs. The potential is there, especially in the coaster builder, but the detail, the path-tool, the management-aspect, the graphics  and the camera-handling are far below par. It is essential that this is going to be adressed in the near future. The communication by the devs towards the coaster-community is in this regard not very encouraging. I think it is only fair that the devs have to come with an open and honest statement about the development stage and a feasible time schedule which lays out at what times what issues will be fixed and what kind of content will be added. RCT world has potential. If they get the coaster tool working in a proper way, it even has the potential to outshine Planet coaster in at least one regard. But so far, this product is not ready for sale and an embarrasment for the franchise. Let's hope that the devs will quickly do what needs to be done. Come clean to the fanbase and coaster community. Only then can they regain some credibility....			"

												I have been playing this game since day 1, and I put a lot of hopes into this one, as all of the game series is great.For a long time I even had this comment on positive - but today i have to change this. I am running this game on a brand new overclocked GTX1080. And still it lags. I guess that is all i have to say about the games performance. It fills up 8GB of VRAM, GPU Clock rises to ~2000Mhz and it still doesn't keep 60FPS in all game situations, especially with a lot of peeps in the park.Gameplay is...well it's okay. Not a lot of rides to chose from, but the community created decorations are cool. It would be an average game - but the weak performance destroyes everything.			"

Early Access Review
								I have played all of the RCT Series, I enjoyed them all but I like RCT 1 our of the lot the best.RCTW for me is quite a disappointment from a technical stand point.Firstly the graphics are weak, Let down by poor quality textures, The world feels like it has no charm as the world lighting appears washed out.Building experience is more prefabricated than the original, You can't choose where to place entrances and exits but at least you can free rotate to any angle.Building paths is clunky and has annoying link snap points, its not true free form construction. I have not found it possible to place shops how I want at path edges and construct a plaza style area, they have to have short paths leading to them.While you can do curved paths, You annoyingly can't do curved queue's????...The coaster spline tool is quite good, However the tools feeding back Intensity, Nausea and Excitement data are very frustrating to work with. You have to open the ride and let it run to get the info, then close it again and make your adjustments rather than being able to get the data from a test run...Overall there a quite a few minor annoyances with this game that are just about enough to ruin the experience.

												For the love of all that is living please do your research on the other games in this genre that are being released. This game is an perfect example of a company that uses a well known name as a money grab. This game is NOT the successor to the old roller coaster tycoon games. If you're looking for the successor, check out parkitect or planet coaster depending on if you prefer rct2 or rct3 styled gameplay. The quality of the content in the game is horrendous. Core gamplay is broken such as the path system, terrain editing, and the peeps. The game is full of bugs and people working on the game fail to acknowledge the problems with this game let alone listen to their customers. This game is also terribly overpriced and is being marketed as a AAA game even though I've played much better indie games. Do not be fooled into buying this game and please do your research before deciding on this game. The steam reviews and Atari's lack of communicating with the community should speak for itself.Tldr: This game is very poorly made and is being falsely advertised as a good game. Do your research before buying this game.			"

								So far, the game feels incomplete. You can sense the power of the spline coaster-building system, but there are PLENTY of fixes that need done before this can be recommended.PEEP AI is horrible, as is their animation. They all seem like zombies. No animation. No character. PEEP thoughts does not seem to work.Should be able to hover over attraction and get information (i.e. number on ride; number in queue; wait time.)Should be able to right-click to remove an object when in build mode.Janitors and Mechanics seem brain dead. They walk past trash; they don't fix rides. Perhaps patrolling zones needs to return.All-in-all, having fun playing game with my 6-year-old son, but I think the game is far from complete. He thinks it's great and I guess that's all that counts.			"

												I would love to say that this is a brilliant sequel to the RCT franchise however I am left with only disappointment. It doesn't feel like a RCT game. It seems like this game has been built from scratch by people who haven't even played the previous RCT games. It's very clunky, load times are horrific, the peeps look and walk like they are half dead, all rides look like fair ground rides - not theme park rides, it's very awkward placing items and feels restrictive, buildings seem to large and generic looking, the Emojis above peeps are just awful and the game lacks loads of content for instance dark rides, water rides, track rides and other basic thrill rides. It feels like this game is half finished. It's most definitely not at a stage where it should be released. It's such a shame.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the first review I have ever written. I am writing this while my refund is pending. RCTW has great potential to be an amazing game. After playing for a few hours and watching streams and such for a few hours, I can not recommend this game in it's current form. I have hope that the developer will turn this around. After watching the latest stream they did, i can see why RCTW is not a success. They have forgotten what it is about. They have forgotten what makes the RCT series great. They have forgotten it is about the roller coasters! After seeing some of the pre-built roller coasters that are available, I wonder if any of them have ever rode one. There were a few things that made me consider opting for the refund, and one thing in particular that lauched me out of the station. First, i tried to build a pretty common element on looping steel rollercoasters called a cobra roll. It is impossible. Well... i cant say impossible. If i wanted to spend hours trying to get it to work i probably could have made it work, but lets get real. Who wants to spend that amount of time on one element. Since the beginning of RCT time, you were able to build  a half loop into a left or right half corkscrew, then into the opposing corkscrew piece, and finally finish of with you second half loop. Now when i tried with the current iteration in the series, i did my half loop, then into a half cor... nope... no half corkscrew piece. Instead there were multiple corkscrews, and not even in the right direction. It was going up into the air, opposite direction and behind the half loop. Now you can do alot with RCTW's spline based coaster builder, but that was just rediculous. I ended up just doing a large loop and making a few other spaced out elements before returning the track to the station. The coaster ended up being well recieved by my parks patrons, but I was about to call my doctor to schedule chemo. So a couple of days later I had an idea. Im going to try to build one of my favorite roller coasters, Kennywood's Thunderbolt. How i have built recreations in the past, especially Kennywood coasters, is to build them on flat ground then save the blueprint. Then, dig a  hole in the ground since all of their coasters are hugging ravines. So as I finished and tested Thunderbolt-ish, i was getting excited to save and put my coaster in its final resting place. Instead i think i may have found RCTW's final resting place. When i was trying to lower i found that you simply cannot do that.it would not even go down till the bottom most piece of track was touching the ground. What the $@*&?!?! I was dumbfounded. I had no solution. Since i was already frustrated from trying to make the rollercoaster in the first place and just wanted to be done, i decided to just raise the terrain and say the heck with it. Cant do that either... all of the land where there were only supports would not level out with the rest. So i had holes in the ground everywhere there were supports. The list of obsenities that proceded from my mouth were many. So that was pretty much strike two. So a couple days later, I read that they are launching the game. I also read that there would be a live stream. I missed the live part, but did watch it a few days later. Nothing new. Same crap different version. They showed off that the peeps aren't skating across the ground anymore, the new ""campaign mode"", and more PxP. What the heck is PxP? Oh, that is the scenery. I swear if i hear them say peice by peice one more time imma kms. Like this is ROLLERCOASTER Tycoon... not Scenery Tycoon. So much emphasis has been placed on scenery while the fuctionality of simple things like rollercoasters and paths are put on the back burner. While watching the stream, seeing that woman force Daisy out, I said to myself, ""Yup... I'm done.""			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start off by saying.. If you want to play the TRUE sequel of RCT3, buy Planet Coaster (Early Bird Alpha Edition). This is just ANOTHER ""Park Construction and Management Sim"" that got called RCTW. I'm not going to point out the reasons, if you don't believe me, patch your eye for 2 hours and try both games.Straight to the point..The Track Editor works well, with less than 5 minutes toying around you will be able to create smooth, visualy fluid and funny rides.No Transport Rides, no Mini Golf.. among others.There are some restrictions while placing scenary objects that sometimes can be a bit anoying.It is possible to make curved paths, to do them visualy pleasant is not that easy.Terraforming works like a charm.Textures are not impresive for a 2016 game.Peeps are not same we used to see in RCT3 which is the most iconic part of the game.As expected in Early Access, you will get some lag, random freeze.There is a lot of work to be done and i hope the game improves over time but for now is not possible to enjoy it.My advice: If you are a diehard RCT fan, please do you a favor and get Planet Coaster. If you just like Park Sims in general, you can also buy this one.. and cheaper than 50$.                    -------------------- EDIT 04/09/2016 ---------------------I'm going to follow the changes coming to the game until it's officially released, I'll change my review based on the final product.

												Do not waste your money..I was the first on the band wagon. The frist day it was available I purchased this game over 8 month before the pre release....i kept following waiting for the game to be released as optimistic as possilble. I absolutely love the other RCT games 1,2 & yes even 3. But this game is a total disaster. It takes way to much effort to build anything in this game. The previous games were set up for you to build, manage, and watch your park grow. If you want build something here is the scenario...First you find where you want to position your item holding shift and scrolline your mouse to rotate the item (very time consuming)...then back out and go to destruction mode and delete trees....if the trees are in a field then you can use the mass delete. But if they are close to a path you must individaully click on each item(I scream everytime). Then go back to the buidling menu find your item again....reposition it where is was originally place the item. Then go to build a path....because its not grid based building paths are an extreme pain (not exagerating). I really want to know the thought process given to changing the way paths are built, it is because of this that I have hated this game from day 1.... It is just way to challenging to waste buildin paths. I did not purchase a $60 game to struggle with building sidewalks all day and yet that what I have done in this game.Next major issue is moving around in the game you must use w,q,e,s,d,z,x, to move in the game. or take you hand off the mouse and use the keyboard arrows. in order to change your angle holding control and moving the mouse. All this is way to time wasting. in previous editions a simple right click and moving mouse worked perfectly and would do the same here but this game is not about simplicity. I promise you that.The final straw for me...Today I clicked on a janitor to follow him around for a few seconds...but then couldn't stop following him....no matter what button I clicked or key I pressed I was locked into following the janitor. i had to save and quit the game then relaunch the game to go back and continue playing. This shows that after 3 years of building a game there are still major flaws that just make the game suck! Not to mention that after 3 years I still don't have a full game.....RCT World took the fun out of managing a theme park and instead just gives you something to struggle and get frustrated with. Nothing in this game is simple. Everything is very complex confusing and boring... Sorry RCT i will continue to play previous RCT games but this one is out. You failed majorly.			"

												Full disclosure, I will keep playing this game even after writing this horrible review. I promise to update it if I change my  mind on anything.I'm not looking for major innovation in this series addition. I liked these games a lot. So I bought it despite the poor reviews. Also was hoping the bugs had been fixed. This is HARDLY playable. There are early access games I have that have way less issues. Frequent crashing issues and no auto-save options (that I can find.... speaking of that the UI is horrible and not intuitive at all for an experience player of the original and an experienced player of current simliar style of game). The settings don't even appear to work... changing 'camera rotation speed' didn't seem to adjust anything. I tried turning down graphics settings to hopefully avoid the major graphic freak-outs that kept happening. Didn't help. Forcing the tutorial is a MISTAKE. Three missions in and I'm still on tutorial? If it's this long let me skip it. I'll come back if I get frustrated or confused. OR USE GOOGLE.Also important to note: I bought the DELUXE edition. Say what?			"

Only ONE OTHER GAME stinks as bad IF NOT WORSE, No Man's Sky.I was a huge fan of NMS, it was just ALL HYPE, much like this game... The entire game just doesn't work as nicely as Planet Coaster... The Peeps in RCTW look constipated 24/7 I really honestly cannot recommend this GARBAGE to anyone, I've spent a better part of a year playing the early builds of Planet Coaster, even then it was LIGHTYEARS ahead... So either get PC or Parkitect... but DO NOT GET THIS GAME.... It's a Waste of money... The RCT brand has been tarnished forever... Thankfully Frontier Games made P.C.. The TRUE successor to RCT 3 & Theme Park (by BULLFROG) RCTW is more of a TABLET/mobile device game than a Computer game... it just feels CHEAP.			"

												--- DO NOT BUY ---From the earliest chance to play pre-release versions of both, RCTW looked worse than Planet Coaster by far. I did buy both though. Since Planet Coaster Alpha 3, I haven't touched RCTW except to see if they somehow fixed it yet (spoiler: yeah right)They really haven't fixed anything as far as i'm concerned - the peeps still look like they are supposed to be realistic, but instead land firmly in ""I asked a programming class to make animations of peeps, that should work, right?"". They glide along when you're zoomed out. They skip and run in unrealistic ways. There are not a lot of unique peeps, so they all look alike.The controls are unintuitive. The main menu screen is just ugly.I really don't have anything positive to say about RCTW.Buy Planet Coaster. It costs the same, and it's not only better - it's actually really a good game.Once again, ---DO NOT BUY RCTW---			"

								This game is HORRIBLE. Please, please believe me, don't buy this piece of rubbish. Gameplay is clunky, controls are unintuitive, coaster builder is a disaster. Graphics don't usually bother me but this looks like it was made as a my first Unity project by a ten year old with a potato and a glue gun.Honestly, it's awful, I'm in the process of trying to get a refund as I write this review.

								A lot of people have issues with details such as park management, mediocre graphics, horrible staff and peep AI, etc.I fully agree with these, but was able to look past this. For me, making free-form coasters was the absolute dream. I'm a bit of a coaster freak, and I finally had a chance to rebuild my favorite coasters around he world in my parks. I could not have been more hopeful, and after hours and hours of figuring out the finicky coaster building tool, I finally created an exact replica of El Toro at Six Flags. So when it had an intensity rating of 21.7, ultra-extreme, and no peeps would ride it, I was understandably disappointed. My next few attempts produced similar results, though they were all exact replicas or closely based off of many of the prominent coasters in the world today. To put hours into this difficult process only to have the majority of my peeps not ride it and a massive pile of vomit in my exits is, well, not good.Fine, gameplay mechanics be damned, I would do what I could do build an aethetically pleasing park incorporating realistic roller coasters. I put even more hours and hours into this process, only to have both the parks I built crash the game before being able to load. All of my time lost.Update after update promising updated coaster mechanics and improved realism and all we get is this bull. I wish I hadn't played this so much already so I could get my money back. A decade-long disappointment.			"

Early Access Review
								I had high hopes for this game and waited a very long time to experience another rollercoaster tycoon game due to me being a big fan of the origional 3. Once beta of this game came out and all the negative publicity started, I thought for sure the developer would truly start caring about how to fix it and make it all that it could possibly be, especially with fierce competition from planet coaster (which I bought beta access for at the same time as buying RCT world). After playing both I was truly amazed at the level of complexity planet coaster gave it's peeps and the level of detail involved in the game even at such an early stage of developement. I unfortunately was not impressed with RCT world, I wanted to like it soo bad, I wanted to ignore the negative publicity it was getting and keep an open mind and stay positive about how this game could one day be truly amazing, but after the negative beta release which I figured would tighten up their boot straps, The game just doesn't deliver, especially at the cost their asking. I found pathways to be incredibly difficult to place, especially at the entrance of the park where nothing seems to connect, or connect straight for that matter. Also peeps look very bland, If you compare it to PC, its a no brainer, there was no time or thought put into peep movement, intelligence, or even just simple gestures. I found rollercoaster building to be fun and intuitive but when you finally finish the coaster and ride it, it studders and shakes on the track which gets annoying, which was also mentioned in a recent review video. The graphics seem so outdated and bland and when you zoom out the peeps skip frames as they walk and it looks terrible, BTW the graphics were cranked to max and i run dual R9 390x video cards in crossfire. The game may one day be extemely fun to play and easy to use, which i truly hope it is because I will definitely buy it again (I refunded it), but at this stage it is not worth the price tag and it seems the developer has not improved much since beta, so it's difficult to see this game improving from it's early access state, i truly hope I am wrong though. I would not recommend this game at this stage especially with planet coaster right around the corner and looking very promising, so far iv had nothing but fun with that game.			"

								I've been playing tycoon games, Sim games, pretty much any sandbox sim game I can get my hands on, keep that in mind as I rip into this game. I really wanted to like this game, because the orginal was fantastic, but I can't bring myself to give this game a thumbs up. I won't bother going into too much detail because there are plenty of people who have. The game is plauged with leaks, bugs and glitches and to make things worse the devs. push the blame off on to the player, as if it's our system and not their poor excuse for a tycoon game. It's not just that though, I have a top shelf graphics card and the game looks terrible, when you zoom out you can really tell how much time they DIDN'T take on the game. The ""peeps"" all have block heads and are emotionless, they move like a robot from the 1950's and noone travels the park in a group. building paths is a pain, getting paths to connect to rides or other paths (which is a huge part of the game) is next to impossible. The scenery looks like junk, flat flowers, no variety, lifeless tress, meaning they don't sway, no leafs blowing, nothing. the lack of detail is littered through out the game, from the peeps to the scenery, even the daylight/nighttime cycles look like they were made on a platform from 98'. I cannot stress how bad this game is, just because it's still in beta dosen't mean "" oh there might still be hope"" because this game is a disaster, so abandon all hope . This company and it's affilates will most likly take the money they've made off us suckers and walk. The devs are a trip and will give you a to do list in order to give you information that will be of no use, it's almost like they have no clue what they're doing and can't adress anything inparticular so they just flood you with a list of possible soultions to THEIR broken game, which in the end , like I said, will be of no use. Almost like they just have a copy and paste response, which I know what you're thinking"" of course"" but it's really bad, like toddlers made a game on dad's computer bad. This game has no bussiness even being for sale, making it free to play wouldn't help, the game in one word , SUCKS. I could go on to about the lack of effort, detail, time and money that went into this game but I think you get the point. I regret not reading the reveiws on this one but I suggest you keep reading them, you'll see my story matches up to almost everyone else. Save your money, this isn't the late and great rollercoaster tycoon game you kneww and loved, this is a cheap rip off and if I could I would give it 2 thumbs down.			"

								I'm going to keep this relatively brief - we've waited a LONG time for this game. The beta proved to be less than promising, but I stuck with it, with community and development managers assuring us the game was shaping up and nearly ready for release. For this to be cited as a 80% complete is insulting. The only correlation between this and RCT3 is the change of numbers - it's nowhere near on the same par with regards to content, graphics (for the time of release!), and playability. I'd recommend Googling some of the play throughs before making a purchase. Unless of course... you're into this kind of thing! Save yourself some money!!			"

								Never will i buy a game from Atari anymore. This is bull****!! People please read...The frames drop even harder than a bowling bawl tossed out of a window!! Not even a steady 30FPS on medium graphics. And that with a i7-3770K 16GB Memmory, 256GB SSD and a AMD Radeon R9 290X graphics card. Then they tried to make the visitors smarter by making their own choices and going directly to the thing they need. So if they are hungry, they would go to a stand for food. If they needed to go to the toilet, they would go to the toilet. Well i think that the one who wrote this system for RCT World was a very very drunk man. The system fails in every way. Even the waiting lines are bugged. People tend to stay halfway the waiting line and dont walk on.Then the coaster building... Luckily they kept some off the old handelings because building with the mouse is not done! And here is the way you build a couster who is actually fun to ride:* Build a coaster* Destroy the coaster * Go on the ferris wheelAnd then, omg are the rides made of plastic? Every ride i build got broken within a few minutes real time. I allmost got up to 30 mechanics for 20 rides and still they got broken and could not be fixxed fast.This is my first time writing a review. Most of the time i think the people will get it if a game is bad or even worse. But such a big name as RCT... What a fail... If you want to spend money on a park building game, go to Planet Coaster. It costs a little more to help the developers ( like € 64,95 ), but than you have a great park building game with great looking graphics and a really good engine.			"

								Loving the RCT Franchise I have tried to give this game a fighting chance so here we go...The game itself feels very Amateur-like. The colors are all off. I boosted the gfx up with a quard core, 16gb ram and gtx 1070, still feels like I bought this game from 2004. There is alot of lag I began to add more features in the park.Audio is horrible and average at most.The animations of the peeps are just awful.. complete garbage. It looks as if a 12 year old learning 3D Studio max made all the peep animations. Its just terrible. This right here practically does it for me because the whole purpose of this game is to make rides and attractions based around these peeps...Knowing the Frontier made RCT3 and did a great job with it even though it was a bit caroon-ish.. I  would say to stick with the company that knows how to make theme park based simulation games. This new developer is definately trying, i'll give them that but they are way out of their league. Not sure anyone will read this but if you do, go on youtube and watch gameplay from this game (RCTW) and Planet Coaster (made by frontier).. You decided which is better which should be completely obvious..Don't waste your money on this game, it is NOT worth $60.. At most its worth maybe $5Conclusion:GFX = 2004 based (garbage)Audio = AverageAnimations = PoorBugs = LOTSGameplay = Average (boring)Go buy PLANET COASTER			"

								Well they pushed the release date back about 4 times before we got the general Q1 2016 release date, which i thought for sure was them trying to hide that they had killed the game in production. I played the game during the first Beta weekend and it looks like they just added in the peep textures, a couple flat rides, and just released it again. There is a metric ton of stuff missing, and menus and buttons are still in weird places, And seeing as this was going to originally release in December 2015 this is unexceptionable. I mean fence builder was the biggest complaint from the First public beta and guess what...There is still no sign of it in the game other then on a to-do list on their website somewhere. This is still a beta build, but for how long they have pushed this game back you think there would be more than 10 coaster types or even building for that matter.I think they tried to get the jump on the market by trying to release the game a year early. Even if you ignore how ridiculously bugging it is then its still missing content. Stock RCT3 Had more content at launch then this game does 4 months after it original launch date and multiple betas. Most of these complaints are about the studio behind this game and how poor their development cycle is if this is all they have to show for multiple missed release dates and multiple open closed betas.

Early Access Review
								I must admit that, in general, I am disappointed with the game so far. I understand it is still in Early Access and I'll still give it a chance to fix its problems until the full release, but it is definitely not what I was expecting given that I've been playing Roller Coaster Tycoon games ever since the original in the 1990s. Still, I'll try to list my impressions about the game as unbiasedly as humanly possible.I really like the interface. It's simple, it's clean, it's modern and it's elegant. It's refreshing to see a modern take on an interface when, even today, most games still go with tacky and bulky interface designs. Pathing needs a lot of work and I'm finding it really hard to get my paths to be how they I want them to be. It's pretty hard to get nice, snaking queues, for instance. The graphics are okay. Not great, but not horrible. But then again, I think graphics are the least important thing in a game. While in some cases quirky graphics may contribute to ambiance, in most games graphics just don't matter and RCT games are games where it doesn't matter, imo. I actually really like the coaster editor. It's a pretty powerful tool once you get used to it. Staff control is very basic at this point and could use improvement. I'm not the best guy to really assess performance as my computer is already somewhat outdated at this point in time, but I feel it could be better. Considering I can play XCOM 2 with acceptable framerates in a medium graphics setting, I was expecting to run RCTW more smoothly than I do. In particular, loading times seem to be particularly slow on my machine and I've had a few crashes when loading Scenarios.To sum it up, in its current state, RCTW still has a lot of issues. It has good points and bad points and, while I am willing to wait and see if the issues will be fixed in future versions of the game, I can't really recommend it in its current state.			"

Shameless. The game's technical problems far outweigh it's content, I'm aware it is ""Early Access"" but it's really ridiculous considering this was already delayed, what? Two times now?The mechanics never seem to actually even do anything, the rides constantly break down despite best efforts, the peeps apparently can never find restrooms despite the numorous amounts sprinkled around the tiny park.I would like to recommend it, it does have it's moments but it's current state is abysmal.

								I cannot recommend this game in its current state, it's an enjoyable game while it works despite the issues some people have raised about not being able to place paths squarely on the grid etc. As well as bad graphics and some of the more humorous visual bugs I have encountered like one of my park visitors getting stuck underground after riding the slide - I can look past these things.Some of the issues I have encountered however are just completely game breaking, for example; After building my first coaster and testing it, I opened it up for the peeps, they began to queue but nobody was getting on the ride, I tried closing it down and opening it again to see if that helped and while at first it seemed to, once the first load of peeps had finished riding it, they refused to get off. I then tried to edit the coaster to see if i could spot any obvious issues that might be causing this which turned out to be a bad idea because after doing so EVERYBODY in my park started glitching out on the spot and couldn't move.I appreciate that it is an early access game and I will look into posting the bugs I have encountered but really for £29.99 the game should at least be in a playable state.

								I was really excited for this game to launch, it was actually really big disappointment. The graphics look horrid and so do the maps, the grass and trees look neon green and ugly/unrealistic.  This is also very laggy on my 3.5 ghz computer. I was all hyped for this, but it made me like Roller Coaster Tycoon 2/3 better. Seems like very little effort has been part into this game even though the game has been delayed a long time.			"

								As a die hard fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series I was extremely excited to try out the latest installment in the series. I avoided the reviews and Lets Plays on youtube purposely so that I could judge the game by its merits alone. That being said, there is unfortunately a lot wrong with the game. The path system is a disaster and half the time it refuses to let me place paths in places that are unobstructed. The peeps are completely lifeless while they are on rides and you can watch them cycle through various terrifying facial expressions while remaining dead silent the entire time. (Its honestly only a bad soundtrack away from being a horror movie.) Perhaps this is just a glitch on my end, but half the time buildings and rides don't actually show you whether or not they are closed which led me to accidentally forget to open half the stuff in my park. (Oops!) I also noticed that the days seemed... Shorter? Like, almost ridiculously short. I feel like they could be slightly longer. In order to see my park at night I have to lock the time set to night time or else you'd miss it if you looked away for two seconds. There are so many little things that could be fine tuned, that would make this such a great game. I want to like this game so bad because a huge chunk of my childhood was spent playing both RCT2 and RCT3. RCTW is just not holding up compared to even RCT3. I'm hoping the developers really are serious about improving the game because it has so much potential. Until then, I cannot recommend it.			"

												Well, this game is awesome at first but then after you play it and your park grows, it just slows down and more uptil it started to froze in the midsit of expanding my park which lost my progress. I was pretty upset after this.I really hope they'll improve the performance of the game as well, espically on a high end computer, it still lags or frezzes, espcailly other reviews that have mentioned this, yes it's true.The developers needs to focus on the performance of this game if your going to demostrate a great franishce. Gee, why is some franchises gets bad and even worst in this age.Well, I'll head back to RCT Classic!			"

												I want to get a time machine so I can go back in time and slap myself for buying this. This game is bland. There is no fun to be had. I've played hours of this and only the first 30 minutes(The ones filled with false hope and lying to myself) were fun. I was going to make a YouTube video about this but 15 minutes into it, I just felt dead inside. This is a shell of a game that could have been something and became the same thing it's been since announcement. A polished tin can with nothing in it to eat. A bland oatmeal of a game. It's like eating cardboard. A peanut without the nut. Those presents under the Christmas displays that you want to open but know they're empty. RollerCoaster Tycoon World.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is far from finished. It's so far from finished that I can't believe they're saying it's full featured enough and they're just releasing the base game so they can add more features later on. No, the serious problem here is that the base features that are available right now just plainly don't work, and even some simple things just don't exist (you have zero control over staff, for example). I can see the potential here, but so much stuff is just so broken. The real redeeming quality of this game is the coaster builder, but just about everything else doesn't seem to work. I'm so glad the devs decided to dump this into Early Access, because otherwise I would've felt so betrayed. I still feeled betrayed though, by the high price for such an unfinished game. I really hope the developers get their act together. I could barely even start my park because I spent like 30 minutes trying to understand the convuluted and idiotic path building system, and my paths still look awful. Even the wonderful coaster editor needs some polishing, it doesn't really give me enough realtime information and my coasters kept flying off the track.Here's my first look at the game:  


YouTube™ Video: Rollercoaster Tycoon World | Ep. 1 | Rings Of Disappoint | Early Access Gameplay 

			Views: 247		

			A first look at Rollercoaster Tycoon World, a somewhat disappointing, yet fun sequel to the fan favorite Rollercoaster Tycoon series.		

 Clearly I wasn't in the correct mindset to be playing a buggy game (yeah let's play what is essentially an alpha right after major surgery), but at the same time this game is barely even ready for Early Access. I continued that first look with a video dedicated to the wonderful coaster editor here: 


YouTube™ Video: Rollercoaster Tycoon World | Ep. 2 | The Unexciting Puke Machine | Early Access Gameplay 

			Views: 146		

			My mouth was still full of gauze for this, but here's what happens when you just try to build a rollercoaster in RCTW. The builder is impressive, the execution...well you can see how that went.		

 . It still needs work, unfortunately, I was really hoping that it was going to work out of the gate. It IS fun though, but you generally end up making puke machines that rate low on the in-game excitement scale. Would I recommend this game to friends? Not right now. Would I maybe recommend this game to friends in the future? Probably, as I feel like there's a lot of potential for this to be a modern version of the first three RCT games. Will this game ever be worth $50-60? No, probably not. You guys are reeaaaally pushing it with that price point, I would probably pay max $30-40 for this, even if it were full-featured and polished.			"

								The RCT series has been one of my favorite simulation game series for a long time. I was ecstatic when I heard this game was coming out and preordered it....a year ago. Now fast forward a bit after the two messy beta weekends where the game was nowhere near completion. Then when the game was delayed from December (I think), I sent out a refund request to Atari so that I could get my money back for the many disappointments and they started to work with me. After giving them my receipt information like they requested...I didn't hear back for weeks, I sent in another request to get my money back and nothing. I figure it's because they knew the game would be releasing soon...and a few days later, they released that it would come out on March 31st. So, whatever, I am abandon my refund request cause what the hell. And then I play this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know its still early access but come on everyone. This game barely runs and I have a nice enough rig to play Fallout 4, GTA V, Borderlans Pre Sequel, and Skyrim all out high to intense graphic settings with no problem. This? The FPS drops to around 15-20 when more than 2 rides are placed, or I'm building something, or a significant amount of peeps enter the park. This is early access, but this is not okay. This game should be able to do the basic things, and it just doesn't deliver. I will review this game again once it gets out of early access, but for now I am done wasting my time on this.			"

								I'm glad I got this game for free from a friend who got two keys bundled in some hardware or software or something, I don't remember. He, however, remembered that I've always been a huge RCT3 fan since 2005 and I still play that game to this day. It's just a colorful pleasure every time.THIS game... well... let's first get the most important thing out of the way:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME for the current asking price of 46 Euros!!I understand that many want to support these developer but... seriously... if they DARE to throw this game on Steam in THIS state, they don't seem to care about it all that much anyway. I for one don't expect them to really put any true passion in this product anymore. I do realize that they've called it ""Early Access"" now, but that's only because they've realized (by having that beta event) that their customers can't be deceived that easily and immediately called them out on HOW unfinished the game really is. This game should get MANY more months of thorough development and quality assurance and could then be released. Everything else is just BS, if you ask me.Remeber the feeling of playing the old RCT trilogy? How much fun it was to enjoy many hours in that colorful, sunlit atmosphere, just watching the park visitors laugh, kiss, play and have fun? How well-rounded it all felt? The friendly and yet functional interface, the music, the whole look and feel?That's all gone now.The people in this game look like hideous soulless creatures. The last time I saw such an atrocious design of humans was in Egosoft's ""X Rebirth"" (remember those grandmas?). They're just uncomfortable to look at. (So that's why they never showed the peeps' faces in their official trailer/making of videos...)The interface looks like a gray, neutral, managerial iPod-like interface. COMPLETELY devoid of color. Just gray with white lines. Yeah, that just screams ""fun"", doesn't it?The terrain in this game manages to instantly disappoint. Really. Disappointment at first sight. And even when you've started building and embellishing your park... it STILL looks cold and bare. Hard edges everywhere and with a strangely gloomy lighting.In the previous games you looked at the empty terrain and the colorful interface and you wanted to dive in!In THIS game, you instead feel an urge to quickly build *SOMETHING* in order to fend off the depressing atmosphere.There are countless comfortable options that are left out. Filtering your available structures by theme, to just name one.I just feel sorry for Nvizzio.Atari has become a disgusting publisher, really, which became painfully evident by their recent trainwrecks ""Alone in the Dark: Illumination"", ""Asteroids: Outpost"", ""Haunted House: Cryptic Graves"" and the ridiculous mobile cashgrab freemium ""game"" titled ""Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile"". Recycling titles of popular (sometimes iconic) franchises and churning out utter garbage.Seriously... until ""Planet Coaster"" by Frontier Developments (the original creators of the RCT series) is out, just stick to RCT3 Deluxe. ""Rollercoaster Tycoon World"" just isn't worth your time so far. It might be when it's finished, but it's FAR from finished at this point.			"

								Iv played early access games before - knew what to expectIv played Pre-Beta/Alpha games before - knew what to expectThis however is on a different level.  It feels like maybe this was either the 3rd or 4th time the code was ever compiled and somehow ended up on steam for purchase.I quit playing after I bought a premade coaster, placed it, and then wasnt allowed to open it to the park guests becuase I didnt have the funds.  I sat around for a bit thinking that maybe I had missed something, but I didnt, and when I stared the game back up I was able to open the ride for business, which being the most gentle coaster somehow had ride intensity pegged as high as it could go, which in turn made all the patrons that rode the ride puke as soon as they hit the walkway, I watched this go on for about 5 minutes.  Built some janitor building to deal with that mess.  Low and behold the janitors were all broomless chicks in blue jumpsuits floating around moving their arms back and forth.The only positive is that steam was very prompt on refunding my money, very pleased about that.

You tell me you need $18 spend a head, then show how much I currently have.- Any changes I make to the theme park took too long for them to be useful for the scenario. I built a coaster in Jan of the scenario by game end only 5 people had ridden it. Thus a waste of $15k.- The graphic look very ordinary, I feel saying it in on par with the RTC3 graphics (a game that is old, very old)The game has a lot of positives but currently they are outwayed by the negatives.

I get it, you don't want to turn off your core audience with changes to classic features they loved, but you added nothing content based that increased the play value.

(Theses guys haven't heard of Disney)You have to set prices at each shop INDIVIDUALLY.Park land has the potential to be huge, yet you have very few rides to choose from.The peeps are soo skinny/small, you can't distinguish one from the other.No auto-delete when building rides.I could go on, but this game is not even able to cover the basic stuff we liked in RCT3.Pros : Ease of Path and coaster building.P.S.: This game will suck your PC dry.

								To begin with, I didn't read the reviews first so my point of view wasn't tainted right off the bat. Honestly though this game doesn't live up to the franchise. The graphics are better than RTC3, but not 8 years better. The motion of the rides and peeps is not smooth. The graphics appear more cartoonish, less realistic. The game frequently hangs up or freezes and it loads very slow. Not nearly as many options as previous versions (ie no transit rides). The curved pathways are neat, but nothing lines up properly when using those tools (hedges and fences don't follow curves). Hedge and fence pieces are all one length, which leaves gaps. Limited tree options and no bushes. Peep movements are not natural, nor is their vomiting habits and urinating on the pathways (seriously?) I could go on and on. I want to like it, because I loved RTC 2 and 3, but it just is not there. I realize this is early access and I think the devs can fix many of the problems, but I don't see them going back and redesigning all of the graphics to the level you might expect them to be for a game created in 2015-2016. They really have a lot of work to do, and as loyal as I am to the franchise I don't see them pulling it off properly. I hope I'm wrong because I messed with it for an hour longer than the refund policy allows...			"

But the roller coaster builder (the core of the game) is absolutely broken. I wanted so badly to like it.While the spline editor is a great idea, it just doesn't work in any feasible way. You'll pull out your hair trying to refine anything, and forget about making straight track. The result is an ugly, unrealistic, gangly, and awkward roller coaster that takes up way too much space and barely runs. There's no precision and the controls are so touchy that you'll find yourself screaming at your computer. Skill aside, it shouldn't take over an hour to lay down a lift hill--only to have the train randomly crash on a simple and shallow (forced by the game) pre-lift drop.Please delay the full release of this game. Go back to the drawing board. Try compromising the spline editor with the piece-by-piece system to allow for the compact and interesting coasters the franchise is known for while keeping the smoother rides.			"

								Just some initial observations when I loaded sandbox.  Can't move around with the mouse, one arrows or WASD.  What year is it again?The sandbox map I chose was very small.  Much smaller than RCT3 maps.    The graphics look fine and that was on medium settings.  Anyone that says they are the same as RCT3 is either lying or just trying to keep people from buying this out of spite because they're butthurt.  Steam has a generous refund policy.  Use it if you don't like it.  Too unfinished for me to enjoy now.  Would rather play RCT3 until this one gets better.I think this will be a great game in 2017, but I would not recommend it now.			"

								Almost had the early access version for 48 hours, and still haven't been able to play. The game still crashes at 57%, but i believe the producers are sorting this.I understand the reasons to release an early access version, but in doing this the quality of the product tends to suffer. They are always either glitchy, incomplete or simply unplayable. I should be able to at least play the game, and give it a fair assessment based on the in-game play. Very disappointed.			"

								The game doesn't work after each and every update. Both of my computers exceed the minimum requirements and it's still a memory hog when it does work. It takes forever to load a small park on a computer with 16GB of RAM, an i7 processor, and a GTX 970 graphics card! I've given this game chance after chance.  Then the game itself just doesn't have the charm and spirit of the classic RCT games. If you want a 2016 version of a theme park simulator, get Planet Coaster or Parkitect, both of those games are awesome. RCTW was a decent try, but needs far too many improvements to be considered a true theme park simulation game.			"

								Waited for so long for this:Here's why I liked it:And here's why I didn't:1) Buggy. Humans float, top end restaurants will NEVER attract any customers no matter what you do. EVERYONE pukes after leaving a roller coaster. NO ONE uses a bin. Takes FOREVER to load. Beyond a certain stage, the game starts to freeze and react slowly. Once, I even had the fortune of having ALL MY GUESTS leave my park suddenly. Terrain flattening doesn't work for some terrains. Annoying as hell. Sometimes you can take a loan, sometimes you can't. 2) Buy a roller coaster that's pre-designed, and you can't change the number of trains, or cars. 3)You can't place the entrance and exit elsewhere. 4)Path has selected spots to join to existing paths, which is stupid. 5)You can't place a shop next to the path, YOU MUST ALWAYS JOIN IT WITH A NEW PATH.This game clearly has potential. As it stands now, it's a pile of rubbish.			"

								Five months into Early Access and the paths are STILL a buggy mess, park visitors STILL glitch through things and float above paths, the major FPS drops are STILL rampant and the game will STILL freak the f*ck out once your park reaches a certain size. Not to mention the sore lack of variety in attractions and items, which I'm guessing they're relying on what little playerbase they have left to create themselves.Charging £29.99 vanilla for this is insulting. I wish I'd had the foresight to refund this mess of a game before I'd played 2 hours instead of attempting to continue to play, naively expecting it to become playable in the near future. "

Early Access Review
								Alright after reading through some reviews that were negative and searching for the positive ones to no real good avail I have decided to write my review. YES this game has the Roller Coaster Tycoon title but does it really feel like the RCT we know and love? Not really to be completely honest. I was so excited for this game to release and my s/o was generous enough to buy it for me when it was available for purchase so I didnt really spend my OWN money on it. But I do feel for those who did pay for it themselves with their OWN money. I have enjoyed the game so far to a point but I have run into a few issues and these are kind of major ones.Coaster Customizations:This is a big one for me! I absolutely love building and designing my own coasters and I figured this point to point style system of building would lead to some REALLY cool coasters. And although it is a very useful thing its a bit confusing at first to use. But what I was really disappointed in is that there is a lack of pre-set parts for the coasters such as loops, corkscrews and twists. Yes they have some but then when you do use them they seem to have messed with the coaster a bit and changes the way it works entirely. Another complaint with the coaster builder that has REALLY frusterated me is how the BRAKES SYSTEM doesnt seem to WORK PROPERLY (at least for me) now it may be something that I am doing wrong but I get to a point where I want to have the ""Block Breaks"" so I can add a stop point for a second coaster to pause at while the other coaster is at the station. Ive done it in 2 and 3 plenty of times. But when I test the coaster it seems to give me the error that the ""Coaster did not complete its circut"" and then the second caoster never takes off? This is really weird to me and would like a bit of an easier block break system.The final thing with the coasters and really the rides overall is that you cant really customize them too much. Like for example; you can change the colors of the tracks but you cant really fully customize the train cars, you have preset trains available. But I would like to see the ability to add patterns and change individual colors on the trians. Maybe instead of the individual color boxes you can choose, try implementing a COLOR WHEEL with ALL the RGB colors on them?Scenery options are a bit of a disappointment not much able to mess with there.ALSO THE BIGGEST ISSUE I AM HAVING IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH MY MEMORY RUNNING LOW WHILE PLAYING THE GAME FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR!!I have 8GB of Corsair Vengance RAM DDR3 1600MHz and IDK WHY I am getting the error that my computer is running out of memory....Thats really all the issues I have with this game. I like it when it works, but it needs some fixing. I would recommend the game but not at this current time.			"

												Ok, what can I say about this game? I was really trying to believe in RCTW because its good potential. But there's a lot of bugs and sometimes I just can't play the game because it crashes on a gameplay several times. After the last update, the game now crashes into the loading screem (after leaving my game to the main menu) and the trees textures are horrible. I'm really sad to do that because I believed this project could evolve to something really good, but I was wrong... so i will not recommend this game at all. Here in Brazil, Planet Coaster is a little expensive but I will wait for a good discount for this game because Roller Coaster Tycoon World is a disappointing surprise...			"

												It's not as good as previous rollercoaster tycoon titles, and having played the other rollercoaster tycoon titles, i'm just not digging the way this one is played. I prefered the multitude of different shops and rides over the rather limited selection in Rollercoaster tycoon world. Where i spent hours developing the parks in the other titles, and customizing them the way i want to, and can take my time getting challenges done, some of the challenges/missions in this game are either too hard or too quickly over, and the game time per map/park is rather limited timewise, you just can't spend as much time on it. I found the maps for each park are rather limiting as well.			"

								Review for RCTW Beta Weekend One (10/30/15)The newest Rollercoaster Tycoon game in the series!-Please note before reading, remember that the purpose of this beta was, ""to test out the key features of the coaster builder and associated systems"" (RCTW Blog #22) -This beta is not going to represent what the entire final product is going to be, it will change overtime with feedback from us, the community, until RCTW Beta Weekend Two rolls around! Please read the entire review to know why I don't reccomend this at this current moment.-General OverviewLikes:- Path customization- Good variety of pathways and scenery in general for beta.- Water physics- Terrain Deformation tools- Good looking UI- Guests were spooky ghosts only for a limited time since it Halloween is approaching as I am typing this.Dislikes:- Crashing!- Takes ages to recover from a crash.- No options to change settings such as audio, graphics, etc in the beta.- No snapping to objects like fences to make placement faster- No grid!- Can't remove added trains when customizing coaster.- Framerate is all over the place.- No tutorial!Noticed Bugs:- When doing something else on your PC while RCTW is loading, the game tends to crash. (e.g. opening steam overlay, leaving window.)- Once placing station and forced to edit the coaster, when accidently exiting before placing a track and going back to edit wont allow you to place any track and gives you an ""Invalid Location!"" error.- Tons of black little dots appear on the main menu sometimes.Summary     Honestly, I felt kind of dissapointed with the beta. But don't get me wrong, this game has major potential to be something big and unique but at the current stance of the beta, I'm kind of iffy on what was only given to us to provide feedback. But anyways, the beta included great elements in the coaster builder which included a lot more coaster customization when laying out the tracks. It didn't feel like it was only a set of pre-modeled tracks and looked like it gave peeps whiplash when making tilted turns (like in rct3) and allowed me to make smooth, curvy tracks. The only thing that gave me a problem in the coaster builder is that there was no way to remove added carts! This is a major key feature in the coaster builder! But if there was a way to remove carts, feel free to correct me.     The pathway design improved a lot since the previous RCT game. Now there is the ability to make curved paths which is fantastic, and also realistic! There was also a variety of pathways to choose from and also had different sizes which allowed a lot more customization to the game. Not only there was a variety of pathways, but also a variety of scenery to decorate your park. This included many lampposts, benches, trees, etc to use! And to even add onto that, the Terrain Deformation Tool allows you to customize your park with pretty, vibrant hills with also the use of the terrain sprayer. It also included a water tool to make lakes or ponds.     Now don't think the beta was all fine and dandy! There was also many things that I was dissapointed about which was the lack of a tutorial, which pretty much there to show you how to play. It was pretty much get into the game and figure out what to do. Although it did not take long, I eventually figured out some of the controls. And one thing that bugged me the most was the placement of pathways, stations, and scenery since there was no grid to make things neat. It also helps alot when creating straight pathways. Also the game pretty much crashed a lot in the loading screens, framerate was all over the place, and there was no options to customize your game. Hopefully this will get added soon for the second beta!But yeah, to conclude this review, I do not reccomend this game yet because it can go either way. It could go terrific or can go bad. If you are really considering, I reccomend it if you are a fan of the RCT series like me, and support the developers of the game and provide tons of feedback for them to read!			"

Now that I got it to work, there is about a 3-5 second delay with every action once a campaign starts (and the graphics look worse than the first RTC). I've tried re-installing it but it's exactly the same.You know what makes the game unplayable though? Having to delete every single peace of shrubbery individually.			"

								I have been a dedicated player of Roller Coaster Tycoon since it first came out and that is why I thought that Roller Coaster Tycoon World would be such a great game.  After over 200 hours of working on a park and trying out the various features of the game I found I did not like it as much as the previous version.  The game is too glitchy, for example the new path system that is supposed to allow you to have customized paths will not allow you to make some connections with other paths.  The new piece by piece building feature is a nice touch, but if you decide to rotate the building, or move it, any shops you have built inside will get thrown out of alignment.  I was very excited today to learn that the game will be fully released on 11/16, the article had mentioned it's releawse date is a day before Planet Coaster.  Being curious I decided to try out Planet Coaster and I am now regretting the money I spent on Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Planet Coaster has incredible graphics, the rides are incredibly easy to design and build, and their path system truly does allow you to design and connect the paths the way you want.  I got more enjoyment out of 2 hours of messing around with Planet Coaster than I did with 200+ hours of Roller Coaster Tycoon World.			"

								Don't waste your money! This game is just bad in every way; everything is buggy! The options are limited; a choice of three world types, limited coaster designs, limited flat rides and limited stalls. One really stupid thing about this game is the lack of control! When placing staff buildings, you don't really have control over any of them like you could in RCT3. If you're a big RCT fan, and looking for 'RCT4', don't get this game. It isn;t even in the same league as RCT3. Just go and pre-order Planet Coaster (made by the same people as RCT3). Just look at some of the Youtube Videos from the early Alpha! It's miles ahead of this game! And it's £10 cheaper. Just DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this game!			"

												This is more of a ""thumbs in the middle, leaning up"" recommendation. I, like most other people reviewing the beta, grew up with the first two games, and still play them to this day. Pros:+Terrain editing and manipulation is FANTASTIC. Very easy to use and navigate, much more so than any of the previous games. Creating valleys, hills, mountains, holes, etc. is super easy and intuitive, and the water tool is much simpler than in previous games. +Pathing is also a huge improvement in RCTW. You can change the size of paths, as well as create curved paths. Much easier and less tedious to lay down as well. +Game itself is very pretty to look at. +Camera works like RCT3, a positive in my eyes. +I don't hate the coaster editor like some other reviews have stated. To be fair, I rarely messed around with it in the previous games. I'm not creative or talented enough to create anything worthy of laying down in a park, so I always relied on pre-built designs and online downloads for my coaster needs. That said, I found it simple enough to use after getting through a relatively steep learning curve. My biggest complaint with it is that the mouse sensitivity is too high, but I'm assuming (hoping) that we will have the option to tone it down upon release. Cons:-Physics seem way, way off. Coasters seem much too slow, and coaster stats appear to be questionable at best. -Time passes, way, way too fast. An in-game day goes by in what seems like 15 seconds, even on the slowest setting. -Everything seems too ""big"". This is a difficult one to explain. -This seems like a game that is six months to a year from release, not one a month and a half away. Menus are basic and ugly to look at, there are very, very few decoration items (assuming that there will be mcuh more at release), and descriptive text in menus is completely missing, or occupied by generic placeholder text.

Now, this game had some nice surprises within it, but some parts of the game are a real killer to me.Pros: Everything (minus the people) looks good.It runs at a decent(ish) frameratelots of coaster/ride choicesCons:The People look like souls ripped out of un-canny hellThe paths are impossible to do what you want with themIt costs 50 DOLLARS?I managed to get this game for 18 dollars using a third-party site. I know that if that didn't exist, there's no way I would ever have bought this.Overall, do I reccomend?For 18 bucks, maybe.For 50 dollars? No way.			"

I lost all of my game play because it didn't save properly. Now I have to completely start over which is beyond frustrating. Wait until the glitches are fixed to buy this.Update:I tried to start another game, and it froze AGAIN while I was in the middle of saving. I lost yet another park that I built, and my park was worth over $30,000 at this point. I'm doing playing until this is fixed.			"

												This game is a HUGE let down for the amazing RollerCoaster Tycoon series. Don't waste your money on it. The game is broken, runs badly is a let down to rct fans.UPDATE:If you are looking for a good, fun and enjoyable theme park tycoon game, check out Planet Coaster!(I do not work for Planet Coaster, I just think you will enjoy that game more than this one)If you are still tempted on buying the game, Check out this review by Lazy Game Reviews, it's helpful and should let you know about buying the game for yourself:

								Controls are cumbersome, it crashes frequently, and has none of the feel the previous games had. I dont know how they managed to do it, but they put out a game in 2016 that is inferior in nearly every way to its 15yr old predesessor. And please do not give me any crap about it being early acsess. The game was due for a full release six monthes ago. Atari screwed the pooch when they hired a new company to build it instead of using the company they had used before. Every indication shows that previous company is now making a new game that will blow this piece of crap out of the water.			"

								It really bums me out to write this review.Let me start by telling you the blame for this fiasco is squarely on Atari. They hired a studio that had no reputation to build the game originally. They wasted a lot of time and money and didn't have anything to show for it.Since Atari brought Nvizzio on to finish the game, huge improvements were made in short amount of time. I have a lot of respect for the hard work Nvizzio is doing.Still, Atari set horrible expectation during the whole process and they've not done a great job of communicating with people following the progress of this game. I'm fairly against pre-ordering games, but after the progress I saw Nvizzio making I decided to pre-order to show my support. They didn't deliver on any of the pre-order perks and went silent again for months. Until today.Now the game is releasing in Early Access, which I'm typically a fan of, but I didn't pre-order an unfinished game. Obviously being Early Access the performance is pretty horrible, even on high end hardware. So yeah, don't buy this game. Not yet. I think it will be great in a year or two, but right now it's just a mess and Atari doesn't deserve your money for how they've treated this game.			"

								quite possibly the worst game i have ever bought in my entire life...cry about my play time if you will, but that should speak for itself. if i cant go more than 30 minutes in a game without laughing at its horrible quality, then its not worth my time. how this was supposed to be a full release in december is beyond me, the idea to make this game in unity is rediculous. they chose unity because its an easy engine to work with. this game is just so laughably bad that i dont know where to begin. believe me i wanted to love this game, after playing PC alpha and comparing it to this, i am suprised this wasnt made by two people in theyre garage working on it for two weeks. the graphics are god aweful, this is 2016 ffs!!!!! games shouldnt look like minecraft if they are meant to be realistic, i mean come on! the best part about this game is the fanboys who defend this game like its the best thing ever in the discussion board. i honestly dont see this going much of anywhere. atari should have hired a realy dev team that has an actual sucessful game under theyre belt. i honestly believe this may spell the end for both nvizzio and atari, these reviews speak for themselves. do not buy this game, buy parkitect or planet coaster, both are incredible games with amazing dev teams that will do there best to help you out. :)			"

								The game isn't as bad as most people are making it out to be, but Nvizzio was a terrible choice. It really brings shame to the Roller Coaster Tycoon name. I know Atari has the rights to Roller Coaster Tycoon but we all know Frontier IS Roller Coaster Tycoon. I didnt want to advertize Planet Coaster here like everyone else did, but you really need to try it. We owe it to Pioneer, they did a great job on RCT3, Atari does not deserve the name and Nvizzio disgraced it. This is where Roller Coaster Tycoon dies and Planet Coaster is born.			"

Early Access Review
								This is not a bad game, but it has serious limitations which are a) infuriating and b) extraordinary considering this is about the fifth version of the game.My kids love the sandbox version, which allows them an unlimited budget to put together the teme park of their dreams and ride on the attractions they've created.  Frankly, $30 is quite a lot to pay for a kid's game.The campaign game, whereby grown-ups attempt to achieve goals, seems buggy.  The first time I played it, it gave me the option to build a handful of rides, but no paths.  Even as the game was telling me that I needed to build paths so park visitors could reach the rides that I'd built, it was giving me no option to build a path.The second time I played it, it gave me a paths option after a few minutes, and then a buildings option.  Then, after I'd built a few buildings, it took the buildings option away, and refused to restore it, even after I'd expanded the park substantially.  The game was telling me that my visitors were hungry, but denied me any opportunity to build restaurants.  The game told me rides were breaking down, but denied me any opportunity to build mechanic stations to provide the machenics to fix the rides.  Eventually, my park simply ground to a halt.At no time did the campaign game provide me an opportunity to build a flower bed.  I see lots of screenshots above of luscious parks, with lamps, and decorations, and attractions, but my experience is that you can only create such scenes in the sandbox version in which everything is unlocked.  Althogh I played the campaign games to the point that I had fairly extensive parks, never could I have constructed the screenshots in the publicity.Paths are the single, most-infuriating thing in the game.  In real life, you can build a path anywhere.  In Switzerland, they buld entire freeways across the Alps and through some of the world's largest mountains.  So why is constructing a dirt path across your theme park a great world of ""You can't do that""?  You need to make very certain in advance of where your paths are going to go, and you can't add to many extensions to them without extensive demolitionand reconstruction.  Visitors on the path constitute obstructions, so if you're hoping to rebuild a major pathway, you have little option but to close the park and wait for the traffic to clear.  This will take a very long time and represent a potentially catastrophic loss of income, but it's the only way you can reconstruct a path!  Other problems with path construction are too numerous to detail here.  Suffice to say that probably noting in this game will raise your blood pressure  more than path construction.All this said, the sandbox version is a lot of fun, in a SimCity kind of way.  If all you want to do is construct the theme park of your dreams, and then ride on all your attractions, it's great.  But I find it extraordinary that the developers have allowed the program's very obvious weaknesses to go ahead -- or even that the program's weaknesses weren't taken with in previous versions.  By the fourth version, you really shouldn't have to be enduring the frustration of non-functioning software! Actually, you shouldn't have to endure it in the first version.It has the potential to be a really brilliant game.  Were it not for the bugs, it would be.  But it seems to have been released on a premise of, ""It'll do.""  The assumption seems to be that, if the graphics are brilliant (and they are superlative!), the public will forgive you if they don't actually work.  Well, I'm not a programmer.  I don't play a game for the joy of exclaiming, ""Egad!  What good-quality graphics!""  When I pay $30 for a game, I expect it to have been thoroughly tested and to work perfectly.  And this game is anything but that.			"

												Devs wont provide updates to paying customers as to release date. They stated a date and then changed their mind and refuse to give us any information. The forums are full of people asking for updates but they could not care less cause they took our money. Also on the first beta that was barely playable it used the game time a clever tactic to make us all unable to refund our money. Please don't support this company as they are using shady tactics to make money and obviously do not care about the fans as they seem to wait months before providing updates that are not even relevant to questions asked on the forums. Atari is now just like EA\Ubisoft another company you cannot trust.Update:The Dev's decided to ban me from the forums for requesting updates from them. I never broke the rules but they need a ""Safe Space"" because words on the internet hurt. Anyways here is a pic of the ban and blank space where a reason is supposed to go. Make sure you don't say anything negative in the forums or you may just be banned also.


Devs Silence those who want updates.

								There are a lot of problems with this early version.  It is very frustrating....I built my park twice and both times the game crashed before I could even save it and had to start over.   Building paths is very jenky especially when linkiing up small paths to large ones.  Removing trees is a pain, perhaps I have not found a way to mass remove trees from an area, but having to click on each little tree and bush is annoying.  The modify terrain is also annoying, as the largest brush size is way too small.  I have not figured out how to assign machanics and janitors to certain areas....is there a way?  So far, my rides keep breaking down and the paths become a huge mess even though I have many machanics and janitors.  Hopefully these things get fixed.  I have been waiting so long for this game to come out, only to be disappointed :(			"

								At the moment I have to give this game a no for recommendation sadly. I had hoped that it would be a great game! But sadly it is missing SO MUCH and it is no where close to properly optimized. This is the first game on my just built PC that actually lags when I am building stuff.So to not just complain, here is a list for the dev's on what they may be able to do to somehwat salvage the game.1). Optimize your♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean really optimize this game because holy crap.2). There needs to be more variety for rides and buildings, this game is over 10 years old and the original roller coaster tycoons have more rides.... you need to be surpassing that. Things like swimming stuff should already be in the game and not something that would be DLC because they where already in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.3). Back to touch on something of optimization. You can't make a single path straight and that is starting to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, nor can you place objects on paths basically wherever you want. This should not be an issue yet it is, I don't see how it can be an issue but you guys seem to have made it an issue.4). Fix the terrain tools so the brushes are larger when you are closer so that you can actually see if you have gotten everything down to the level you want it or up to the level you want it. I am constantly having the problem where I think I got it all then I build something and notice I didn't.5). Optimize the peeps, both workers and guests, so they stop being so dumb about things. I basically have to have a janitor/mechanic for every ride I put in the park because they seem to not move quick enough between everything. As for the peeps, every thrill ride and coaster I constantly have a path covered in puke even if I put a bathroom right next to the exit...6). I think that you guys may be heading in the right direction but there is just simply not enough in the game at the moment to get my recommendation. This may sound harsh, and it is, but I wouldn't even want to release the game with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is at the moment. Add things like research and development into the game to unlock things, don't gate them behind completing parts of the campaign. That is tidious and annoying when I have no real control over what I want more of.7). Developers, listen to your audience and realize♥♥♥♥♥♥is going wrong at the moment. For example the grid, well since the grid isn't properly alligned at the moment it doesnt work, simple and easy fix but yet you guys haven't done it. Just please listen to your audience so that you stop getting such negative reviews.			"

Thus, we are reaffirming our refund policy – we allow refunds up to March 31st 2016 to anyone that pre-ordered the game through Atari.com or RollerCoasterTycoon.com. This gives you a day to try Early Access, no strings attached. If you pre-ordered via Steam or another retailer, they will be able to facilitate refunds as needed."" - Rollercaster Tycoon I was ok sweet well atleast let me try it out and see if it has any potential.. If I dont like it they will give me time to get a refund. Played it, again an incomplete game with bugs. I love paying 50 dollars for a crappy and buggy software.. So I submit a refund request with Steam.. Turns out I have more than 2 hr of gameplay.. Steam wont give me a refund.. So heres were Roller Coaster lies. Lies about release day, lies about the refund. So in the mean time im playing the better game of Planet Coaster. I hope to god Roller Coaster Tycoon gets their game fixed, so I dont seem like I paid for a crappy program.			"

Early Access Review
								I know this is early acces but my god what a piece of crap this is!Game crashes sometimes. (just bought new powerfull hardware) I watched some trailers and some game-play video's of the game but the grapics are just not the same. They are horrible. The rides, tree's and buildings look ok, but the people/AI look like they pulled them out of the year 2008 and placed them in a 2016 game. people are lagging out of the trains. employees fly throug little hills and over the paths. workman; you can't direct them where to go or what to do. engineer; they don't do check-ups and safety controls, even not when you put the timer on 10 minutes. docters; well, wtf do these guys do? all my people had broken arms or something like that.The people (AI) are so stupid. they throw up after 5 seconds when they get out of the ride. my park was filled with pee (the yellow♥♥♥♥♥♥on the paths is pee because people couldn't find toilets). I placed toilets everywhere and those ♥♥♥♥♥ couldn't find them. the AI in Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 were more intelligent then these guys.I builded a park in this game were people (the AI0 would recommand my park to there friends, but I would definitely not recommand this game to my friends. I could be such an awesome game and i hope the producers do something with all the feedback but for now i'm done with this game. It really needs a lot of work. my advice: if you really wanna play this game, WAIT FOR THE ORIGINAL RELEASE AND DON'T GO EARLY ACCES! Early acces will only dissapoint you.			"

												I gave it a shot. I tried. I wanted to support this beloved franchise, but beloved no more. I had 1000x more fun with Planet Coaster Alpha, Beta even moreso. Save the money and especially save the frustration. Planet Coaster's editor is second to none...save No Limits 2. But that's more of a CAD program than a game.No, RCTW lost me after 65 hours. And I say this with much regret. Maybe the Workshop crowd can make something out of this mess, but I'm not sure that even the best modders have anything tangible to work with here. Will check in from time to time to see if there are any improvements, but as of now, it's Planet Coaster all the way.			"

								You could try and ignore all the many bugs, the rubbish graphics, the really awful looking guests, the amateurish animations, the bad AI, the cheap and often incorrect sounds, the slow map loading, the low framerates, and the blury out of focus camera to stop you noticing the lack of details in the models and textures, if you really want to play this game, but you're better off rolling round in a stinging nettle bush.I realise that currently this is an early release game. however, this must have been done on a low budget and it is not worthy of being part of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series.  Many of the current issues were reported to the developers by testers months ago (why are they not fixed?).If you want to play a top quality triple A Rollercoaster game then look at Frontier's Planet Coaster, the developers of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.  Although, at the time of writing this review Planet Coaster is currenly in early alpha, it is vastly better than this disaster.Honestly, save yourself money and anguish and avoid this game (and stinging nettle).

												I'm gonna recommend this game for the following reasons:  - The game is in beta stage, and they've made beta testing mainly to fix bugs, and find main issues on the way. However after i've seen this beta so far, there's still alot they'll need to improve, but the tools you do have are excellent compared to other coasters. - It's like Cities Skylines of Roller Coaster games, mainly because the community is huge for this game, and steam workshop. A lot of people fear that there's only 10 coasters, don't worry just wait 1-3 months and you'll have pretty much every coaster in the world to play around with. Not only can you share what you've made, but also most likely see legendary coasters in-game. But for every coaster i guess they'll look on highway systems from Cities Skylines for an example where you could pick different interchanges from the community, in this game under speciality, you'll most likely find extreme versions of loops, corkscrews and etc. - Even though the game is pretty good so far, as i said earlier there's a lot of features they'll need to add. It's almost impossible to make something 100% straight, and i will go cry in a corner if they don't add such a feature, because that's mainly one of the few things you'll need. So after this review, i would say the game got a bright future, but it takes some time to get used to, i really wanted a tutorial in the beta, just to know how the mechanics work. It's nice to being able to tweak EVERYthing on your coaster. But they should add classic mode coaster building from the older games. All in all if it was up to me i would give it 7/10 for now, but it's only in beta and hopefully it will only improve from full release 10th dec. But lets see how the next beta goes, and if the game actually improved or they'll need to push the release date a few months.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a huge fan of RCT3 and I was dreaming of the release of a sequel since a couple of years after its release in 2004. Up until yesterday before the release, I was only slightly frustrated it was taking so much time for the game to come out (it was originally planned to be released early 2015) as I really wanted the game to be as great as possible and did not mind Atari taking time to make a game that would deserve to be called RCT, especially after I got to play the beta back in November 2015 when I saw that they were very far from having any part of the game finished at all.But after such a long wait when I finally got to play RCTW yesterday, I went through extreme excitement to denial, followed by disgust and finally ended up laughing nervously in front of my screen.To make it simple, if RCT3, a 12 years old game was released today, it would still be by very, very, very far a better game.In RCTW, everything is broken:- The graphics of the peeps, structures and the land when zoomed are absolutely disgusting and can compete with games like Super Mario 64 released 20 years ago (I am barely exaggerating)- The roller coaster building system is completely broken and it takes hours to complete one that has many chances to end up not working properly at the end.- It is very buggy, I mean so so so so so buggy, I had to relaunch the game 3 times in 2 hours I never saw anything like that before.- Despite the fact that they look like they were made using MS Paint, the peeps will look like either vampires (Vendors at stands with red eyes) or zombies (they walk like zombies when they hold anything), or witches (janitors cleaning vomit with a broom and hovering when moving). Looks like they got the horror theme right at least!- The non roller coasters rides are not only very few but look worse than the ones on RCT3. The way peeps act while on some of them is completely unnatural and it just hurts so much looking at it.- Unless I missed something, there is only ONE song that can be played for all the rides. They give you the option to change it depending on the theme but essentially, it is the same song just slightly different! And if you have 2 rides next to each other and play the music on both, the music is not synchronised and I let you imagine what it sounds like!- Even when I got frustrated and tried to be nasty with my peeps this would not work! The peep picking tool does not work, taking one and putting them at the opposite part of the park teleports them back to their original place after a few seconds, peeps in cars that are ejected from the coaster will be teleported to the exit, and drowning peeps (Yes, I was very annoyed at this point!) by adding water does not work, they either keep walking underwater or may eventually stop moving and start ""jumping"" in the water indefinitely.A few extras:-Most park management options from RCT3 are gone.-Peeps disappearing, flying, going through walls, queuing the wrong way.-Female peeps (even male?) make porn sounds.-Sounds of babies crying all the time or children sounding like they are being tortured.-Background decors unfinished.I am stopping here but I could add more, and that is after having played the game only 2 hours!But I know what some of you may want to say: ""it's normal it's an early access!""Well, before you go any further, here is a thing: Atari had planned to release the game early 2015, and after being postponed multiple times, we got to play the beta in November 2015. More than 4 months later, I cannot see ANY improvement whatsoever that has been made. (I actually think it is even worse as during the beta we did not get the chance to see the monstrosity that are the peeps as they were only ""ghosts"" back then.)Atari had multiple chances and a lot of time to improve the game but fact is they just did not care so I cannot see how this game will be any better in the future. I requested a refund of the game and advise everyone not to buy this game.A very disappointed fan. "

You've even taken out some useful tools for rct3 which makes the game even more of a drag to play. Would not recommend buying this at this stage. Maybe in atleast 6 months time when some kinks are sorted out but even then I don't know if the gameplay will be any better.			"

								We are huge fans of RollerCoaster Tycoon, however, we are done with this franchise and want a refund.  RollerCoaster Tycoon World  is a FAIL on so many levels---a few examples are: there is no edge scrolling so you need two hands to play the game; the graphics look like cartoon graphics, not what was presented in the trailer; the game  play space to too small for the sizes of the pre-made rides, too many trees that need to be deleted because the rollercoaster takes up more than half of the park space (that is filled with trees!) ---the list goes on!  We suggest that you go back to the drawing board using RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 (Deluxe) as the base game and improve the graphices on that one ---even that would be better that what you have provided.   If you are planning to be new to the franchise don't waste your money on this one; buy the first two if you want to have clean and simple fun and the third one if you prefer a more graphic experience,  This one is not worth the money.

It actually says the curve is too sharp when using it.-the staff management has been completely removed-people teleport, walk through walls and in the grass.-benches snap to the outside of the path where they cant be used-static ride entrences and exits-sub par general graphics and frame rates			"

								At this point in time, RollerCoaster Tycoon World just isn't ready. To be honest, for a game that was to be complete by this point in time, only to be shunned into Early Access again, and to be as buggy as can be - I don't think this merits spending the $20 that I did (I bought this game through a CD key on a different website, so I cannot refund the game, but hey, it was $20). If you are planning on spending $50 on the game at this time, please don't. It's not worth it. $20 is pushing it at the time - I know there is the opportinuty for this game to get better, and if it does, I will go back and I will change my review.On a more positive note, the game is very stable - I don't think it is quite as efficient as it could be, but again, that is an expectation for an Early Access game. I think to be fair, that is something that will get better over time. I had no issues with the game crashing or anything like that - it was laggy until I adjusted graphics settings, but overall it was fine. There are a ton of graphical bugs in this game though - Roller coasters suddenly having peeps go away for no reason, that kind of thing.Overall, I'd stay away for now. Give it some more time. I think there is a chance it will get better.... but I can't say for sure.			"

								You know to be completely honest I loved RCT all the way up to RCT3 Platinum. But honestly now I feel its gone into the wrong hands. I really think I know where it went wrong, Atari. The game was originally created by one man, then in 2 Frontier came in to make it even better, In 3 it was still great when Atari came in, but when Atari seized power all was lost. Atari made some good games, unfortunately Rollercoaster sims are not their thing. I don't want Atari to feel horrible or like it is a lost cause, because quite frankly some people are still going to enjoy it and some have already bought it, but this project is going to lose them money. I played through a friend, and thought it was fun, but when I saw gameplay for PlanetCoaster my experience was over taken just watching the video. Here is the fact Frontier knows what they are doing, they are making PlanetCoaster, and they therefore changed the name of the true RCT. I think in all fairness your money is better spent there. If you aren't a mechanics freak like me and most others though you'll still enjoy RCT. I am not reccomending the game however, because it hasn't met my criteria. Sorry to the Atari RCTW team, hope you can find better luck in a different and hopefully following project (If this one doesn't send you spiraling out of business).			"

								I'm honestly trying very hard to like this game, but the developers have seemingly made it impossible.  I know this is still a game in development.   Where do I start with the issues with this game?  First of all, making a simple path in Rollercoaster Tycoon should never have been made so freaking complicated.  Paths do not connect to other paths correctly and you never can seem to angle the pathways where you want them.  And God forbid you mess up a pathway and need to delete something because, in my experience, you will need to delete almost all your pathways to correct the issue.  What is the point of an elevated pathway if you cannot light it for your peeps?  Rides are hit and miss.  The flatrides sort of come off as generic.  It would be better if you could modify the colors of the flatrides to at least make them appear different instead of the generic colors they come with.  Rollercoasters are seemingly impossible to get working correctly and seem to have an extreme rating even for the most simple of speeds/drops.  So far, every time they do a major patch my parks that I have saved do not want to load.  So I have resignated myself to not get too attached to any park that I create.  I've had two parks so far that I can not use because of updates corrupting the file.  Like I said, I'm trying very hard to like this game but it needs a lot of work.			"

								This game is not ready to be released even in Alpha.  It actually offers less content and features than the game it supposedly succeeds (RCT3).   To ask $50 for so little content is asking way too much.  This is not the way to make your fan base happy Atari!  Requested refund and am going to wait for Planet Coaster - which shows so much more promise.  Cities: Skylines turned out to be what most people were hoping for in the last SimCity.  Let's hope that Planet Coaster is the true successor to RCT3.  Sadly, RollerCoaster Tycoon World does not appear to be it.			"

								Honestly, I think a lot of the negative reviews are from the constant disappointment. For the game to be delayed 3 times and end up being early access.... Who wouldn't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about that? The game is for sure not finished and doesn't run very smooth, but it has a lot of potential to be a good game. If the developers actually use the early access to perfect the game, then yes, I will recommend it. If the game gets stuck in early access and never goes anywhere, then there will be a lot of angry RCT fans. Last, the game doesn't have much content at all. I really hope they double if not triple the amount of content in the game. To charge 50$ for this game is kind of a joke. Let's just say the additional content/DLC better be free for game owners.  For now I'm going to give it a thumbs down, but I will quickly change it to a thumbs up if I see the developers are actually making progress.  "

								Welcome to a game that looks worse then Rollercoaster tycoon 3.I normally never ask for a refund for a game, but holy cow this game is a mess that seems more like coming out of a scam indie studio then a well-known Atari backed studio that seemed to have control on the development and was finally giving us another great rollercoaster tycoon game, but even in early access this game is so broken that it would require a major overhaul so big that we would not see it for a long time and they do not seem willing to do that. I can live with graphics that are not top end, i can live with certain framedrops and lag in a early access game. What i do not however can live with and support is a broken game where it´s not just the above that is the problem, its also animation, core gameplay elements like guests actually going to a store, guests that run around like headless chickens because the queue is not long enough, pathways that are just poor. not to mention ridecams that made me look at the date just to make sure i was not actually back in the 90´s.These things was even in a old Rollercoaster tycoon 3 but it seems that the developers have forgotten that we are writing 2016 and not 1996. So can i recommend this?, not a chance in fact STAY FAR FAR FAR FAR AWAY. Unless they change their game drastically this is a failiure.			"

								Broken game.  Black screen and mouse on start up.  Fully updated drivers, etc...  Buyers beware.  50 dollar Black Screen Simulator 2016.Update:  After discovering a work around for a law in the game coding not letting it start, I have been able to play the game.  However, there are many game breaking bugs right now.  This includes things like bugged repair guys who are unmovable and you cannot fix rides, or none of the Janitors cleaning anything, or all guests bugging out and not riding anything and causing you to run out of money and the guests needs meters dropping and them  being upset at your park.  You can't build a park bigger then about half of the starting area at the moment, because the game becomes very laggy and can lead to crashing or more bugs appearing.  The current state of the game plays like an Alpha more then a Beta, which has not been play tested AT ALL.			"

								Save your money for Planet Coaster Instead.This game is OK at best.  Which is a shame becuase I love rollercoaster tycoon.I will say, though, that the spline system (When it works) is awsome.  You can really make the coasters exactly how you want them with every inch.I don't even want to play this game after playing the alpha of Planet Coaster.  It shines WAY brighter than this game and you can't even build rollercoasters yet.  Just the sheer building and park decoration is FAR more enjoyable than this game with being able to manage the park and create rides.  Sorry RollerCoaster Tycoon, but here is where we go our seperate ways.You should have kept Frontier Developments in charge of the game.			"

								so i played alittle on the ""SandBox"" Mode and the Moment the Game Loaded in i seen a SMALL Park, Nothen like RTC3 with how big the land is for the park, Sandbox should be unlimited amount of space because well its ""SANDBOX"" Mode, I love every Roller Coaster Tycoon, Iv been waiting for this game since March of last year when it was announched for a Release in November then it was pushed to December and Then to March 30th. Now i am gonna give it more time for me to play, But i remember the first time i played RCT 1 i was glued to my Computer Seat for Hours and Hours, Same with RCT 2 and 3, While i was Streaming RCTW last night i played and was BORED out of my mind, As of right now If your a fan of RCT 1,2, and 3 DO NOT BUY OR PLAY THIS GAME until it is fully finished, You will HATE Roller Coaster Tycoon for EVER after if do play it, You place a ride and it has a Set Enterance and Exit Port unable to move where the Enterence and Exit is, Overall as of right now i am giving RCTW a 3/10 rating, i may change this review when more updates come out but as of right now its a 3/10. I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME. =(			"

								I have been a fan of the previous three instances of Rollercoaster Tycoon, but this new one... well, it is bad in almost everything.Lets start with ride/road placement. It is almost impossible to place a ride or shop on an existing road. It just does not work! you have to delete the road, place the ride, and redo the road. And it is hard to get nice grids...The next biggy is the graphics. Nowadays, I expect a photorealistic rendition of the park, but it looks more like a bad video game out of year 2000... I mean, even the older RCTs had better graphics (if not really 3D graphics, but that is beside the point).The only good thing that I can say about the game is the new freeform functions, but that is about it.

								I was about to seek a refund and realized the download was available. I will not compare this game to any other like game currently on the market ""for fairness"", with that said.. This game was something like a job I got as a teenager, it looks so much better on paper than it did in real life. Somehow it just doesn't seem as fun as all the prior installations and I have played RCT 1-3 (and all the add-ons loopy landscapes, corkscrew follies et al), today there is a sort of vibe, nay, passion missing in RCT. Pro's:My PC didn't crashThings are a hint more attractiveThere is more detail (like a mop bucket behind the janitors station for example) ooohPeeps have no character, groups etc.. The parking lot adds realismI like the park and rides management systemCute ride and shop namesCurved paths nice path detailsLots of plants optionsBenches and lighting can be off the pathsCons:I spent the moneyMore puke than ever - ""look a lamp-post"" - bleeeghDon't know why the game just seems flat - lifeless. Nothing really snapped to a grid as I expectedI put in nice dining I had zero popularity though I had 600 peeps visit it they must be just reading the menu'sPaths are a pain - periodDecor construction tools was limited - walls etc..Deleting: ever tiny bunch of green and tiny little pebble to put in a ride was just silly.Deleting: select a ride and it's so easy to select another ride nearbyIf there is enough negative feedback - this might be all we get folks.My guess is they had to rush this out to avoid refunds (tough to account for behind the scenes). Seems like someone is spread too thin to have made this right the first time (I feel bad them and wish them luck). This game could have been very profitable if the right internal resources were dedicated to it. If the game is ever finished I'll give it another go but have no plans on participating in early access forums. If this game were $15.99 and I'd give it a thumbs up for value. I think this game is simply OK, I give them a thumbs to the marketing team for getting good revenue. That is one approach to business..			"

								First off, the game has a lot of bugs. Also to build rollercoaster sit takes a lot of thought, (Which can be better at times) whereas in rollercoaster tycoon 3 you could get in and build a rollercoaster coaster like that. No messing around with safety and the free form tool is messed up. However I'm personally a big sucker to when it comes to FPS (Frames per second) and graphics quality. RTC world delivers this really well compared to RTC3. Terrain editing is much nicer as the tiles are gone from RTC3 and blending is better. Although rides and rollercoaster scant go underground and after you've finished a rollercoaster, you can't edit the terrain that sits underneath the track! That sucks! Also when zooming out, peeps become more static. By that I mean there is no movement in there arms, legs and body but instead the shuffle along the ground as if your FPS is down at 2! As well as there is a lack of themes. I know that RTC3 only had an extra 5 themes through the platinum edition but come on Atari, add more themes and as well as there is no filter to filter themes like on RTC3; there all in one big list!To conclude I wouldnt buy this game yet. It has a lack of customisation and needs to be developed. I do realise this is early access and not everything is added and flushed out, exactly why you shouldn't buy this game just yet. Once the game is out fully then give it a go but stick to RTC3 or planet coaster.John			"

Early Access Review
								Most of the negative reviews of this game are completely unwarranted. I've been a fan of this franchise since the very first game, and this has the potential to be the best one yet, even though it does need a lot of work. Most of the people who seem to hate it either seem to ignore the fact that it's an incomplete early release, or simply didn't have the patience to actually learn how to play it. Finally, I think it does measure up to it's main competitor, Planet Coaster.First, let me say that if you're expecting an easy-to-play, piece-by-piece builder like the previous two where everything always comes out perfectly square and symmetrical with complete ease, you're going to be disappointed. The node-based coaster builder can be tricky, and it takes some work to get parallel tracks or symmetrical scenery arrangements. However, most of the people complaining about this seem to have completely ignored the snap and grid options. Once you learn to use it, I actually find these elements superior to analogous elements in other simulators like Cities:Skylines. It does take a while to learn to and optimize the path building, scenary placement, and coaster-building features, and it's a bit more difficult to use, but the trade off in difficulty pays off with the high level of freedom you have. Now, something very negative about this game, it is EXTREMELY buggy in its current state. It crashes a lot, the frame rate is really low, a number of the features (such as the coaster's physics engine) are woefully incomplete, and the AI in guests and maintainence needs a lot of work, but it is important to remember this is an incomplete game. It's probably more buggy than most games that are called beta or early access, but that's more the fault of Atari's marketing than the game itself. If they work out these bugs, it has the potential to be a really good game.The best feature of the game by far is the coaster builder. Judging by other comments and You Tube videos, most of the people complaining about it seem to have absolutely no clue what they are doing and haven't even tried to learn how to use it. It is in my opinion the best coaster builder out there right now. It's less complex than No Limits, and gives you way more freedom than the builders in the first three or the current version of Planet Coaster. Granted, the physics engine is probably incomplete and what's right now there is probably a place holder (there's very little friction on coasters, the breaks are way to powerful) and there are some bugs with the coaster builder (frame rate slows way down, some features cause it to crash, and there are a number of bugs with the breaks). It's also somewhat difficult to learn how to use (though should come somewhat naturally to those familiar with No Limits), but again what you lose in easiness pays off in what you gain in freedom. Again, don't expect an easy piece-by-piece builder, but do expect to be able to build really realistic coasters. I love the mixture of node and piece-by-piece builders.Since I also have access to the early bird version of Planet Coaster, I think it's worth doing a point-by-point comparison between the two. Granted, both games are incomplete, so all of this is subject to change, but it's worth mentioning how I think the two stack up against each other.So far, here's what's better about RCTW:-Better Coaster Builder with way more freedom than you have in PC, but PC's builder isn't even in alpha yet so this can change.-Better path builder. PC's path builder is easily the worst part of the game, it's so wonky and very difficult to build decent looking paths.-UGC. As someone who spent hours looking for and working with CS in RCT3, this is a huge plus. The integration with Steam Workshop is great, and it allows to add elements of piece-by-piece building in RCTW that aren't there yet. Also, it expands the potential for customization in the game in the future way out there.-Better looking flat rides.-Better camera controls. Though PC has very similar controls to RCT3, RCTW's controls are more intuitive and don't clash with other controls in the game.Here's what's better about PC:-Better overall graphics. Even though some elements in RCTW are more detailed, the lighting, shadows, and such in PC are way superior.-Better sounds. Sounds like guests on coasters are having sex in RCTW, and coaster sounds in PC are more realistic. Also, it sounds a lot less cluttered.-Better Scenery builder. Piece-by-piece building allows for a lot more freedom in building buildings and the scenery in general looks better.-Better AI. Peeps act and move more naturally, and there are fewer bugs. It gets you to think about the layout of your park a lot more.-Way less buggy, and better optomized overall.Here's what's neutral/debatable between the two:-Stalls. The Stalls in RCTW are more realistic, and the feature of walk-in resteraunts is a huge plus. But, the stalls in PC are more customizable.-Coster stations. Like stalls, they're more realistic in RCTW, but more customizable in PC. Granted, RCTW's devs said they're planning on allowing for blank coaster stations for mor customizations in future updates.-RCTW has more features, game modes, and such as of now but that's just where it is in its development.Overall, I slightly prefer RCTW but that's mainly because the main reason I've ever played these games is for coaster building and, as it stands now, RCTW has more features overall, but PC just needs to catch up in development. Both have the potential to be great games.In conclusion, do not by this game if you're looking for a completely ready-to-play, fully optimized, and easy-to-play game. It still needs a lot of work, and is difficult to learn to master all the controls. Most of the reason why people seem to hate it is a mixture of bad marketing and unrealistic expectations of how complete it would be. For casual gamers new to the genre of theme park simulators, it's definitely not worth the price. But if you truly love simulation games, and have the patience to work through the bugs and actually learn how to play, and want to support the development of a potentially good game, it's definitely worth it.

								 Having played and enjoyed the RCT franchise for most of my life, I was overjoyed when I heard this game was in development. I never thought a Roller Coaster Tycoon game could be butchered so badly. Boy, was I proven wrong. This game feels like a bad port of a knock-off RCT game for a mobile platform. There's barely any content, the graphics are sub-par, the UI is clunky, the guests lag the game, and you can't even move the camera with the mouse. They said this game was 80-90% done upon release? And after numerous release delays, they have the audacity to try and hide it behind an Early Access tag at the last minute to attempt to cover up how flawed the game is. There is no excuse for this.This game does not deserve to be called a Roller Coaster Tycoon game.			"

However, after playing RCTW for less than an hour, I have requested a refund. I might purchase it again when it leaves early access and is a proven, solid game. Until then, I am sorely disappointed. I am unable to trust Atari with those titles that I grew up with, those fragile memories from my childhood. This saddens me deeply.In the meantime, Planet Coaster kicks♥♥♥♥♥♥ The true spiritual succesor by the developers behind RT3. Go buy it, NOW!			"

												I felt duped when I preordered RCTW and it suddenly went into ""Early Access"" when it was supposed to be in full release form. At that time the game felt like it was alpha at best. I held on to hope that Atari valued their audience and were going to make the best of things by delivering a finished product by full release. I defended RCTW and told others to just give them time and they might be able to turn things around. Duped again apparently. *I think* they were pushed to some arbitrary holiday deadline, or afraid of Frontier's game, either way it has released in a very sub-par state. I tried to like RCTW but it's just not good enough. No matter how good this last group of devs are and even though they tried to listen to us they were given a task that was insurmountable. All in all I would stay away from this game, it had potential but they sadly bungled it. The best thing I got from my pre-order was the lesson to never pre-order another game. *PROS*-The Coaster Creator. You can build pretty good looking rides once you learn a bit about how it works.-When they work right the flat rides are not so bad.*CONS*(The Short List)-The path system. It has never worked right. They fixed it up as best they could but that's like putting lipstick on a pig.-The AI. Nothing like watching guests form a vortex at the paths between the food stalls and the bathrooms, never to ride another ride again. Or sit down. Or anything but eat and defecate.-Still feels like a beta state game. Memory leaks still reported. Game breaking glitches still present from early access.*TL/DR* Not worth the price of admission. "

												Game has been released. Review updated as of 18/11/2016.Please scroll to bottom to read.THIS REVIEW WILL BE UPDATED AS THE GAME DEVELOPS.*****************************************************************I suppose to start with I will honestly say I am LOVING this game. So many people forget or don't realise that Nvizzio have only been working on this for about 18 months or so, proir to this 2 others had tried and failed, so there was and still is a LOT of work to be done before the masses get a finished product. This isn't something that will happen quickly either.At the moment it needs a speccy PC to run too, as it uses rather a lot of memory at the moment. Some users report upto 8Gb of RAM being used by just this game alone. Yes there are a lot of features this game doesn't have yet but these things will come, in time.

Peeps are working better and overall the quality of graphics is now better too.Game Update - 30/08 - Review updatePiece by Piece Building has now come to RCTW and is amazing to use.With the previous 2 updates breaking the game for most, I was hopeful to try the new update to see what, if anything has improved.Unfortunately there is still ZERO improvement in performance. It has now got even worse. Game lags like crazy and glitch's here there and freakin' everywhere.

												Game has been released. Review updated as of 18/11/2016.Please scroll to bottom to read.THIS REVIEW WILL BE UPDATED AS THE GAME DEVELOPS.*****************************************************************I suppose to start with I will honestly say I am LOVING this game. So many people forget or don't realise that Nvizzio have only been working on this for about 18 months or so, proir to this 2 others had tried and failed, so there was and still is a LOT of work to be done before the masses get a finished product. This isn't something that will happen quickly either.At the moment it needs a speccy PC to run too, as it uses rather a lot of memory at the moment. Some users report upto 8Gb of RAM being used by just this game alone. Yes there are a lot of features this game doesn't have yet but these things will come, in time.

Early Access Review
								This game looked way better in the Beta (which was horrible). Where is the love to the franchise? Where is the love to details that you promised? The pre-built coasters have chain lifts from the beginning to the end of the ride or are bend in the wrong direction the whole track. This game seriously lacks all the atmosphere & love from the devs what made the franchise so popular. The peeps are awfully animated and act like robots. There are so many bugs that need to be fixed urgently, before the game will be playable at least. The most annoying bug is the bug where you can't connect any paths to buildings. Moreover, the fact that it sounds like a porn movie, when you hear the peeps in the station or while sitting in the ride, has been ignored by the devs. It is horrible, that the publisher says since months, that this game just needs a bit of more optimizations until it will be ready. Undoubtedly, this game will need months/years until it will be a real RCT, that deserves its name. Atari should think about their selling policy, when the game is sold to have a final release in December, which has been delayed until the end of Early 2016, then they thought, we can't sell this game to the public like that, however, lets (1 week before end of Early 2016) just give them an Early Access game, then the people can't complain about the huge amount of bugs, because its Early Access. However, those who preordered feel betrayed now and really have the right to complain, when they see that even the developers livestreams, are full of bugs. And remember, the reason why there are so many negative reviews is not, that it is a poor game, instead you just dont understand EA or are a fanboy of the competitor.			"

								RCT WORLD is an unstable game that crashes constantly, even on high end computer systems.  The game likes to crash when using the bulldozer and has crashed while trying to save causing hours of coaster building to go down the drain.  I recommned that while you build or design coasters that you save the same coaster build twice under two different names.The look of the game is gorgeous, with realistic peeps, lighting, and textures. The coaster building freeform is interesting however requires some tweeking.  I recommend having more preconstructed options available like loops and helixes as these are difficult to make with the system...(at least smooth concentric loops and helixes.)  The curved paths are a bear to acclimate to.  I should be able to click on a start then an end position of the path and then adjust the curve as desired. Im sure that updates, fixes, and additional content will be forthcoming and constant.  Water, travel, and more thrill rides have been promised.  Tunnels will be nice too.  I have not yet attempted to create my own scenery, however, if I can play the game for 15 min without it locking up, seizing for half an hour, or out right crashing, I may attempt to import some buildings created in lightwave.  As it stands constant crashing is my bigest grip to an otherwise interesting game..the crashing makes the game unplayable in my opinion, at least at this point,  and requires some serious patching to improve stability, especially if they are charging $60 for the game.

								Every review I see on here is bashing on the graphics. Honestly I'm not here to look at a pretty game I'm here to make a park and have fun. So graphics aside. This is my review.I've only played a bit and I'm not impressed!Camera: The camera in the game is awful. You use the WASD keys to move. Why can't I click and hold left and drag? When you zoom in it gets blurry and looks awful. Pathing: Don't even bother trying to put a que line or anything down. It's annoying. It doesn't work. Just don't. Also why can't I right click to delete stuff? Speaking of...Teraforming: OMG KILL ME. What do you mean I can't move the land up? OH because of that little stupid rose bush?! Well just move it up with it or just delete it. Instead you have to go to the delete tool, delete the tree/bush, go back to terrain, then and only then can you move it.Que Lines: Why do I have to BUY the ride sign? Why isn't it just on the end like it is on EVERY RCT?Overall: So sad. Wanted to like it, wanted to think everyone was wrong about it. But no. This game (I know it's early) Has a lot of issues. It feels like  the people behind this game have never even played a roller coaster tycoon. Off to check out Planet Coaster.			"

								Holly Hell!I have put in 4 hours. I am really trying to love it. I am the biggest Coaster tycoon fan I know of. Loaded my game, and all finance stats are gone. All positive cash gone, and im negative 17k.All rides are broken. In one part of the park, there are 2 rides broken. So I built 4 large mechanic shops with 10 mechanics each. That is 40 mechanics and the rides wont get fixed! The shops are right next to the rides. The path technology is terrible!!I can go on and on. It's unplayable. I had fun trying to play around the bugs, but then I just kept finding worse ones. Don't turn on the heat map! It screws up the entire game!Charlie Brown's words keep speaking in my mind ""oh good grief..."" lolsure hope this all gets fixed..... and soon!			"

								Utter dissapointment, and great regrets.  If you have Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, don't even bother.I got so excited when I read on March 29th that the game finally had a release date and it was March 30th!  The game which I purchased last fall which then had a release date of December 2015, later pushed to ""early 2016"" after a very poor beta weekend.They now released the game under ""early access.""Do not buy this game expecting the next installment in the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise.  Think of it as some new knock off game trying to live up to what was, and falling shortThemed stalls selling unthemed items, really?!  RCT franchise is dead like many other great games such as Sim City.			"

								Well this game is not what I expected it to be, first of all i've been playing the game for an hour now and I still haven't successfully built a path, the controls are so difficult to use and the tutorial isn't much help either with a measly three step guide that was certainly no use. Overall I think that the graphics have progressed really well from the previous game, however I was a little dissapointed when going on the camera view to play on the ride to find that the graphics were very much the same as rct3. Another issue I seem to be having is that due to my unsuccesful building of a path i'm having to delete an awful lot, this however came with yet more difficulty as the demolish cursor wouldnt snap right to the path. Having not gone any further into the game I am unaware as to what other issues may occur but I am sure there is plenty, if it was possible for me to return this game and get a refund then I certainly would be doing!

												For this beta they wanted to test the coaster builder. It works fine if you get the hang of it, but for some reason the coaster will never be finished. I tried to build 1 coaster, but it totally randoms fails at random places. Yes, it even failed for me with chaining up before the drop or sometimes even when leaving the station(physics problems).Sometimes it made sense it failed, but then you tweak the place where it failed, you can tweak everything thats next aswell..Had some other issues aswell:-Needed to change my graphic card settings to get the game even running(otherwise you see a nice blue screen and   after some time you get kicked back you desktop).-Memory leak, after some time the game is not playable anymore, checked what it was but 8GB ram wasnt enough....-Game Speed affected the rollercoaster.-Camera is sometimes hard to control when building the coaster.It's the first beta, but they wanted feedback on the coaster builder (How people like the new system of building coasters). But if you can't play normal to test this thing then I say this game ain't ready to launch yet.Hope this game will release later then the date they stated.So for now I don't recommend this game! "

												After getting out of early access i thought i would give rctw another try hoping that the devs killed the bugs and polished the game. I really want to like this game but oh boi does it suck. The biggest problem is not only the lack of content, the totally lackluster soundtrack, the nonexistend atmosphere or the really boring area's where you can build your park. The whole game just runs very bad. Low framerate is still an issue when your park gets bigger and this game really loves to crash. I do love the coaster builder tho, but thats it.			"

However the designers slowly added new features and such but after a certian update, the game no longer worked, I would get as far as the opening videos then nothing and looking at the community disscusions I'm not the only one this has happened to, in fact a lot of users reported this issue (along with many other crashing issues). They have failed to rectify the issue with so many people remaining with the issue. Stay away from this game until they sort it out!! CURRENT RATING 1/10			"

								This game could have been so much more. I expected it to be more fun than RCT2, and better than RCT3. Unfortunatly, I was wrong about that. At it's current state, it is very hard to recommend it, the game is very glitchy, has very low textures, and it only has three maps to choose from... Really? Only three! I mean was it too much to ask for a game that was better than a game from 2002, and 2004 repectively. I really hope Atari can turn this game around before full launch.			"

												After getting out of early access i thought i would give rctw another try hoping that the devs killed the bugs and polished the game. I really want to like this game but oh boi does it suck. The biggest problem is not only the lack of content, the totally lackluster soundtrack, the nonexistend atmosphere or the really boring area's where you can build your park. The whole game just runs very bad. Low framerate is still an issue when your park gets bigger and this game really loves to crash. I do love the coaster builder tho, but thats it.			"

I understand that this is a prerelease but they have had plenty of time to provide us with a better game than this. The fact that they are acctually charging money for this is insane. They should be ashamed of making people pay to play this terrible game. Since I have  already had to pay for this, I will attempt to play this again once the full release comes out, but till then I'm not gonna give myself a headache fighting a coaster builder that DOESN'T WORK!!!!

								If a player keeps from viewing others' views and opinions and allows an open mind before entering this world, then I think they can find themselves having an adequate time playing for a few hours. This goes especially to those players intending to do super-basic stuff like building basic rides, planting basic scenery, do minimal to no landscaping, etc.But when a game has so many glitches, so much lag, and so many errors and incomplete aspects within it, you have to sit and wonder who's bright idea it was to release this horrifically broken piece of software at the price of a full-fledged, fully-built, fully-complete-and-ready-to-sell-to-the-masses video game. I understand the game is listed as ""Early Alpha,"" so this should be expected, but coming from a video game that was originally intended to be released summer of last year, I was at least hoping for it to be polished enough for more serious gameplay.I found the game okay to play at first and that the reviews many YouTube gamers were giving it to be just a tad bit exaggerated. But do heed their words, and do heed the words of the ""Mostly Negative"" reviews found on the Steam Page. In the end, it's really not worth it.I intend to keep my copy to play at another date and hope that they will improve it over time, but it will likely gather dust now and then until I feel ready to suffer through the tremendous lag and superabundant number of peeps puking for my generic janitors to clean. Your $50 could be better spent elsewhere. I promise, I promise...			"

								This game does not deserve to have the RollerCoaster Tycoon name attached to it. It is awful in every element of the ""game"". Sure this is Early Access but that is NO excuse for this horrible ""game"". This has been a failing project for years. The current screenshots all look good but then you get in the ""game"" (which is just over 1gb) and put all the settings on high, you still get something that looks worse than RCT 3 does and that game is 10 years old! Artai has been money hungry for years turning well known IP's into new, totally garbage games and RCTW is no different. A few things wrong with it:-Sound design (want to hear some adults only bedroom noises? Zoom into the coaster stations)-UI (everything is just wrong. Not user friendly, way to big, hard to navigate, etc)-Peeps are a joke. You will find quite a few that look the same. They don't walk right. Loading into rides is awful-Gameplay is just horrid. I had to force myself to play for an hour trying to find something good about it and there is nothing. -Graphics are awful-Just no fun at allAs soon as the negative feedback started rolling in on the forums, threads were getting deleted. You mention Planet Coaster on the forums (even when trying to compare the games to give Atari ideas), you get the whole thread deleted. Atari has become a massive joke and I will never buy another game from them again. It's a real shame that they have the rights to Roller Coaster Tycoon because I would love to see what a real game development company could do with this beloved series. Unforutnally I think it is to late and the RCT name has been tarnished by this total hunk of garbage they call a ""game"".			"

								This game is terrible. It still is nowhere near release. You can't edit hardly anything on the pre-built rides, coasters, and structures. The peep graphics are choppy at any eye height beyond right over top of them. The coaster building interface is junk - it lets you build ridiculous track segments while defying logic and sense. The graphics are poor - RCT3 was better. The on ride cameras are choppy when turning or changing slope - very poor. You can't see the ride increase or decrease speed either, it always looks like it's going the same speed. The building system overall is bad, clunky, impossible to place things where you want them. The game is so far from ready, and there doesn't seem to be any promising sign that it's going to get any better. This is all coming from a very disappointed, huge RCT fan from day 1. Bummer.			"

								I loved these games.. but unfortunatly this game is TERRIBLE currently. The frame rate drops are ridiculous and it lags so bad once you get 2000+ guests in your park. It has a terrible game breaking bug that causes your mechanics and staff to get stuck at the exit of a ride when trying to repair it - or they get stuck trying to leave their building... so guess what! nothing can get fixed and your park becomes a horrible disaster that servers nothing but food and overpriced toilet use. You can pick them up, but then they teleport back to the spot they were stuck in. Also any roller coaster you have causes EVERY single person to puke when they get off... yes EVERY SINGLE ONE. So your guests are never happy when leaving a ride (after puking themselves) and walking through a mountain of every other persons vomit in the park. The cleaning staff cannot keep up unless you over-hire and cause yourself to go bankrupt from staff wages. WAIT UNTIL THE GAME IS NOT IN EARLY ACCESS TO PURCHASE!! unless you want to pay for a game with a new glitch or bug around every corner and you end up refunding it anyways from pure frustration.			"

Early Access Review
								We can take for granted that an early access game will be rough round the edges, and we must be prepared for plenty of quirks and bugs. However one has to wonder just how far into the development this game is, when core functionality is so fundamentally broken. Take as an example, when you begin a campaign, besides a extreme stutter, which I will get into shortly, after picking one of just three areas to start in, you will often find yourself with only one build option; rides. Granted, the intention is of course that different creation options will unlock for you as you progress in the game, however on numerous occasions, besides the rides category, the other options would unlock much later than necessary (that is assuming they ever unlock). Like in the previous Rollercoaster Tycoon games, you need to place rides and shops far enough from the paths to provide space for a substantial length of an entrance queue. After placing a number of rides, you may notice that you have no means of drawing a path to them. What this leads to is hundreds of visitors entering the park after paying the £5 entrance fee, merely to walk back and forth on the small stretch of preset pathway at the entrace, getting increasingly tired and frustrated, and feeling understandably ripped off. To make things worse, if you have opened those rides in the vain hope that these visitors will get off the beaten path and make the trek across the grass to ride the helter skelter (heads up: they won't), soon enough the rides will inevitably break down simply from normal test usage. Nevermind, you can get mechanics on the job because it looks like the Buildings category finally opened up! Oh wait, you can't build a pathway. Right, that's really brought things to a halt.The interface adds insult to injury when notifications pop up, giving you a series of requests like ""hey, it's kinda dark, can you please add some lamps?"" or ""hey your customers can't get to this ride, can you build a pathway to it?"", and ""hey, your ride has broken down, can you get your mechanics on it?"" - And my response to them all is ""I WOULD IF YOU LET ME!"".In spite of this locked interface bug occurring a couple of times for me, I was lucky enough to start a campaign where the interface did function normally, and all the features unlocked for me within a reasonable time, more or less consistently. Besides the slightly cumbersome building/ride rotation mechanic (an 8 way snapping rotation would be preferable), and the fact that the auto rotation assignment (based upon the path you are placing the building next to) works less than half the time, the game actually feels surprisingly functional in spite of those finnicky issues. As for the coaster creation, it is fantastic! I had a blast designing an intricate coaster with ease. However it can be a little tedious to keep testing the ride every time you make a change to ensure that it works. It would be preferable if there were a feature that allowed you to simply test the last segment that you added, rather than the whole ride from the begining. Indeed, it does not seem to be far-fetched to assume a finished product could be comparable to Cities: Skylines in terms of quality and design. There will undoubtedly need to be a lot more in the way of content, as there is not even close to the amount of building and ride option or design variation compared with the previous Rollercoaster Tycoon games- but of course a lack of content is to be expected in early access. Perhaps one thing which really leaves a gaping hole, is the lack of in-depth creation. For example, the paths are laid with a line-drawing tool rather than a grid system which prevents creating little patio areas or plazas by hand, forcing you to use the preset ones. I am not sufficiently convinced that this will be changed in future patches or indeed upon the final game's release, because the Tycoon game industry seems to be moving towards this more ""accessible"" route, at the cost of player's creativity. I noticed this with Thrillville and Zoo Tycoon and other games of this style, but I would love Rollercoaster Tycoon World to prove me wrong and break away from this trend. I mentioned before that the game was stuttering. Although my PC's hardware is decidedly outdated for this 'generation', the parts exceeded the minimum and recommended specs for the game. For perspective, I can run Cities Skylines on Very High settings with smooth and responsive performance, even when my city spans across 5 regions and is filled with tens of thousands of people. I can also run Grand Theft Auto V at very high settings at around 50FPS. So, I cannot say I was not disappointed that the performance for Rollercoaster Tycoon World is abysmal. The game is not bad looking (though I'd argue not nearly as attractive or impressive as Cities Skylines), it is perhaps the best looking theme park tycoon game, and to be honest, it is a more up-close and personal style of tycoon game, with far more attention to detail than others in the same vein, with a naturally more dynamic environment. When you zoom into your park, you can get a lot closer than many tycoon games usually allow, and you can witness how the branches of palm trees sway in the wind,  a person behind the desk at a ride's entrace with the ride's buttons and controls, and see the little gate swing open for the customers, see kids running with excitement holding the balloons or other souvenirs they bought, etc. I expect that the finished product will look beautiful with just a hint of polish here and there, and perhaps a bit more detail in buildings and shops (most of the shops are identicle besides the large mascot/statue on the top). I would, for example, to see t shirts actually displayed in the window of the t shirt shops, and fridges with drinks actually displayed in the drink stalls, and burgers being made in the burger stalls. I recall the game The Movies by Lionhead allowed you to zoom into a burger stall and see a man actually cooking the individual burgers.... that was over a decade ago, so I am sure that in the $CURRENT_YEAR, it shouldn't be too much to request that the team behind RCTW are able to put at least a similar amount of effort into detail that Lionhead was able to achieve 11 years ago. But sadly, even if they did, that would only make the performance issues worse. It is already extremely uncomfortable for people who even meet the recommended system requirements, and even more-so when you choose to speed-up time. Freezes, unresponsive UI and generally horrendous stutter are present even on lower graphics settings. In conclusion, there is a lot that needs to be fixed and improved. I would certainly recommend fanatics of the franchise to get the early access game if they have ridiculously strong hardware, as when the game GUI is not misbehaving, the game shows a lot of promise and it is certainly quite enjoyable. I apologise if most of the review is criticizing rather than praising, but I felt that the negative did outweigh the positive for the most part. So, unless you fall into the category of ""fanatic with future-proofed hardware"", avoid the game for now but keep your eye on it, as I expect great things to come. If by the game release, there is a solution to whatever is undermining performance, the content is greatly expanded upon, the visuals are a little more refined, there is more free-rein and features that enable creativity and of course providing the remaining bugs are ironed out, I have no doubt that this game could be absolutely amazing. Especially with Steam Workshop support. Don't let us down, people, you know what you need to do!			"

Early Access Review
								I really really wanted to like this game, and now after playing the PlanetCoaster alpha early release I may be a bit clouded but this game lacks improvement, and growth after such a long time of un-comparable theme park sim/roller coaster park simulations. You know you have problems when a really early PlanetCoaster build is far more polished and feature rich than RollerCoaster Tycoon Worlds beta early build.All of the comments and opinions I have are with me knowing that yes it is an early access/release. Although I know this, it really isn't an excuse considering we have passed the original full game release date, and second full game release date.RollerCoaster Tycoon World severely lacks customization, and depth. Everything about it seems dull, and dumb (not like this game is dumb, but nothing in it seems smart, guests, employees, rides, etc). Everything just seems like its moving a long a set path with no real logic or process to give it a unique feel. Guests still hover around as if they are on an inviseable hovercraft, they are generic, and not very creative. There is no joy in the guests eyes, just walking ""sticks"".The rides look quite a bit better than the previous incarnation of RCT, but still lack a bit of a real feel, and detail. It is almost like they took what made the rides tick in RCT3, and threw a new graphic on them. IN theme parks/amusement parks some rides in a park will be the same ole spin and go up and down, but other rides do not necessarily have a pattern to them. I may be splitting hairs here, but after so many years what did you bring us that was new and imaginative? Not much.Objects, paths and scenary are a pain in the butt to use. Paths are finicky on where they can connect to each other, and you will find sceneary won't attach in that one special spot you saved open just for that particular piece of scenary. Unless you are a master of the poorly implemented way to use the paths tool, or plop sceneary expect to be spending a lot of time deleting things, replacing paths, and starting over on parts of the park if you are a detail oriented person. I could go on for awhile, but I will just say this.The game lacks depth, and ties you up in regards to creativity, and customization. If you are happy with just throwing down rides, making money on peeps, and cleaning up garbage, then you may not think this is to bad of a game, but to be honest there are better games that are 12+ years older than this one that will give you that experience. I don't feel like I wasted my money as I still hope the devs put it into high gear and turn this franchise around, but it is really looking bleak at this point. They have a whole heck of a lot of work ahead and them if they want this franchise to survive. I have a feeling though they pretty much just killed it. The new champions of the theme park tycoon series I have a feeling isn't going to be Atari.			"

								As a long time fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, it really sucks that I have to give this review. I've been patient, given Atari plenty of leniency after reading all of their blog posts, and I actually bought the game expecting to get something that's at least enjoyable to play. (Luckily I got it for $30AU elsewhere)Sadly, that is not the case. After months of broken promises of the full release of the game, we get this steaming hot mess in Early Access instead. And it's not fun.The peeps look horrendous and the animations are all awkward, and there are quite a few instances where staff will appear to glide across the map. When you scroll out completely the peeps look like pixels moving jaggedly.The coaster builder, while innovative, is really not that pleasant to work with. While I enjoy being offered more flexibility in building a roller coaster, I still have a very hard time getting the pieces to work just how I want them to, and it doesn't integrate well with the piece-by-piece builder - which, by the way, doesn't have the option to place pre-built banked curves. Moreover, there's no way to change the speed of a whole section of chain lift at the same time - Why isn't this feature present here when it was present in all previous RCT games.The stalls are oversized, the transition from individual staff to staff-rooms is terrible, the path system, while innovate, also lacks from terrible implementation and lack of piece-by-piece building, the rides look tacky, blah blah blah...I could go on for ages, but to sum it up, it's...not fun to play at all. I'm not vibing it like I did with the first 3 installments, and I honestly would have faith in this game, but considering the amount of times Atari's been blowing smoke up our♥♥♥♥♥ I can't give credit to anything they say anymore. AAA game my♥♥♥♥♥ Mattlab.I could only justify buying the game if it was $10, but that's stretching it. Don't waste your time on this game right now. If you have a real itch to immerse yourself in a beautiful theme park sim, fork out the extra money for Planet Coaster.			"

								While leaps and bounds better than what they threw at us back in October, this game is still lacking any sort of strong feeling. If anything, this is what they should have started with. While all the features are there, even more bugs are present. Paths to not work properly, peeps look awful, the camera feels worse than a classic N64 camera. Coaster builder again, while much much better, is still a disaster, and the camera doesn't make trying to build exactly the way you want it any easier. Placing a premade track piece, and then going into freeform mode causes the previous piece to deform and angle awkwardly. Nothing is very streamlined at this point.I have not tried anything else other than placing a few flat rides and staff buildings (another thing that shouldn't have been included, as it takes up already insufficient space); because the game crashed when trying to change the options.This game needs at LEAST another 8 months in development to get everything sorted out, and done right.As many have already said, Planet Coaster is already 1000x what this is looking to be. I hate to be one to compare between two different games, but it's really true. If you want a good Theme Park simulator, or even just want to be able to build cool, interesting (not to mention large) coasters, RCTW is not for you. Hats off to Nvizzio for trying, but you've missed the mark for a second time.Cheers everyone, see you in Planet CoasterUpdated 11-23-2016: Felt like giving this game another go, since surely the extra months would help right? Wrong, so very wrong. You think they spent that extra time working on this game, wrong again. They decided ""Hey RCTW is already horrible so lets use that money we scammed dedicated fans to develop another mobile game!""Upon trying to start up the game, it crashed. 8 times. Needless to say I will never be installing this game again. Atari, what happened to you?			"

								So I decided to ignore all the bad reviews, and buy into a franchise that I have grown up with (I think RCT 1 was the first ever game I bought on PC), and like everyone else, I am bitterly dissapointed.I got the bug where the game crashes at 57%, followed Seifer's guide, and fixed that. Brilliant, now I can play the game. Nope. All I can see is a pink screen. Followed another guide by Seifer, and this fixed the pink screen. Brilliant, now I can play the game. Nope. Every time I go to place a ride, I have to have it elevated by 8-9m before it will recognise a valid placement, meaning I can only create parks on stilts. I don't even care about the graphics or lag or how it doesn't offer as much as RCT3 or all the other complaints. I just want a game that works. I spent £30 to be met with constant crashes and errors. My play time is so low because the game just won't work.  "

								In it's current state, I simply cannot recommend this. Being an RCT vet, playing all the previous games, I was very happy to learn that they were releasing a reboot to this franchise that I hold dear. While I do still have some hope that this will be a great game at full release (assuming it doesn't get stuck in pre-release limbo), the game has too many problems right now, ranging from very bad staff AI to terrain sculpting bugs, lack of customization for rides and coasters, to very barebones instructions for what you have to do.The one somewhat redeemable feature is the coaster builder. After some headaches figuring out how to use it (again, the game does not explain very well how to do so), I was able to build a pretty sweet coaster looping around a lake with plenty of inversions, loops, and the like. If they can get the AI fixed and bring back all the customization for rides from the previous games, this could still be a good game. Then again, maybe that's why they added mod support.Anyway, it's at most a 4/10 right now. Save your money for now.			"

								I know the game is only in Early Access, but it was originally set to release in early 2015. I've been a longtime fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise, but unfortunatley, this game is major letdown and disgrace to the RollerCoaster Tycoon name. Maybe someday this game will reach a point where it is polished and refined, but currently, I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing it.			"

And where the heck did the free construction playmode go to? I HAD a save, it is gone, just GONE! This game is a disaster!			"

Early Access Review
								I have been a die hard RCT fan my whole life. I still play RCT3 all the time, 12 years after its release. I have been following RCTW since it was first roumered, and I was extremely excited for it. I had waited over a decade for a new RCT installment, so you can imagine my anticipation for this game. I am sad to say that this game is not good. I was okay with it being released in early access rather than a finished game, but it isn't even close to ready. I was expecting all of the features of RCT3, plus a plethera of new features, rides, scenery, interface, and better graphics. This game has none of that. It is basically a stripped down version of RCT3. There are hardly any rides, there are less themes than there were in previous games, the graphics are bad, and it is poorly optimized (it freezed and lags on my PC that can play virtually any game on ultra settings). On top of all that, the path system and the terrain system are totally broken. They claim to fix it them in every update, but it still doesnt work. The best part about the RCT series was that you were able to imagine a dream park, and then build that exact park. RCTW doesn't let you do that, and most final products come out uglier and more awkward looking than you imagined. As of right now, I cannot recommend this game. I don't know what Atari was thinking charging $50 for a game that is years away from being complete. If I were you, I would pre-order Planet Coaster. It looks like they will be releasing a complete game with all the features we want.  "

Early Access Review
								As a huge RCT fan, this is a tough one. On one hand this game is (head scratchingly) in early access. On the other hand, they've had multiple games in the series to pull from in terms of content and roadmapping as well as several delays before the official release date. As an early access game, it's not bad. It's completely playable with the money and simulation basics in there to actually run a park.However, as an RCT game it is a major letdown. We were promised an evolution in the series and what's here is simply the framework for the next step. Is that a bad thing? Not exactly, if something isn't broke then don't fix it. But it's nowhere near what Planet Coaster is doing. Right now you have 3 themes and over half of the scenery/props are locked. I'm not sure if they are locked behind some sort of in-game system or locked out because they aren't finished yet... the game doesn't say. My park ran smoothly enough for me but after I had built 3 coasters and 8 flat rides, I had 1,300 peeps in my park. At one point my menu disappeared so I had to exit out and reload from the main menu. After it sluggishly reloaded, the framerate was in the single digits. Making it unplayable in my eyes.As for the coaster builder, I didn't care for it much at first. I made a clunky and ugly first coaster. The second was a bit better and the third was almost exactly what I wanted. It's not a bad system and I actually think it works great once you learn how to use it. You can attach set pieces, just like in the older RCT games, or you can go off the grid and make whatever you want! You just have to play with it. So, the coaster builder is on the short list of positives for this game.The biggest problems I see right now is the amount of content, lack of in depth management tools (staff management, etc.), ugly peeps, and poor optimization. Luckily these are things that can be addressed and fixed. The menus aren't particularly eye pleasing but that's not a big deal.Also, the mission objectives that are given to you in game are so HUGE they sometimes occupy 75% of the screen so you can't look at the tasks while playing with your park. You have to look at them, close it out, try to finish the task, then open it back up to see the next one. It's mind bogglingly annoying!The truth is that there is a lot of potential here but right now it's not worth the asking price. Wait for a sale or the full version to see if they can polish this up a bit.			"

								As of now I do not recommend it.The performance is poor when you make a big park and there is a huge lack in available amusements which are NOT rollercoasters. Furthermore, building roads can be VERY difficult since it often wants to snap to another place that's somewhere else.If you don't mind these things then go ahead and buy it. But I do not like it as much as I like Rollercoaster Tycoon 3. And it's nowhere near worth the price of 45 euro.			"

								I bought this game long time ago and all negative reviews are true this is a very sub standerd, in my opinion even unplayable, game. However ATARI is very generous in refunding the money releasing in early acces long after the promised release date. Here comes my real problem, steam isn't giving back the refund to their customers. The reason they give is that they can't pay out money spend so long ago. Wich is a strange reason since in this case buying a long time ago is  one of the main gounds for the refund. There are enough ways to pay back this money and in my opinion this makes it stealing from your customers. So my advise NEVER buy something on steam you can't try out immediately because even when the developer grants you a refund steam will not give you back your money.			"

												This is no Rollercoaster Tycoon  1 & 2 but it is a much improved RCT 3. As this is a Beta I dont wanna compare this to any full released game, I love these types of games and for me the wait of 10 years for a new one is far too long, I have played 5 hours so far and im mostly pleased, yes we have bugs, yes the building off a coaster is tricky to understand to begin with, but as this is a next gen RCT you can expect a more realistic feel to building a theme park.  The physics of the building on a coaster is demanding and you do need to thing about physics of bends, speed, gforce etc, so lets hope they can improve the buidling system, maybe some instructions to help people who are having trouble.

Early Access Review
								At first glance (30 mins in) I am a bit disapointed. Remembering though that it is EARLY ACCESS - but also remembering that they were going to release the game about now as 'finished'.Definitly not a finished game. Graphic issues everywhere. Glitchy and lots of clipping around the place. Peeps tend to hover and not walk about. Staff members do the same. Paths clip. The on-coaster Cam needs a fair bit of work - there is no detail in the coaster, but the scenery is good looking a far.The ambience is a bit quiet or sterile so far. It seems pretty dull for a theme park, even with a few hundred people in. You dont hear the hum of people, just the random moans and screams of some ladies - which sounds like pornography tbh. And lots of money cha-ching noises from your rides. I was expecting a bit more immersion and realism.At this stage I'm on the fence. Im not excited but it has some potential. I am considering a refund and trying Planet Coaster Alpha instead - it looks more polished. I would give it probably a 5.5 to a 6/10 in its current state, but I will give it more of a go over the next few days and update. My advice though... is to wait. The Atari team could turn this around and make it into something great.*UPDATE* I gave this game a really good go and played for a few hours and have decided on requesting a refund. Already I feel I have played enough and done everything. It doesnt feel like an RCT game - theres no atmosphere. The coaster builder and camera is also horrible and VERY hard to use. 3hrs into the game and I dont feel like playing anymore - now you all know thats not right - not to mention my fingers are sore from clicking (the bulldose system sucks too).I may consider re-purchasing down the track if there are some significant improvements, but until then, the Planet Coaster Alpha actually looks a lot better than this is in its current state, so Id suggest at least taking a peek at that. The best way to describe it is: RCTW = SimCity 5 (a major let down). Im hoping Planet Coaster = City Skylines.			"

												So I played the game over the weekend pretty much none stop and I can say I was super excited about this game. The graphics are pretty awesome.I like some of the news things they have put into this game but it still is nothing like the original. Which to me this is a good and bad thing. It is great that we have so much more customization to this game. Circle paths, large, small, medium paths, lights, trash cans, benches, etc.I enjoy the fact that you can make a roller coaster now almost as you wish and it is not constrained as it was in the old Roller Coaster Tycoon. But with that being said, the magic of the old games is not completely present here.I want to build a roller-caster, test, add my scenery, my queue and be off. I don't want to spend almost 2 hours on building a coaster and than not be able to finish it because my train car is always hitting a bar that was placed in the wrong area by the game. I don't want to spend close to an hour and a half just to complete laying out my track. I want to put able to select the section of the track and place it how I like. There are alot of advantages to this new UI and I do recognize them but I am not a roller coaster designer. I am a average player that wants to build a roller coaster in the game as quickly and have it enjoyable. At the point, it is not that enjoyable to build a roller coaster because it is super frustrating.Here is an example on why it is so frustrating, If I am building my roller coaster and I am zoomed out to see what it looks like. If I click on a portion of the map where i would like for my track to be laid, that game from now where lays a very large piece of track randomly that the end of the new piece of track is laid down all the way to the edge of the park. WHAT?!!!!! That is not what I wanted. Now I have to zoom back in to make the track smaller, than angle the camera just right, and than either shift and any of the 4 number to adjust the track as I want. That is just ridiculous.If you are going to show a grid, as I like building on a grid, don't give me just a small piece of grid. Just display it on the whole map.For sure there is a learning curve for this game. But so far my initial review of this game is not all the stellar when building coaster. This is something that is NOT going to change for this is pretty much the hole core of the game.I am still at a maybe..... I wouldn't recommend this game but at the same time if you are a die hard fan as I am, I wouldn't turn you away either.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWSo here is the thing, I love this series, all the way from RCT to RCT3 and the process that this game took to get here caused me to cancel my pre-order, buy Planet Coaster and play it on release date. However after the launch I got curious and re-purchased the game and here is what I think....NVIZZIO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO!!!!Pro's:Well it feels like it tries to be RCTArea themes are goodand well in my opinion that's about it for pro'sCons:*UPDATED 16/9/2016*THE COASTER BUILDER IS A LOAD OF BULL - How did you screw this up??? Press 1 and scroll mouse wheel to raise and lower, press 2 and scroll mouse wheel to tilt, press 3 and scroll mouse wheel to pitch and pressing 4 and you guessed it scroll that mouse wheel and it does something else. This is the WORST coaster builder I have used, its just so clunky and time consuming compared to, dare I say it, Planet Coaster's which they hid in Beta due to they thought it wasn't great but let me tell you it is the quickest precise builder I have used. It systems don't fully work, I struggled to get two trains running on one track, it kept failing with no information on how to fix it, the coaster preview while building is clunky, you click to build and then the preview of the next piece dissapears, it only reappears once you click and then click to build again. It's just pretty much, in my opinion, the worst coaster builder I have ever used.THE RIDES - Okay I get it realism is in but they just don't feel real and oh no the signs, the terrible ride signs. Yes you can rename and it shows up on the sign but there is just no character to them. It feels robotic and no this wasn't a sci fi theme.THE GRAPHICS - Just no, this is not 2016 worthy level of graphics, I can see that maybe you were trying to capture the feel of RCT3, or it's just an ""optimization"" thing but seriously that's why the game was delayed and it STILL SUCKS.********************************NEW**************************************************** THE LOAD TIME - Oh I could make a cup of tea and drop it onto my expensive PC by the time finally kicks itself into gear and you know the fun part?? Becaus of how great Unity is, if your graphics settings are incorrect or you want to tweak, you have to EXIT YOUR PARK, do the tweaks and then you guesssed it, WAIT FOR THE THING TO FREAKIN LOAD AGAIN!!!PATCH CONTENT - I'm getting increasingly worried now, it's been a few months out now in the world of play testing and I'm really not seeing improvements. Yes more rides and buildings have been added, do they look nice and attractive? No, graphic style has not had an update, it still looks like poop and zoom out and all your peeps become pixels that jutter to their destination. They released grid building and customisable buildings, but Planet Coaster had that from day one! Too late on that part, whether it was always part of the plan or added so that the game could keep the players it still has, whatever the reason it was too late and, in my opinion, badly done.Just general things don't seem to be improving, comparing it to Parkitecht and Planet Coaster whose updates have been consistent and fix bugs but add new exciting features and improve graphical quality all the time. They seem to be striving for the best while RCTW seems to be hanging on to the lifesaver surrounded by sharks.Below is my original closer and it still stands apart from my belief now that this game will never be at that high standard, in fact my belief is that the developers have given up. They are making this to an acceptable level where they can retain maybe a few people but enough so that Atari aren't on their backs and then dumped, never to be updated again for the trouble it has caused. Somewhere inside me, for the sake of the name of RCT, I hope I'm wrong.**********************************************************************************************This game could have been great, COULD HAVE BEEN, but competition in the market from Planet Coaster and even Parkitecht did not do this game well. I mean Planet Coaster literally beats it on every level, yes it has flaws but that's what development time is for, RCTW HAS HAD 3 F***ING YEARS TO GET THIS RIGHT AND 3 DEVELOPERS. Seriously get this game to the high standard it now has to live up to or congrats to Nvizzio for killing off one of the most beloved franchises of Theme Park building.			"

								As another reviewer pointed out, this isn't early access, it's a paid alpha test. The game is SLOW, and I mean slow. I would be happy to blame my computer, but when I play MMO's with all the graphics on high quality and have them run smoothly, I doubt that's it. Because it's so slow, everything is glitch. Camera angles are impossible to control well, rides and pathways can't be placed easily. I'm hoping it gets better.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit: The RCTW developers have actually been very proactive in communicating with the community and fixing what needs to be fixed. Since this review was written, there have been several bug fixes and graphical improvements made to the game. While the game still has it's slew of bugs and some needed changes to gameplay (the path system still sucks but they're working on a redesign), it is better than when it first launched. While I still can't recommend this game in it's current state, I have no doubt that if Nvissio continues to act on the feedback of the players, this will actually turn into a worthy successor in the RCT franchise.Graphics: 6/10 Better looking than its twelve year old predecessor, but still dated for 2016 Gameplay: 4/10While the coaster builder is fun, bugs and minor annoyances detract from its overall enjoyment and poor optimization means even the most powerful computer might only scratch 15 fps.Series Innovation: 5/10While a lot was added to this entry (fully customizable coaster builder, restaurants, curved and larger size paths) a lot was also taken away. The amount of rides and coaster styles you can build is less than what it was in its predecessors, and you can’t build rides that go underground or roller coasters that don’t connect to the end (e.g shuttle loops).Overall: 5/10Rollercoaster Tycoon World (RCTW) has the potential to be a worthy addition to the famed Rollercoaster Tycoon (RCT) series, but in it's current state it's bogged down by bugs, missing features, and a stack of minor annoyances which shouldn't exist in a game after two years of development.I absolutely loved the first three RCT games and in 2014 when RCTW was first announced I was excited to see what the newest game could bring after ten years of new and improved gaming technology. Then the original developer was replaced, and the replacement developer was also replaced and the release date for RCTW kept getting pushed back from its initial “early 2015” date. Finally, at the end of Q1 in 2016, Nvissio and Atari released their Early Access Beta, a year after originally planned, and still not the final release. After playing RCTW for a couple of hours, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed in the progress that has been made after two years. While the graphics are improved from it’s predecessor, RCT3, the game does look dated for 2016 and what game engines and computers are capable of (at a 1GB download I was kind of expecting that). Polygon reduction when zooming out is very noticeable, and trees go from leafy to a three shaded blob without any middleground. Additionally, the park visitors just look kind of… weird. They have a tendency to run almost wildly flailing their arms which just looks funny and the look only marginally better than their now twelve year senior counterparts. Rides on the other hand do look much better than back in 2004, but look more like they would be in a game released four or five years ago, not now.The game is hampered by a number of bugs, with many people reporting that the game won’t load past 57% ( I have not had this issue myself). Additionally, there are issues with the game freezing and crashing at random times during gameplay, and on the “Frolicking Forest” map, the terrain editor only removes the polygons of the terrain and you still can’t place paths or rides unless they are above the previous terrain height.Gameplay wise, it’s actually kind of fun but there are a lot of annoyances that really cut away at it after only a few minutes. The coaster builder is pretty fun, but it’s also pretty hard to just get a straight line out of it. It would also benefit from having a stand alone coaster builder built into the game instead of only having the option to load a map and build it during a game. Additionally, for a “beta” there is a wide variety of shops and stalls, but it is very limited ride wise, with only a handful of roller coaster styles and a few different “flat rides” with varying scenery to choose from which seems interesting considering it’s a game built around building rides at its core. Additionally, the roller coasters have to connect, no more building shuttle loops for an easy payday. The main annoyance that’s been plaguing me is that there is no area demolish. Every bush, shrub, and tree that is there when the map loads needs to be individually clicked on to destroy, with is rather tedious. I do like that there are now larger paths that can be built, but there are times when the game won’t let me make a straight path, especially when making a short path that connects to another path. Another annoyance is that you have to build shops and stalls offset from the main path, and have to build a path to connect it to the main path which adds in an extra step and is also tedious, especially when your path doesn’t want to just go straight.Playing RCTW, you can see hints of the potential that this entry has, and with some polish and more development work, I do think that this can be a good game. However, with the way Atari has been treating this game over the past two years, I don’t really believe any major amount of progress will be made, and the game will forever be one of those “What could have been” examples.

Early Access Review
								This game still has a lot of problems. At this moment it's really an early access. There are really some good things about the game, the way you can design you're own rollercoasters looks good and is fun to play with. The paths are a lot better than in RTC3, you kan now make corners and lay them down as you like them, make them bigger or smaller.It works and looks OK, but it does not make me really excited about the game yet.The controls are really bad. Most is done through the keyboard, it works but the right combination of mouse and keyboard makes it really easy to control.The mouse controls you have like zooming in with the scroll wheal is way to sensitive. When giving it a single little scroll it goes all the way down or up. Maybe it's a setting, but I would expect this to work like it should with basic settings. I have found the side screen scrolling with the mouse, so that makes it somewhat better, but overall the controls are really not great yet. The graphics are not great, it looks OK, but it's not the graphics you expect from a game today. Beside that it the graphical performance is not so good. Lot's of frame rate drops.Peeps are sometimes walking of the paths trough bushes and trees and some look like there are floating over the path.Sounds are missing from peeps when you ride allong. Sometimes when you ride allong with a rollercoaster you keep hearing the lift chain all the way in the ride.But at the other hand I think this game can have a lot of potential, but it does have a long way to go.If they make the graphics better and put some time in bug fixing, better controls and some more content and senarios to play it really can be a nice game to play.I would not recommend the game yet at this moment, the main reason for this is especially the price and what you get for it at the moment. On the other hand, if they will really make the game a lot better to play in the upcomming months with more content and features without extra costs the price is acceptable, but that's is something you will only know in time.

												I remember how much I loved playing RollerCoaster Tycoon when I was a kid. So many good memories ! Last week I learned that there was a new game of Roller Coaster ! So cool ! So happy ! Yay for the nostagical me ! But...This game is a complete waste of money and time. After only two hours of playing, the game just stoped working. (I was at the « Influencer challenge », you know, when you have to buy a souvenir shop for kids ?) Okay, this happens sometimes. I tried launching the game again. After clicking « resume », it stoped working. Okay... Maybe something wrong happened. I tried launching another park. Same thing. I even desinstalled the game and reinstalled it. Rebooting my computer. (which is not the problem, since I just bought it a few months ago) Same thing. Plus, the game isn't THAT good either and I am so bored with the bugs. Really, I do not recommend this game. I asked for a refund, since I just bought this game last week. I hope I will receive the money back soon. Right now I am downloading Planet Coaster, and I hope for a better experience ! A review of Planet Coaster will follow.			"

												Just don't buy it. I'd love a refund, but whatever I'll just leave my thumb down review here instead... The game is simply impossible to play properly. I purchased it while the early access and it was full of glitches, game would crash when the park was getting loaded. It was early access, so i told myself alright just wait a few months and try play it again later.And here I am, a few months later. I start the game and it's still full of glitches or annoying things. Again, the game freezes randomly, or when I try modify the keys setting. I also started to play the sandbox mode, and the camera got stuck out of the park, and I cannot move it at all. I mean, come on... I tried everything in game, I am just stuck : http://puu.sh/sYbbR/209bc06304.jpgI also let my nephew play the game a few hours, I think he had to start over like 3 times because the game would freeze.I am really disappointed, I had great memories from RCT3...

								Sorry, I'm really sorry I have to change my review, I gave it a positive but now that I've thought about it this has to get a negative, I mean it's must have been on the drawing board since at least 2014 ready for a release in December 2015, we are fast approaching to end April 2016 and it's been demoted to early access, yes the graphics are good, but there's very little content, after all this time there should be hundreds of rides and coasters, I bought the Deluxe Edition back in October last year, and now i wish I waited. Maybe a few dozen updates might improve my rating on the game, but for its back to RCT3. It's a real shame really.			"

Early Access Review
								This is hugely dissapointing. Finally another edition to the iconic loved series comes along and this is bearing in mind i played the beta weekends and felt disappointed then, it hasn't got any better. GAMEPLAY - Load times are somewhat slow, i run on a i7-4790k, GTX 970, 16GB RAM and just loading a blank sandbox park takes me 42 seconds, yeah not the end of the world but loading a blank park.. Lots of framerate drops too for seemingly no reason. I see no difference in the gameplay mechanics, the grid facility is pointless as it doesn't match up with anything, they say they completely overhauled the coaster builder since the beta. Well again i see no difference in the coaster builder now compared to the beta, it's really not good, it's incredibly difficuilt to get any smooth turns/curves/corners. Alot of placements of objects, scenery, paths etc. aren't 'allowed' when there is nothing blocking them from being placed. It's just frustrating, it's all these features that are the most fundamental part of the game and they still just don't work. Everything is just very tedious and frustrating to do, it should be easy! But instead, i feel it's very very poor.GRAPHICS - I wouldn't even go as far to say that they are OK, i understand graphics aren't everything, however after Roller Coaster Tycoon 3's release date of October 26th 2004 the graphics feel like more of a remaster apposed to up to date graphics. It just feels lazy, and it simply doesn't look refreshing or exciting. Nothing new or high tech going on here. Framerate drops all over the place even on low settings, changing graphical settings hasn't seemed to help in any scenario.CONTENT - Unfair to say considering it is now in early access and more content will be released, but don't expect a lot to begin with. There is barely a campaign. There are specific 'scenarios' such as 'Turn a failed park around' which are ok but not exactly a lot of thought put in here either. A sandbox mode which is great to have still so thats a positive!! FEATURES - Really the only noteable new good feature, is the curved paths and having the ability to not be restricted by a grid (however as previously said, neither work as you'd expect) other than that, there isn't a lot of difference. The social hub is a good idea to be able to share creations but i haven't seen it working yet so i can't comment.OVERALL - Bringing the franchise back again sounds like a fantastic idea, and what the developers are telling us and raising our hopes for just hasn't happened. Everything feels lazy and sloppy, just as if there is no passion put in anymore. It's such a disappointment, if you are a Roller Coaster Tycoon fan i can't imagine you are going to feel anything but disappointment which i hate to say. Once again, it's early access so there are features yet to come so this is as of now, but considering it has been delayed and now shoved in early access. Things don't look good.			"

								Atari, Atari, Atari. What have you done to the RollerCoaster Tycoon name... How many years, and how many developers, and you come up with this? Even with your focus groups for a year you couldn't fix these bugs? Freeform path building is broken, ride animations are terribly bugged, the coaster builder is actually not very easy to use, food buildings are literally the same design as each other with a different food item on top, peeps are weird and sometimes don't show up, the prebuilt coasters are boring and look like they were designed by a child intern, and above all, the game is poorly optimized. Even on a high powered PC, the graphics are just mediocre. What I do like is the selection of facades, foliage, etc. and the financial statistics, but that does not justify a $50 purchase from anyone at this point. I thought that waiting this long meant that the game would be ready, but I was so wrong. Maybe I will purchase it again one day, but I am requesting a refund. 2.5/10			"

								I never thought that a game that came out so long after the previous could be this much worse. The paths are so wonky and dont really make sence ( they should let you adjust the angle of the curve better and choose the size). The snapping is horrible. It's so laggy. The coaster builder makes no logical sense with the shift and scroll and it's so hard to make the coaster like you want. There isnt enough scenery things. the fences are so difficult to build. the grid doesnt work so well (should be able to make it much bigger). There isnt enough coasters or rides. Last of all you can't build your own buildings anymore. Worst game I'd rate it a 3/10. They should have just replicated rct3 and boosted the graphics or something and made curved paths because this is pathetic. I hope they fix everything and add features because i'm buying planet coaster otherwiswe. Are we still able to get refunded and if so, how.			"

								Just don't buy this game if you're a fan of the original series.I feel like this game is a complete letdown and I will explain why:- First; The Coaster builder is terrible. Yes, they added the familiar piece-by-piece building that we all know form the original games. Which is fine. The spline based coaster builder is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The main issue that I have is that the piece you are forming is attached to the camera. So when I'm building a coaster, have the piece where I want it, and want to check from another angle I can't because the piece will slide along.  Furthermore, I've spend 10 minutes to tweak the brakes in order to make the coaster pass the test. I don't want to spend 10 minutes on tweaking the brakes; in real life if a coaster has it's desired speed it will open the brakes and let the train pass through. The stations are troublesome too as I can't change the length of them. So if I want to have a compact coaster I can't because the station is gicantic. Other strange things will happen to your coaster as well in freeform mode; supports where going straight through the tracks and my axes where inverted at some point so every new piece I placed was all messed up.

Paths won't connect to the places I want them. In the previous installments you could snap paths together to make a plaza, this isn't possible in this game either. Also the three widthts are way too limited.- The guests look terrible. Even horror movies are less scarier than these mutants. They can't be drowned as well, but I'm not counting that.And finally, but most important: The game is missing all the charm that the previous installments had. And I think that is the part where this game really dissapoints me most. A utter shame, luckily I can still play the old versions and I will continue to do so as this piece of empty software is not worth both my time and my attention.

								Just don't buy this game if you're a fan of the original series.I feel like this game is a complete letdown and I will explain why:- First; The Coaster builder is terrible. Yes, they added the familiar piece-by-piece building that we all know form the original games. Which is fine. The spline based coaster builder is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The main issue that I have is that the piece you are forming is attached to the camera. So when I'm building a coaster, have the piece where I want it, and want to check from another angle I can't because the piece will slide along.  Furthermore, I've spend 10 minutes to tweak the brakes in order to make the coaster pass the test.

								I never thought that a game that came out so long after the previous could be this much worse. The paths are so wonky and dont really make sence ( they should let you adjust the angle of the curve better and choose the size). The snapping is horrible. It's so laggy. The coaster builder makes no logical sense with the shift and scroll and it's so hard to make the coaster like you want. There isnt enough scenery things. the fences are so difficult to build. the grid doesnt work so well (should be able to make it much bigger). There isnt enough coasters or rides. Last of all you can't build your own buildings anymore. Worst game I'd rate it a 3/10. They should have just replicated rct3 and boosted the graphics or something and made curved paths because this is pathetic. I hope they fix everything and add features because i'm buying planet coaster otherwiswe. Are we still able to get refunded and if so, how.			"

								Until this game is fixed from all its bugs I wouldn't spend the money. I bought this months before it was released. Excited when I could finally play it then all hopes dashed within the 1st 5 hours. I spent $60 or so for the upgraded version of the game and well f*ck. So many bugs, I have 6 mechanics running around in assinged areas (3/per area) and only 8 rides they don't fix them, my peps are always unhappy cause of food and such yet I have more food stalls than rides, notifications that park is always dark ( I have more lamp post in the area than a city street does) Just don't waste your $$ they kept pushing the game back and when they finally did release you'd have more fun watching paint dry, I waited for more updates and they just cause more glitch's.

								Ok, first off - I remember going to EB games as a kid to buy the very first Chris Sawyer RCT back in around 1997. I have always been a loyal and dedicated fan of the franchise. I have spent entire summers in earlier editions of this game. I love the idea of this game!~This roller coaster tycoon...... I started playing this way back after the beta test in february. Since then, nothing much has changed. The game isnt even fully functional yet. its missing a few things still like transport and water rides, etc.. But whats worse, is that there are fundamental elements don't even work properly. I keep on trying to play it and then some bug starts ruingin everything. Today for example, in mid game - TWICE, the ability to click on rides and interact with them in any way with the mouse just completely stopped. More then one train ona track doesnt even work, hasent ever worked. Pathways are still wonky and force connect to nodes which leave you with all sorts of weird awkward results. Its just a mess... one thing gets added, two more things break. The most recent bug makes the game unplayable. I was really looking forward to this game, but with each passing day I am loosing more and more hope that this thing is ever even going to make it to a playable level...			"

								I bought this game way back in September of 2015, i was looking forward to it's release for so long. Then when it was realeased i was so excited and i couldn't wait to play it and then i seen what a crappy job they did and i couldn't believe it. (Eg: The peeps look terrible and are very glitchy, they also don't follow the path ways properly, neither does the staff.  At points the staff and guests didn't walk but they just floated around the park, the rides are very choppy and some of them don't seem fun at all. I know it's not done yet but honestly how could they think that this was good enough to release? I have loved RCT eversince the first one came out. I played this for a few days and i finally got fed up enough to the point where i just stopped playing it. What a let down, after all of this time waiting just to end up getting a kick in the junk. I thought Atari would have more heart invested into the game than this but i guess i was wrong. They need to give our money back and start over from scratch. I don't think i'll be getting my money back at this point but it's ok, i'm willing to accept that.I had already bought the final copy of Coaster Planet but this game drove me to buying the early bird access for it. Coaster Planet is amazing and it's alot easier on my nerves than RCTW was.Coaster Planet isn't done yet but it looks a hell of a lot better than this and it's clear that they do give a♥♥♥♥♥♥and care about their customers.I guess the roomers were true, Atari was just in it for the money, thanks alot.You should all be ashamed of yourselves.Unless the game gets a hell of alot better, i won't be back.

												Essentially a polished RCT3. Realism has slid even futher. For people like me, a roller coaster enthusiast, I want to create roller coasters that look and sound like the real thing... these do not. The ""hyper"" coasters can have ridiculous inversions, the spinning coaster cars spin constantly for no reason, none of the sounds are authentic, the list goes on. Flat rides operate too fast. I get it, it's for show, but all I can think of when I watch them is that people's heads would be snapping off constantly. A good game for kids and early teens who don't care much about realism.			"

								Hey there, stranger. You're probably going through all the negative comments and thinking 'Meh, people these days... the game can't be that bad. It's one of the best series I've ever played! They're just a bunch of haters!"". Welp, it can be that bad and it is. It's god awful in almost every aspect: narrow selection of attractions, weird terraforming, weird attraction and prop placing, weird peeps, TONS of bugs, etc, etc. You thought the roller coaster designer was cool? Well, only if you like testing the coaster after adding every damn segment and if you like having the carts derail for absolutely no reason. New path laying seemed promising? Nope, if you go too crazy about it the game sometimes won't even let you connect your new path to the existing ones. Oh, did I mention peeps bugging the hell out when they travel an elevated path?The game makes you wonder how bad the beta was and just what the hell the devs did for almost a year. It's like a giant middle finger directed at their customers.Seriously, I can go on for ages. Just don't buy it, don't encorage the devs.P.S.Childhood destroyed, thanks Atari.			"

								I had high hopes for this game. I thought that people were exaggerating when they claimed that not too far into the game, there would be performance issues. Unfortunately, they were not lying. About one hour into a small park I was making, the lag began to hit. At first, it was because of the short periods of the day in the game switching from day to night. I then locked it in the day phase and it had helped at first. However, not too long after, the lag continued to worsen. I understand that the game is still being worked on so hopefully they work on improving the performance issues. I know it's not my computer because it affects other users as well. On to the next topic, one thing that ruins the experience is the lack of custom buildings, like the ones in the previous games. I really miss creating buildings for my ride queues and what not. My park seems baren and the lack of decor doesn't help. I wish we had a larger selection of roller coasters as well. It'd be nice to have water rides or dark rides but they're unavailable right now. I think they should work on adding more theming and improving the performance issues. At the moment, I would not reccomend this game but hopefully in the future my opinion will change.			"

								I am a life long RCT fan, a huge fan of the series. I have player RCT 1, 2 and 3. And I have been VERY EAGERLY looking forward to RCTW!! I pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game to get the extra bits and pieces and to give some extra funds of support to Atari and Nvizzio. It was a very expensive price for a game but I thought it would be well worth it... I was wrong! Yesterday I got the game, RCTW installed and I launched it, and within the space of ten minutes I was totally deflated by what I saw... I work in software development. I have used BETA's to get feedback on software from BETA Testers. I have taken part in software BETA's and early access. And yes, the software is buggy and needs a bit of polish, but I am STUNNED that the state RCTW is currently in is what Atari and Nvizzio only recently classed as a nearly finished game that was getting some polish and optimisation. Are you serious!?! REALLY!!! I know RCTW has gone through some rough patches. It's passed through the hands of a number of developers and I have backed them all. I had real admiration for Nvizzio as I saw the work they were doing and it looked great!! But I can tell you now, the RCTW game I have on my PC right now doesn't look anything like what I saw in the videos and screenshots used to promote this game. I didn't get to play the BETA back in October as I was away, so seeing RCTW today is my first real introduction to it, but what I see in RCTW today looks worse than what I saw of the BETA. The graphics seems to have degraded completely! The peeps looks terrible!! There are animation glitches, gameplay glitches, sound glitches, and the game just doesn't grab a hold of you and make you feel good about playing it. There is no soul to the game at all. The whole atmosphere is just wrong, no, it's missing completely!! If this was BETA 2, I would have been stunned by the poor quality of it... If this was really early access I would have been stunned by the poor quality of it... But the fact that Atari have said, prior to the ""current"" early access release, that this game was nearly finished and it was just getting some polish and optimisation for release... WOW!! I can't believe that THIS is what Atari classify as being a polished 2016 PC game. So I have a question... What happened...?!? Seriously, what has happened here? How can this version of RCTW that is ""nearly finished and receiving some polish and optimisation"" look so poor, so bad, and is so buggy and holds very little fun, be considered as good enough for release as a game??? I have to be honest, I have ZERO faith in Atari and Nvizzio that they can bring this game up to a good enough standard to make it the game that it should be! I also am wondering just what have Atari and Nvizzio being doing the past few months when there was silence on the forums??? I was, at the time, hopeful that they were busy making the game great! But I certainly don't see it... I see a very poor game that is nowhere near ready for release and I find it insulting that they classed this as a nearly finished game, receiving some polish and optimisation to get it ready for release. For the record, I don't have access to the Planet Coaster ALPHA, I do have the game pre-ordered, but I can tell you now, their ALPHA looks a LOT better than the RCTW nearly ready for release game. I will keep watching to see what Atari and Nvizzio do to save RCTW but I'm not expecting a miracle to happen and that's what needs to happen. Let's be honest, if this is what they class as a game nearly finished and getting polished for release, then it's an utter shambles!			"

								Although this game is currently in 'early access' i'm not going to be too lenient on it as I originally pre-ordered it to come out in December 2015. For me, it has recreated the old 'Rollercoaster Tycoon' games but just removed the fun. Pros:- Despite what some people say, the rollercoaster builder is actually quite nice to use and I was able to create some good designs with it.- The ride cameras can sometimes be fun (if the framerate keeps up enough!)Cons (Where do I even start?):- Such a simple task of building paths is such a pain.. the game is so fussy about what connects where, and even with grid and snapping, I was unable to create a simple straight path system- The ride a building placement is equally as unpredictable, refusing to allow buildings to be placed in open areas next to paths, also not automatically joining to a path when placed directly next to one.- The staffing system has been 'dumbed down' and the janitors walk off and do what they want. You find yourself constantly building new staff buildings as the staff have seemingly disappeared and I cannot find a way to track them individually.- There is little to no customization on certain rides (especially pre-built ones).. Again, this removes a large portion of the fun.- The game seems to include food and souvineer stands from 4 set themes, limiting your creativity.- Only 3 maps that you can start from scratch on.- No autosave feature, so I lost over an hours work due to a power cut. In 2016 I would have thought this would be a standard feature?- Now for probably the biggest con.. graphics and performance... For a game that was supposedly meant to be 'retail ready' by December 2015, its appauling. The graphics look like a mobile phone game, or a PC game from 2004. Also the performance on highest settings is really bad. On my GTX 970, I can get around 30-40fps scrolling round my park. When I zoom in to watch the customers glitch around the footpaths and disappear into rides, however, i get as low as 15fps. The framerate is also very unpredictable when using the ride cams. I could go on and on about how I am disappointed by this game, but I'll cut the review here. I was looking forward to this so much last year that I didnt cancel my pre-order when I heard about the beta. I also eagerly downloaded it the minute I saw it was avaliable. I tried to enjoy the game and ignored the criticism, but all it did was make me want to play 'Rollercoaster Tycoon 2'! "

								I can't recommend this game at the moment. I was prepared for it to be different to the other RCT games but it's just no good.The staff huts don't seem to have proper pathfinding for the staff so I can have a large hut with 10 janitors and the paths are absolutely filthy. I've got about 40 janitors and mechanics in a reasonably small park but rides remain unfixed for absolutely ages and the paths are rammy. I've set the inspection times to 20 minute intervals, my rides still breakdown all the time and then remain unfixed for ages, even when right next to the mechanic hut.I can't see any way to easily see what staff I've got and where. I placed a large entertainers hut... 1 month later  (game time obvs!) I saw 2 entertainers leave the building. And there were 6 'employed' apparently but no sign of them months later.There's no way that I can see what excitement levels or intensity the rides I'm building have before I actually build them. I don't know whether I'm getting value for money or not as I used to use that information to determine how much I can charge for the ride etc. Also doesn't say how big the ride is going to be until you actually select it.I was playing the campaign on frolicking forest, deleting trees and shrubs was a frickin nightmare and levelling the ground left me with several rock outcrops that wouldn't flatten so it was a little bit pointless. You should be able to delete trees and bushes by dumping a ride on top of them and all land you own should be able to be flattened easily.I want to like this game but I don't right now. I know it's early access but it should be better than it is.			"

								Not reccommending yet anyway.... this game has promise, but at this stage that is all it is... i love the RCT series and played all of them on PC since the first and put many hours in.... The major thing for me at this stage is the coaster builder, you can do anything with it which is great, but the problem is you can do anything with it and it is so hard to build anything complex or overly quick without it going wrong... you cannot delete multiple pieces of track, you have to select each one, it is pretty much impossible to build one using the track building as per RCT3, this has taken a backwards step IMHO, the people in the game are idiots, they are complaining they are hungry outside a huge selection of food shops and still complain, there is sick everywhere and no janitors ever clean it up, you cannot scale, or amend prebuilt rides or flats, the drop tower should be much higher and you should be able to amend this to suit, no monorail or trains (Yet, hopefully they will come).... I guess the main question should be what has changed since RCT3..... not a huge amount really.. yes the GFX look a bit better and the menus are different but is it really 10 years newer???? I guess the answer is no and unless they sort the coaster builder out so it makes sense and you can do what you want to do then i guess its kind of a backwards step vs RCT and when that came out.... I hope the DEV's can bring this into the 21st century as i want this to be good, but its just a bit lacking in every department.... this is an early release so i am holding out hope but i was hoping and expecting so much more..... PS if anyone can tell me how to do a straight bit of track using the builder then im all ears!			"

								Total rubbish - Un-finished, unmarketable dross. I dont write steam reviews; Mainly becuase I am rubbish at them. In fact, my reviews are on par with the state of this game......The animations are awful and the UI is clunky. The 'Early Access' branding of this iconic game was always a mistake. Loyal fanbase back in the forum have been kept in the dark for months, but were informed by dev's the game was under going 'optmising and polish' a few weeks before the announced 'Early Access.' This was clearly an attempt to keep up with the competition, that released an Alpha before Atari and an attempt at trying to control media and user opinion with the usual cavet of 'Its early access.'Poor choices, poor devlopement and poor management have left this title lacking in all of the areas the old games excelled - Avoid right now, Come back this time next year when the title may be in Beta stage, with better graphics, performance and UI.

								This game is severly broken. Avoid at all cost! I had hoped for something so much better. Go buy RCT3 if you want a much better game than this. Early access or not this is a sad farce. The only viable fix for this game is to scrap the whole thing and make a fresh start.  My 3 year old gaming rig runs every AAA title on the market just fine. This game looks like it should run on a 15 year old system but it has a massive memory leak and will bring my system to a crawl. Well here we are over 2 months since release and this game is still just terrible! Run Away! Do not buy this horrible turd.			"

I have tried forcing DX11 but it didn't work. EDIT: Now i can't even load my save, when it has loaded it just crashes, probably because of the insane lag. What kind of a monster system do you need for this game?I got a gtx 980 and i5-6600k, and it runs horribleEDIT2: I will change this to recommended once i feel the game is worth the current price. It sure has great potential and it's alot of fun, i honestly trust that the developers will make this great. But currently the only reason i don't recommend this is because of the system optimization.			"

Early Access Review
								This is in reference to the Early Access build released March 30.The good news first: The core engine is fairly solid, and is more than adequate to build a robust park-creation sim upon.The bad news is that they haven't done that yet. There's very little of the Early Access build that can be considered robust. The press release for the EA build boasts 4 different themes, and tons of scenery; the '4 different themes' bit is technically correct, but only because they didn't include the word 'complete.'  The 'tons of scenery' boast is an outright fib, unless they were estimating the raw, real-world tonnage of the simulated rock formations and generic foliage that comprise the mass of your 'theming' options. Actual theming options -- statuary, themed plants, facades, animatronics, landscape textures, etc. -- are extremely slim. As a strange contrast, there actually IS a fairly robust selection of fences and path textures, quite possibly more than were available in RCT3, so if you were hinging your plans for a dream park on pavement options, brother, this could be your train. A building sim lives and dies by its building options, and RCTW just doesn't have them, yet. It's hard to imagine what Atari was hoping to accomplish with this EA build; while this move ostensibly beats Frontier's ""Planet Coaster"" to the Steam marketplace, the lack of options can only result in unflattering comparisons and bad press.  I remain optimistic that the missing theming options are forthcoming (particularly if they have any hope of properly implementing dark rides, as they've announced), but as it stands right now, they have a long, long road ahead if they desire to catch up to RCT3, and much longer still if they hope to surpass it. For now, there's not enough here to justify a purchase. Will update review if this changes.			"

								To review the game I will just paste my comment on the discussion board, hopefully people will understand;""We have taken all the good from previous games and made it better"" - I don't think soFirst off before I begin I want to point out that this isn't a BAD game, but the videos the devs released gave it a bit too much hype.Now as the title suggests I am here to point out the stuff that was good from the old games but the devs seemed to think was not important.The ability to modify your staff's roles, assign them to specific paths and to customer their uniforms.Now come on guys, really? This was a key fuction (for me anyway) as a kid to keep my park at top spec, now I am unable to make sure litter and other things is kept off paths as the janitors decide they just don't need to go up a ramp.The ability to modify/customise pre-built coasters/rides.Again, really? What harm would it of caused allowing us to change the colours of thrill rides or stores? My early parks in previous games were all colour coded sections and themes, now I know I can sort of have a theme BUT who says I want my sci-fi section to be blue and blue only?The graphics are really dated.This is another thing I don't quite get, you have the potential to make an amazingly good looking game, yet it looks like RC3 a couple of years later. Then it also seems your optomisation for powerful machines is a bit lacking too, when I put details to very high, I expect more than just block colours.Custom built coasters need some work.You build a piece, then you click it to move it, then you add bits, the you tell it to build another piece, then you move it....you are over complicating something that has unlimited potential.Like I said, it's not a bad game...it's just not a good game at this stage, yes yes, I know it's in alpha but they have had plenty of time to polish it up more than this...

								If you're looking for the successor to the excellent RCT3, you're looking in the wrong place if you are considering RCTW.  RCT3 was created by Frontier Developments, and *published* by Atari.  RCTW is being delveloped by NVIZZIO (the 3rd developer hired by Atari for this project), and published by Atari.  The ONLY relationship between RCTW and RCT3 is that Atari has a license to the RCT name.  That's it.  This is Nvizzio's first stab at a RCT game, and it shows. Planet Coaster, however, is the true successor to RCT3, and is made by the same team, Frontier Developments.  It's simply doesn't have an RCT name because Atari paid Chris Sawyer for rights to the name.  Frontier has TONS of experience creating a great roller coaster park sim, since they did RCT3 and many other games in the theme park genre.  The attention to detail in Planet Coaster is amazing.  Just watch some YouTube videos and check it out yourself.  Frontier uses their own engine for Planet Coaster (PC), and it's obviously up to the task of making beautifully-rendered environments with thousands of animated guests that react to your park.So, I'm not going to repeat all of the negative reviews of RCTW here.  Those are all (mostly) true.  I've moved on, since Planet Coaster is far, far, far beyond where RCTW is.  If you want the ultimate in theme park simulation experiences, don't walk away from RCTW... RUN!			"

								When playing this game, I'm constantly asking myself what ATARI has done with their time since the Delay and BETA.It looks like they dusted off an old game back from the 90s' and decided to release this mess. The graphics are horrible, the animations are cringe worthy and the sound effects are not good either.For a 2016 game, it simply by far doesn't cut it. Early Access or not.My advice: Don't waste your money on this mess, but invest in Planet Coaster instead, since that, even in Alpha, is already much better compared to this.			"

								So after playing for a couple hours, id thought I would share some of the things I like and do not like.So first off my major gripe is the AI, or lack of it. Workers hardly ever clean no matter how many janitor stalls you build, You have a park full of sick and trash. And people who seem to be ill, that look like Zombies.The visitors just seem to flock to the newest ride, there is no real equilibrium. The Animations and overall quality of the visitors is super poor, if you zoom in its tolerable, although nothing like the quality of Planet coaster, think more ""Theme park animation / graphic quality"" What is with the visitors animations? if you zoom in they seem to walk fine, but if you zoom out to the normal distance its as if the FPS drops on just the visitors animations. Looks ugly, seeing the ""peeps"" lagging. While the rest of the rides animations are fine.I dont like the themed buildings, it seems half arsed and an after thought. The shops look bad as they are, but you have to have 20 of the same ugly buildings because the ""peeps"" have a preference of which ugly building they buy from.The sounds OMG the Sound design is terrible. Tinny sounding music, constant screaming of children. I had to play on mute. The times I have been to parks, I dont hear screams over the ambient noise, like its the ""Hostel"" film.They clearly have got allot of inspiration from City Skylines ie the path placement, the style of UI, the land system. But have not translated all the quality and charm Skylines has.The game just seems to lack depth, I want a research tree. To have goals to unlock the rides / shops i want.I want better Animations on everything but the rides, I want better quality graphics, I want scenery that matches it surroundings so rock formations and things dont look so artificial. I want a more in-depth staff system, that I control. But after 5 hours of play the thing that is bugging me so much that I have to stop is the buggy visitor animations / AI / quality.I dont feel like spending hours building something awesome, to watch these freaks walk around my sick/trash/zombie filled park.I like the Coaster system, I like the variety or scenery. I like the terrain tools, I like the pathing system and the UI although it lacks depth.You say you went the EA route not to add polish but to add more ""functionality"" The game needs WAY MORE polish. This does not look like a game released in 2016.The core is there and some of the systems are in place although they lack allot of depth. I pre-ordered so long ago, I really wish you had not of released it in this state, even as EA.You only get 1 real launch and first impressions mean everything. Im unsure whether to refund this or not.I im such a fan of this series even after pre-ordering so long ago and let down after let down. Everything I stated is meant for constructive purposes, not as hate or any other BS. I hope this helps.This is for the developers, not a PR person you delete my post and ill post it somewhere you cant delete it			"

I may review this decision in 12 months time but of course Planet Coaster should be released then so I might not even need to bother with this game.Oh and what sort of Wooden Roller Coaster doesn't have guard rails running along each side of the track...I mean, come on guys...And where's the corkscrew coaster!?

Early Access Review
								This Game does not live up to its promise. They pushed it back and back since they cannot meet the deadlines apparently. Then they have applied the smart marketing trick of making it early access: meaning no money left but they desperately need it. Which would be ok I guess BUT:There is the tiny problem of an important feature missing: stacking scenery to build buildings etc. Their response: I could go into a 3D software and create my own models of scenery but in game I cannot because it would be too complicated. So a major NO! Rides cannot be customised at all (except for colors and a couple of trees) and thus it feels like a smartphone game rather than a real RollerCoaster Tycoon (even when just considering the graphics).

								This Game does not live up to its promise. They pushed it back and back since they cannot meet the deadlines apparently. Then they have applied the smart marketing trick of making it early access: meaning no money left but they desperately need it. Which would be ok I guess BUT:There is the tiny problem of an important feature missing: stacking scenery to build buildings etc. Their response: I could go into a 3D software and create my own models of scenery but in game I cannot because it would be too complicated. So a major NO! Rides cannot be customised at all (except for colors and a couple of trees) and thus it feels like a smartphone game rather than a real RollerCoaster Tycoon (even when just considering the graphics). Maybe they will activate that feature in an in app purchase way or add high resolution textures as a DLC. But they stated that they will add rides and scenery and tweek the physics, but that the basics of the mechanics are pretty much done.If you are ok with all of these limitations, I can recommend you the game because it does exactly what you expect.

								Worst RCT ever and completely unworthy of the name. They should have given the new RCT to Frontier. Now over at Frontier they have made a better and cheaper game than RCT World, which is a complete failure in every aspect from the terrible music, cheap aestethics, uncreative building possibilities and terrible performance/bugs.The game is still in Early Access, but Planet Coaster is infinitely better at everything in its alpha, so my hopes lie elsewhere.I also have to notice that the game destroyed my OBS profile and then refused to load after reinstalling three times. Apparently their plan is to make me sit in front of a loading screen at 0% until I reach the mark of 2hrs playtime after which I can't get my refund.			"

								I know this is an early release version of the game - but honestly, it is even light years behind the previous instalment in the series, RCT3, in terms of graphics and game physics. In terms of usability, it is far too complex in places that could be a lot more simple, too, and for a game that I've wanted since I was about fifteen, this has really let me down. If this was £10, then I would say it was worth the expenditure. But this much money? I definitely would not recommend it. I have honestly never felt this let down by a video game in the past, and I can see a lot of people jumping to this game's direct rival - coaster planet - Upon its release. This is the kind of quality that I would expect from a tablet game. I'll check back in the future and see if RCT can revive my faith in the series, but as of now, it's looking extremely unlikely. Farewell, RCT, and farewell my hard earned £30. You will be missed!			"

								as a long term rct fan this game is by far A JOKE!!!  yeah sure early access but update after update fixed NOTHING the tracks go under the ground when i wanna do a hammer head turn, when i finish the coaster its ultra extreme no matter what the coaster is. then coaster editor is way too complicated to use (i got somewhat used to it but still) it should be like rct 2 style when building.  i know theyre trying to innovate but there should be a style option for building in the editor. so all in all the game is WAY TOO BUGGY!!!! hell it shouldnt even been released in early access.  This early access is a joke and im personally ashamed of it being a rct game forgive me and all but this game is not worth my time! avoid this game like the plague!  RCT 2 and 3 are by far superior than this garbage!!!			"

								03/09/16for the first time since this games been available on steam ive sat and actually enjoyed playing this game and yes there are still many issues with the game but the developers atleast seem to care,The new PxP building method is a great starting point and i hope they continue to build on it, yes it was a bit janky to begin with and i did get frustrated with it but after a few hours im making good looking scenery thats really fleshing out the park.for those who already own it give it a try it cirtainly surprised mefor those who dont own it wait...26/1/17after unity 5.4 update - when it runs, it's running smoother than last time i played it but its still such a mess, having tried itme and time again to build somthing in this game it just relentlessly gives me the finger and crashes.Its a shame with each time i try this after a big gap in updates it seems to improve and if they worked a miracle and made it so it plays on lower spec pc's it might have its own niche specially since planet coaster requires a good pc to run.but once again skip it, it really is as bad as you've heard			"

												I've not played for very long but I've seen enough to know this game isn't finished and shouldn't be out of early access yet. The first thing I noticed was the horrendous translation job. It's either translated with google translate or by someone who has only a basic knowledge of the language. It's dutch by the way, my native language is dutch. This translation makes for a very amateuristic looking game but even worse it makes for a very awkward reading, it's very difficult to understand the quests and such when the sentences are this unnatural.So now I got that out of the may I'd like to say some things about the gameplay. In my short play time I haven't experienced any mayor issues like freezing or crashes but the game looks really rough around the edges. There are visual glitches everywhere and while it runs stable (for now) the loading times are too long.When it comes to the game itself the controls bother me. They promote the game like a successor to the legendary RTC series so why doesn't it play anything like the previous games? The controls are completely different and it feels unintuitive to me. I might get used to that in time though. However, the fact that the targeting system doesn't work has nothing to do with my inability to get used to the new controls. What I mean is, when I try to remove trees, more often then not the game doesn't properly recognize where I'm pointing the cursor exactly. Then there's the graphics. As I've set before it's really rough and doesn't look natural. The people don't look natural either as their animations look weird. All this combined makes for a game that looks fine at first sight but it never feels like a real theme park somehow.All this is a real pity because there's actually a more then decent game underneath. None of the issues by itself are gamebreaking bugs but take them all together and you have a very broken game. Fix a few of the above mentioned issues and you get a flawed but fun game.And that's where it bites: even though there are updates every month I wonder if the fans are ever going to get the game they want. I've tried to contact the developer/publisher to adress my issues but I can't find an official forum or anything to contact them. This worries me. But I don't want to end on a negative note. As I've said: even though the game isn't finished I could still turn into a fun game it the developers keep updating it as they have been doing. I won't give up on RCTW yet and will be updating this review the longer I play and when the game gets updated. If I look at the previous updates it seems to me that the game does get monthly updates more or less so I expect the next one somewhere in april. I can't recommend RCTW to anyone at the moment. Hopefully that will change in the near future.			"

Early Access Review
								I tried to stay positive, even though this game has had its fair share of negativity in the, ehh, recent past. I remained hopeful for the EA, and this review is keeping in mind that it's EA. Having played a few EA titles, and knowing how much a title can improve to final release, this review is negative, because I just don't see that it will improve enough to final release to warrant a positive review. Yes, it will improve, but I just dont see that without starting from scrath (again), this game can be salvaged. In any case, keep in mind that this review is of the first EA release.But let me start with the positive. For me, at least, it runs smoothly and without problems. Performace wise, then, it's good. That is about all the positive I can say about it. Other than that, nothing positive to report, unfortunately.The graphics are, without question, horrible. Nothing close to the ""in game"" screens we were shown before. The rides, the scenery, foliage, ground textures etc... I haven't seen any redeeming quality to any of it. There are several things I compare this to: RCT3, Planet Coaster (the competitor), Cities Skylines (built on the same engine), other similar sim-type games from the past 10 years. Without fail, I cannot think of any other high-profile game that is worse than the current state of RCTW.Animations of rides are adequate I guess, but nothing to write home about. They could do with better physics simulations.Animations of peeps - how they move that is - is atrocious. Even RCT3 did a better job at this. They perform several actions and show their emotions (e.g. having to go to the bathroom, hunger, anger, being sick etc.), but the animations are honestly just bad. Even their standard walking and running actions are awkward. On that note, peeps look horrible. Colours, textures, shapes, everything. If you're into misformed yellow and brown blobs with creepy unexpressive and oversized eyes, this may be your thing. But no, they are not ""cartoony"", they just look like they stepped out of a game from the mid-90s. What I may forgive the EA for is peeps, park workers (cleaners, medics etc.) walking through fences, buildings, off-grid paths, each other, to their destination. I may also forgive cleaners sweeping footpaths about 6 feet  away from where the dirt actually is. These can be fixed in future updates. But what will be a tall order to do is the seemingly faulty pathfinding of peeps to their destinations, which at this stage seems worse than in RCT3. The workers also seem to have a wonky work/pathfinding method to get to their next destination. For examply, just in RCT3, janitors are happy to walk straight past 10 puke piles to get to a dropped cup half-way across the park. These kinds of AI behaviours I am less optimistic can be fixed easily. Paths are very hard to use. The three widths are ok, but their snap points are hard to use. This is a similar problem that Planet Coaster suffers from currently, that foodcourts with tighly packed shops are basically impossible to build. Maybe something that will be resolved. This is personal preference, but should be inclued in the review: I am no fan of the pre-made and themed large food stalls and buildings. I much prefer a smaller footprint basic stall and build my own scenery/building around it. For me, at least, Planet Coaster has an advantage here. This is personal preference, if you like plop and forget, then RCTW is for you - just not for me at this time. The coaster builder is actually not that hard to use. If I compare it to Planet Coaster's, I would say it's about the same level of difficulty to use. From me, no major complaints with the basic construction side of things. On the other hand, the graphics of coasters, their supports and the physics seem wonky to put it mildly. Much work needed here, but I think it could be done. Overall mechanics and park management is basically a carbon copy of RCT3. Yes, the heat map and extra graphs may give you a bit more information about the park, and in the future there may be a few extra options in buildings, but overall it is exactly the same and nothing new to see. I also don't see any ""placeholders"" for future expansions in this realm to get me excited. TLDR - in conclusion: very unpolished, which may be expected for EA. I personally don't see, however, how it'll be the game that was promised to the community - feels like at this point no matter how much the turd is polished, it remains a turd. Maybe there was too much hype from Atari (understandable marketing) making my expetations too high, but compared to my own expectations, this game falls short. If you have tons of $$ to buy both PC and RCTW, do so. It may be a fun game for a little while and worth the investment down the line. If you only have $$ for one, I'd recommend waiting and spending it on PC, because I don't think this one will be PC's match even at final release. I have both, and will keep both. But I am a sucker, and wouldn't recommend it to others. I wanted to add a little edit to the end of this review to maybe clarify one point. This review may have been positive, but it is - and I fully acknowledge this - skewed by expectations. This is not my own preconceptions about what I expected the ""next-gen"" RollerCoaster game to be like, but rather by the expectations I had based on the promises made by Atari reps this past year or so. While Planet Coaster does look much better than RCTW right now, at least graphically, in terms of features it offers much, much less. But - and this is a big but - they folks at Frontier have been very honest with where the game is currently, what they are releasing in the Alpha and why, what they want to test and what kind of feedback they want. On the other hand, the folks at Atari have been spewing AAA, the best, so exciting, full of features, looks awesome, and other such language, which this game is not. At least not currently. So yes, a large part of the negative review is part of the humongous PR failure on Atari's part. If they had kept expectations realistic (not low, but realistic) and were honest what is actually being released - an unpolished pre-alpha stage of the game, I may have had a positive review. But not like this. If I take their word that this game has been in ""final optimization and polishing"" for the past four months, and is 90% complete, then no, I cannot give it a positive rating. Just wanted to clarify this point. :)			"

It’s all okay, because the game is in  EARLY ACCESS!  It’s really sad that many devs and publishers (other than Atari) are using early access as an excuse and a crutch for lazy programming and getting your money faster.

								From what I have experienced with this game so far, I must say that it is a step in the wrong direction from Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. The coaster builder is tough to control, the path building system is pretty limited, and the graphics are not very good for a game that is released in 2016. On top of this, I have tried searching for the past hour and a half on both Steam and Atari's website for instructions on how I would be able to return and recieve a refund for this game but no success (even though it was mentioned on the latest blog post that I could recieve one until March 31, which is today).

												This game is absolutely terrible, extremely disappointed customer. At best this game is the sort of game you would download on a phone. This game is not worth the price tag. I purchased this game expecting it to be the next generation in rollercoaster gaming due to spending hours and hours playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, however Rollercoaster Tycoon World is far more restrictive taking the element of creation away from the gamer causing the fun to be sucked out of the game.This game has received nothing but bad reviews and feedback, i purchased this game when it was in early access with promises that it would get better, unfortunately this has not been the case.  With the bad reviews and feedback from this product I feel Steam should be offering customers the option of a refund or at least credit to have the opportunity to purchase another game. When contacting steam on this I was refused. Do not buy this game, you will be disappointed.			"

I'm sure RCTW will pick up the slack ""eventually"" and be a good game but as it is and how LONG it's actually been in development but not counting on how many times the game has gone to new code and old code wiped out... I mean... just look at the videos it looks amazing, but the actual game is the real definition of♥♥♥♥♥♥!!

								Let's see, absolutely terrible load times and graphics could use some work.  I have them maxed out too.  Still early access and it is just as addicting as the previous ones if not more.  Will patiently wait to see what they do with this edition.Update, had  park and over $50k.  The game doesn't even load my park now.			"

Early Access Review
								While I still have hopes for the game as I've been a huge fan of the series since the first game and I realize this is currently in early access, a lot of the features from the old games are missing and that makes this game feel a little lacking..It does however bring forth some interesting and welcome differences with curved paths and the spline-based coaster builder. For now though, there isn't enough to the game and it's a little difficult to find everything so I can't recommend the game, especially not to long-term fans of the series as it will most likely depress them..I don't see much new from the first beta 4 months ago and we never did get the second beta we were promised as far as I'm aware and I'm not too happy about the game being released as early access but I will continue to play through the game's updates and possibly edit my review down the road.Here's hoping the game will be what everyone was wishing for from the first mention of the game.

								Really terrible. I'm very saddened to see the state of the franchise in this state. Just the game optimization alone is very bad. I spent most the of time just trying to adjust settings in the game just to see if the gameplay was any better. I spent about two hours going through the game and tutorials to see the full aspect of what this latest title has to offer.In the end, improvement is a MUST. MUST. MUST. MUST.			"

								This game shouldn't have been an ""early access"".  I'm tired of these half finished games especially from an old franchise like RCT.  There's so many missing features in RCTW that RCT3 had, like being able to test your coaster while building it (Maybe its there, but I've yet to find it.  It shouldn't be so hard to find a simple option).  I must add with the roller coster builder is beyond frustrating to use.  For some reason you're not able to add a chain lift peices untill you're done with the coaster.  My next point is Graphics.   I run a GTX 970, 8GB Ram, and Phenom II x4 processor,  I shouldn't have to put everything on medium just to not get choppy graphics.  I hope they end up fixing this pile of garbage soon or I'll be stuck playing RCT1,2,3 for the rest of my life (which actually wouldn't be so bad)			"

								As someone who has been defending RCT with how slow they have been releasing this game, I am compeltely disappointed in the Early Access. First of all the tutorial is a FAQ of text. Altering the terrain really tests your patience with such a tiny brush size and no strength option. You cannot flatten terrain with trees and bushes, however to delete them you have to click on every single bush and tree (which the majority of the time the cursor doesn't sync to what you're trying to delete) - there is no drag a box to delete or brush tool deletion. There is also no undo button, which is extremely handy in building sim games. Laying pavements are frustrating when there is no freetool option and the grid tool is buggy. Camera controls are very limited to WASD to move the camera and scroll wheel adjusts zoom and angle. Basically, TLDR: Worst than previous RCT (buy RCT3) and it's a terrible Early Access Game, save your money until proper release and see what everyone says about improvement/ save for Planet Coaster which looks epic.

								Got banned for making critical comments about the 2 years they had my money and didn't deliver the game.  I had pre-purchased the game 2 years ago and the developer kept giving false release dates...and then finally released it as a ""early access"" a day or two ago.  They banned me because I was critical of their false advertising and false reporting of release date.  And just before they banned me...they kept deleting all my posts that were about game ideas and comments about game progression.  SO...whatever discussions you are reading....have mostly all been santized already. They are not letting any critical posts or anything that might even be a suggestion to help the game get better.  All they want to do is let the discussions appear as if the game is completely fine.  All suggestion discussions are being deleted to give a false impression of game.    As a side note, to move around the map you need to use your keyboard.  It's not like RCT3 or any other game like this....when you move the mouse to the side of the screen, you should be able to move around the map w/o using a keyboard.  Very frustrating.  When they unban me...i MIGHT change my negative review.			"

								This game is Amazing!ly bad. Go get Planet Coaster since its made by Frontier Developments who made RCT3. Planet Coaster plays just like RCT3. Full control of the game with the mouse and has every good feature of RCTW and RCT3. RCTW requires using the keyboard for 99% of the game while Planet Coaster can be 99% without a keyboard. If you still live in the time before the mouse existed this game is for you. If you wait until it comes out on disc you can buy an expensive coaster to hold your drink while playing Planet Coaster. The only downsides are Planet Coaster is not on Steam and does not yet have coaster building. When I played this it felt like a crime scene knowing RollerCoaster Tycoon World had been murdered. I dont know when, but I have seen the body so I know it happened.			"

								lets see here where do i begin.oh yea half the content as rct 3.NO transport rides,NO custom buildings,i cant even tell you how many less rides.It really is unbelievible.i only played for a couple of hours and thats all i needed being a owner of rct3 platinum.the land footprint in sandbox mode is tiny compared to rct3.It really is diapointing how devopers are really just putting out subpar programs nowadays.I think one reason is trying to widen customer base that can play without a so called super computer.Which for people with high end systems only leaves us frustrated.Not being a computer tech even though i built my own PC tri screen 2-980Ti,i7 kind of stuff when you have better graphics in order to accomidate others you have to lesson the content.Oh and the one thing i truly hate is that i have to use the arrow keys to move forward and backward plus side to side no more moving the curser to the edge of the screen total bummer.

								So. I was really disappointed by this game and got myself a refund. I normally don't do that but the overall approach, not to communicate in any way with the users here before the release should've warned me but I wanted it to be good.But I played for some hours yesterday.There are some fun points and good approaches but the overall content was really disappointing.Aside from coaster construction the gameplay is behind RCT3.The staff management is horrible and I don't really understand why I have a grid, when I can't really use it.The tutorial was ok but still.... The ride artwork is ok but the rides in the beginning are just WAY TOO BIG...and the performance overall for this .. meh. I got >100 games on steam and this is my first refund ever... That basically says it.And I do not let the ""Early Access"" thing count. This game has been delayed and delayed ... There was plenty of time. If that's just to justify minor bugs ok....But this is pre alpha at best....			"

								RCTW Is a  coaster building game from the creators of RCT1 and RCT2... During my playthrough I quickly set up my rides and pathways, even tried out the coaster builder a few times... However we're going to narrow this review down to the good the bad and the ugly parts of the gameTHE GOOD- Killing Peeps on rides and drowning them is back! And more fun than before!- SOYLENT GREEN shop oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god if you're a sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like myself you'll include this in your park... It's kinda mandatory.- The graphics aren't bad, they are close to being on par with Sim City and Cities Skylines, but they're nothing special.- The sound is great! Hearing the bustleing of peeps and chains pulling coasters over a steep fall, it feels good and sounds appropriate.- Modding is there for those who can mod and whatnot and steam workshop will provide adiquate mods for people to try out.THE BAD- Coaster Builder will often Crash your game and your computer! Throught my multiple attempts to use it my monitors will often cut out when the game crashes, causing me to restart constantly. This issue MUST be fixed immidiatly -Some peeps are just UGLY and the shopkeepers are absolutely terrifying ""THEY STARE INTO THE DARKEST DEPTS OF YOUR SOUUUUUUUUL!!!!:-On occasion the framerate will dip and bog down the pc.THE UGLY-Lack of customization. You cannot customize the rides the same way you could in previous rct games, you can't make your own ride entrences and exits, instead there are preset buildings that you can plop down... I absolutely despise this-Coaster Builder is VERY tough to use at times, as you can try to make turns and lifts and dips, your mouse curser may spaz out and cause the track to expand into the♥♥♥♥♥end of nowhere...-Severe Lack of themes for your park... With previous titles you had wester, spooky,industrial, fun themes, ice themes, lava themes, dino, retro, suburbon, in this game there's hardly even a third of what previous games had in terms of themes... I thought this was a Theme park! (I can't even make a bad joke by locking sections of the park off to peeps unless they cough up money, so no paywall joke/ dlc joke for me"")FINAL THOUGHTSWhile the game can get addicting, and can be quite fun when it works, the glareing issues this game has is unbearable, even for an early acess game... I thought they delayed the game so that they can fix the issues, instead I see some the same issues I saw in the Beta!I guess I'll wait till planet coaster comes out and see how it fares.			"

Everyone's open to their own opinion but this is mine...THIS IS EARLY ACCESS, BUT MY FRUSTRATION IS ALSO EARLY ACCESS!!i apologise in advance to any diehard fans or anyone that's affected by what i write but this is simply as how i see it..Do I Recommend This Game? Depends... I'd only recommend this game once it has exited EARLY ACCESS, in the meantime save your money for other games or you could have a 1st hand test of the game and then quickly refund it if you're not confident or just youtube the game to see what's going on... A little research to the things you want in life doesn't hurt a bit..Been a fan of RCT for ages, yet this is by far the most dissapointing money wasting game i've paid for!!Having played for that amount of hours is more than enough for me to regret buying this, (played the game for 30min - 1 hr on alternate months only to see new things added but the old things ignored, eg; glitches, bugs, lags, crash, stupid A.I that doesn't even conform to what their supposed to do...I've reported, requested and questioned as to why certain things are the way it is and yes, if i do know how to do what they do, i'd help them, sadly, im a buyer and a gamer as almost everyone else who bought this game lookin to have a little enjoyment and a COMPLETE GAME and not expect a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job but like i said earlier it's still in EARLY ACCESS!! Thinking it'd be fun like the previous RCTs, i gave it a blind chance by buying it before it's supposed launch of DEC 2015 but it got delayed, so MAR 31 2016 was when i managed to play glitchy buggy laggy game..  a month shy of a year from it's supposed launch, it still has many glitches and bugs and some other faecessss, and to this day it still looks the same... gave it a few chances and possibly waiting for it to end the EARLY ACCESS ERA!! and Yeaaahhh, I am about to F*CKING give up on this game and look on to PLANET COASTER as it looks promising, Keeping an eye on that while this shall be my lightest data paper weight ever in the meantime......My paper still flew....

								How can a game sold at a retail location be an Early Access title? This is absolutly unacceptable and shows a complete disregard for providing a quality experience to customers. There is no indication on the retail packaging that this was not a completed prduct. I would be willing to say this could even be considered false advertising. So I cannot recommend this game. Even if it comes together in the end and I have no complaints, I still will never be able to recommend this due to the misleading retail packaging. This should not sold at retail until the game is out of Early Access.			"

								RollerCoaster Tycoon World has several problems in its current state:- The Grid and Snap on function doesn't always seem to work as intended. Making two roads parallel to eachother is far more difficult than it should be.- Making rollercoasters the way you want is nearly impossible. I can't even make a simple loop.- Coasters can't be tested while the time is paused.- The building/editing tool for both roads and coasters takes time to get used to. - To edit terrain doesn't work correctly, and can make permanent holes in the ground. - Peeps (AI people) seems to have problems with pathfinding at times. - The few tutorials they do have are useless.Despite these problems I did have some fun with the game, however the older games have so far been better. I hope they fix the problems as well as improve the controles for building/editing tools. At its current state I cannot recommend the game.			"

Early Access Review
								I called it, RCTW = Sim City 2013. This game has poor performance (R9 390/i7 4790k), poor textures, poor animations,small map, not much rides, bad path building, broken janitors, puking peeps everywhere, bad day & night cycle, and ingame date & time speed ( a rollercoaster will do 1 or 2 runs within a month). And the thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most is that they was origanlly planning to release this trash in December. In what state would the game be in back then, yet we are still going to have fanboys and white knights defend this gaame to the death. And honestly even if they do fix these problems before the full release, I wouldn't expect much, seems to me this game is broken to the core and just needs to be scraped and start over.			"

								Currently, RCTW will run at a *measured* average of 19fps at 1024x768 / lowest settings.  That's on my Core i7 / Nvidia GT 940 laptop.  At 4K on lowest settings I get around 2fps.  I haven't tried the game on my desktop yet, but it's really not worth my bandwidth at the current state.  Fully maxed at 4K, I'm not really impressed at the looks of the game - it reminds of me of RCT3.  Gameplay wise, there's no in-depth park management, building straight paths is a nightmare (even with the grid on), and tbh there's just no fun in building a beautiful park like in RCT 1/2.  The charm is gone and replaced with flashy menus and thrill ride designs.			"

								This is really sad for me. I've been a RCT fan since the first one, and I was overly excited to RCTW as the start when Atari announced back in 2014. Just bought it in November, I was upset with the launch delay, but ok, I understood.But now, this EA (which is not an beta or alpha) looks really bad. I gotta say, not everything, but here are certain things that really dissapointed me, and I hope that Nvizzio will fix. Some of them was in the previous RCT games.- Everything is just too much big. (Even the food store, which I think is the smallest thing in the game)- The path tool didn't work to attach some things (some ridiculous things, it's hard to attach the queue lines in those)- You have NO CONTROL of the employees, and it's unnecessary to need a giant building to hire them. (You can't even set a specific place for them to stay)- There's no research for the things just like was before. You can unlock the things only completing the goals. I didn't like it.- You have very poor information and control of the guests (You can't ammount them by sorting the thinking or the feeling.- A simple roller coaster (yeah, really small and smooth track) it's getting a extreme-high level of Nausea, making about 80% of the people throwing their stomachs out by the exit of the track, making the paths incredible dirty.I will not talk about the graphics, the lagging, the low frame rate, and the visual of the peeps, which you can find more complains here in another review.It's playable. But it's kinda sad, really is. And don't worth the paying right now.I hope they'll fix all of this soon, making me change this review. I really hope.6/10			"

Early Access Review
								The RollerCoaster Tycoon games have been a staple part of my gaming life since I was a knee high to a grass hopper....RollerCoaster tycoon world has ended this run with a game that doesn't deserve to be associated with its forebears.   Firstly, I know this is an Early Access game and shouldn't expect too much, but this was a true disappointment.  I have a fairly high end rig and this game ran pathetically; peeps don't walk and glide, fps is very low, coaster builder is laggy.  The graphics are just terrible, barely upgraded from RCT3.  The water is just dreadful....why does it look like copper sulphate solutions?! It's not that blue!The coaster builder is a double-edged sword...the potential to build anything you want is brilliant...you can make the coaster into exactly what you want...it is just so damn fiddly!  One great positive is the testing stats overlay that you get...it highlights the areas of the coaster that has the highest nausea inducing spirals that can really help when trying to perfect a ride as well as pointing out where the excitement is highest; that aspect is brilliant.All in all, I feel really disappointed with this game.  The number of bugs is staggering and issues is staggering.  I really wanted to love this game, but as it stands at the moment, I just can't.  In some respects, the developers have listened to the community from the pre-alpha but it still has light-years to go before I would recommend.  I just hope that the developers really try and fix this....otherwise its the end of a great series.  So far, the developers have certainly been fixing the major issues with posts and that.  I remain confident that with some time and feedback, they will turn this into the game that it should be.EDIT 4/4/16:  Having played the game for a bit longer now, I can see the potential in this game about what could be.  Having changed the graphics settings to their highest (the autoconfig didn't do this) and their not actually that bad, so you can ignore that from my previous review!  I think I would upgrade my initial review slightly, but at its current state, I still can't recommend it.			"

								I cannot recommend this game what-so-ever.  Very poor start for this Early Access return of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series.  For a 2016 game, i haven't seen character designs as poor as this for the past decade or more.  The RollerCoaster building tools themselves are very rough and dont handle well at all (camera repositioning itself as track sections are added and removed which then throws me off while designing).   THe overall performance of the game is lackluster, with the game freezing up as buildings or tracks are placed.Many times the phrase ""its an Early Access game"" has been said to soften the blow of incomplete releases, but since this is being published by Atari, which is not a small time company by any stretch of the imagination, ""its Early Access"" just holds no water, especially after multiple delays and apparently shifts in development houses.The developers and publisher of this game should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a cobbled together mess.  I do not see the RCT series being able to recover from this, IMO.			"

												The game itself is very confusing compared to previous installments (1-3...all of which had a more autocad like feel). They had a steep learning curve, but made easy with ten times the automatic coaster piece options. Once a person got the hang of it, the world was their oyster. On WORLD however, every button, control and feature is all jacked up. Maybe they lost certain rights to use the previous interfaces, button configurations and script interface methods so they had to change it to a foreign design. The game industry is doing that a lot. Some games claim to be ""different than Call of Duty"" but really they just switched the grenade and jump buttons and confused a bunch of noobies. Another thing is the 2014 release date...woops. Fast forward to the 2016 version that is for some reason sitting on shelves at Best Buy and Walmart with (full game must be downloaded from Steam) written on it...SO WHY THE DISK?! It is almost like we are loving shooting ourselves in the foot with this game. I want a refund and continued access to this game for free. Complete waste of money.			"

								For this review I am gonna do a fair comparsion between RCTW another game in the same genre: Planet Coaster1 Game Basics1.1 GraphicPlanet Coaster 8/10Good Color Filter and good cartoon graphic in general, very good!Rollercoaster Tycoon World 4/10Bad Color Filter, too yellow and grey, graphic is bad as a game released in 2009, park detail is horriable and store models are repeated.1.2 SoundPlanet Coaster 9/10I really like the catchy BGM in the main menu and devs also use the BGM properly in every detail of the game (like the one played when the park is loaded and we start playing).Rollercoaster Tycoon World 6/10Not Bad Background Music, still the same style (but changed a bit) of the 1st and 2nd generation.1.3 HUD (UI)Planet Coaster 6/10Generic Park Simluation UI, the globe in the main menu is static and not rotatable, and the icons on it are repeated, very ugly. Please redesign it.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 7/10Simple and beautiful flat designed UI, with cool animation, easy to get started, but there are some translation errors and menu selection bugs at the current stage, which should be fixed after I believe.2 Game Elements2.1 RidesPlanet Coaster 8/10Rides totally functioned and animated beautifully, guests can interact with the rides perfectly, coaster can be easily built and mounted.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 7/10Rides totally functioned and animated beautifully, guests can interact with the rides but due to the awful guest model, it's ugly, coaster can be easily built and mounted.2.2 GuestsPlanet Coaster 9/10Perfect cartoon guest art style, featured tons of differnet animation which makes the park alive and artistic, but guest types are too narrow, too repeated.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 0/10Totally piece of sh1+, dumbass motherfcker super b1+ch puzzy cun+. What the FK is this? Guest? Peep? I'd better watch Justin Bieber dancing rather than watching those lame cheap craps walking and running. Don't release the game until the designers who designed those guests are fired by Atari.2.3 Park LandscapePlanet Coaster 8/10Great Lanscapes, piece by piece building system (MOD), very good vista and flexiable terrain system with infinte possibilites. And many themes available.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 5/10Acceptable but still needs to be polished, the cars parked outside are repeated and meaning nothing, and there are only 2 types of themes (meadowland and western). Vista is super ugly,2.4 PathPlanet Coaster 3/10Very bad path algorithm. I can not build stright paths and build linear stations, too bad, please redesign your algorithm for path system.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 6/10Path system is OK. I can build stright and bend paths as I want but still a little bit harder. And another very bad thing is the path seems to be floating on the land surface instead of stay right on the land surface, which makes the game looks cheaper.3 ExtraFor the rest of the parts such as optimization, advanced graphic or steam workshops and so on, I am not gonna review at the current stage because the game is not actually finished.Final Score:Planet Coaster(8+9+6+8+9+8+3) / 7 = 7.3Rollercoaster Tycoon World(4+6+7+7+0+5+6) / 7 = 5.0			"

								So I understood why the first beta weekened was bad, and didn't judge. Then they skipped the next weekends for the pre-orders. They lied about the December release date, then did not post any news for MONTHS. All of the sudden they come out with early access, and the game is just as bad as it was last October. Terrible FPS just trying to play (I have verey good specs.) The path system is a joke, I can't connect paths without FPS loss, and weird snap issues and bugs. Coaster editor... What? It makes no sense. RCT 3 is so much better than this, even graphics wise. It was released in 2004. I reccomend buying Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Not this.			"

Needs serious improvement, hopefully that will come in the next few months.As an updated many months later, the game has improved. Performance is far better, there is a new story mode which is nice and some more content. It still isn't what it could have been and seems aimed at a young target audience now. No water rides or transport rides on release. Supposed to be coming in the future, but I am not sure they an afford to do it.			"

								Sad to say, but this game will need a miracle not only to be playable, but also to be enjoyable. At the moment everything feels so clunky, from the coaster editor to the simulation of the park. It's a real shame, because aesthetically the game is absolutely gorgeous, but it simply falls flat on all other areas.			"

								This game is not ready to be published.  If they would just  play the game for like 5 hours before releasing it, they would know that the game is messed up.  The system of deletion and snapping are jacked.  The mechanics get stuck and stop working.  The thoughts of the peeps just dissapear, never to return, but don't worry, they still get mad.  There is no easy way to find where your staff are, or figure out what they are doing.If you make the angle of the path exiting your rides at any more than 45 degrees, it won't allow you to make the queue and visa versa. I've also had a little trouble with connecting new paths to already built 1paths (not an issue of angle),The maintnence guys go back in as soon as they come out of the door of the buildig.  If they do make it out, pretty much all 10 of them are stuck together walking around.I am very dissapointed with this game.  I love the idea.  The problem that I see is that in the last couple of years, many gaame makers have been giving us broken games.  This is unacceptable.  The game litterally doesn't function.  I feel like I should be able to return this garbage and maybe buy it back if the designers get their crap together.It's appears that they focused so much on how the game would look, that they completely neglected making sure that if functioned propely			"

								I truly belive this will be a great game once it's finally finished, but for now there are some serious problems.  My main complaint is with the new paths engine.  This is the way you build and connect paths and queues in the game, and it is borderline unusable becuase connecting to existing paths is difficult and building grid-aligned paths has been made harder in order to support more organic shapes.  The developers claim this is one area of focus for improvement, which is the only redeeming factor.Beyond that, there are various graphic bugs I've noticed while playing and sometimes the rides just stop running and need a manual stop and start.  The game itself has even locked up while loading and exiting.  Maybe in a couple updates I can change this review, but for now, older versions of the game are better.			"

								I bought this game in the hopes of great fun! But instead I got afustrating not simple game which i am not keen to play again until some drastic updates has happened for the game! I really am sad that the mouse cursor when moved to the corner the map moves with you like previous games also I spent half hour trying to make a curvy pathway and failed. Also i couldn't rotate my rides like previous games ONE simple click to turn it right or left with simple arrow icons. PLEASE MAKE IT EASIER TO ROTATE THE RIDES AND MAKE IT SO THE CURSOR MOVES WITH YOU WHEN MOVED TO A CORNER. That will help a lot in making the game more simplistic and more fun to play. Graphics are great, lovely colour but the game is sadly too complicated compared to the older versions of this game which i love playing.			"

												Now the game has left early access I can honestly say this game is dead, do not buy it, they haven't manged to fix a single bug (or they have but introduced more bugs in the same update) since last year and the graphics seem to have got worse not better, I could list a million things wrong with this game, if you are looking for a true Roller Coaster Tycoon Successor head over to Planet Coaster (also on Steam) and click buy as its simply incredible.

								This is seriously the worst of any of the roller coaster tycoons I have played. DON'T BUY IT! It has major problems with it and if you ever get it to load it will freeze and you wasted 20-30mins loading. I would not recommend this game for any roller coaster tycoon lover period.			"

								Apart from the strange fact it went from beta to early access (alpha), this is still extremely buggy, ride ques bug and ppl dont que properly, some facilities dont get used by the peeps, paths are very difficult to get placed the way you want them same goes for rollercoaster building, and when you get more than 1500 peeps in your park well the list is to long but safe to say things get abit wierd, anyway just my opinion do what you like :)			"

								I was really looking forward to this game but even as an early access release, it's just lacking. I keep encountering bugs, the animations kinda suck and the tone of the game just doesnt feel like roller coaster tycoon. The franchise kinda used to have more humour.Maybe I'll try again when the game's finished but for now it's a firm thumbs DOWN.			"

								I'd like to say they tried, but it really doesn't seem like they did.The game is poorly optimized, crashes frequently, looks worse than RCT3, the coaster builder doesn't work properly, the user interface is garbage, when you build a launched coaster, instead of telling you how fast you're launching it, it gives you a slider from 0 to 10. Like, what the hell? They couldn't be bothered to tell you how fast you're sending the car off at? The physics engine is terrible.Please, don't buy this game. Save your money and get Planet Coaster or Parkitect			"

								Holy mother of god. Absolutely awful. 107 minutes in and I just couldn't take the mess any more. Already requested and received my refund.  This game was supposed to be out months ago... and here we are, 3 months late, and it's still 'early access'? I can understand a few glitches here and there, but this is ridiculous. 60% of the time, the game won't load, and when it does load, functions of the game won't turn off when switched on..... for example, I turned on the 'heat map' feature to find my most popular ride. The heat map would not disable and conveniently covered the menu button so I could not save and reload the game... 45 minutes of game gone to a rookie league glitch. The peeps are glitchy and half of them just 'float' instead of actually walk and move... the ride camera stops working and the peeps on the ride appear to detach from the ride and kind of hover over the seats.. this game that is incredibly late is almost unplayable. I wanted to like it. I really did. I've loved the genre since game 1, but Atari really screwed the pooch. I will be buying Planet Coaster which is made by the same people who created the first 2 rollercoaster tycoon games... Atari merely bought the name ""rollercoaster tycoon"" and destroyed it.Awful, Atari... just awful.			"

								When the beta testing looks better than when it officially is out for early access, you know something's wrong. I had decent hopes for this game. It looked good in videos of people playing it before it was out, but now that it's out I completely regret pre ordering it for 60 bucks (deluxe, cause I was hyped). Never gonna buy anything again until its officially out, no mans sky is another example. (not that I bought it) This was a let down, I don't see how you could possibly release something to the public, even in early access, with this little content and so many bugs. DON'T GET THIS GAME until further notice.			"
