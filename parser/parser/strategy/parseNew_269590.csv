Early Access Review
								At the time of this writing it's been nearly ten months since the developer updated this game. It looks to be abandoned at this point in time.That said, I certainly don't think that this is a bad game. It is an uncomplete game, yes, but what's there is solid and fun to play. However, being solid and fun to play does not save this game. There is nowhere near enough content to the game to keep long-term interest from someone looking for a meaty rogue-like to whet their appetite.Sadly, as mentioned previously, the developer seems to have lost his interest in updating the game in any way. That being the case, I cannot recommend purchasing this title even at the five dollar asking price.			"

AbandonwareThis rogue-like has/had a lot of potential to be decent, but the developer has clearly abandoned this game and there is little likelyhood of it ever being completed. Not only has it been months since the last update was released, the developer no longer checks in with the community and ignores forum posts declaring this game abandoned. As it stands now, there simply isn't enough content to ever rationalize purchasing for this game. Moreover, I would be hardpressed to justify putting money in the pocket of a developer who is still selling a game that he clearly has no intention of finishing.			"

								I'd like to start off by saying, even though I am giving this a negative review, it is known to the community that the Dev was the only person working on this aside from one other person who was added later. Also that the Dev was in College/University and this was a ""Free-time"" Project. Now that I have that out of the way, I would love to sit here and tell you how great a game this is. really, I would.... But, Alas, I can not do that. Although I do think the overall game play is enjoyable, there is far too little content to leave one satisfied. The last time this game was updated was Early in 2015 just after the new year, Although it did provide a new level to the dungeon after the first Boss was defeated (Making for 2 Dungeons essentially), sprite upgrades and a few visual fixes, as well as an audio upgrade (Which had to be hot-fixed).The communication attempts towards the Dev on Forums (Even his own website) go unchecked and unanswered. I honestly had a good feeling about this game as I LOVED Desktop Dungeons (Which plays very similar), but it DOES seem like the Dev has just dropped this game, as sad as it is for me to say it.As far as purchasing this game goes, Part of me says buy it for the roughly $5 its at and try to have fun anyway (Like I now do), or play it safe and don't give a cent to a Dev that dropped a game like so many before him have.

Early Access Review
GameplayRoguelikes are characterized by a list of gameplay mechanics, such as procedural level generation, permadeath, turn-based gameplay, and randomized loot. The latter includes random stat generation for equipment and unidentified potions and scrolls. This game includes all of them, but unfortunately not much else. As it stands right now, the game is a barebones roguelike in terms of gameplay. Compared to its competition in terms of gameplay, the game is running far behind. If Claustrophobia wants to stand out - even while in early access - it should have gameplay elements unique to it. Be it a fusion of gameplay elements from different genres, or simply a new set of mechanics not seen before.The gameplay is fairly simple. You start your character by picking a class, and (if desired) you can do some very minor modifications. You are subsequently dropped in a dungeon where you get to fight a very small variety of standard mobs. Think of the rats, zombies, skeletons, and spiders kind. Your character has a set of abilities that cost 'mana/stamina' to use, but at the very start you will not have access to many of them. You defeat the aforementioned enemies, pick up whatever gear you find and wear it if its an upgrade or sell it if it's a downgrade if you encounter a shop.ControlsThe game controls pretty well. The animations and UI are very indicative of the commands you give, and that's pretty much all that can be said about it. WIth turn-based gameplay in the standard roguelike fashion there is not much to controls. While the game has fairly little 'meat' to it as of yet, the controls are not convoluted. What I like is that you can bring out the map and click on locations to auto-walk there. Skill use and target selection is also very intuitive with a nice layout indicating range.DifficultySo far the difficulty of the game is lacking. While there are traps around, I have yet to step on one by accident. My juggernaut without any trapfinding skill is pretty much capable of seeing and disarming every trap so far encountered. While disarming a trap can still fail (and deal damage in the process), the game's health regeneration mechanics make this trivial.Every turn you automatically recover health as long as you are not starving (in which case there is simply no health recovery). While enemies don't seem to roam through the dungeons (they stay nicely put in their enclosed rooms) waiting and healing is not dangerous at all. With the common availability of food, it is even possible to easily kill bosses simply by beelining to the entrance stairs and safely recovering your health on the previous dungeon floor, before you can resume killing the boss again.As is common with roguelikes, positioning is key. You don't want enemies to surround you. Instead, enemies should be funneled through so only one enemy at a time can engage you. With the dungeon level design this is fairly easy to do. There is (so far, as I have discovered) only one enemy type with a ranged attack who can foul this tactic.Gold seems to be too common in the game, especially since you can sell the gear you don't use. So far I have been able to purchase any gear I wanted from the shops, which means your character is more often than not well supplied with equipment of fairly high strength.LevelingWith the aforementioned ease of getting equipment, I often even forget to level because the 2 points I can add to my stats makes barely an impact based on the gear upgrades I'm getting. This makes the attribute system rather pointless. Even worse, item requirements are not tied to the base score of an attribute, but to the total score. Thus, you could wear +strength items to sufficiently increase you strength in order to wear the gear you want. This often makes me forget 2 attribute scores are given every time you level.Every odd level you also get 2 further points to level in a skill tree and a specific ability. This system is really too convoluted. First you will need to find a skillbook of the ability you would like to use. Then you have to read it, but reading it requires a minimum amount of points in a certain skill (e.g., defense skill, or assassination skill). If you have enough points in that, you can read the book but haven't learned the skill yet. You then have to spent one point into the ability in order to learn and use it. This system should be reworked, because it makes you require 3 things before you can use an ability, while abilities should be fairly important as they diversify combat.GraphicsGraphically, the game reminds me a lot of Pixel Dungeon (free mobile game for android devices), which actually does a much better job gameplay wise. It is nice that this game changes the looks of your character based on the gear being worn. The graphical style is good, and makes also for a clear UI. Unfortunately so far there is fairly little variation in the graphics, but this is not a point I will stress too much since it is still in early access, and graphics aren't the most important factor in roguelikes.Final JudgementThe Good Nice graphical style Very clear UIThe Bad Bland and lacking content - nothing this game has to offer is unique to this title as it carries to bare minimum of what would constitute a roguelike It is far too easy based on its core mechanics (health recovery per turn, ease of getting gold, dungeon layouts making enemy-funneling easy) The leveling system is not that great. Convolution in one part, and barely significant in the other. No variety in gameplay. The skills are limited due to the leveling system, and the currently available skills don't seem to have that much of an impact. In games like Tales of Maj'Eyal skills are essential for survival - here they barely seem to make a dent.The game does what all other roguelikes do, but nothing extra. It currently lacks a lot of content and doesn't stand out among its peers. This is basically the harshest criticism of the game there is, because making a roguelike (or roguelite) nowadays seems common practice among indie developers. For now it is ""just another roguelike"", and despite its early access status nothing has been added that hints at interesting new mechanics. Its lack of content furthermore makes it lack much replay value aside from trying out the different classes.If you want to satisfy your hunger for rogue-likes, try out Pixel Dungeon (mobile game, great controls, good graphics, and currently better gameplay than this game while also being fairly bare-bones) or Tales of Maj'Eyal, which is a difficult and full-featured roguelike.

								There's potential there but it has quite obviously been abandoned. The last update was nearly a year ago and the developer has stopped all communication with its community too. I have no idea what's going on but this game is no longer being actively worked on even though it's still in Early Access which would imply that it is. It's not.So, i'd refrain from purchasing it for now. "

YouTube™ Video: Claustrophobia First Play 

			Views: 412		

			In this video, I play for the first time ever the new early access game called Claustrophobia. It's a turn-based dungeon crawler that is actually much more impressive and fun then it's screenshots or...		

Nothing needs to be said more then this:  Don't judge this game by the simple graphics you see.This game is mega fun, especially if you are an RPG dungeon searching fan.  Period.It is turned based, meaning for every action you take or over movement you make, the monsters also take a turn.  You can't out-move or click your mouse fast to get extra strikes on them... that will get you killed fast, trust me, hehe.  Instead, take your time, plan strategically in your battles and movement, and that is where this game shines.'There is tons of loot, store 'rooms' inside the dungeon that you can find where you can pawn your junk and buy needed gear.  There is level ups that give you points to add to stats, new special abilities/spells to add, and new perks to unlock.  Add to this all the real feeling you get of 'exploring' the dungeon as rooms are revealed from the darkness as you explore them, and this game is a simple, but deep and very fun little gem.This game is worth three times it's asking price.  After playing it, I am hooked, and if I had to go back and buy it again, I'd gladly give $14.99 USD for it after spending some time with it!  It's THAT good.  ""Must Buy"" if you like RPGs and especially if you believe a games heart isn't in its graphics. "

								It's another Rogue-Style Dungeon Crawler.I can't tell if there are any unlockables but it's an addicting fantasy turn-based Rogue-like game.  It plays fine and the aesthetics are nice, but I feel like it might be a bit brutal in terms of difficulty.I mean, I also said the same thing about the Binding of Isaac when I first played it, but I feel like I always had more control over what I was doing in BoI then I do here.I've had several instances where opening up a door on the SECOND FLOOR of the dungeon gets me into a situation where I've bitten off more monsters than I can chew (yes I'm funneling them into the doorway to fight them one at a time). Sure you can escape, but monsters aren't stupid enough to not chase you down or flee when they're hurt.			"

								I don't typically play games like this, so this is coming from someone who doesn't enjoy the typical ""turn based"" system like this. Much more into a free-roaming/mission oriented level/gear based game such as Diablo. However, that being said, there is quite a lot of strategy within this game (aside from the gear and levels) which I enjoy. It's addictive, and even though it was hard to grasp and I found myself dying a lot, you learn the ins and outs fairly quick. I'd definitely recommend this game to someone that is new to these kinds of games. It was easy to grasp.			"

								 One of my favorite rogue-likes (lites, ish, whatever).  I have quite a few hours on this game on Desura (eww) and quite possibly may be the reason I got Desura in the first place.  Anyway, the game has done a complete 360, in a good way not a Project Zomboid way.  The dev is really awesome and commited and I wish all indie devs took their projects as serious and gave as much love to them as this one.  I won't go into gameplay and stuff, you can watch the videos.  I would conservativly give this game a 8.5/10 anyday.  Very fun in its early stages, and with all these upgrades and much deeper gameplay mechanics evolving that rating might go higher!  Give this guy your 5 bucks, you know you've spent more on way worse games!			"

								- - -Edit: It's clear this project was left unfinished so I recommend you don't purchase this game until it is completed.  My old review is below:- - -I like this game.  Claustrophobia has options; lots and lots of options!  Different classes, armor and weapons, shops, and spells for every class, not just the mages.  Now add unknown scrolls and potions, traps, teleporters, and dealing with hunger,  Then add the management of character stat points for each level as well as dealing with your choice of specialties and you quickly realize Claustrophobia is a different game every time you play.Another thing I enjoy about this game is it's fair.  The best way I can explain it is every time I have died, it is because I made a mistake and I know it.  Thismay not be a good thing if you're a roguelike veteran who makes very few mistakes.  Personally, I prefer strategy over luck-based gameplay and Claustrophobia does a good job of making the game tough, but fair.I'm going to confess that I'm not a fan of roguelikes but I am having a blast with this game.  It feels like a good dungeon delving RPG with tough objectives.  I die a lot, but I get a little better every time I play.  I look forward to seeing how Claustrophobia develops further; it's quite playable already.			"

								Edit 06/2015: game development has stopped, and the dev, who used to interact quite regular on the forums, hasn't said a word since last patch five months ago.  I no longer recommend this game.  It is still a fun game, and if you just want to experience all roguelikes finished or unfinished you should definitely give this one a try, but otherwise this is just incomplete and not worth anyone's time and money anymore.  I'm leaving my old review intact below, in case it appeals to someone.  FYI, this review had 96% approval before switching to ""not recommended"".-----------------------------------If you can't tell from the number of hours I've played it, I really love this game.  If I were to design my own roguelike, it would pretty much start out like this one.As a fan of roguelikes, Claustrophobia really hits the spot when I feel hungry for some beatdown, both given and taken.  I'll be cruising along, crushing little monsters, looting some neat gear, until I hit a room full of monsters looking at me funny.  I died to many such rooms until I learned a few tricks that made it easier, and even then I would still die, mainly from making ""stupid"" mistakes.  An unforgiving roguelike?  Now there's a tautology if I ever saw one.About the Early Access status...  I've given feedback for many games in the past (not only on Steam) but I've never seen a developer be so receptive to his players' comments.  The interaction is timely and courteous; the developer is a real professional in every sense of the word.  This tells me this little gem of a game will grow to become something quite extraordinary.  With a 5$ pricetag, it is a steal.			"

Claustrophobia: The struggle to finish this game.Update-- Back when I wrote this review, that was how I felt about the game. It seems the developer shares the same sentiment as the game is now officially abandonware. Yup, this game will be early access and unfinished forever.Hooo boy, I regret buying this game! I like Rogue like games. Every encounter is tense, you never know when or where more supplies are going to turn up from, you are kept on your toes and if you get overconfident, you die.It really is a thrill and many of us would agree that you feel crushed when you die in a Rogue-like game, but from the ashes you rise again!Hell, even games that aren't rogue-like in nature may feature an ironman mode or a hardcore mode such is the legacy of the rogue-like.Enter this game.Rouge-likes are supposed to be hard!For me, I've played a lot of rogue-likes or games with perma-death and without a doubt the one recurring theme is that you take the safest build possible. This obsoletes most of the other things in the game. Build health, build just enough damage to kill things respectabley and not an iota more. Build defensive stats and evasion. Horde food.Playing through this game was just me going through the motions. It didn't bring anything new or ""challenging but fair"" it was just another rogue game, designed like it was painting by numbers.But wait! You can customize your own class! That's what the promotional blurb said anyway.I won't critique the interface for not being clear on this aspect, that is subjective. However how can I customize my class when there are no classes to customize with! We have warrior, shieldbearer, ranger, thief and hex-caster/warlock. With the exception of pairing up Warrior and Shieldbearer, none of those other classes work well, combined! An arguement can at least be made for ranger/thief since thief gets stealth but what on earth are you going to combine warlock with?Doesn't matter anyway because here is the golden rule. Stun rules. Rules every game that it is in and this is no exception. Shieldbearer and Warlock get stun, you may combine the two classes if you want but regardless you will want shieldbearer since he has the longest stun, no matter how you build your class, get that stun or you are going to get annihilated.This game is a struggle to keep playingUltimately the game is not good. It is drowned out by a sea of games that do what this is trying to do but better, much better. The music is good, the art direction is very good, but the game is just paint by numbers. Traps you can't see? Check. There is a perk for that by the way and it is the ONLY perk worth your while. Hunger? Check. An outdated relic but hey, Rogue did it so we'll be damned if we don't! Monsters that outscale you horribly? Oh yes, got to have that, so playing Melee is a huge waste of your time. I could go on but you get the idea and really the only question worth a damn is; is it good? To which my answer is no, it is too tedious and too boring because that is the only playstyle that will keep you alive. Stun, hit a few times, run away. If Ranger, place a trap, run away. If thief, you are already dead. If Warlock, cast poison, run away.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

								Very fun game so far. Reminds me of Angband, a rogue-like I've played for a long time. At the time of this review, the game is still in early access and quite short but I'm excited to see what new content gets added. Even now it has a lot of replay value.			"

								A rogue that plays like an old rpg dungeon crawler - love or hate type of thing. The fundamentals are great, the game needs lots of fleshing out. It seems like the game has been abandoned which is unfortunate. I really enjoyed this Early Access game. It was intuitive, easy to get into, and fun. I no longer recommend this game for the price, there is just not enough there (or promises of).			"

								This is a great game to ease new players into roguelikes.  Nice character development without being cumbersome.  Deadly enough to be 'entertaining' to oldschool Moria players but not too bad for starting players.  Or at least thats my take... I suppose if you play 'stupid' the death toll will stack up rapidly.It's a nice interface as well,  Love being able to click on map to quickly navigate, although I do wish it would avoid known traps while doing so.The 'epic loot' is well varied, but, at least in my few play-throughs, seems like it might be tied to 'class' selection.  Would be very nice if there were an identification skill.All things said, a very playable early access. "

								First Impressions:""Claustrophobia: The Downward Struggle"" reminds me a lot of ""Dungeons of Dredmor"", albeit a quicker and more simplistic version.  ""DoD"" has a lot more character classes and skills to choose from, but then again, ""Claustrophobia"" is still under development.  For five bucks, it's a pretty fun time.  I'll be curious to see how this game looks when it officially launches.

Early Access Review
								This is a first and foremost a really great game. It has taken obvious inspiration from Dungeons of Dredmor, and in many ways I think it personally succeeds and being superior. The animations, the moving, the combat is so lovely and clean compared to D&D which I find jittery and sometimes buggy. At the moment though, C:TDS is very much an unfinished game. Once you get the hang of it, and it will take you several new characters, and once you have descended through each floor and fought the final ""boss"" you have then reached the end of the current version (I think this is about 5 floors?). You are told how the game is in alpha stage and that there are plans for much more content, which I think will truely make this game fly. But for now, you are sent back to the beginning of the (randomly generated) dungeon to face harder and meaner foes. As I mentioned before, when/ if this game is fully finished, I believe it will be very successful. Much like D&D. The loot system is superb. I found myself grinning with glee everytime I stumbled upon a new weapon/ piece of armour/ piece of jewellery with awesome stats and felt very satisfied as these improved stats worked their magic quite visibly so. The combat is beautiful, and so... Idk, clean! It has nice sound effects which makes killing enemies very satisfying. The hunger system is a nice little added tidbit which makes it very challenging. You will be very pleased to find a big slab of meat lying on the ground, even if it is green and potentially unsafe to eat, as long as if satisfies your hunger, you're happy!One final note/ plea: Please devs! Please complete this game! I love it so much and it would be even more perfect if it were complete with the features hinted in the final message at the end of the dungeon. Overall I give this game an 8.5/10. I will happily update my review once the game has more content.			"

								Seems like the sort of roguelike where it's difficult to get started, but once you're on a roll, you can survive quite a lot.  Very fun so far, even though I haven't even beat the first boss 3 times.  For the first time, I'm really on a roll (with default Juggernaut), here's hoping it pans out :) Oh, I didn't even realize it's early access, it seems done enough, lol......if it's getting even more content, great!  I got it on sale, but I don't think ~$5 is overpriced.			"

								I will preface this by saying I love roguelikes, I mean really love them, They are probably my favorite genre and this game is a very much appreciated addition to my library. I appreciate the simplicity and complexity that comes along with roguelikes and this is a great example. The Simple interface, idea and execution is on point, I love it. One of my favorite games for quite a bit. I can just open the program and play for any amount of time. That is the beauty of a dungeon crawler such as this. But I must warn not a game for every sort of person, If you are willing to try a new genre go for it, but If you are not to open to new game types then steer away. Overall a very good game and I have enjoyed my time spent in it. Good job developers, you have done a wonderful job.			"

								Great game i was amazed how fast i died on my first try (there was no hope on the 1st floor) but everytime i died you cant load your last data saved ( after several deaths i found out.) I can give you a few tips i know so far so here they are:1- IF you feel that your character is about to die or cant find an escape like teleportation scrolls or a nearby portal simply load your data before death or else it will be gone 4 ever2- Closing the doors when enemy has spotted you they can open it again (one of the reasons i died) 3- This is a cheap trick but useful. save everytime you find a unknown potion or a scroll and use them. that way if its a bad one you can load it up again and thats how i saved my map scroll. well i hope that helps. and happy dungeons!

								So I tried the game, I had it for a while, was hoping to wait until it left Early Release to play it, I decided to look it up today, and saw the mentions it was pretty much abandonned, also after playing a bit I really came to the same conclusion as everybody, its way too hard, they start you at a pretty intense difficulty from Level 1, now its possible to survive some time... but inevitably you'll encounter a room full of monsters and get butchered in snap unless you try running away, but unless you got a stun move, forget about actually running away, they'll keep on your tail. Its a shame the game has been abandonned by the developer, it wasn't really that bad conceptually, he probably made it as part of a class project, he worked it up a bit more and then decied he'd help pay up his school loans with it and probably abandonned it as soon as he had already earned a fair amount of money so he'd focus on his studies or when it failed to meet his expectations of easy revenue he decided to quit it, maybe he merely expect to put us on hold until he is done with his degree than finish it... but leaving the game on hold for a year + is very distasteful, anyhow I can't find myself to recommend this game.

								So, i think now its the Time for a little review :-) ( Before i start, i want to tell you guys that my english is very brooken^^)At first i need to say that i normally hate Rogue Like Games, but i wanted to give some more games a chance.So i decided to buy this game. And i love it like the first moment,because i like the combination of Rogue like and tacticel decisions.The first time i died in the First 1,2 Floors. ( I need 10 restarts?!)Because of the Random Building of the Dungeons it is interesting everytime and i dont get bored at all.Now i am at NG+2 (New Game 2).Pro`s and Kon`sPro:- Random generated Dungeons all the TIme, so it is interesting to explore them all the time.- You got a lot of Classes and you can skill them complete unique.- A lot of Loot and drops.- You can find different Spells to get stronger.- (and many More)Kon:At the moment i got no Negativ Point to tell it you.The only thing i hate its the Scroll of Equip destruction, i missclicked twice.... Wasnt that cool.Guys, when u arent a fan of Rogue Like Games, give this Game a try anyway. And when you are a fan, you will love it!Think about that the game is in Early access . I think it is better then some games who are Full released for a long time.10/10			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I'm not saying that this is a bad game. As it is, Claustrophobia is a fully fuctional roguelike dungeon crawler that certainly captures overly unforgiving nature of the genre. However, this is not to say that the game is all that great either, especially when compared to other (very) similar games.While most roguelikes tend to follow a similar gameplay regime, Claustrophobia does very little to make itself stand out from other games, namely Dungeons of Dredmor. Aesthetically, it uses the same 3D top-down dungeon view as Dredmor, and the cartoony style of the sprites is very similar as well. Even the title screen appears to have taken influence with the logos using almost matching fonts and the backdrop depicting a very similar scene. And while Dungeons of Dredmor implemented an extensive skill system and an imaginative cast of baddies, Claustrophobia seriously lacks in the character customization department. And the enemies? Zombies, rats, spiders; Bland, bland, bland.They even reused the same tileset across different floors. The game just seems to lack any creativity whatsoever.Again, I'm not saying that this is a terrible game, but I don't understand why anyone would choose to play it when there are far better games elsewhere. Maybe it's still to early to judge since it's still in early access, but seriously, if you're going to spend $5 then you may as well just buy Dungeons of Dredmor (it's the same price by the way).

								Claustrophobia: The Downward Struggle Review - Raymond KTI would recommend it, but it's early access and hasn't been updated for ages.This rogue-like has/had a lot of potential to be decent, but the developer has clearly abandoned this game and there is little likelyhood of it ever being completed. Not only has it been months since the last update was released, the developer no longer checks in with the community and ignores forum posts declaring this game abandoned. As it stands now, there simply isn't enough content to ever rationalize purchasing for this game. Moreover, I would be hardpressed to justify putting money in the pocket of a developer who is still selling a game that he clearly has no intention of finishing.			"

Early Access Review
								I beat this early access game once. As stated in the description, this is more of a demo/proof of concept than a game as of this date that you can support. It is very short and shallow. Everything levels up with your character so RNG has little impact currently. I really hope the author introduces more RNG that forces you to make strategic decisions on what limited resources you consume each new game. I also feel like using the skills should be more strategic and possibly buffed instead of just resting and using them all every fight. The resting mechanic should be removed or changed to make this possible. I don't think a cooldown system can work well and maybe should be changed to a energy/mana system with limited replenishment. It is early access, so I have hope it will become a great game!			"

Early Access Review
 Abandoned Game  I bought this game due to the fact that, it looked pretty good, graphic-wise, and the fact that I like rogue-like games. Well, I'm disappointed, the developer, who seemd to want to create something fun, has pretty much abandoned the development of this game. Until the developer decides to do something, this review remains negative. I can't recommend this Early Access title, and I won't. Has potential, but no kinetic energy, as of yet.The game IS fun, it's very fun! But with the lack of features, the lack of support, and the fact that the dev. no longer responds is a big issue. When the developer comes back, I'll fix this review. Gameplay: It's the same as any other rogue-like game; take turns, open doors, kill monsters, collect loot, and travel farther down. I hope for an option to keep your character's stats, rather than just looks (and maybe even name?), as it can get extremely repetitive just re-statting characters. There are multiple items throughout the game, and many pathways you can take. Luck based game, you either open a door a lucky-man, or open a door and die as an un-lucky man.Story:The story is what you make of it, it's a role-playing game (duh). The only thing you know is that you have to survive and dwell deeper into the tower(?).Graphics: The graphics are simple, which is expected, and it can only appeal to fans of the genre. Plus, as a bonus, you can change textures/art in the folder, which is always nice. The art is not clunky, not too serious, but just right.Classes:This is one of the better elements of this game, albeit the short amount of classes (3). You have your basic classes: rogue, warrior, shaman, and archer (archer is the best in my opinion). Instead of being forced into the game with the generic class skills, you have skills/skill trees you can choose before you get into game; warrior's can use the shaman's black magic, same applies with rogue and so-forth. It's fun to mix up classes and skills, just to see how far I can get with said skill-set(s). 6/10  This game easily could have been an 8/10, but due to having no-updates (being in Early Access), I can't recommend this. Unless, of course, you're looking for an unpolished rogue-like game. The game itself is fantastic, so far, but it REALLY needs some updates. The lack of armor/weaponry, buffs, enemies, textures (same textures), and other things, are totally fine, but the fact is, the developer hasn't been here to take care of that stuff, which is disappointing.

Early Access Review
								I need more practice to enjoy this game and give positive evaluation. Roguelike isn't my favorite kind. I prefer rpg.Your progress depend mostly on luck. Your gameplay, gear and skills are important too.+ Nice Graphics, UI & musics+ Easy shop system+ Roguelike, permadeath+ Rpg system : 4 classes with attributes/skills/spells to manage+ Many enemies to kill (normal, champion, elite, boss) with challenging fights+ Cheap price+ More features in future (craft, bosses, dungeons, item, ...)+ Devs seem to correct bugs very fast and take care on Steam forum.+ Recommended (even if i give a negative here), you can buy it- Unbalanced rooms (difficulty and number of mobs)- Mobs are all able to open doors & follow you as soon they spot you- Starving system ruin your progress if you don't find food to feed you. Glouttuny traits can reduce that but you need too traits that increase chance to hit. Each time you step or fight your starve counter increase- Some bugs but its early access we have to stay fair- Not recommended for Duke Nukem/Serious Sam players : you have to play fully strategicWithout annoying starving system i'll probably now give it full positive evaluation. I hate in rpg/roguelike Sims concept. If you think eating is realistic, why you don't ask to pee or♥♥♥♥♥♥in-game too ? Because i doubt eating a lot of food without that isn't so realistic.			"

								A fun game but needs more depth. Character choices are very limited and the game tends to get slightly boring after a while. Especially if you die a few times and have to start over again.Hope this gets more content in the early levels, then it will be worth its price.Now; not so much.			"

								This game hasn't been updated in 7 months; abandoned.#######################-This game is pretty interesting, although I wish it had a few more features that would make it better such as a...Character saver, a set of difficulty levels to choose from and more traits and perks to pick from your class.-The game has the class 4 classes, rogue, mage, warrior (juggarnaut as the game calls it) and archer.-This game also has a lot of potential to turn into something big but I don't want to shove words into the developers mouth but this game has a really small player base (32 peak high for about 2-3 months http://steamcharts.com/app/269590 ) and due to that, I personally think the developer will drop working on this title since there is a small incentive to work on it if people keep passing it up.-For 5 dollars and you want a small indie game to itch your small adventuring taste, I am iffy about this game, but I'm going to like it because this game is overlooked and this is ONE of a few rogue-like and indie games I actually like, I generally only play AAA titles.

								I originally bought this game from Desura when it was early in development and to be honest, I much preferred it back then.It's not that this is a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it just feels like a prettier clone of Pixel Dungeon for Android devices, of which I've already had my fill.The orginial was far more randomised, and in my opinion the graphics were more endearing.I've uninstalled this now as I won't be playing it anymore, however it is still a really good game, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes roguelites/dungeon explorers.

								i really want to like this, but the dev barely seems to work on the game, if at all, as its been nearly 4 months from the last update. its in limbo big time. it has potential, but i dont want potential, or promises, i want the game i payed for. i know this is EA, which is why i will change this review if the game gets updates and shows progress, but as of now it seems like it is dying a slow death, and im sad about it, because it looked really cool.

								Really really enjoying this game ^_^It's really traditional for Rogue-like's but it's completely accessible for new-comers and veteran's alike. I'm still looking for the kind of feature that wow's me but all in all? It's great and I adore it. It's surprisingly polished as well.			"

								Personally I think this is a really interesting game. Yes, the whole dungeon crawl premise is being over done, but I feel like this game captures it pretty well without making it overly difficult. A bit complex, yes, but it balances everything out with the equipment you can get and if you have the mind for it you will overcome any challenge thrown at you.The game randomly generates the floors of a dungeon, with certain things being certain per floor, such as shops so you can spend the hard earned gold from killing monsters. Each class starts with two skills, and earns more from shops, searching bookshelves, and possible monster drops. The hunger system is actually a really interesting mechanic that adds that extra layer and helps to seperate it from other games of the genre. If your character gets to the point you are starving (I say if because food is quite generous in the game, unless you get really unlucky) your health regen stops entirely, making your only way to gain health potions and leveling up (which will become a lot more difficult even with great gear). You generally find the food on the floor or in boxes, and you can find rotten food for those times when you are real desperate and NEED your health regen back to get back into the fight.The level up system is interesting as well. It's not your typical ""Level up your skills and base stats"" even though it uses some of those aspects. You get the choice of what you want to do with the points. You get 2 points to spend on your base stats, which I enjoy because the other games generally give you 4 or 5 making it rather easy to make a tank, DPS, or just impossible to hit character, and every other level up (I believe it's the odd number ones, if you prefer to keep track that way) give you one point for traits and one point for skills (HOWEVER you must keep in mind that in order to level up your skill you need to find a book for a skill first and waste your skill point learning it). The traits are interesting and vary from skills that increase your hunger so you won't have to worry about food to trap detection/disarming (Both from same trait/feat) so you can alter your character each run. OH, right, once a character is dead, that's it. So that means no ""Oh, I'll run in, level up, die and start with him again"" nope, none of that, it's on the spot thinking to keep you on your toes and make you think about what you level up before you jump right in.All that being said, if you like the sound of that this game, I absolutely recommend it and think you should pick it up because you will have hours of fun playing it and seeing how well you end up doing. If not, well, I'm sure you'll find something that you will enjoy. After all, Steam has plenty of games for everyone. "

								Edit-Well. The game is abandoned. There was a ton of promise. The developer was incredibly active on Desura, but then slowly fizzled away once he got to Steam. A shame too.Played this one a lot on Desura and even threw down comments that the dev deemed helpful! I eventually stopped playing once the developer stopped updates in order to upgrade everything, but now it's back and looking better than ever. This indie developer here is a whole lot of awesome and dedicated to Claustrophobia. If you find bugs and report them, you'll definitely hear back from the guy and you'll definitely be helping shape what's promising to be quite the fun roguelike.It's no Dredmor, but given time this game will become a beast all it's own. As it stands, it's pretty straight-forward roguelike goodness with all the randomized stats and equipment you could ever hope for. If turn-based roguelike yummyness is what you want, then throw in $5 and follow along with the developement of a terriffic experience.			"
