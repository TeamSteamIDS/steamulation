												Goats and amethysts.No.Blueberries and frogs.No?What do you little bobbleheads want from me?Reus is a resource management god-sim that has you taking on the role of the planet itself, controlling four powerful giants that carry out your will and alter the landscape to your whim. You can create trees and animal life, grow entire plots of fertile swampland, and one of your giants can even punch veins of precious stones directly into the crust. All of this, to attract the ungrateful little bobbleheads known as man to build great cities upon your surface. The humans create many great works on their own- well, with your help. Your giants can directly influence whether or not they complete their projects (do you really want a mad scientist around? How about a sacrificial altar?) by altering the landscape further, creating new resources that meet the goals of these projects. The more you complete, the more varying projects and resources you unlock, and thus the rabbit hole goes deeper. You can even unlock longer game-times as well, allowing more time to create and build, and allowing more time for the humans to try and rise up against you and your giants.They do go to war with each other. And they'll attack your god titans too, which is a curious choice. Your giants can slaughter them back, as any good vengeful potential goddess will be happy to know.The game can get quite complicated as you go on, however, the title screen provides a link to the Reus wiki, which will give a lot of ideas and help.The graphics themselves are cartoony and relatively simple looking, but always bright and interesting to look at. The game is on a 2D scale, all around the surface of the planet. Your giants traverse the outside of the planet as well, so some of your time will be spent waiting for the big lugs to get to where they're going, but since their abilities have cool-down meters, that isn't too much of a problem. The soundtrack is rather limited, though, so have some of your own music handy for the longer games.Overall, Reus is a well-designed god game. It'll start off just slow enough to get you hooked, and keep you in for the long haul as you look to see what you can accomplish next.			"

												You should play Reus. - It will give you a barren planet and 4 Giants which are able to create life on it. With their help you will create different biomes, plants, animals and ressources. Attracted by this, Humans will settle and build Villages, which you can then grow and care for.The game is presented in its unique and suprisingly detailed visuals that let you zoom from the planet view in to the details of the villagers. Its something to experience, and makes navigating the whole planet fast, very easy.The playtime is at first limited to 30 minutes, you have to play and unlock achievements to expand this to 60 and later 120 minutes. Yes the gameplay is heavily driven by achievements, but through this you are able to learn to effectively play the game. If they would have just ulocked everything from the start i would have been overwhelmed and confused. There is also an endless mode and various special gameplay options that you can play with if the standard gameplay isnt your thing.The gameplay gets more and more complex the further you advance in the game, up to an suprising ammount of deepness that rivals the god-game-richness of classics like civilistaion or populus. The wiki helps alot to understand all the mechanics if youre lost: http://wiki.reusgame.com/index.php?title=Main_PageOverall this is a very solid and fun game, that will give you way more than you probably expected from it. - You should play Reus!

												Reus is another indie title. If you’ve seen my play history you’ll know that I’m very “in to” the game. Reus is a good game to buy because it’s a world builder, individual games are short, there’s a lot of replayability, it’s a game with deep strategy, and an easy learning curve. There’s a lot of value in this game.As a world building “god game” it fulfills many of the things you’d naturally expect. You lay out the terrain. You manage where the towns go. You can destroy nations in an instant. You manage a lot of externalities. The cool part about this “god game” is you manage every thing with these potent giants who you enhance throughout the game by completing objectives. Each giant is different and has unique powers to explore. A mountain giant for example can create minerals but can’t create animals. An ocean giant can enhance plants but can’t create them.This game follows the old school principle of “unlocking content”. There’s just some thing about unlocking content and learning as you play that is a lot of fun. In Reus the entire objective is to march through over 60 unlocks which are called projects. Each time you play a game you complete various projects with differing objectives. This gives the game a lot of replayability as many of the projects have opposed goals and there’s not enough time in a 2 hour game to get them all. When you finish a game you’re rewarded with new tools for your next game. This means you’re slowly learning new and more advanced ways to adjust things as you progress, it’s all very elegantly done.I have two negative things to say about Reus. First if you play a lot the music track is just simply not sufficient. The second is that even though so much of the game is modular there’s no DLC, no update packs, no nothing. They won’t even take my money for in game hats (for the giants of course).This game is absolutely worth the $9.99. Skip pizza and destroy nations in an instant. "

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Reus Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: God Game; Strategy; Simulation; Casual My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-30 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers REVIEWThere are several reasons why I really enjoy Reus and believe it to be a well-made and fun game.  I can certainly see why it may not appeal to absolutely everyone, but I think it does what it does well and does so in a charming little way that remains unique to its own identity.  It is a casual game, and a very much toned-down “civilization-management” style game compared to others in that genre.  It is actually a “god-sim” style game where you influence but do not control the civilizations in your world.  Furthermore, it is round based, each round starting from scratch and lasting 1 to 2 hours; however unlocks and certain progressions are saved across all rounds.The main thing that I like about Reus is that it satisfies the desire to play a civilization-management / god-sim style game without overloading the player with piles upon piles of data to keep track of.  The tutorial is great, and slowly introduces the mechanics to the game.  Even after the tutorial ends, things in the game are unlocked relatively slowly as the player completes rounds of gameplay.  All this prevents you from feeling overwhelmed when you start playing.  And you can really understand how the game works piece by piece instead of it all just being tossed in your face immediately after clicking “New Game.”  It is a bit of a double-edged blade, however, as some players may inevitably find Reus to be lacking, as it is truly far less complex than many other games involving civilization-management.The game is quite simplistic and it is way more god-sim than it is civilization-management; and it shows in the gameplay.  Control is limited and simple, and much of the development is automated while the player just makes sure everything is going smoothly by managing resources, and occasionally divinely-intervening in affairs of the NPC civilizations.The art style, music, and even the game mechanics all add to the simple charm of the game that gives Reus its positive identity.  The game isn’t very innovative but it does have a unique feel that will satisfy.  Once you get into the swing of things, you will find Reus to be quite addictive.In summary, I would say that hardcore fans of the civilization-management genre will probably find Reus way too casual.  In truth it is much more so a casual god-sim than it is anything else.   But for people who are interested in getting a small taste of civilization-management without the overwhelming feeling and tedious gameplay, they may be pleasantly surprised at what Reus has to offer.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												""Hmmm... another city / colony / civilization management simulator..."" - this was the first thought about Reus. Well, that thought turned out to be wrong. While the game might look simplistic, childish or even shallow, because of the colorful visuals and the concept of giants ruling the world, I promise you - this is not the case. Being a Civilization series veteran, I'm used to deep and complex games. While Reus might not compare with Civilization 5 or other games on that subject, it definitely provides a sophisticated enough mechanism to keep me interested, at least so far. I've been playing for 4-5 hours by now, and I feel like I still have a long way to go before I really learn the game mechanics and master it.To bottom line this - if you like the genre, get this game. It's well worth it, even at full price ($10).Update (18 hours total) - this game turned out to be one hell of a pleasant surprise! I'm having a lot of fun with the progression mechanism.I now have a much better perspective and understanding of the game, so I can give much more information. Skip to the end for a short bottom line, if you don't feel like reading all that text.The idea in the game is to contribute to the developement of the colonies by supplying resources and improvements, mainly plants, animals and minerals of different sorts. But in order to unlock the better, more advanced resources and improvements (called ""aspects"" ingame), you must explore and use the more basic options, or you can't progress and reach the advanced stuff. Needless to say, I guess, that the more advanced your giants are, the bigger and more prosperous colonies they can sustain, support and control. ...yes, control. Sometimes a colony gets greedy and arrogant and attacks your giants, and needs a good kick in the♥♥♥♥♥ In some cases it's even necessary to destroy a colony, if it looks hopeless.Also, the humans in the colonies will try and develope projects of different sorts, and you're supposed to help them meet the required criteria (if you want that project to succeed). The trick is to choose the optimal combination of resources to supply to the colony, factoring in the resource's position, its level, and the level of synergy it might or might not have with other resources nearby, plus the project's criteria, of course. So far, most projects need specific amounts of either food, wealth or technology or any combination of them. Some projects, though, will also require one or more unusual conditions, such as winning a war with another colony or having another colony completely destroyed (either by going to war or by ""divine intervention""). There are more aspects to the game, some of which I don't fully understand myself yet, but I promise to update if I feel l learn something important enough. For one, you have time limits, both for the ""Era"" type of game (what I've been playing so far) and for the projects. Obviously, it complicates things.Anyway, to summarize this update - this game is way more complex and rewarding than it seems, or at least more than it seemed to me at first. If you like strategy and colony management, get it, definitely worth it!Update (October 29, 2013, 40+ hours): This game is now officially one of my favorite games ever! It has a nearly perfect balance - it's complex and deep, so you don't get bored too soon, yet it's relatively easy to get into and learn, so there's no need to spend too much time learning the game and its mecahnics - it's fun straight from the beggining! I'd say this game is a perfect introduction to the colony management genre, much more begginer-friendly than Civilization 5, for example, which is an awesome game, possibly my #1 favorite of all time, but has a pretty steep learning curve. I really hope Reus generates enough profit and PR buzz to justify a sequel. I'd hate for such a great game to stay a lone shining gem, all by itself. :)			"

												Saw this during the Steam Sale and said ""WTF is this."" Rolled the dice and was massively impressed. Basically, you play the part of the planet. You're totally barren and unable to sustain life. You control 4 different giants who all have different abilities. Your goal is to make the world liveable and grow the cities as big as you can (racking up the city and world score). Every city will produce a semi random special work with certain requirements. Upon completion, you get an ambassador to upgrade your giants skills/unlock new abilities. This is the real key to the game as higher level project require much more resources which cannot be obtained without upgrading resources (which start out locked and are unlocked by completing various achievements).The challenge kicks in late in the game from the greed mechanic. When a city has more than 20 of any unused resource (threshold can be raised/lowered by various things like projects, awe, and danger) they gain greed. Too much greed and they'll start attacking other cities and even your giants. Late game they will start work on projects that give cities up to 500 unused resources (bigger gap faster greed accumulation). Losing a city can massively set back your score and cost you valuable achievements. The game is a balancing act of managing multiple cities and their needs while striving for ambassadors without letting the humans kill each other.My one complaint comes from the 2 hour game mode (needed to unlock a lot of the high end achievements/resources). If you're really striving for absurd scores to get the best resources unlocked quickly, you spend a ton of time pausing and issuing orders to ensure you're maximizing building in the time limit. I honestly found 2 hour games far less fun than the 30 & 60 min game modes.TL;DR - Simple idea, complex planning. Kind of a mix of a god game and a puzzler. Need to have a plan to ""level"" your giants and build the world to maximize your score. Very good game.			"

												Best game i've never heard of before buying. A charming and addictive god-game, has a lot of depth beneath its simple gameplay. Game times are divided into 30/60/120 minute segments, each with their own achievements to unlock. Achievements actually do something in this game, each comes with a resource that you can use in-game after unlocking and actually makes for some very addictive gameplay hunting down the achievements.Has a lot more potential as well, sadly updates are rather sparse. Hoping for a sequel.			"

												Alright, I'm seventeen hours into this game and have half the achievements in the bag, so for $2.50 (steam sale price) this was unquestionably worth it.Is it a God game? Civ building? Puzzler? RTS? It's hard to categorize the game. Briefly, you command 4 giants clockwise and counter- around a flat ""globe"", creating features such as animals, minerals or vegetables in segments or terraforming into mountains/deserts, oceans, swamps or forests. Villagers move in. They'll randomly decide on ""projects"" which you complete by having your giants create resources in the village. But take care -- if the villagers grow too fast they get greedy, and either attack other villages or even the giants themselves!Games are timed, and you're given rudimentary tools to start. You can't do everything that's possible in the game without ""unlocks"": achieving some goals each game. This may turn some off but it really works on multiple levels: limits the complexity to start and gives you different goals for each game so that you won't want to find the One Winning Strategy. 60 to 120 minutes is a big time sink (especially if you're pausing), but you can knock out a half dozen ""unlocks"" in a given game, especially at the beginning.In a game where everything works together well, it only makes sense that the core mechanism of the game is ""symbiosis"". Some features work better next to others (e.g., bonus food for having this animal near this plant), and then you can embue features with different aspects and then transmute them into higher-level items which likely have different symbioses. This is crucial because there's simply not enough land within the border of each village to accomplish the goals as they get harder and harder.And I didn't even mention ambassadors. Or having to have your giants ""put down"" advancing armies (or let them through -- Hammerville was looking a little snobby).Really, everything in this game works together so well, and it's very unique. Definitely buy this if you like puzzle or sim games.			"

												To sum Reus up in a few lines:1 - You start off with a clean world, create habitats and life. Nice!2 - People start settling, you grant those people what they need. Noone is complaining!3 - Everyone is happy and loves you. This should be easy now...4 - Different peoples start to have different objectives. Tough, but doable.5 - Villages start to attack each other. Hey, stop that!6 - A massive avalanche of goals and deadlines start to overcome you and7 - OH GOD WHY THE HELL DO YOU GUYS KEEP ATTACKING THOSE HALF-WITTED FISHERMEN WHO THE HECK TAUGHT YOU THIS BULLSH*T AND WHY IS THAT GUY NOT RESPONDING TO8 - You start off with a clean world...

												It's like driving a long road trip; just involving enough to need your focus, but only just. Ultimately the depth of strategy is a bit too shallow for me, and the focus on slow grinding (you'll need a full 60 minute round or more to get some incremental progression) makes it too frustrating for me to play. There are certainly good parts: I like the art style, the concept and interaction of different parts of the ecosystem. But it's ultimately too slow and repetitive for me to enjoy.			"

""Can the Rock Giant create a boulder that it cannot lift ?"" ~Loading Screen tipI’ve always been a huge fan of so called ‘sim games’, so playing Reus seemed inevitable to me. If You’ve ever heard, or better, played legendary ‘Black & White’ series, You’ll instantly  notice some similarities between those two titles.  They both may be called “God simulation games”, ‘cause in both of them we take up a role of tremendous beings, with power to shape the world itself, and the humans are only there as some kind of a cattle, growing and expanding their culture thanks to, or despite our actions.In Reus, we get to control not one, but four godlike beings – The Giants, awoken from their slumber by the power of The Planet itself, in order to reshape it, and make habitable for humans. Each of those cute beings rules over one aspect of the planet – oceans, forests, swamps and mountains/desserts, but in order to restore life, and make it blossom again, they’ll need to use, and combine all of their powers.One of the main problems Giants will encounter, and an inspiration behind the game itself, will be a growing greed of the human race. This feature not only defines gameplay pace, but also may prove crucial in achieving game objectives, required to unlock more complex resources. Basically the more goods You’ll provide to humans, the more they’ll want, and while trying to get them they’ll no compromise, resolving to fighting with each other, launching a full scale war or even attempting an attack on The Giants themselves.But the best thing about ‘Reus’ is a seemingly endless, and flexible number of possible development strategies. Every resource created has its own unique “symbiosis” making it more potent under certain conditions. For example certain plant may provide more “food” while growing next to a mineral, which may also benefit further from the nearby animal nest. With 108 different types of resources present in total, You’ll need a long time to discover all potentially useful combinations, and craft Your own unique strategy to master the game, and help Your humans complete most challenging projects !The last thing worth mentioning about this game, are its undoubtedly beautiful visuals. The whole planet, The Giants, and human villages are set in a cute, round and pleasant 2D environment. This concept fits the game perfectly, and in symbiosis (sic.) with a good soundtrack makes a perfectly addicting combination definitely worth it’s price !Pros:-	Extremely high replayability.-	In-game milestones provide targets for every round.-	Intense theorycrafting is possible, due to a huge number of possible choices.-	Lively community, developing its own challenges, and competitions. (Official Reus Forum[forums.abbeygames.com])-	Cute and enjoyable visuals.Cons:-	Unusual gameplay, may be boring for some players.-	It takes time to figure out every aspect of the game.			"

												I love this game. But--full disclosure--the strategy genre is almost exclusively where I spend my gaming hours. The remaining time is usually allocated to sandbox games, and Reus sort of falls into both these categories.While definitely not an open world game by any stretch of the imagination [the world is literally a closed ring], Reus follows the sandbox/god game pattern of affecting the world in a way similar to an artist painting a portrait. Using the proper tools (the Giants and their abilities), you masterfully paint your world on the blank canvas that is the earth. Unlike the artist, however, your creations are living beings!The ExperienceFor the most part, you play the game by ordering your four Giants to either place resources, augment existing resources, terraform/terramorph the planet, or attack an area. This basic premise is compelling, and the art style is rather charming. However, once you start to really dig in to Reus, its weaknesses start to come to the surface.At a macro level, the only real issue with the game is its repetitiveness; a trait which is no stranger to the genre, and Reus certainly doesn't aim to change that. You're literally starting from the same place every time you play [an empty planet], with little deviation in your opening choices from game to game. This weakness is something of a non-issue to genre fans, of course. Just be aware that if you struggle to enjoy city/empire-building strategy games like Civilization V, for instance, you're not likely to be won over by Reus.The MechanicsMore specific to the gameplay: the aspect of Reus that makes it compelling happens to also be its biggest drawback. Reus retains replay value in two major ways: randomness/chance and unlocks [achievements]. The random aspect is the aforementioned double-edged sword: your villages grow by completing projects, which are chosen from a pool of potential projects (depending on terrain, etc.), which each have a randomly-chosen resource perk, which in turn dictates how you should build moving forward.This RNG is obviously intended to keep the game fresh, however it is often at odds with the direction your unlocks want you to follow (especially once you're down to your last handful). The game requires a lot of pre-planning (prepare to spend a lot of time reading the wiki), but then forces you to rely very heavily on what are essentially a series of dice rolls to line up perfectly. If you're averse to save scumming, you're gonna have a bad time.The game engine also has minor goofs from time to time [no surprise, it's an indie game!]. Such as: a village spiking from 1 greed [high levels of greed are obtained by growing too fast and determine how aggressive villagers are] to attacking their neighbors just by loading savegame. These events seem to be rare, however.Conclusion TL;DRIf you enjoy the planning aspect of strategy games, and don't mind a lot of waiting [as resources build and for projects to start/finish], Reus is will reward you with hours upon hours of relaxing cognition.Seriously. Reus can give Civilization a run for its money with all the pausing and tabbing out you do in a 120-minute game.			"

												Reus has a cute, endearing art style that really works and brings the game together into a cohesive whole. The problem is that that cohesive whole is more of a morsel than a full meal. Gameplay purely comes down to optimizing a very small set of tiles while managing a similarly small set of values, and that truly boils down to a lot of tedious testing which feels more like work than fun. Or you could just go search the wiki for optimal builds, because ultimately, memorizing what building goes with what other building is your end goal. Once you know that, the game is over, and that just isn't enough depth to persuade me to choose it over the myriad of other strategy titles.Abbey Games was really onto something with Reus. I see the potential, but somewhere along the way, they took a wrong turn. I really wanted to like this game -- and I did enjoy the art style -- but the gameplay truly fell short. And what is a game without good gameplay?			"

												Reus is a pure optimization game - build a village, give them what they want (but no more) with the limited land available, repeat ad nauseum. The various tech trees of plants/animals/minerals hides its information away and it quickly becomes apparent that the most optimal way to play is with an Excel Spreadsheet and the Wiki next to it. Your reward for optimizing and completing a project is ambassadors and buildings you can use to do more optimizing, all while staring at the same planet you set up at the very start of the game. Want to go exploring the tech tree? Too bad, you've just ruined all the bonuses from your old plants and need to set up new ones, all while dealing with obnoxious cooldown timers.Reus isn't bad at what it does, but it lacks purpose beyond optimization for its own sake.

												PLAY THIS - if you like puzzles, achievement and level unlocks, building and planning thingsDON'T PLAY THIS - if you are looking for a God game with the usual fanfare of fancy spells and conflictOVERALL - Recommended, assuming you like a bit of a development puzzle. Solid game, best played casually once in a while, interesting alternative take on what a God Game is.At first glance you might be forgiven for thinking Reus is a god game. And at the start, in a very simple way - it is. But that's not what Reus is about - Reus more than anything is a puzzle development game, which just so happens to have god like giants striding around carrying out your latest puzzle solving commands.You can probably stop reading here and decide whether you like progressive puzzles that require repeated plays to figure out. If you don't you can skip Reus. If you do, or at least you really like at least the theme of a God Game that's actually a puzzle game...The first couple of hours of Reus will get you familiar with moving your guys around, creating the land types - and what kind of variations you can get up to, and most importantly of all will introduce you to the main element of the game - puzzling out the transformations of one resource type into another.At this point you might leave the game alone. A light game. Couple of hours of play. I get it.But, if you're the type of player that likes to build things that will see you progressing and unlocking new capabilities and achievements, that enjoys trying to optimise and plan a better setup, then Reus could lock you up for countless hours.As Reus progresses your virtual world dwellers will demand ever increasingly impressive buildings to be built for them - and your job is to supply the required number of resources to do that. But resources are not just a simple task of sticking down a mine here and an animal there. In Reus there are dozens of resources - and most of them can only be utilised in a not so easy to navigate upgrade tree.What you can build depends on how many successful projects you have built in the world - and therefore the upgrades your giants have in order to place ever better resources and upgrades, and also how far through the game you have progressed. Most of the upgrades and buildings will simply be unavailable to the starting player, and the game will need repeated plays for you to unlock achievements and unlock those better resources. It will often be the case that you will be able to progress so far - and then no more, as your paltry set of resources just don't have enough clout to cater to the demands of your meeples.Reus has a lot of depth to it. The sheer number of resources available and their unique synergies with other things around them gives a huge amount of variation in effect. And this gives rise to a fairly interesting laid back game that comes down to puzzling out the best placement and interaction of what's available to you. But it takes time. Reus is going to eke out what it lets you play with so that you need to play it over and over again. As each unlock opens up new capabilities so you will be able to push the envelope and release a new set of unlocks and so on. As the depth of your unlocks increases so too does the time required to get your civilisations up to the point where they can start utilising them.Nice progressive game mechanic, or cynical attempt at lengthening game replayability of an otherwise much shorter game ?Overall Reus is worth playing, it's a solid game and has some nice depth to it - just how long you will be playing for depends on you temperament.

												Reus is a solid god simulation game. It is quite unique, there is a lot in the form of unlockables and plenty of combinations and variation among the different resources and mechanics. Besides the somewhat annoying project mechanic, the game functions well and is quite addicting, not to mention it has a nice and beautiful little art style. There is some basic functionality lacking in the form of speeding up time or customizing your game settings more and the game can get repetitive.I would have loved to see them go a little bit more all-out with this. Lets be honest, every god game needs to have vulcanoes. More music tracks would have been great, weather systems could be interesting or more advanced combat simulation would all work so very well in this game, but it is either way definitely worth the money and I can certainly recommend it.

			Reus! The Dutch word for ""Giant"" is a game about.. Giants! Shocking I know! But is this 2D god game from Abbey Games an interesting and enjoyable simulation game, or is it more of a GIANT pain?

												This game isn't that bad, it's just that after a several games, if you want to progress you need to learn by heart every type of building, power, etc. and their interactions. It's frustrating since at some point you need to be a total expert of the game if you want to ever have fun again. That's too much effort for me.			"

Short Verdict: Reus is a beautiful strategy, god simulator game. You control 4 giants who can terraform the planet, and add animals, plants and minerals, while you watch peoples settling villages, exploring the resources you made available, getting greedy, waging wars and even attacking you. I have to say that I don't usually like games froms this genre, but Reus has so many fresh elements and the concept appealed so much to me that I've really enjoyed playing it--and I still will in the future! I've played it for 20h so far, or so it seems, but I'm definitely not done with Reus. It has a few minor flaws, but it's a great game.Pros: Reus features something really nice called symbiosis, which means some natural sources (animals, plants and minerals) get bonuses when put close to or distant from other elements Gorgeous 2D graphics Each giant has a unique set of skills, which you can unlock and upgrade as you complete projects Speaking of which, projects are like short-term objectives you need to achieve for a tribe and they give bonuses to the tribes and provide ambassadors to improve your giants' skills There 3 unique main biomes (forest, swamp and desert), plus 2 extra minor biomes (mountains and sea), each of those having their own sets of natural sources In-game achievements unlock new natural sources, adding new elements to new games, not to mention they provide ideas for what you should do in a given era, adding a lot of replay value Reus also disencourages you from getting ahead of yourself and starting to create a lot of natural sources, since they make your tribe greedy and you may end up losing everything or even being attacked. If you still wanna rush, you can add ""awe"" and/or ""danger"" (by setting the right natural sources), so the villagers are struck by them and don't have time to get greedy. Basically, you can play the game and succeed using different strategies, which adds a lot of replay value to the gameCons: The beginning of each era (or ""game"", if you'd prefer) is always the same, and that takes a bit of the replay value away--the only difference is what you decide to do in a given era. So I always sigh when I'm starting a new era. And usually I have no patience to start a new game right after finishing another one. The game starts really slow, then in the end your giants can't handle all the fuss anymore, unless (maybe) if you activate a cheat (they call it ""alternative option"") to make them faster. Giants' speed could've been more fine-tuned. Greed sucks. I love the concept, but you should be able to do something to make it go down. Once a village becomes greedy, nothing will revert that. Then you'd have to either deal with it until the end of the era, or destroy it and start from scratch. And you'll probably have to destroy all natural sources, too, since a new village settled in the same spot with become greedy in seconds! Not a con to me, but many people mentioned it, so I thought I should, too: you'll be doing a lot of math in your head! ""If I change my chickens for a salt mine, I lose 3 food, but I get 10 money. Oh, wait, but I'll lose that other symbosis and I'll lose 10 tech, but I'll get 15 awe from a new symbiosis..."" etc. Because of that, Reus generates a lot of analysis paralysis--you'll probably pause a lot and spend at least 3 or 4 hours playing a one-hour era.Bought on: I actually traded a bundle link for Reus for another one I had. But it's not an expensive game. Definitely worth its full price.			"

												Initially I liked the style but expected more of a god sim rather than a super slow resource management. I did not expect to be waiting ages for the giants to move around to a tile either or to be waiting a long time for resources to build up or for a building ability to cool down so that I can use it again (and you do use them a lot). Everything is sooooo slow here. Even the (forced) tutorials are a drag. And in the end it's not even to an excting end goal, theres nothing to do except help with managing the resources to keep things going. What a bore..			"

												Reus first appears as a simple 2D god / civilization builder game however it quickly becomes a mundane and tedious game of managing each city's projects and all of the lands. You are limited to playing a 30 or 60 minute game on a fresh world, where each time you are trying to unlock new objects and achieve different goals. The total amount of different objects and goals becomes overwhelming to figure out what you really need to accomplish during a certain playthrough. To really understand and become efficient at the game you probably need to either practice different methods or read guides to figure out the best setup. After playing a few different worlds the game unfortunately did not hold my interest and when multiple cities are up and running it becomes a chore to multitask each city.			"

												Overall, I suppose it's not a *bad* game.  However, I find that in the late game, you end up spending more time keeping your citizens from from killing you or themselves rather than trying to reach your overall objective.  I realize that is part of the game mechanics, but one minute of inattention can quickly ruin all your hard work.  A greedy/warlike city can easily kill your giants or another prosperous village, which gets very frustrating.  Also, it seems to hog a lot of resources for what appears to be a simple game...In short, I suggest finding a better title, and only getting this game if it's very cheap.			"

												Picked this game up during the fall sale 2013 since the art style looked interesting and I enjoy the god-game genre. It didn't take long to discover that this game is clearly not for me - this game involves growing numbers to certain values to proceed to the next stage by placing tiles (e.g. food, science, gold) with absolutely nothing for the player to do in the meantime - a problem magnified by the lack of simple time acceleration controls. Optimizing the aquisition of these values involve placing the tiles in the correct order, making each run a predictable excerise in mathematics. The villages/villagers are a simple repeating animation, there is no simulation here. I do think this game has a place with a younger audience, otherwise, make sure you play a demonstration first.

												It's a great game if you like trying to maximize efficiency. There is something very satisfying about cobbling together a few planets and trying to make thing coexist... then learning new strategies and patterns that are even more fruitful. There is a nice steadily deepening set of gameplay mechanics that comes with the resources you unlock at the end of each world that leaves me looking forward to the start of the next era. There are also interesting challenges presented (Like have a village reach a certain prosperity using only plants and animals) which let you try something out of the ordinary. These challenges do bring one of my few gripes though, as I'm never sure when a village is going to expand (and include a resource that is not allowed) or if I'm even allowed to use adjacency bonuses with offending resources that are outside of the village borders.For those who want to know a little more about the game:This a game is all about adjacency bonuses. There are two basic kinds of plants/minerals/animals per biome and 5 biomes. Then all of those can be evolved a couple of times with various aspects... and each stage of evolution has different bonuses, usually pertaining to what it is near. This on it's own could probably be mathematically solved pretty easily to yield the greatest possible output of the planet you control, but then there's humans that pop up and build cities over some resources and have projects that they want to build, throwing in extra bonuses that apply to things within their border. At the end of the era, you unlock new plants and animals and minerals to use in future plays. "

												I was going to hold off writing this review until I had more time in the game, but I woke up this morning confused as to why everything wasn't labled with their resource value, so I guess you can say it's made an impression.  Theoretically, Reus is very similar to most civ-strategy games. Resource management is the core mechanic, upgrades are vitally important for continued advancement, great works will occupy a lot of your energy, and warfare is an ever-looming danger. What sets Reus apart is that you're not trying to make one civilization the best in the world; instead, you ARE the world, and you're trying to make ALL civilization succeed.You exert your will via four semi-elemental Giants - titans, really - each with unique but related powers that alter the landscape of your surface. Humans will automatically settle and then try to form a civilization depending on what resources you give them. You then care for your babies, give them what they need, what they want, and watch as they thrive. But be careful not to give them too much, or they'll grow greedy and war-like; at this point, you either sit back and watch them form an empire, or take action and smite their army - or the entire town.The game's replay value comes largely from its slew of challenges, which largely boil down to ""Be this successful with these limitations."" The only way to complete these challenges is by repeatedly playing the game until you understand how resources interact with each other - called Symbiosis because, you know, nature - so that you can maximize resource output with minimal combinations. Completing these challenges unlocks further Transmutations (resource upgrades) that then make it possible to complete even more challenges. So yes, the achievements actually mean something, which means that every time you play, you have to play differently. So if the game gets boring, well, that's your problem.			"

												Part Black & White, part Doodle God, part Triple Town. Reus is a game I've wanted to play for a long time but now that I've gotten to know it better, I can't help but be disappointed.You see, the planet awoke from its sleep and saw that everything on its surface was dead. So it sent the Giants to make it habitable, and not long after, little creatures called men appeared. The Giants tried hard to help humanity develop, but the harder they tried, the greedier the people became. And so it went until the mission timer run out and the planet went to sleep again.In Reus, you control the four Giants, your avatars in this world. Through them, you terraform the earth, place different resources to attract the humans, and then make sure that they have everything they need. The last part involves upgrading resources and placing them in such a way as to make use of their special properties and synergies. In return for your help, humans will offer ""ambassadors"", who grant your Giants new powers. But if you let any village grow too fast, it will accumulate greed. Greedy villages will start waging war on other humans, and eventually will even turn on the Giants. Then, assuming they haven't grown too powerful yet, you need to punish or even completely destroy them.This all probably sounds great. In particular, the idea of having to maintain a balance between growth and peace is fairly interesting. Unfortunately, the game is actually rather shallow. Terraforming, for instance, is limited to making a mountain (which will, in turn, create a desert) or a sea (which will create a ""wet wasteland"" that you can turn into a forest or swamp area). Notice I said ""a"" mountain... You don't really get the ability to freely change the shape of the planet; instead, your actions are sort of symbolic.Even the ""balance"" idea is not really as fleshed out as I wished. Essentially, you can only grow any given village in little steps. If you add too many minerals at once, for instance, or ones that are too ""powerful"", the greed will start accumulating. You can combat this in a couple ways, and it's not a terrible mechanic (though it is somewhat annoying at times), but it doesn't really reach the potential I thought it would; for instance, interactions between the villages matter little, there's also no ""civilization vs nature"" conflict you might expect. Perhaps I hyped myself too much.The worst example of the game's shallowness is actually the most core of its gameplay mechanics — exploiting the many different resources. In order to efficiently use resources, you need to place them in certain ways: for example, placing an animal next to some particular mine will give a bonus to that mine. But the animal itself may want a plant next to it. Of course, you will quickly find out that basic resources are really weak and so you will start ""transmuting"" them. Unfortunately, you don't know what the new type will do, other than from a very short description in-game — or your memory — and the effects and interactions are not really that intuitive.It turns out that rather than strategy, what Reus requires is trivia knowledge. Pretty soon you'll be checking the wiki to get a quick reference or plan your moves — in fact, the game links to its wiki from the main menu. But if your core gameplay revolves around something that can or even should be done through referencing a wiki, and there's little thinking otherwise, then something's wrong.That's not to say that because Reus is shallow, it doesn't have a lot of content or good ideas. It does actually allow you to use different strategies or playing styles, mostly through deciding what you want your Giants to specialize in. Do you want to focus on animals or plants? Of course, getting the animals specialization may require a swamp village... And so on.There is a lot of different resources to use, too, with complicated ""evolution paths"" to get them. Most will be locked at the start of the game and will require fulfilling ""developments"" to get, which are essentially in-game achievements. (If the name ""developments"" seems somewhat awkward, well, the whole game is sort of like this, full of typos and weird turns of phrase.) I know some people dislike achievements in general but in this case, their use is great. In fact, I would say that their lack would pretty much break the game — I, personally, feel like I'd spend just a couple hours exploring the mechanics and quickly get bored. ""Developments"" provide you with goals to fulfill and different ideas for playthroughs, to motivate you to continue playing.The playthroughs themselves are interesting because of the limited time you have. You can actually specify whether you want a 30, 60 or 120-minute long ""match"". I felt this worked fantastically in the beginning, as I could have a quick, half-an-hour game whenever I felt like it. But eventually, you start needing that extra time to further develop your villages and fulfill more difficult ""developments"". It all starts to slug down then.It's hard for me to rate Reus in terms of ""buy it""/""don't buy it"". I spent some considerable time playing it and don't really regret it. At the same time, it was underwhelming. The premise is great, yet the execution very shallow. It has good music but the graphics I didn't really like, and overall the game feels and looks kind of like a Flash game. Perhaps it could have been made better through the inclusion of some co-op multiplayer mode — it really feels like it should be there. But as long as the gameplay relies on you remembering odd transmutations, it doesn't really offer the sort of depth I was expecting.In the end, I can't really recommend you get Reus unless you feel that the mechanics I described here are something you'd really enjoy. But to be fair, if there was a neutral grade for Steam reviews, that's what Reus would get. It's not bad, just underwhelming.			"

												This was a very pretty looking game, and by the videos and screenshots alone, I had figured perhaps it would be a fun little sim game! But.. it's actually just a lot of min-maxing, crunching numbers by placing specific resources down in a particular way to gain maximum efficiency. The game quickly turns into a numbers game, which simply is not my cup of tea. I do not have enough hours to say if the game truly picks up the pace, but from what I have played, it's -very- slow paced.Buy it on sale, and definitely look up some video reviews or gameplay before you decide if this is the game for you.

												As far as god games go, this game is QUITE different than the status quo.  You work to unlock upgrades to existing items - you will unlock some based on things you create, and some on achievements you get.  As the people develop, you can unlock different plants, animals, and minerals to use.  Every game is different - you upgrade your giants in different ways to unlock different powerups, placable levels, and special abilities.I spent so many hours trying to figure out what combinations work well together.  If you like figuring things out, and retrying different combinations, you will love this game.  Tons of achievements to be had, and you work for every upgrade you get!  Only thing that is annoying is the fact that you have to wait to unlock longer ""eras"" where you get to play for longer in a game.  But that unlocks quick enough.			"

												A very sad near-complete waste of potential. Should have been great. Comes close to being great. Ends up mediocre and frustrating.So, you think this is a god game, right? Well, not so much. It's more of a puzzle game. The gameplay is based on villages that can use a few tiles around them, and you have to use your giants to put resources on those tiles and improve them. Pretty much all the resources have interaction bonuses, so you have to place the right combination of resources in the right order so as to get maximum progress for a village. It's not as fun as it sounds.The first annoyance is that there's no in-game guide to what the upgraded resources do. You can see what the current level's possible upgrades can do, but for the levels after that, you have to alt-tab into the wiki. And since different level resources have wildly varying effects, this is important. The same applies for placing a basic resource - what you get depends on the terrain, but there's no tooltip for it, so either you have to memorize it or alt-tab into the wiki. Or just place something to find out. But that's not a good idea, because the giants' abilities are on cooldowns.And speaking of cooldowns, you'll be annoyed at those a lot. See, you can't just freely place resources to solve the maximum efficiency puzzle. No, there's a cooldown on the resource-placing ability, and a cooldown on the upgrade-boosting ability. The latter is very important, because without it there's a 67% chance of getting the bad version of the ""aspect"" that you need to place in a resource to upgrade it. And you'll be dealing with this multiple times, because the game goes something like this:- Place initial basic resources- Complete projects for villages to get more powers for your giants- Use those powers to upgrade the resources- Rearrange resources because higher level resources have different combination effects- Use resources to complete more projects for villages- Get second level resource planting abilities- Re-plant, re-boost, re-imbue and re-upgrade EVERYTHING!- Use resources to complete MORE projects for villages- Get second level ""aspect""-imbuing abilities- Re-plant, re-boost, re-imbue and re-upgrade EVERYTHING!- Dunno what's next. I got too bored to continue. According to the wiki, there's a third level to the abilities, so extrapolate that into more re-doing everything.Add to that the fact that village projects take up tiles and wipe whatever you had placed there upon spawning, casuing you to potentially have to rearrange everything in the area, and you get a lot of frustration.Now, all this on its own wouldn't be too terrible. What makes it inexcusable is that the main game mode has an arbitrary time limit. A limit of 30, 60 or 120 minutes, your choice. After you unlock the longer options, of course.Yes. You read that right. A god game, a management strategy game, has an arbitrary time limit before it wipes your progress and you get to start the next session on a barren planet. I'm not joking.It doesn't need to be said that one of the major appeals of this type of game is the opportunity to craft a working city/region/ecosystem/whatever and have it sitting there for you to admire. This game goes in the opposite direction. You get a short time frame to set up a few villages before the session ends and reports what achievements you've gotten and what upgrades they've unlocked. Then you start over, using the upgrades to get more achievements.There exists a free play mode, but it feels hollow, as you're locked out of the progression system. And you'd have to cheat first to get the unlocks, because free play only lets you use what you've unlocked in time-limited mode.Another thing that needs to be mentioned is how disappointingly simplistic the humans are. The store page description promises virtues and vices, and your giants praising and punishing them. In reality, a Greed stat is all there is. It goes up when the village still hasn't begun using all the resources you've made available, and it goes down when the village catches up. That's it. It's a pretty transparent way to implement an arbitrary limit on the speed of village growth, and this in a game with arbitrary time limits on game sessions. I don't get it.A predictable aggression mechanic is shoehorned in - at about half greed, the village will start attacking other villages, and at full greed it will start attacking your giants. If the latter happens, you have to destroy 3 armies and it will become peaceful and go down to 0 greed. This mechanic tends to be quite annoying, because there are achievements (and associated unlocks) tied to villages winning a number of wars, but they stop attacking other villages if they get too greedy (and turn on your giants), so you have to keep providing a surplus of one type of resource, waiting for the greed to go up until the village catches up, waiting for the greed to go down somewhat, then replacing the tiles with another type of resource, waiting for the greed to go up until the village catches up, etc.All that said, the game is still close to being great. If it was based on unlimited play, with unlocks becoming available as they're achieved, not at the end of a session, and with village projects being built on the tiles already taken up by the village instead of on resource tiles, those 2 changes alone would be enough to turn me into a fan.Gameplay aside, the game is at least quite visually appealing.

-Quick Review-Reus is a simulation strategy game that allows you to control four giants to create a whole world. You can choose between swamps, deserts, mountains, oceans and forests. As you create your world humans will build cities, will you help the humans achieve a utopia... or you can smash them... they probably reserved it. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Has anyone seen this ever watched the old cartoon ""The Iron Giant""? (Warner bros, 1999) This game is nothing like that movie. I just wanted to see if there's anyone else that remembers that film. Actually all that's similar is the giant aspect.I don't think there is a single word spoken throughout the game, the game starts out by teaching you how to use the various giants. and explains how to shape the world around you. When I started I felt very overwhelmed about how much I had to learn, don't worry about learning it all right away, you'll have plenty of time to slowly get used to the concepts in the game as you progress.As you play you unlock new animals/fruit/plants and longer world lengths. As you progress you need to accomplish various different goals, this give the game a sense of direction to keep trying to get better, and experience different things.Game Play: You only control 4 giants, you select various abilities and tell them where to build and what to build. When the humans show up you try to help them and keep their development very balanced so that they don't have more than their neighbors and try to prevent wars... unless you want wars, then go ahead and give one city all the things and watch the humans become greedier then Ebenezer Scrooge.the game controls are simple, you can play the game with just clicking, but I try to get used to the hot keys for faster response time. the giant also need to move to the selected location before it can build or destroy anything, this does limit how fast you can create on your world. Achievements: The achievements in Reus are tied directly with achievements in game, and these achievements, when earned, unlock various new animals/fruit/plants to add to your world. This makes getting achievements actually mean something, other then aesthetics and a good pat on the back. Price: Reus costs $9.99, I've put in 11 hours so far, this game is by far worth it's price. I did buy the game over the steam summer sale, but even at full price that's pretty good quality. Conclusion: I strongly recommend the game to anyone who likes strategy games, again the game has some fun things to unlock, and various ways to play through it to unlock more the controls are simple, the strategy is engaging, and I just enjoyed playing this game, and will continue playing because I still haven't played through without getting at least one new thing unlocked.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 05, 2015: fixed a few spelling errors, and concluded you can just smash the puny humans instead of caring about their greed.

												Cute art. Relaxing, but fairly repetitive game. Trying to unlock everything can be challenging. If you're not a completionist, you'll probably get bored after the first few games.You control four elemental gods: rock, forest, ocean, and swamp. They can create three inhabitable biomes upon the planet: swamp, forest, or desert. Additionally, they can each create and improve different versions of the three resources: food, gold, and tech. As you create resources, villages settle around them. As the villages improve, they will pick specialties and demand more of some of the resources. If you give them too much too fast, they will become greedy and attack each other. If you don't satisfy their needs in time, their specialty will disappear. If you do satisfy their needs, they will gift you with an ambassador. Ambassadors are used to increase the power of your gods. Each god will get different powers from the ambassador depending on the village's biome.On its face, the game is quite simple. When you aim for some of the more advanced achievements, you are forced to strategize a lot more. On which biomes should I allow villages to settle so I can get the best ambassadors? Which giant should pick up that ambassador? How do I grow this village without it becoming too greedy? If you enjoy micromanaging, this game might be right up your alley.			"

												Reus is a puzzle game about placing objects in a line to create synergies, providing resources for towns.  It is not a strategy game, and it is not quite a god game; it is a puzzle game.  The major flaw seems to be that every action needs to be premeditated; if you don't keep track of every single item that the giants can create (and in what contexts the item can exist), you can't create enough resources for the towns to progress.  The game seems to be best played with a piece of paper detailing all the important synergies in order to be able to place the very few successful combinations that can get you to advance.  Without an incredible supply of patience and a taste for puzzle games, the game simply isn't all that enjoyable.			"

												Reus is a solid and entertaining game. You control four giants who help form a brand new planet as you see fit. It takes some strategy to combine the right resources so that you villages may flourish. And that makes it really addictive, because the better your villages do, the more powers your giants get to add new and more powerful resources. The game also makes good use of developments/achievements, which in itself is quite rewarding when you finish a game.When starting out playing this game it might take a while to figure out how to combine resources and how to make your giants stronger, but don't let this get you down. You learn a lot by just trying stuff and the in-game explanations make combining resources easier. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes a perfect mix of good artwork and intelligent gameplay. It's one of the best ones I've ever played!			"

												It's like an RTS, except that it's not. Feels more like a great implementation of a non-existant euro-style board game. It's a match-3 game, except it's not. It's addictive, because there's always something new to do and the animations are fun and rewarding. When you zoom out, you really feel like you're creating a pocket world. It's humbling, because it keeps telling you that each era comes and goes, and you (the planet) slumber every now and then, waiting for life to spark up again, somewhere.			"

												There are two schools of game design. The first, puts emphasis on how things “feel”. The second, tries to make all the numbers add up on a spreadsheet. The first may not be all that balanced, but the second tends to be no fun at all. Reus leans too much towards the second.A session of Reus goes like this: you pick how long you want to play, 30, 60 or 120 minutes. There is a non-time limited Freeplay, but you won’t unlock any new technologies in that mode. As the game starts, you’re presented with a flat, formless planet and four Giants. Each Giant represents a sort-of element: Water, Swamp, Forest and Rock. Each can terraform the landscape in their own way, and manipulate the ecosystem by creating creatures or plants. Casting these “spells” costs nothing, and often you’ll have to overwrite previously placed elements as the situation changes.Spells don’t have any real logical match-up to their Giant, which can be very confusing until you have it all mapped out via rote memorization. After a terrain type has been made, such as forest, settlers will move in and set up a little camp. The way the Giants move around, the circular cut-away view of the planet, and all the little people doing their thing, is very charming. But underneath that charm is a very cold, soulless spreadsheet that governs how the game plays out.Reus is more of a puzzle game than a god sim. Settlers will construct a “project”, mostly at random, and you need to manage the landscape within a town’s boundaries to meet the project’s completion criteria. These range from having enough Food, Tech, or more difficult ones, like going to war with another settlement. Fauna and flora have “synergies”, which unlock additional resources when things are placed a certain way. It’s a house-of-cards balancing act, placing things next to other things in the most optimal way. When a project completes, you gain an Ambassador which - when paired with a specific Giant - unlocks more powers for that Giant. New projects start, and you need to rearrange things to meet the new criteria.The foil to the system comes from Greed. If a town grows too fast, or lacks sufficient Threat from nearby Predators, they’ll stop fearing the Giants and may even start to attack them with arrows. Which is possibly the only real humanising moment to be found in the game, watching the Giants cower. When the time limit runs out, the Giants go to sleep, and you unlock new technologies to use in the next session, depending on how well you did.I kept asking myself, “is Reus badly designed, or am I just bad at it?” It’s a difficult question, made all the more vexing when you’re aware of the Dunning–Kruger effect. Reus is a badly designed game. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad game. There just isn’t much to it.			"

												Reus, the Dutch word for giant. What an appropriate name for a game with such scale. At first glance Abbey Games’ Reus may not look like much, a simple god game with a lack of depth and strategy. But with further examination there is more to Reus than meets the eye. If you can get past the slow start of tutorials there is a surprising amount to learn and discover.In Reus you are the planet and control 4 giants, the Forest Giant who can create the forest biome as well as basic plant life. The Swamp Giant who can create the swamp biome as well as animals and plants. The Ocean Giant who creates the ocean biome allowing the planet’s soil to support forests and swamps and the Rock Giant who creates the desert biome and raises mountains as well as minerals from the earth’s surface. All these giants are used together to create increasingly advanced forms of life as you progress through the game.Creating life attracts humans; humans will create villages on your planet in the varying environments provided. These villages will start out as simple towns, but can grow into prospering cities when the right resources have been expanded and advanced. Villages will construct projects requiring certain amounts of food, wealth and technology from resources to be completed. Once completed ambassadors will be asked to join your giants, unlocking new abilities and resources. Reus features many different mechanics including a greed system that can lead to wars with other villages and eventually the giants themselves. Reus is best played when the player is left to discover the game by themselves so I won’t spoil anymore and really, there is too much for me to get into detail about everything.The way you progress through Reus is rather interesting, and for me the most engaging part of the experience. Progression through the game is made by the collection of achievements, the game is on a timer and when you first start you are given 30 minutes to evolve your planet and complete the goals required to earn achievements. Earn enough and longer time periods are granted.  Achievements also unlock greater and more powerful plants, minerals and animal life so it is certainly necessary, and satisfying to collect them all. Your level of enjoyment in Reus will be determined by the kind of player you are. For me, Reus really engaged me, and immersed me in its world. It had my interest right from the start and that interest continued to grow as I discovered everything the game had to offer. However, I am the kind of player who loves to collect things, loves to level up my character until it reaches maximum rank. If activities such as achievement collecting or world building does not interest you your opinion on Reus may vary, but even so I have to recommend Reus to everyone. Even if it doesn’t seem like the kind of game you would enjoy I strongly suggest that you give Reus a shot. You could end up having a great time of gigantic proportions!			"

												Reus is just another Indie game. This game will give you a planet with four giants (Forest, Desert, Swamp, and Water) to create life on it. The giants help human to build their village and resources, like fruits, herbs, mine, and animals. Nomad will move to your village as soon as more resources are available. You as a ""God"" of the planet should take care of them. The villager can be greedy because they want more than expected.You are limited to 30 minutes to play the game for the first time. Then, the playing time changes to 60 minutes and 120 minutes. You will be given a challenge for each playing session. When a challenge is completed, the achievement will be unlocked. Some challenges are easy but others are not. Anyway, you can also play tutorial.Speaking of game features, this game has nice 2D graphic that you can zoom in-out to see the details. I like their art styles. Keyboard and mouse are supported. I recommend to use both when you're playing the game because there is keyboard shortcut. Keyboard shortcut helps you to choose a giant easily. By the way, Reus is available on Linux. If you are a Linux gamer, this game may be your next wishlist.So, I would recommend this game.Note: the store page of this game doesn't tell if the game is available on Linux. I have played this game for more than 40 hours. It runs flawlessly on Linux.			"

												Reus has great style and a wonderful concept. You're in charge of 4 different giants to terraform a 2D earth and appease human settlements in their own ways. Watch them expand, fight for resources, etc. The key is building synergy. This game might really appeal to some, so I would suggest giving it a try if you're paying a fraction of the price. However, I just couldn't vibe with how the game plays out. Implemented time limits and reconfiguring resources just right proved more frustrating than rewarding in an otherwise relaxing game. I want to like it, but I straight up don't want to play it any more.What ended as a thumbs down for me could be an entirely different story for you here.			"

												I do not reccomend Reus. While it is a cool concept for a game, the game quickly grows stale and boring quickly, and after playing it once or twice, I found myself not picking it back up, instead opting for other games. I thought on it, and decided this was because of how restricted it was, it allowed you to puppet everything, but didn't allow you any actual power over many things in the game, it felt more like a game of watching rather than doing. It earns a 5/10. Stale and boring.			"

												It is a tough call not to recommend this game, it is well thought-out and a clever use of elements and game play.  It is largely a 'spinning plates' affair where you have to keep track of a lot of individual and interacting elements to make the most out of each play through.  Mostly this game amounts to nothing more than Achievement hunting, but if that is your thing, maybe you will like it more that I did.  For me it was cute for a time, but I quickly got bored with it.The only significant problem, even for Achievement hunters, is there is no in-game upgrade tree or information menu.  Efficent planning is essential to acquiring whichever goal you are hunting, having to plant and re-plant resources hunting for that one you couldn't quite remember how to get, is time wasting and frustrating.  A simple menu option that allows you to check the upgrade steps for any resource you have unlocked isn't exactly a big ask. The fact they seem to expect you to remember the variations for a dozen different resources that have different, branching upgrade paths depending on which of the four different elements they can be placed in, seems like a bit much for what is, at its core, a casual game.

												I like this game, even though I kinda suck at it.  I'm slowly learning what everything means.  I play mostly RPG and FPS, so this is a departure from that style but a welcome change.What I like about it is the concept is unique, having the giants.  The Steam achievements actually help guide me with things to focus on to earn, and there are a ton of achievements.  The overall feel of the game is nice, and visually appealing.  It's easy to navigate, switching between buildings, giants, creating things, or just checking the stats or details on an object.  There is plenty of detail about what everything means, and the relationships between them.  I've had zero issues with glitches of any kind, so to me it's a very stable game.It's a challenge to learn, but fun to learn it. There are plenty of helpful guides out there made by gamers, if you get stuck or are looking for alternate strategies like me.			"

												What an utterly charming game!  It certainly put me in mind of both Black & White and Populous, both games I loved once upon a time.  The graphics, while simplistic, are candy to the eye and suit the theme of the game perfectly.  It's suprisingly complex; easy to learn, difficult to master.  The premise is simple on the surface: you're the planet and you've been slumbering in between eras and when you wake, you use the last of your energy to form four gods with different abilities to terraform your surface and make you live again.  As a byproduct of your nature gods' work, nomads choose to settle and form cities and you have to keep them happy via your gods so they don't go to war and decimate each other, and you.  I quickly became obsessed with forming better and better cities within the limits of the planet and my gods' abilities.  Should you wish, you can play for 30 minutes at a time, with longer time limits becoming unlocked as you earn achievements, or you can play sandbox-style once your time is up.  It's fantastic for those times you want to actually relax with a game instead of tensing up on the edge of your chair, screaming obscenities at pixels (which I do quite regularly as well).  It's a perfect gem of a game and I wish I'd known about it sooner.			"

												Meh. I love god-games and city-builders, but Reus is far more of a memorization puzzle than a real strategic experience. That is, there's less that's strategic or tactical about it, and more questions of whether you can remember which exact combinations of resources create the exact resources you need (not a logical process at all - two strawberries, for instance, create awe. Strawberries.) Beautiful, yes, but the gameplay doesn't really grab you, and the unlocks offer little to excite.			"

You have to optimize your (little) space available to produce as much resources as possible, by using various symbiosis effects... And at the same time, you have to manage your towns so they don't massacre each other. Or maybe you want them to massacre each other? It can have benefits.I also found its art style, music, and gameplay insanely relaxing. Overall, a pretty good game.

Easier. Crisies happen less often, economies are more stable and easier to manage, and your little followers are easier to please.While this has been great for making the genre more accessible, it's also had the adverse effect of sometimes making these games... Trivial. Whereas sandbox modes used to be enough to keep a god game fun because of the challenge involved in growing and regulating your domain, a lot of what you're seeing now requires extra layers of stuff such as objectives and whatnot tacked on to keep it fun. While this is not inherently bad, the problem is the actual gameplay isn't designed with these goals in mind well enough, and the management gameplay falls flat.Reus is a fascinating experiment in building a god game with genuinely engaging management gameplay that's actually quite simple to learn. It's very much the same satisfaction you get from playing a good puzzle game as you try to set up the proper improvements you need in the right places, and the progression arc for both a given era and a full game is clever and keeps you engaged, and gives you something new to do every time you play.Overall, this game is a steal for only $10.

												Reus is fun for the first 2-3 hours. By then you've seen everything the game has to offer and realize it isn't worth continuing just to nab all those elusive steam achievements.  The game seems pretty well-made but it is ultimately just a casual god-sim severely lacking in excitement.You control four giants that can terraform a barren planet, adding oceans, forests, mountains, and swamps, as well as plants, animals, and minerals to each.  Your job is to make the planet habitable and provide human settlers with whatever resource they need from food, tech, and wealth.  You have 30 minutes to make the humans as prosperous and happy as possible. Or you could kill them if you think they're becoming too greedy.  The choice is yours and yours alone!Helping the humans complete projects (i.e. acquire a certain amount of food, tech, and wealth in a limited time span) provides an Ambassador for one of your giants.  Picking up the ambassador provides minor power-ups to the abilities you already possess.  The game has 13 different tech trees for you to attempt to understand.  Each possible tech tree is tied to a biome (ocean, forest, mountain, swamp) and resource (animal, plant, mineral).  You cannot unlock all abilities in a single play session, so you'll need to pick and choose how to use your ambassadors to best affect.  I really like this concept, but in practice it is poorly implemented.  The in-game prompts for how Ambassadors affect each giant and how each upgraded ability affects the different resources is incredibly confusing to understand.The game attempts to offer replayability by providing a number of conflicting objectives (steam achievements), forcing you to play a ridiculous number of times in order to complete all the objectives.  (Yes, the steam achievements are the only objectives this game provides.)  Unfortunately, nothing ever changes between plays so the game grows boring very quickly.  The 30-minute sessions just seem to drag on forever, and just when you're wondering if it will ever end, the game then allows you to increase the time limit to 60 minutes.  That's 60 minutes of boredom, catering to the every whim and need of the pesky humans.			"

Freeplay is also quite helpful because there are so many combinations of upgrades for the plants and animals so it makes for good practice to learn how to best play the game to accomplish the various objectives. Well worth the price for the number of hours it will take to get all achievements. And even if your not achievement oriented, well worth the price for how long you enjoy playing before moving on to something else and yet will be likely to still come bact to it from time to time.

												Want to memorize tech trees? This slow, arbitrary game might be for you.Say your Forest Giant creates a fruit plant. Well by default you get blueberries, for no apparent reason. Using powers (""aspects"") from your other giants, you can upgrade those to either strawberries (which produce more food if next to blueberries) or apples (which produce more food if next to animals).The game is built on these sort of relationships between tiles (which surround your planet in a flat circle). There's never much rhyme or reason as to WHY e.g. armadillos produce slightly more food if there's a mineral nearby, or agate produces 10 more wealth if there are adjacent frogs.After playing a few rounds I get the strong impression that this game can be mastered by making a giant spreadsheet, or better, just visiting the wiki. There doesn't seem to be much skill beyond memorizing the abritrary numbers on the various convoluted tech trees.			"

Once your first village has appeared it's up to you to balance helping them develop, achieving prosperity and supporting other villages. You need to balance how much you favour villages otherwise they can become greedy and eventualy resentful leading them to war with other villages or even the giants themselves. If you purchase this game aim for the in game achievements to unlock more options for your next game.

												This one is a philosophic game if I ever saw one. Natural powers are represented by Titans (even though the game calls them ""giants"", to me the word ""Titan"" gives them a lot more better context), who create everything (non)living in the world.Even though all this is made as a gift for the humans, those same Titans are capable of taking away what they have given and smiting ungrateful humans. At the same time human population can try to rebel against the Titans and even destroy them, but ultimately that will lead to their own demise.On the game side, Reus is a satisfying combo-o-matic: place these precious animals next to these minerals and they both receive a performance boost. Then add a bush or berries next to the minerals and even more goodies are generated. Such fun. You could also call this an achievement hunting game and that too is made very well, as some challenges might prove satisfyingly tricky.Most of all, for me, this game provides some casual fun that looks delightful and surely makes its player very happy with its positive core.

												The simplistic and childish-looking graphics would never have made me guess at how much I was going to love this game. It has sucked up hours and hours of my attention as I try to juggle all the demands without falling into wars, to prune my towns' resources until they get what they want, to strive for a new achievement or a new challenge so I can unlock even more resources. This game has thoroughly grabbed me.It's not a sim or a strategy game in the way Civilization, for example, is. But if you enjoy puzzles with a little bit of strategy mixed in, then this game will snare you just like it did to me.			"

												Looks quite simple, but some mechanics are hidden. Once you figure out how to boom your population the game is just a chores list to get achievements. Development of the game died, don't expect any updates. That said you may get quite a few hours of fun. Just buy it if it's on sale.			"

												tl;dr: buy it on sale if you're looking for a decent pass-time, but don't expect to get huge hours of gameplay from it.If you're looking for a simple game to pass the time, Reus will do the job. It's not everything I wanted (I felt like more interaction with the villages would be nice, and wars between them felt like they became one-sided too quickly), but I definitely don't regret the purchase.

												I had high hopes going into this game. It seemed that it all the elements I wanted were right there: godlike powers, freedom to build a world, emergent civilizations. Here's the thing though; it's not really that fun. This game seems to exsist only for you to fufill it's own requirements for an arbritrary reward. That's right, this is an ""achievement-hunting"" game. If you like to complete lists of achievements, this is an awesome game. Those who seek strategy or depth should look elsewhere.			"

												Looked nice at first. As an old Populous guy (Black & White was completely different and incomparable), I was very excited when this finally came out.After a 2 hour playthrough, I seriously got bored. There was not enough depth, and overall the formula for winning was always somewhat obvious (and linear).I didn't quite expect the ""quick run"" concept in this game and thought more in terms of playing a world and developing it for hours end (think 4X games like Civ or city simulation games).It wasn't for me it appears. Too bad, because otherwise I would probably have enjoyed it with its cutesy graphics.			"

												Reus is different from the games I normally play, a god game in which you fill the world with plants, animals, and minerals, nurturing human civilization so that it can thrive and advance.  The game is simple to play and achieve some of the basic milestones, but is deep enough that it will keep you busy for quite a while if you decide to attempt the more difficult challenges.  You will always have different methods available for generating the resources that the human settlements need to prosper, and different ways to keep the greed that these newfound riches create in check.  There is almost always more than one path to victory, whatever it is you decide victory means in a given game.Reus is everything you could ask for in an indy game: it is inexpensive, flavorful, fun, and will provide hours of enjoyment.

Here's my, and everyone else's opinion, REWARDS. We suggest that for every era a person completes they earn a new giant, for instance, after you finish the first era you earn THE FROST GIANT. A giant that can creat frozen tundras, polar bears, peinguins,walrus's, pine trees, and more! Once you finish the second era, you gain the MAGMA GIANT. A giant that is similar to the rock giant, and can only place a biome by going onto a mountain that the rock giant built and transforming it into a volcano. It will create vulture nests, new ores, and more! So thank you for reading and if you don't like our idas you can change something about them. =)			"

												I really like this one, always recommend!  Of course, you have to be knowlegde that this kind of game is the one you setting things to make everything works properly, and there is a tons of ways to make it happens, as much as a tons of things to unlock. If I would describe it in one word would be ""possibilities"".It's a very calming game, but full of challanges and have it dinamics. The truly times of action are when your humans hate you, make wars or thier project falls apart (but I normally describe them more as ""despair"" that action... or maybe sadness... angry too, sometimes...)So, be aware if you don't like this kind of game.To me, the nice points of this game are: Oh! What a beautiful art! Full of details, but at the same time not too much complex, you can look at it and appreciate every single part of it! Everytime you look at those tiny humans and thier village, you find something new and nice and cute. The giants gods too.  The sounds effects!The music is nice, I would say the perfect one to those kind of game: Still listen to something, but forget that is a music, and miss it when is none. The sounds effect, in the other hand, makes everything puts together, and particularly I can't play the game without it. About the gameplay, it's pretty impressive! If you thing about it after play the game, it's kind of complex setting here. Briefly you have gods, abilites, aspects, nature, symbiose, humans, resourcers, projects, ambassadors, etc... and you can evolve mostly everything! Yourselfs, the humans's project, the resources, the game setting...but the designers make everything very friendly! Is easy to learn, remember and consult, there is even a wikipedia! You don't feel that it's complex at all! Feels very... natural? You have this 4 giant nature gods who make the World beautiful and full of life. This make everything more easy to connect with the real world aspecs of nature since the gods use the most basics of it, so it's not hard to remember what they do.  The fact that they (the gods, ok?) share some of this nature aspects make the possibilites in game more vast, and I'm not only talk about the water, forest, swamp and mountain aspect/land/etc, it's about thier ability to change animals, plants and minerals. Pretty much those 3 are the basic resources you can use in game, so if it gives the player a lot of possibilites to interact, more fun will be. It's challenging and at the same time gives a purpose. As the 4 gods entitys, you give stuff to humans, they finish their project and give ""back"" possibilites do upgrade (the Ambassadors) yourselfs, which is very intelligent because make a Symbiosis Relationship with the player and the humans. You can't really advance without those tiny people, you can try (haha, no you can't), but you are losing most of the fun! And manly, the Ambassadors upgrade some abilitys, but not all of them, you have to see which one are most usefull to your propose. The projects of humans are really audacious, especially when they evolve over time. They interact with the ambient and can changes you plans to the village depending on their demand. The more advance is the project, more you must think to make everything connect with harmony.  It's challenging, nor other word! You can play at the normal setting the game gives you, or... not! The normal settings, Era, give you games of 30 mins, 60 mins and 120 mins as you evolve. The other one you play as freely as you want (but can't acquire new things D:). You have advance set too, which you change even the World size. They managed to translate the game into several languages, maybe your is available!There are more things to talk about, such as the nature, symbiose, adoration, war, angry humans,etc., but I think you should just play the game to find out. It's look very simple at first, but, believe me, (it's not simple)  you will have more fun than you expect!			"

												ReusSince the glorious days of Black & White and the departure of its creator to a more RPG-centered Development there hasn't much news in the god game. Only a few entries were made in the last couple years with no real successor to the genres prime example. Reus is one of these entries. It doesn't try to overthrow the king, but it captures the spirit of Black & White very well. With quite a few changes.StoryInstead of playing a powerful god that controls cities and mighty creatures alike, and being constantly annoyed by your conscience, you are instead the very planet itself which wakes from its billion years long slumber to fill the surface with life once again. Since you are just a giant rock sorrounding a burning gas ball you receive the aid of four giants to help you fill the surface with all kind of life and protect it, if necessary. I think we had that part somewhere before, didn't end well for the giants. Anyway, your Giants are equipped with very different kinds of powers for that job.GameplayThe four Giants are called after the four Biomes they can create. Ocean, Forest, Mountain, and Swamp. They can create Land, setting up Recourses, and even enhance them with different skills, but that later. The first important thing to use is the Terrain Generation. You have five Biomes at your Disposal. While all Giants can only create the Lands they are named after and forest and swamp need to be placed next to an ocean, deserts can only be created when raise a mountain and there is no ocean in its sorounding.After designing the landscape you are ready for the next step: Resources and Settlements. The main feature of this game is to let small villages settle somewhere and provide them with food and gold and everything they could need. While Black & White lets you decide where to put new villages and what structures they build, you are here to waitfor the game to decide which building they want. And on that comparison, the Villages in Reus are just one single structures you can't interact that much. But that's not that much of a problem since Reus uses a new, almost puzzle-like aproach on how to interact with villages. You create Resources (Animals, Plants, Minerals) and your villagers will start to use them (and give them Food, Wealth, and Tech). Since that alone would be pretty boring, the Resources have special abilities attached to them, which grant additional bonuses if you meet certain requirements. So can a Plant almost double its food output if you place it next to a mineral. And on top of that, the different Resource types behave completely different. While Animal can make your Village more aggresive, while Plants have an effect to counter that. Minerals dont have such a system on that scale like the other two, uses some unique features. Animals and Plants have a range on where they give out their bonuses and form different kinds of Animals and Plants, depending on in which Biome you put them. Minerals on the other hand don't use such fancy techniques. You will create the same Minerals whereever you go (with a few exceptions here and there). And instead of a range system they just throw out all bonus on the place they are standing on. To differentiate them even more you need to overcome a special obstacle (called symbiosis), to to make abilities usable. For this your villages need to already use a certain amount of food, wealt, or tech. Stupid rocks.Speaking of Villages, these things have, too, some special features worth mentioning. First, Sttlements have Borders. Everything inside these borders will be counted, everything outside ignored. Don't worry, the Borders will expand once the Settlement reached a certain size. The second thing are structures. These are special building outside of the village, which grant certain additional bonuses, depending on what they are. You can have which grants a tech bonus for each Plant within the borders, or fishing docks gives out a food bonus for each fish around it. And completing it will give you the key to victory, an ambassador.Those little people will then sit on your Giants and unlock new powers. These powers, called Aspects, can increase the output of the recourse a little, or activate the last grand feature in the game, Transmutation. You know, that cool thing where you can transorm something in something completely different. It's fun, just don't try to resurrect your dead mother with it, okay? It works like placing a new resource, the first transmutes are not necessarily more powerful, but more you go down on the transmutation road, the better your outcome will be. Of course, if you don't activate the abilities you won't get much farther with it. So plan ahead and draw yourself a map of all the transmutations (I do and will eventually post it here). It will even help to understand certain structures of the transmutations, like the conjunction between ocean animals, you can jump from both animal a1 and b1 to a2 or b2, while the desert animals a1 and b1 only share c2, a2 and b2 are only reachable from the same letter. So keep that in mind. An interesting addition to this is that in the beginning only very few transmutations are available to you. To unlock additional ones you need to unlock steam achievements, which will be tracked ingame. These things are finally useful for something.ConclusionPretty solid, beautiful drawn, 2-D god game, which can lead to some tedious puzzle work if you want to come far. There are some critic points, like when settlements go and try to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your Giants. Reus is one of the best examples of the creativity of indie games. If you like slower paced simulations, where you can watch and devolop the towns under your watchful eye, without any pressure, timed or otherwise, you can't do anything wrong with this game. Buy it, enjoy it, and see for yourself.If you want to get a better look at a playthrough of this game just click the link below:http://youtu.be/jdKaXzZ8gJM?list=UUMxIS2guRxfCuJ1gllMecuAFor more Reviews visit my Blog at:http://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/ "

												Reus... It's a well packaged game, wish I had a button for ""just okay"".Does it have depth? Sorta...Replayability? Somewhat...Strategy involved? Kinda...This game is simple but the depth/matrix of mixing and using the creature's powers gets hard to memorize or get into a flow (considering each game is timed) which limits the ""strategic"" feel. Replayability kind of reminds me of a mobile game, you keep chipping away at each level for that little bit of progress... its there but starts to get awfully repeatative. This is a quick pleasure game, I would not recommend paying full price for it, this is one of those games you throw in your cart when its 50-75% off.			"

												Reus is a simple game. What it lacks in depth it makes up for with gameplay that keeps you involved with what’s happening in the various areas of your world. Balance out the demands in all of your established biomes and the people will be happy. Fail to do so and you’ll see wholesale revolt by your populations.It is quick and easy to get into this game: learn the four biomes and what role the associated giant performs and you’re good to go. The game helps you out by giving you progressively more difficult challenges to meet before advancing to the next level.Is it re-playable? Most definitely, and I would make it part of the gameplay. By this I mean that you have a countdown timer in the “Era” mode which is like a ‘campaign’ mode (I use the term loosely) where you have to successfully complete all the challenges before unlocking the next level (longer countdown, different challenges). Endless re-playability, but some might say endless repetitiveness.Unfortunately that’s all there is to Reus and while there is no defined end game (besides dying), you can certainly achieve everything there is to achieve in the “Freeplay” mode (no countdown timer). While I do recommend playing this game (positive Steam rating), I cannot call it a good game; it is mediocre at best because of how limited the gameplay is.			"

												TL;DR: This is a nice god-themed puzzle game, with nice graphics, innovative design and fun gameplay. But it has its shortcomings.In a nutshell, in this game you play as four Titans, each one with unique powers, and by laying out biomes and sources (animals, plants and minerals) and upgrading them with your Titans' abilities, you can make suitable environments for humans to settle down into villages. Your villages will then request random Projects from time to time, and by fulfilling them, you get either Ambassadors that upgrade your Titans' abilities and structures that provide your villages with resources. As you complete goals (achievements), which usually requires your villages getting a certain amount of resources, you unlock further sources, which can be used to complete more difficult goals.To fulfill your villages' Projects, you will need to combine sources and structures that sinergize well. For instance, the Apple Tree will provide extra food and tech if you place it near an animal. The Granary will provide extra food if next to plants.By using the resulting Ambassadors you get, you can unlock better Aspects, which in turn you can use to upgrade your sources or turn them into completely different ones, which you'll then use to fulfill more demanding Projects. And you must do it all while managing your time (you're on a timer), the different interactions between your sources, and also your villages' Greed, a game mechanic that prevents you from building things too fast, or your villages start wars against one another (or against your own Titans).All in all, these mechanics make up a very nice game. However, you may expect that: 1. It will require a lot of brainpower to get all the important achievements. Considering how they are necessary to unlock all the sources, it can get frustrating at times if you plan (as I did and failed) to get everything this game has to offer. 2. You're on an undelayble timer; you can't upgrade every Titan ability to its fullest potential (you only get a certain number of ambassadors per world, which are not enough to upgrade everything); the projects you villages start are very random and sometimes too demanding; the different Aspect tiers required to unlock different sources are very difficult to get; the sources interactions are very complex, and usually replacing one requires replacing several others as to maximize their sinergy effects. 3. Sometimes, you'll feel lost. You'll need several different villages, usually at least one of every biome, and you need to tender to their needs often. Sometimes you'll need several complex sinergies between your sources, and that will require very careful planning of sources layouts. Sometimes, a very useful source will be out of your reach because you've chosen to upgrade the Aspect of one Titan over another; sometimes, you won't be able to give a Titan the Aspect you want, because doing so would jeopardize your plans. Sometimes, your villages will start dumb projects that go against your plans. And very often, replacing a source or getting a new Project requires replacing several other sources, so as to maximize their sinergy.4. In order to get the most difficult achievements, you'll fall short of having to plan the entire world layout and Titan upgrade path beforehand. If you wander just a little from your plans, you may not achieve the goal you want.5. It may get repetitive after a while, and the worlds you create are not persistent.6. You will check the game online wiki frequently. Do you remember the innovative Civilopedia, the one in-game encyclopedia that every complex game should have? It doesn't exist here. And several critical pieces of information (like upgrade paths) are not available in-game. Despite these shortcomings, if you like complex puzzle games, you'll really enjoy this game. Just beware that this is not truly a god game, despite what the Steam tags would make you believe.			"

												This is a time and resource management game. Develop land into one of 4 types, 3 of which are human liveable. Use your four giants to add fruits, animals, or minerals to guide each village to what they ask for. Complete their quests and they will give you priest like people to upgrade your giants. Problem is that each giants can only hold so many priests so you need to plan ahead. This game is fun, but comes down to a ""Optimal"" path you must choose which limits the way you may want to play.			"

												I feel as though I may be the only one who enjoys this one, but I thought it was a cool experience. A unique take on ""god games"", you should find yourself having some fun with it. As far as replayability, however, it soley relies on the plethora of achievements there are to get, as once you've beaten a game in a particlar era, you are pretty comfortable with it all and may not find anything new to keep you going. Only in trying to develop a strategy to attain the achievements will you really want to keep playing.			"

												I bought this game because it was on sale and looked interesting, three years ago. I finally decided to play it and I gotta say I was hooked almost immediately. One of only three games I've played to 100% completion, I've played over 60 hours of it this week. This is the equivalent of a book so good you don't want to put it down until you are done. This world builder/resource planter is addictive as hell.If you liked city/theme park builders back in the day you will really get a kick out of this game. It has much more in common gameplay wise with games like the Ceaser franchise, or pharaoh or Roller coaster tycoon. You have set goals you need to achieve with your resources within the time limit and every play through is a little bit different. Progression is tied to achievements, with the later resources being unlocked as you do better at the game. I liked this aspect, as you are always playing on the same ""map"" and so the new resources and unique challenges add variety to every playthrough.The game runs pretty darn smoothly though there are some bugs from time to time, specifically around completed projects text boxes being wonky sometimes, though very little that affects gameplay. I would highly recommend this game, especially for it's asking price of 10$ cnd, its a steal. Thanks for the great game devs!			"

												I really wanted to like this game. But i just couldn't. It's a fairly original take on a town building game where the focus is more on  providing resources and environments for the villages with 4 elemental giants that you use to shape the world. The visual style is pretty cool and the symbiosis mechanic is pretty interesting too and makes you need to plan your layout of resources carefully.But despite all this i found after a few hours i was bored and the novelty of the game had quickly worn off. Because unlocking different types of resources is achievement driven you will have to do several playthroughs to unlock them initially a half hour then expanding to an hour and so on. As some achievements are difficult to obtain together this may require several 60 min playthroughs for example. This is the main reason i lost interest.Overall it's a promising game that just fails to deliver 5/10			"

												So apparently this is an annoying math game, not a god game. I don't use abilities to build and destroy civilizations, but to make sure they have enough food, wealth and whatever to reach their next project's goal - not to survive, just to pump their ego until they are Greedy and make armies which I have to put down. And you can only get that by upgrading certain Giant's abilities, then making sure the upgraded ability adds enough food etc because the plant or whatever is next to something that gives it a boost like a mineral or whatever. All adding up numbers to make sure you keep these tiny creatures happy with you. You feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing servant, not a god. It's a maze of abilities, tiles, and interlocking synergies to memorize, not a god game.			"

												Reus is nothing short of amazing. What an awesome game. And a Dutch product, which I am very proud of, of course. Think of Reus as a 2D Black & White, minus your pet animal. You control the landscape, you place the elements and let mankind take over from there. They'll build villages and projects. Don't like a certain village, or are they starting too many wars ? Destroy them. Give other villages the opportunity to grow. There are so many possibilities, the choice is yours.The game is shown in 2D and is extremely detailed in how it looks. You can zoom in and out and that way see the planet or the people living their lives. I'm amazed by how this was accomplished.Playing a game takes 30 minutes, or, if you unlock enough achievements, 60 minutes. I think games can last even longer than that if you unlock even more achievements, but I can not confirm this yet. Earning achievements allows your villagers to create much more advanced buildings later on so starting off with the bare minimum is a good way to ease players into the game. Throwing too much stuff at them in the beginning might just confuse them. But, to be honest, even I got confused a couple of times, even in the very beginning of the game. There's a lot of micromanaging involved in this game, and things can get kind of hectic if you don't know what each button does. That's why the tutorial is a good place to start. If you're not into tutorials you can always try and play a game. The game will never punish you for not knowing things, but if you want to truly enjoy it just stick with the tutorial.Reus has no real goals besides the achievements, which are completely optional. It can be quite relaxing after a hard day's work if you do nothing but build, avoiding the achievements. Also, playing a game of Reus will never frustrate. It will always be fun and random.If that sounds good to you go on and buy it.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												I was really excited about this game, but it was a disappointing experience for me. Game mechanics are simply boring. It is just about: ""k units of parameter x is needed, place some y's. Parameter z is rising, you have to put some w's next to that q's"". You do something, wait for the consequences, try to balance the numbers. God, those numbers... a very old fashioned way of game logic. Plus, you don't enjoy doing those things because basically you don't see them very much. All the plants, animals etc are simple undetailed miniature figures that wander in the background, they don't seem to interact with the environment. Graphics are very frustrating in that sense, making Reus no different than a board game, except you play it on your own.  After all the tutorials, i didn't have any will to play this game.			"

												I think Reus is a very elegant god-game simplified down to a very fun level. Some people like the ability to actually influence specific citizens or creatures, I prefer the Reus approach where the little factors all are automatic and you just make big decisions. Some people also prefer an open-ended game, while I prefer the goal oriented design of Reus. You can play for as long as you want even after the era ends so I'm not sure why some people complain about it.I am rather confused on why many reviews call it a puzzle game. Yes, you have certain objectives meaning you need to structure your cities in a certain way, but it doesn't pigeon-hole you into a puzzle by any stretch. For instance lets say you need 100 food to make a farm - you could plant some bushes, or you could make your grassland an ocean and make fish, or you could put chickens by your bushes, etc. Or you can choose to destroy the farm and make something else. The tech tree is quite substantial and there are countless ways to build each city. This is no more a puzzle than making a research centric city in Civilization. You build the things that boost that one aspect and reduce the others. Perhaps you need to make more trade-offs in Reus and people don't like that?The only criticism I have is that after you unlock everything the game is kind of boring. 8/10			"

												Reus is an indie god game that often plays more like a puzzle game. Instead of single god, you actually control four different giants who shape the land and place down various resources. Soon enough villages start popping up and begin demanding various things. As is usual in a god game, you only control the four giants and have no direct control over the villagers.On the surface Reus might look like a fairly casual game. There's a decent amount of complexity under the surface, however. The villagers will demand various resources for their projects and these demands will get harder and harder to fulfill. You also need to be careful when improving your villages. With rapid growth the villagers get greedy and can start attacking the neighboring villages. The core gameplay consists of placing the right natural resources on the right tiles on the map. This is also the part that makes Reus feel more like a puzzle game than a typical god game. Optimal placement is rather crucial as the resources boost each other in numerous ways based on a complex symbiosis/transmutation system. Personally I found this part of the game quite fiddly and rather unintuitive. The game could definitely have used a better in-game help system for all these bonuses.Each game has a fixed time limit (only 30 minute game is available early on, later you unlock 60 and 120 minute games). To unlock longer games and other features you need to complete as many developments as possible. The developments are goals that require you to grow your villages in specific ways. As the game length is limited, you can typically only complete a few new ones in each game.I wasn't a big fan of the slow pace of the game either. You need to play a lot of games to complete the various developments, always starting with the same empty world with only the basic giant skills available. For me this got repetitive fairly quickly. After a while I decided I don't have the time or patience to continue playing and just gave up. Perhaps a more traditional campaign would have helped to keep things more interesting.While Reus does some things quite well, I wasn't a big fan of the fiddly resource micromanagement or the slow pace. I'd recommend this game only if you don't mind these issues or if are a big fan of the genre. Everyone else is better off waiting for a sale or a bundle.The good:- Nice and clear art- Good difficulty progression with more and more things unlocking as you keep playingThe bad:- Game is rather slow-paced and there's no way to fast-forward time- Gets repetitive and you need to finish a lot of games to complete the various developments- Resource placement and the symbiosis/transmutation system is rather fiddly and not very intuitiveThe ugly:- A few minor UI issues like wrong font size and an empty dialog window			"

												5-hour opinion: This is the best god game I've played since Black & White, but the genre is so small that that's not saying much.  Still, I'm getting good vibes here.  It's fun playing god, and the mechanics also put me in the mindset of those Alchemy games for phones, where you combine things to make new stuff.The pacing feels a little weird.  The tutorials are alright, but once you're done with them and start the full game it suddenly feels really slow...until you realize ""oh man, I'm fifteen minutes into a thirty minute game and I should have been working faster, time actually matters now!"".  Optimal play means not a lot of waiting around.  You can pause to issue orders but it still feels pretty tense if you're really trying to do well.Unlockable stuff, both within and between games, is a major theme.  90% of what you do is upgrading patches of land into better patches of land.  Help towns complete projects, get new powers so you can upgrade land further.  Unlock achievements to raise the cap on how much you can upgrade stuff in future games.  It seems kind of limiting at first, but you also need to unlock 60- and 120-minute games, so you don't really bump up against the cap too badly in early games.All in all, I don't think this will become a classic, but I had fun with it.   The time pressure is too much for me to think of it as a casual game, even if it's hard to lose, exactly.			"

But I feel like I was somehow deceived by it: it's not a God-game, I was never playing the role of a truly omnipotent creature in it (except for choosing the placement and the type of the terrain and the resources there was nothing much else that I could control), and it's not even by far a civilization-like strategy/simulation management thingy. It felt more like a time & space management game, a puzzle game more similar in gameplay to those pathetic Facebook-based restaurant/cookie time management games. I, personally, get bored of this kind of games quite quickly, as they feel too repetitive and tedious to me. But I'm also conviced that many people will have a lot more fun than I did playing this game.For games like this I wish there was a button between ""Yes"" or ""No"" when asked if I recommend this game - something like ""Under certain conditions"", or ""Depending on what kind of gamer you are"" or simply ""Undecided/Unsure"", or something... you get the point.

												Black and White meets SpaceChem. In this game you control 4 giants, each representing an aspect of nature, who manipulate the earth in ways that attract, grow, and motivate human settlements. While the basics are relatively (for this type of game) easy to learn, the complexity ratchets up quickly through 2 main mechanics. First, your giants evolve their abilities during each game through the collection of ambassadors who appear when a village reaches a project milestone. This grants them the ability to upgrade plants, animals, and minerals in new ways. Second, as you accomplish objectives, you unlock new types of flora, fauna, and minerals for future games, as well as open up longer gametype modes. In this way an initial 30 minute game (era) where you place a few simple plants, animals, and minerals around a few primative villages eventually gives way to 2 hour-long games with dozens of possible ecological effects with hundreds of combinations, all bent on stimulating  settlements to grow and build epic projects. It's these ecological combinations that will either make or break the game for you. If you enjoy the challenge of mixing and upgrading  varieties of plants, animals, and minerals to find the perfect symbiotic mix while under time, space, and villager greed limitations - you'll love this game. If not, you'll probably get frustrated quickly.			"

What’s this game all about?Since there is no established genre which Reus would fit in and it’s not easy to intuitively understand what the deal with the game is, I’ll explain the core gameplay loop in detail.At first you’re presented with your barren 2D planet and you’re given control of Reus’ four trademark giants. With them you create your planet’s biomes and resource nodes, which in turn leads to establishment of human settlements. Each settlement’s most important attribute is its resource count, split into three categories: food, wealth, technology. Resource count will gradually rise from nothing at founding to some maximum amount dynamically determined by composition of resource nodes within settlements’ borders. Resources don’t have any traditional functions (i.e. food isn’t used to feed the population), they are simply gathered for two purposes: they count towards overall score and are used to complete so-called ‘projects’.Projects are the core gameplay concept in Reus. They are buildings, such as a granary or an observatory, which spontaneously appear as construction sites within settlements’ borders and they are completed once settlement gathers certain amount of resources. Each project provides a unique passive bonus to its settlement, so players are usually forced to adjust their resource composition once a new project pops up. Completing projects is rewarded with ‘ambassadors’ each of whom is assigned to a giant thus upgrading it. Upgrades allow giants to create more advanced resource nodes which in turn makes it possible to complete increasingly demanding projects.Who’s going to like it?I’d recommend Reus to anyone who is going to enjoy getting familiar with characteristics of a large number of resource types, combining them in a manner that will extract the most value from each land patch, tinkering with secondary resources to power up their settlements’ growth, analyze what upgrade path will best suit their current situation, etc.As far as presentation goes Reus is pretty strong. Graphics are simple but stylish. Music is calm and pleasant even if it becomes slightly repetitive after a while. Interface is tidy and responsive, although some of the tooltips are not informative enough (luckily there’s a wiki website which describes everything in detail).Any red flags?This is not a god game, so if anyone is looking for that particular fix - look elsewhere. Humans of Reus have extremely limited autonomy and the game requires lots of micromanagement.There is no form of time compression so sporadically players will have to sit through a period of nothing to do. Generally pace of the game is rather slow with plenty of waiting for cooldowns or for giants to move between settlements. Players with little patience might want to think twice before plunging in.And completionists beware – top tier projects require some serious analysis and calculations and on top of that there are tons of unlocks available. Generally, you won’t be able to just breeze through the content.			"

												This game's budget price justifies its existence.  It is a god game, where the player controls 4 teraforming giants who plant resources on a planet.  Villages form to take advantage of those resources and give missions (called projects in game) to the player, usually revolving around having a certain amount of resources and tile types.  Complete a misison and get an ambassador which empowers a giant letting them built more advance resource types.  To really succeed, a player needs to take advantage of resource ""synergies.""  For example, you develop a deer node, which gives substantially more food if near certain types of plants.There are catches.  Villages that grow to quickly may declare war on other villages and wipe them out, depriving the player of a possible mission/ambassador.  If villages get really greedy the may declare war on your giants and attack them!  At some point, it is better to just destroy the village.The game is at first a lot of fun with a ton of unlockable achievements that let the player unlock new game modes and new resources.  However, the unlocked 2 hour mode is necessary to get some of the more difficult achievements, and is simply to long.  Furthermore, the harder achievements require players to make carefully planned decisions regarding which ambassadors to pair with giants.  So, the game becomes outright tedious.  Spending 2 hours or more (with pausing) only to discover you missed unlocking that one achievement is very disapointing.Still, a player should give more hours of enjoyment out of this game than the standard FPS single player campaign.  Combine that with a budget price and you have a cheap way to entertain yourself for a week.			"

												Black and White meets SpaceChem. In this game you control 4 giants, each representing an aspect of nature, who manipulate the earth in ways that attract, grow, and motivate human settlements. While the basics are relatively (for this type of game) easy to learn, the complexity ratchets up quickly through 2 main mechanics. First, your giants evolve their abilities during each game through the collection of ambassadors who appear when a village reaches a project milestone. This grants them the ability to upgrade plants, animals, and minerals in new ways. Second, as you accomplish objectives, you unlock new types of flora, fauna, and minerals for future games, as well as open up longer gametype modes. In this way an initial 30 minute game (era) where you place a few simple plants, animals, and minerals around a few primative villages eventually gives way to 2 hour-long games with dozens of possible ecological effects with hundreds of combinations, all bent on stimulating  settlements to grow and build epic projects. It's these ecological combinations that will either make or break the game for you. If you enjoy the challenge of mixing and upgrading  varieties of plants, animals, and minerals to find the perfect symbiotic mix while under time, space, and villager greed limitations - you'll love this game. If not, you'll probably get frustrated quickly.			"

												There are 2 paths with this game:1. You play it for the beauty of the game, the novelty of such a quirky little GodSim and the unlocks - this path leads to boredom and Reus gathering e-dust on your library shelf2. You play it with the understanding that this is a game of Strategy which requires a measure of forethought, balance, sacrifice and a general plan of what and how you are going to achieve your aims in this play-through. - This path leads to a deep respect for the design of the game and a approach to a playthrough that sees it as a challenge to be mastered.I think Reus is brilliant and I have only scratched the surface of what I need to do to become better at it.It is a Strategy game, a puzzle to be unlocked and understood and an OCD's dream!

												A surprisingly good little gem of a game. Bought it for $2.50 on a whim during a Steam sale, but it's entirely worth the full price of $10 if not more so. It's basically a god sim where you control four giants that each have their own unique abilities to shape the land and create different types of animals and natural resources. With these giants your goal is to steer the development of the world and lead it to peace and prosperity. Along the way the greedy, dirty, little humans will try to stir up trouble and you'll have to figure out how to deal with those problems. You can either try and manage them, or just give in to your darker side and destroy the villages with earthquakes and other fun tools.The meat of the game is in the complex relationships between different resources and making sure each village has what it needs to continue to grow. It can be quite difficult sometimes with only four slow moving giants to oversee a whole planet, and it requires some planning and thinking. So be warned, this is not just another clickfest where the game plays itself out for you and gives you a WINNER badge at the end. Great game.			"

												This is a great god game. Picked it up on the holiday sale and couldn't put it down for days. The game has a neat mechanic where you unlock things as you play, eventually allowing you to get to higher and higher levels until you can create a eutopia the way you see fit. It's also cool because you can 'transmute' resources into different ones, allowing for tons of combinations. You'll think, you'll laugh, you'll love, and you'll punish those greedy little villagers time and time again.Pros: unique mechanics, easy to learn, relaxing game play, will cure that strategy/world building itch you have, good atmosphere, you play as a planet, and it's a cheap game.Cons: relatively short (can do most everything within 30 hrs), not a lot of replay value, can get repetitive.Overall, this is an excellent game at an excellent price.

I expected to get bored very quickly and for there to be little content because of the low price, but honestly I would spend at least £10 on this. It's very well put together, no grinding needed. My only qualm is that I wish freeplay had unlockables (where it only unlocks it for freeplay, not eras), however that's just my personal preference as a casual gamer.Overall 4.5/5, strongly recommend for God-game, time-mangement and strategy lovers, both hardcore and casual.

												A god game whose whole purposes is about frantically rearranging resource buffs in an optimization puzzle to satisfy the peoples' demands.Met demands give you gods more abilities to improve your resources further, and this usually involves changing everything, because each resource synergizes differently, and makes you make significance changes to adjacent resources, then the ones adjacent to those, etc.There's meta-progression as well - each world only lasts a fairly limited amount of time so you will need to start fresh on new worlds. Earn achievements, unlock more stuff that can make you more productive the next play through to help you earn more achievements.Again, this is a resource placement optimization game. If that interests you, this game should interest you. Otherwise, not so much. $10 I feel is a reasonable asking price for the game, if still a tad high for my tastes. Sale purchase recommended.			"

Finding the fun here means embracing a needlessly complex and unintuitive system of synergies and transmutations, and a high tolerance for repetition over the long haul, but those elements are at least backed up with plenty of personality and no shortage of challenge.

												Abbey Games is an independent games studio, formed by four computer science students back in 2011. This is also the same year where the concept of REUS came to life. However, their first creation was not REUS but it was the prize-winning Tinytanic. Early 2013 REUS finally landed in our hands and it was the first debut game from Abbey Games that truly left the world in awe. A fun fact that not many know about is that REUS is Dutch for giant and is actually pronounced quite differently than how you would say it out loud.SettingsImagine yourself as a god, in control of four powerful creatures that can shape the planet to your will. No wait, you don’t have to imagine it anymore. You are a god or a goddess in REUS and you have four mighty giants at your disposal. Each giant has the ability to create nature in its finest: forests, swamps, deserts and oceans. You determine how to shape the perfect world for monads to life in, providing them with the necessary resources such as plants, animal life and minerals in order for them to survive. However, humans are unpredictable and while you do your best to give into their desires, greed may become a possible threat to your once idyllic planet. As the master of these four giants, it is up to you how you react on these threats by adding animal life with danger or minerals that provide awe and much more. You are the creator but you can also be the destructor.Game playMuch like any game, the tutorial is essential if you’ve never played a god game in your life. You start by controlling one giant, then another one and so on. You will also be introduced to giving into the will of mankind that roams your planet and the threats that will arise if greed takes the upper hand.The rest of the game play is pretty much the same. You start with a planet which you need to shape by creating oceans, forests, swamps and deserts accompanied with mountains. Then you need to decide if you’d rather place plants or animal life, or even minerals for the nomads to settle down. As a god, you need to help them by providing the resources they need in order for them to build the desired projects such as a school, a granary and even a shrine or a temple. You will unlock even more projects, fauna and flora by helping the humans develop differently. Thanks to the complex system of upgrades and synergies, the game provides you with an endless amount of play time and play styles. There are 123 achievements to be unlocked and I would advise you not to focus on these as much since the randomization of the humans needs can slow you down. I tried to hunt these achievements down for three Era’s and then just started playing more strategically, suddenly unlocking five achievements unintended. However, don’t push these achievements to the side completely as you can only level up by completing an X-amount of achievements. By leveling up you will have access to even more projects, plants, animals and resources leaving you completely addicted to the game.Final conclusionYou can say a lot of things about REUS, yet at the same time there isn’t much to say about the game since it completely blows you away. It’s logical and simple but it’s still capable of amazing you in every aspect. A must have for every casual gamer and even every hardcore gamer who wants to slow down every once in a while.Scoring: 9/10This review can also be found on NearlyEnoughDice.com "

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/reus-first-impressions/Reus is a god game. You’re given a planet with four giants to help construct said planet and bring life to it. You hold ultimate control over the fate of this barren landscape.Sure, the game may not look like much out of the box, but its rather complex and has quite the learning curve to it. The game’s tutorial, although long, should suffice, as it did for me. A session in Reus starts you off with four giants and an empty planet. These giants each have their own unique traits and can each create a biome of some sort. There’s an ocean giant, a rock giant, a forest giant, and a swamp giant. Each creates its own specific biome, as you should be able to tell from their name, the rock giant, however, creates deserts and hills.Life will eventually bloom on the planet in the form of humans. They’ll settle villages, which, being the god of this world, you’re tasked with tending to. You can even destroy these settlements if you wish, which may have to be done if said village poses a problem to all other villages.The gameplay in Reus gets more complex as you get further into the game and you’re slowly allowed more playtime based on achievements. Once certain achievements are unlocked, you’ll be able to spend more time in a single world than before.Reus is a a lot of fun, if you can last through the learning curve. The graphics are very simplistic, yet they fit the game well. The gameplay appears simple and fun, but is actually quite complex. Recommended!			"

												Let me start things off by saying that this game takes a fair bit of patience to play, and there is nothing fast-paced about it unless you decide to neglect the pause button for whatever reason. Reus is a thinking game, and it rewards experimentation.Simple in concept, unique in visuals and smooth in execution, Reus lets you shape a 2-dimensional planet by terraforming the land with your Rock, Swamp, Forest and Ocean giants to create deserts, swamps, forests and oceans which you can then populate with wildlife and foliage. Once any such biome has been created, and any resource has been placed within it, humans will appear and the true game will begin.The game is primarily about providing for humanity while monitoring how quickly they claim the resources you give them, lest they become greedy and have to be put down. While I doubt this is a new concept to the god-sim genre, I found Reus to be approachable enough for me to get sucked in despite historically not being a fan of said genre. The controls are fluid and clear, there is a great variety of things to toy and experiment with and the game actively rewards your experimentation with new and more powerful bonuses which, when combined with the unlimited number of retries, the free play mode and the simple goal of ""develop humanity beyond X points"" makes for an interesting experience that keeps you coming back to try more.On the downside, the game's replayability runs a bit short when you complete all the objectives, and there seems to be a glitch that lets you unlock achievements on the ""easy"" mode (which is normally supposed to disable achievements). In addition, the randomness of human development can often be a pain and you may find yourself frustrated by that one village who refuses to try a different project than the one you keep denying, no matter how many times you destroy it.A more subjective downside is the simple slow pace - your giants move slowly, resources are gathered slowly, abilities have significant cooldowns - which is all the more pressing an issue when you have 7 different human villages you're trying to manage at once. This could be also be considered part of the game's difficulty however, and some enjoy a slower-paced experience.Over all, I thoroughly enjoyed Reus and would absolutely recommend it, especially for it's low price ($10CAD at time of this writing). Even if you aren't normally a fan of god sims, I would recommend picking this up on sale and giving it a try - it might surprise you.			"

Interesting Take On An Old IdeaThis was an interesting title to get into. I've clocked well over a hundred hours on the DRM free version, so I am speaking from more experience than I appear to be with this one.A long long time ago I used to really love Populous for the Sega Genesis console. It was a really interesting isometric strategy game where randomly generated maps created a landscape over which I ruled as a god. I could foster my followers, or show no mercy and destroy with natural disasters.Reus takes this a big step further.Control elemental giants that can create and destroy, settle the world and watch villages grow and prosper, or destroy. There is a lot going on and this game can get really deep really fast. The tutorials made it easy to figure out the basics.The game controls really well, and a simple stage can last for hours. Performing tasks such as evolving plant, mineral, or animal types unlocks different other plants, minerals, animals, and so on. This opens up all kinds of possibilities.Managing villages is fun, and pretty simple at first. Inevitably they make tougher more complex demands. Which can grow tense as timers running for each task count down. I would liken it to spinning plates; try keeping too many going and you might lose track of of one or two of them and not realize you've missed something until it's too late. Other tasks might include fostering a great village only to see them become greedy and destructive toward others. And yet other tasks, or requests, could be sacrificing one village for another to meet shrine requirements.There's not much I can tell you that you can't read elsewhere and better. I can tell you I enjoy this game immensely, and will probably clock another hundred hours on my steam copy as well. This game is a lot of fun, and a great way to chill for a few hours.Pros: Crisp graphics Great sound and Music Easy to pick up, challenging to master Diverse possibilities add tremendous replay value Plethora of unlockables “Chill” experience Just plain fun!Cons: Can be repetitive Some concepts a bit confusing Lack of custom controls menu Acquired taste (or not really for everyone)Honestly, I had fun, but if someone had described this to me before I'd played it wouldn't have understood the game. It get's my recommendation though. I highly recommend looking at videos before buying! This game won't win everyone over, but as a former Populous fan, I'm hooked!			"

But don't give them too much, or they'll just become greedy, selfish little runts, crazy enough to even attack the giants themselves.			"

First part 30 minutes, second 60, third 120, and so on so have some fun and see what u can create.			"

												Highly polished 2D art with 3D elements.  Reminds me of Tropico with Spore style graphical elements.  It's very pretty and easy on the eyes while also having a complicated strategy campaign.  There is a learning curve to this game and learning what everything does is part of the fun.  Very relaxed game where it's up to you to help human civilizations prosper as much as possible within a time limit.  It can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be.  I don't like how I have to wait for the elemental gods to walk all the way across the map just to do an action.  If they are gods shouldn't it be instantly?  I don't like how humans can attack the gods either.  Gods can't be hurt by mere mortals so calling them gods in the first place is kind of stupid.  They are like giants with super powers.  Fun game.  Worth the money.  Small kids and young teenagers would probably really love this game!  For adults it's a nice break from more serious and realistic FPS or RTS games.  Can definitely recommend it.

												I gave my villagers gold, fish, chicken, fruit and a nice little school, so to thank me, they started throwing spears at me until I decided to throw gunk at their village.In all seriousness though, this game is utterly amazing, for a tiny price as well, the amount of thought needed to meet all of the developments and reach the symbioses is quite high in the later stages, and I love that. The game in general is an almost perfect 2D god game. However, I don't think greed quite works in that way... I mean, it makes sense, but I'm finding it hard to believe that a villager would decide to throw spears at a Giant Rock man, who could destroy you, and everyone around you in a single hit. But oh well, it would suck if it weren't like that, It's not meant to be taken too seriously. Great game 10.5/10			"

The game offers many ways to provide resources and to punish your early civilizations when they get greedy. Unfortunatly, there is no way to ever prevent it and there is only so much you can do. The world is quite tiny! Would love to see a sequal of this game where the world is huge and you have a whole lot more to manage. Maybe more giants or other abilities and more developement. For what it is, it's great & fairly priced & can be rather entertaining.			"

												Not a bad game, It plays just like you think it might from watching the video preview. I was kinda disappointed with the lack of a full campaign in a single player game. After the tutorial you just play a sandbox with limited access to giants and skills and a 30 minute time limit. Do what you can in that time to get achievements and unlock more stuff for the next playthrough. It seems like an artificial way to increase game hours and instead reduced mine as I didn't want to replay the same game 10 times to see what else I could build.If that doesn't bother you then it's worth a look. Going to recommend this because it's a charming little game that will work for others better than myself.			"

												Ok so I've only played 2 hours so far; I can already tell you that this game is fun. And worth the money (at least sale prices!).As you can see the aim is to command giants to build and shape the world to allow villages to grow.There are 3 short tutorials that outline the basics and then you progress from early eras to later ones, each giving you more time to complete the goals. These goals are called unlocks and are basically achievements, which then level you up.The game has the correct pacing; the games last 30+ minutes, each task inside a game gives you 10/15 to complete, though they don't take that long... and yet there's always something more to do and a higher score to reach.The graphics are 'cute', very cartoony but quaint and adhering and gives the game a non too serious approach.I got it on daily deal at £1.50 and after 2 hours I've already had my enjoyment's worth out of it, and yet I've unlocked 7 from about 60 unlocks/in game achievements.Now I'm not a very good gamer, so at some point I won't be able to do more of these challenges. No worries, there's also a freeplay mode, where you can just build up your planet however you want with no worries to over arching objectives for the unlocks... though you cannot progress either. It's more like a skirmish in an RTS game for eg. But this mode by itself is something I'd come back to for a few hours at a time to chill out and watch the world grow.Overall a unique styled game, lots of fun, right level of challenge; increasing as you progress, and for a couple of quid it's a real valuable game to own.

												The full review can be found on Start 2 Continue[start2continue.com].Excerpt:In the beginning, you created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. You said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And upon the desolate planet, you created four great giants, aspects of your divine will. They toiled, carving ocean trenches and raising mountains; planting forests and filling swamps with all sorts of beautiful creatures and strange planets. And finally, the first humans appear in the shadows of the giants as they stood guard to protect your creation. Such is Reus, a new 2D god game created by Abbey Games and released earlier this summer.When I first played this game, I admittedly thought of Black & White right away: shepherding humanity on its way through indirect influences—though instead of animals, you have elemental giants to do your bidding. Mind you, this is something completely different, a sort of puzzle/strategy simulator kind of package....With surprising complexity, great graphics, and addictive gameplay that always keeps you on your toes, Reus is an awesome game and a great second title from Abbey Games. I can’t wait to see what else is in store for both this franchise and these developers.			"

												Reus is a god-game that kills time for 30/60/120 minutes, according to your preference. If you're an achievement farmer, then you would usually go for the 120 minute game, which is not feasible all the time because it's pretty long. This game has never been updated, so playability usually ends once you finish all the achievements, or if you get stuck on the harder achievements for too long, or you don't have too many 120-minute segments of your life to spend on the game.For the price, I wouldn't be asking much improvements to the game. It would only be better if it's playable on a tablet, which has been ""looked into"" for the past 6 months without any reply from the developers.Recommended game for players who want to try a god-game without jumping into an expensive game straightaway.

												At the time of writing I'm at 3 hours of playing, so to clarify my thoughts are on the ""early game"", so to speak.Reus is a fun, charming god game with beautiful art and gentle music. The main game mode gives you reign of a 2D globe for a set period of time (from half an hour at the shortest to two hours at the longest) and leaves you to achieve whatever goals you choose within that time, with the suggested goals that unlock new items being things like making a city that prospers using only animals and minerals, or making a particularly large city. The strategic element of the games comes from achieving each city's goals using the limited number of tiles around them by taking advantage of symbiotic combos, such as a predator that gets a bonus from being around smaller animals, or a plant that grows better next to mineral deposits.While there is a free play mode, I prefer the structure that the goals offer, since they challenge the player to try new things and new playstyles. The limited time sessions are also a good design decision, since they avoid the weakness that some sandbox games have of dragging on for too long and becoming formless. I find that Reus is a good game to dip into for a session at a time, try a few new goals, relax a little but also think a little, and if that sounds like the kind of game you'd like to have in your library I would highly recommend it.

I don't like how I have to wait for the elemental gods to walk all the way across the map just to do an action.  If they are gods shouldn't it be instantly?  I don't like how humans can attack the gods either.  Gods can't be hurt by mere mortals so calling them gods in the first place is kind of stupid.  They are like giants with super powers.  Fun game.  Worth the money.  Small kids and young teenagers would probably really love this game!  For adults it's a nice break from more serious and realistic FPS or RTS games.  Can definitely recommend it.

So many possibilities in ways to play and tons of discoveries to make.  The basics of the game are easy to pick up, but it can also be extremely strategic.  Figuring out how to elevate your little nomad town into a thriving community is rewarding and challenging.			"

												I gave my villagers gold, fish, chicken, fruit and a nice little school, so to thank me, they started throwing spears at me until I decided to throw gunk at their village.In all seriousness though, this game is utterly amazing, for a tiny price as well, the amount of thought needed to meet all of the developments and reach the symbioses is quite high in the later stages, and I love that. The game in general is an almost perfect 2D god game. However, I don't think greed quite works in that way... I mean, it makes sense, but I'm finding it hard to believe that a villager would decide to throw spears at a Giant Rock man, who could destroy you, and everyone around you in a single hit. But oh well, it would suck if it weren't like that, It's not meant to be taken too seriously. Great game 10.5/10			"

You basically create a world for the lil human dudes, and pop up them up some food and science or whatever. Then they do the rest! That is until they rise up to rebel against you or a neighboring town. then you kill them all. KILL THEM ALL WITH YOUR GIANTS. Did I mention you control four different giants, in order to make an awesome world? It's pretty cool guys.			"

												What seems to be at first glance a simple god mode/world building game is actually a very complex resource management game that takes quite a while to master. It has taken me quite a long time to even figure out how some of the mechanics work. It's a lot of fun to try and build different styles of cities and get the achievements, and at first you are given options of playing in 30 or 60 minute chunks so you can play a game and then move on with your day. The giants are very endearing and the levels of zoom make it fun to look in on how things are going.			"

												Reus is a god-game that kills time for 30/60/120 minutes, according to your preference. If you're an achievement farmer, then you would usually go for the 120 minute game, which is not feasible all the time because it's pretty long. This game has never been updated, so playability usually ends once you finish all the achievements, or if you get stuck on the harder achievements for too long, or you don't have too many 120-minute segments of your life to spend on the game.For the price, I wouldn't be asking much improvements to the game. It would only be better if it's playable on a tablet, which has been ""looked into"" for the past 6 months without any reply from the developers.Recommended game for players who want to try a god-game without jumping into an expensive game straightaway.

												Let me start off by saying: this game is not for everyone.  However, that being said, I am thoroughly enjoying this game as of right now.  I picked it up for $2 and I have no regrets.  I do not usually play games like this, so I was a little bit hesitant as to whether or not I would enjoy it, but I can say with absolute certaintity that this game is fun for the right audience.  It plays like an RTS, you have 4 elemental godlike giants that control and shape the planet so that the humans can develop there villages.  You need to manage resources and make sure that the villages do not get too greedy otherwise wars will break out (these wars usually don't take too long anyways).  Each giant has the ability to create it's own biome, as well as their own resources.  It's the little things that matter, but I enjoyed that even though you would use the same giant to create plants or animals, it would spawn different plants or animals depending on what biome you are using (e.g. with the same giant you could place chickens in the forest biome and kangaroo rats in the desert biome).As an incentive to keep playing, there is a levelling up system.  The more you level up the more resources you unlock in terms of plants and animals, which is a good way to keep the player motivated.  One thing that I disagreed with is that you also have to level up to unlock different play times; for example, you start out with 30 minute trials and once you reach level 2 you're allowed to use 60 minute games, etc.  I would have preferred if you could unlock every game time from the beginning.  However, Freeplay mode is unlocked at the beginning, which is a nice addition.  In Freeplay you don't have to worry about helping the humans build a certain amount of projects in the allotted time period, but you also don't level up or unlock anything in Freeplay.TL;DR if you're looking for a fun, godlike RTS game to pass the time with then this is a great game to pick up, especially if it is on sale.  If you're looking for an RTS with a little bit more depth to it, you may want to pass on this one.  8/10			"

												Not a bad game, It plays just like you think it might from watching the video preview. I was kinda disappointed with the lack of a full campaign in a single player game. After the tutorial you just play a sandbox with limited access to giants and skills and a 30 minute time limit. Do what you can in that time to get achievements and unlock more stuff for the next playthrough. It seems like an artificial way to increase game hours and instead reduced mine as I didn't want to replay the same game 10 times to see what else I could build.If that doesn't bother you then it's worth a look. Going to recommend this because it's a charming little game that will work for others better than myself.			"

												Ok so I've only played 2 hours so far; I can already tell you that this game is fun. And worth the money (at least sale prices!).As you can see the aim is to command giants to build and shape the world to allow villages to grow.There are 3 short tutorials that outline the basics and then you progress from early eras to later ones, each giving you more time to complete the goals. These goals are called unlocks and are basically achievements, which then level you up.The game has the correct pacing; the games last 30+ minutes, each task inside a game gives you 10/15 to complete, though they don't take that long... and yet there's always something more to do and a higher score to reach.The graphics are 'cute', very cartoony but quaint and adhering and gives the game a non too serious approach.I got it on daily deal at £1.50 and after 2 hours I've already had my enjoyment's worth out of it, and yet I've unlocked 7 from about 60 unlocks/in game achievements.Now I'm not a very good gamer, so at some point I won't be able to do more of these challenges. No worries, there's also a freeplay mode, where you can just build up your planet however you want with no worries to over arching objectives for the unlocks... though you cannot progress either. It's more like a skirmish in an RTS game for eg. But this mode by itself is something I'd come back to for a few hours at a time to chill out and watch the world grow.Overall a unique styled game, lots of fun, right level of challenge; increasing as you progress, and for a couple of quid it's a real valuable game to own.

												I am really enjoying this game at the moment. It's a laid back God Game where you control 4 elemental giants guiding humanity to grow in different ways. If you've ever played the ""Grow box"" type web games this game should feel very familiar. You can use your giants to turn herbs into tomatoes, flowers into trees, fish into sharks and depending on what you provide to the humans dictates in which direction they will advance.  At its current price you can't go wrong. Switch off your twitch reaction skills from playing Call of battle modern ops warfare field 3, kick back and relax with this lovely little indie game.			"

												If you have ever played 'Populous' then you will already be slightly predisposed to like this game; even if you haven't, you will still find find yourself playing this game for HOURS.  Controlling 4 giants acients with 7 'skills' each; you have got to terraform the world into a habitable place before the ancients return back to their slumber.  You're working against the clock here, and the more you vary your playstyle - the more terraforming options and tweaks are available to you for your next playthrough.  Probably because of this - the replayability is VERY rewarding; couple it with the fact that each game is a SET time (30mins / 60mins / 120mins) - it's a game that you can 'budget' your time for quite well.  It won't stop you from sinking MANY hours into it though.I thoroughly recommend this.  Having just come out of my first BIG slog of playing, I am actually still itching to go back and carry on.  Definitely get this if you have a fiver spare.			"

												At the time of writing I'm at 3 hours of playing, so to clarify my thoughts are on the ""early game"", so to speak.Reus is a fun, charming god game with beautiful art and gentle music. The main game mode gives you reign of a 2D globe for a set period of time (from half an hour at the shortest to two hours at the longest) and leaves you to achieve whatever goals you choose within that time, with the suggested goals that unlock new items being things like making a city that prospers using only animals and minerals, or making a particularly large city. The strategic element of the games comes from achieving each city's goals using the limited number of tiles around them by taking advantage of symbiotic combos, such as a predator that gets a bonus from being around smaller animals, or a plant that grows better next to mineral deposits.While there is a free play mode, I prefer the structure that the goals offer, since they challenge the player to try new things and new playstyles. The limited time sessions are also a good design decision, since they avoid the weakness that some sandbox games have of dragging on for too long and becoming formless. I find that Reus is a good game to dip into for a session at a time, try a few new goals, relax a little but also think a little, and if that sounds like the kind of game you'd like to have in your library I would highly recommend it.

												Simple game for a cheap price. Main criticism from my side is that there's no in-game interface to get information on the complete tech tree or the parts you already progressed through. The only information you get is the thing you want to change right now, never what you could turn it into later, even though you might have done so before in a previous game or in another place on the map. If this is completely intentional it doesn't work, because people just open a browser out of game and look it up anyways. The game has too much information to memorize even through multiple runs, so it wouldn't hurt to get information on what you've already unlocked and done at least once. Otherwise it's nice to waste a few hours with.Oh and it fully runs on LINUX, which is a HUGE plus for me.			"

The lack of a campaign is offset by the way various features are unlocked, albeit making the game slightly reminiscent of Facebook games, and the Flash-like animations and UI aren't helping there. The concept is greater than the execution itself, but it's still very likeable. It's a fun game, lodged somewhere between ""puzzle"" and ""god game"". Would recommend.			"

												At first, I was all in. A simple yet somewhat complex god game with an interesting 2D view. The problem is that after the initial learning curve, you realize you neeed to memorize every possible combination to truly be great at the game. Too much work for little payout. I'd say get it when it's $5 if you like this type of game.			"

												Simple game for a cheap price. Main criticism from my side is that there's no in-game interface to get information on the complete tech tree or the parts you already progressed through. The only information you get is the thing you want to change right now, never what you could turn it into later, even though you might have done so before in a previous game or in another place on the map. If this is completely intentional it doesn't work, because people just open a browser out of game and look it up anyways. The game has too much information to memorize even through multiple runs, so it wouldn't hurt to get information on what you've already unlocked and done at least once. Otherwise it's nice to waste a few hours with.Oh and it fully runs on LINUX, which is a HUGE plus for me.			"

												A lovely indie game, great for downtime between more challenging games / doing serious stuff. The lack of a campaign is offset by the way various features are unlocked, albeit making the game slightly reminiscent of Facebook games, and the Flash-like animations and UI aren't helping there. The concept is greater than the execution itself, but it's still very likeable. It's a fun game, lodged somewhere between ""puzzle"" and ""god game"". Would recommend.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a simulation  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are many resolution sizes available.You can change the aspect ratio.You can play this game on Fullscreen mode or Windowed mode.There is a Music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There are some different languages available.There are different play time limit available.About the game.You control 4 giants. Forest giant, water giant, rock giant and the swamp giant. Each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes a mix is required to build something unique that you normally can't get. So then you have to use a rock giant in a forest area. Or a forest giant in a swamp area. Before the match is about to begin, you will see some of the achievements/unlockable that you are still able to unlock + with the description. When on ""Earth"" You will see some arrows popping up, These are temporary fertilized ground. Which makes your resource more powerful. Once build on that ground the fertlize effect will always be activate for THAT resource. So if you are adding a different resource into it. You have to fertilize this with the forest giant again. So that resource also gets the boost. Some resources requires another resource to become more powerful.There is a Well explained tutorial ingame.Music is okay.Everytime you unlock an achievement, you will unlock something new too! So unlock to get more abilties!Able to pause the game and resuming it. You can give order commands to the giants when in pause mode.Other things.Reus is a Dutch word for Giant.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												This is a fantastic and wonderfully complex game.  Sparing you another description, this game has some reverse Civ-like (playing as the environment, not the humans) elements and some puzzle elements to it.  What is the most optimal way for you to give resources to your villages without them trying to destroy each other and you?  How do you give the humans just enough of a boost for them to finish a project without them demanding more and more resources from you?  Now that the humans have rebelled and are attacking you, how do you deal with an angry and murderous village?  I highly recommend this game, and it is easily has one of the best value-to-money ratios of games that I have played.			"

												A calming, relaxing game, based more in creation then destruction....until your subjects disobey you, then it's time to fertilize the next generations crops with their broken bodies.It's a god game, and one that is in many ways simplistic, but offers enough complexity to warrant several more hours of play. I got it for a third of the price and it is without question worth that much, and I suspect had I bought it for full I'd still feel largely satisfied.In it you try to help lead humanity to new heights of civilization...sometimes. Other times you just want them to murder eachother so you can unlock a new animal. Moments where to build one civilization up you have to destroy another lend a properly sociopathic tone that any god game should have. Especially when you've just freshly unlocked a new power from your sacrifice, only to turn around and make them burn. Good times.			"

												Reus is the first god game i've played in years, probably a decade plus.  Its a classic style god game where you indirectly shape civilizations by terraforming and can directly affect them with powers such as earthquake.  There is a surprising amount of depth to the game, with different biomes multiple synergies between different plans, animals, and minerals in those biomes, and you control the placement and upgrading/transmuting of these with your giants, which can in turn be upgraded in different ways via ambasadors, which the towns give you when you complete projects.On the whole the game is well balanced and enjoyable, with progression provided via unlocks from acheivements, each game has a time limit so you must persue specific goals to be able to progress within the time.On the downside its a bit slow to get going and you will need plenty of patience to get into it properly, but if you have enjoyed god games in the past then this is a classic example that you will almost certainly enjoy too.

And if your willing to stick with it and work your brain a little, youll find it can be rewarding if not a little repetative.

												A simple to start game, click your giants here grow this put that bit of animal there and lookie people!  Of course nature isn't simple but with the help of your 4 gods you can shape the villages and planet to grow.  Grow to slow and projects don't get build and your village become unhappy, grow to fast and they become greedy and will attack you.  Striking a balance is the challange here.  With only a couple of villages that's easy to go but when you're trying to manage 5 or 6 things can quick run away from you and before you know it Treerun is being over run by the neighboring village and POOF away goes your hard work.There are 3 time settings for the game 30, 60, and 120 min games.  Each one unlocks after the other along with additional resources that you unlock through the achivements in game, which can be a bit annoying as you're trying to figure out why they wont grow the damn hemp you want... but in time you'll unlock and enjoy the journey.  While I wouldn't have picked up this game for the normal 10 bucks it was a steal for 2.50 and well worth the time put into is so far.  Manage your villages, your abassadors and the land around you and you'll shape the planat to your will.			"

Progression is easy enough that you can get your humans to build cool projects but difficult enough that you're not going to get all the unlocks right off the bat.I like that your powers are divided out amongst the four giants as well. You gain new powers by providing the resources your humans need to build various projects, and once they complete one they give you an ambassador to increase the powers of one giant. Choosing what powers to advance for a particular giant lends it an interesting bit of strategy.Very cool little game.			"

Reus comes accross first as a cute God game with a simplified world building environment, but quite quickly the depth of this game reveals.In fact Reus is a very smart game, where you try to maximize your world and your giants` power during a 30/60/120 mins game.  As you develop your world, the gameplay becomes deeper as you advance, and you have to adapt to each game as they develop differently. Also at the end of a game you unlock new environments and projects for the next games.The combination of simplicity of the game mechanics and the depth/replayability is very good. "

So then you have to use a rock giant in a forest area. Or a forest giant in a swamp area. Before the match is about to begin, you will see some of the achievements/unlockable that you are still able to unlock + with the description. When on ""Earth"" You will see some arrows popping up, These are temporary fertilized ground. Which makes your resource more powerful. Once build on that ground the fertlize effect will always be activate for THAT resource. So if you are adding a different resource into it. You have to fertilize this with the forest giant again. So that resource also gets the boost. Some resources requires another resource to become more powerful.There is a Well explained tutorial ingame.Music is okay.Everytime you unlock an achievement, you will unlock something new too! So unlock to get more abilties!Able to pause the game and resuming it. You can give order commands to the giants when in pause mode.Other things.Reus is a Dutch word for Giant.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												While a good and fun game - it gets a bit boring with time. Is repetitive, and due to random-generating - can sometimes frustrate you out of your mind when you keep destroying same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again, and they just keep building it, and then you start a fight, because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are throwing rocks at you! and you're their damn god, what do they think they are?? Yeah. Also time limits suck, but without them you can't' reach your full potential. And then you can't reach full potential because time ran out.Still. Worth the money if you get it on sale or something.			"

All the thing you can do are easy to do. But ofcourse there is a hard option. I play/played this game with a big smile on my face, but you need also your brains. That is the best conbination in this game. If you like actio-games, don't buy this game, because it is not a action-game.

												Being God feels amazing, especially with these gentle giants to aid you in your world creation! Feel rewarded when you discover optimal resource placement and then experience a power trip when you pacify villagers with fiery death from above (or, y'know, fiery injury). With Reus you can enjoy a soothing world-building experience, or you can go in depth and unlock all possible resources. I recommend this for literally every person. Everyone please buy and love it.

												Rock-paper-scissors mechanics are incarnated in Reus at its best. Here are different kinds of plants and mines and animals and fishes and else and else and else — things that you fill up your little planet with; they must be combined in different ways to cause various reactions that define the vector of evolution and development of every individual village under your control. Villages that grow strong want more and begin wars, villages that are weak are useless for your overall prosperity. Trying to gain some points of prosperity, you balance between stagnation and greed. Your will materializes via Giants — creatures with its own set of abilities. The more you learn about different kinds of in-game connections — the better your skills and score are. And it's always so exciting to find out that your new ideas work well.Addictive. 85 out of 100.			"

												Have been playing this game for a while after seeing it on a YouTube video.  When it came on sale, I thought I would give it a try.  There is a tutorial that explains the game in a short hand version.  Although you will need to try different combinations of plant, animal and minerals to get the best combinations.  Completing projects for the villages will help you unlock other types of plants, animals and minerals. Of which there is quite a bit.The game can become a tedious and repetitive in the beginning, when you still need to learn the different combinations.  The time in the begining rounds is also quite limited until you get to the second level and you have 60 minutes in which you have to complete the different projects.  On the third level you get 120 minutes per game. (Still need to get there)There is also a freeplay option, but this will not allow you to unlock anything or get any of the achievements.  I would only use this when I have unlocked everything.Overall I like this game.  The graphics is nice and the UI is quite easy to use.  I will recommend this game if you like to think a bit, specially when it comes to getting the best combination of plant, animal and mineral.			"

												DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at www.stanislavcostiuc.com. I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.Reus is what I’d call a mix between Populous and Settlers, two of my favorite strategy game series. Your goal is to create an economy eco-system (the Settlers part), but indirectly, by shaping the planet and placing and transmuting different environments and resources (the Populous part). And it’s simply a delight to play.The basics are quite simple. Our elemental giants can place three environmental object types: animals, minerals, and plants, which in turn give one or more of the three types of resources that humans use: food, wealth and technology. It’s a very basic and simple concept, and the depth comes in combination between the environmental objects and environments themselves (forests, swamps, oceans, deserts and mountains, which our giants also are responsible for creating), symbiotic relationship among nature, settlements, and between each other, and adapting to the situation by transmuting nature as the settlements start expanding and it all suddenly sounds a lot more complex, doesn’t it?But here’s the thing, Reus is very smartly designed when it comes to expanding depth and not overwhelming the player with it. You start with just the basics, and unlock upgrades (both direct for nature and indirect for humans) as you complete certain number of goals. So this allows you to spend time trying to figure out how to make best of the symbiotic relationships between different plants, animals and minerals (and the way people want to use them depending on what they’re building, we don’t have any controls over the humans) and as you get a better understanding by completing goals – you get access deeper into the systems.The only thing that I think is missing from the game is a fast-forward function. Even though it’s very enjoyable to listen to the game’s awesome ambiance music as you watch the lush and beautiful graphics, sometimes you just want to speed things up a little bit.So unless slow pace is something that’s going to push you away, I’d definitely recommend to check it out! I’ve spent hours in the game already, and sense that will spend many more.			"

												In Reus you control four giants who all have their own unique abilites to affect the planet. The goal of the game is to create prosperous villages. Prosperity is gained by having the giants create animals, plants, and minerals for the villages, which in turn give food, tech, and wealth. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. To maximize prosperity, you need to take into account symbioses and transmutations. Both of these concepts take a while to get the hang of and use efficiently (at least for me). And if a village becomes too prosperous, they become greedy and will attack other villages and even the giants. This creates a whole new facet of gameplay, leading you to put the village in danger, take away resources... or even destroy the village. Each giant can create a different biome, meaning each village you create can evolve differently.What I find interesting about this game, as an avid achievement hunter, is that achievements (developments) must be obtained to progress in the game. Earning achievements unlocks new game modes, resources, projects, etc. If you aren't a fan of achievements, you may find this annoying. Well, earning these achievements actually acclimates you to the game, and gives you the chance to experiment differently every time you play. I find myself planning each game I play in advance in order to maximize achievement gain. To those who say the game is boring and repetitive, yer doing it wrong. The ability to have villages develop differently every time you play creates massive replay value. My advice: buy the game. If it's too expensive, wait for a sale. But either way, I suggest you give it a try.			"

The graphics are really nice and are giving the game a nice atmosphere, but you can probably see that in the previews.

												This game is a real pearl of a god sim. I don't think the game's trailer does the game justice, because the game is much more diverse, complicated and intricate than the trailer shows. This game might not look like it, but the way the different resources interact with each other opens up for a very advanced god sim game. It gives you as a player a big arsenal to choose from - will the villagers survive mostly on animals, plants or minerals? The achievements and challenges are integrated into the game in an extremly though out way. It pushed you to play in different way and with different goals in mind, so it is easy to both focus on the way of playing you find the most fun and to experience ways of playing you might not have tried on your own. I heartily recommend this game to people who are fans of the god sim genre or the rts genre!			"

												Reus is a God game where you control giants to craft and transmute things to the likings of the people, building their settlement withthe use of the resources that you control. It would be slow at first then after you have unlocked more of thedevelopments of your giants, things will start to get interesting,and difficult at the same time. Overall the game is awesomethe sounds blends well with the game, the graphics are nice,if you have'nt got this game, then you are missing a lot..8/10 "

												Reus is a bloody amazing tapestry of interwoven elements. The best way I've ever heard it described is ""a positioning-based puzzle that disguises itself as a god game"". Remember games like Populous and Black & White, where you'd get to indirectly control your followers as a deity of some kind? See how Reus kind of looks like one of those? Forget it, they're nothing alike.What this game really is about is making the best of extremely limited resources. You are given a set amount of time (from half an hour to two hours at the highest), a small planet divided into tiles (it's pretty much one-dimensional) and four giants that can either change the terrain type of a bunch of tiles, place a source in a tile (the resulting source is based on the type being placed and what terrain it's being placed in, so an ""exotic animal"" means different things in swamps and in forests) or use an activated ability like healing all other giants. All those actions have a cooldown. Sources give points of three different types (food, science and wealth), and human cities appear to make use of those points. Your goal is to get as many total points as you can by the time your time runs out. Simple so far, right?Except the resources by themselves are only half the battle, what actually makes you scratch your head are their symbiosis bonuses. Blueberries triple their food output if near certain other plants. Agates give extra wealth when next to animal nests. Frogs increase their tile coverage and give more wealth per tile when next to elderberries. That's what makes positioning so important in Reus - you have to figure out how to place sources next to eachother to maximise their output.Now you think you've got the hang of it and can plan ahead far enough; you might even have a few favourite three- or four-tile source combos you've developed while playing the game. Then come the ambassadors. You see, the human cities I mentioned start projects that require a certain number of specific points (like 15 food) to complete. When they are, not only they give an extra boost to the point output in that village (again, depending on other sources in vicinity or in the world), but the village also produces an ambassador that can be put on any of the giants. Depending on the giant and the type of ambassador the giant gets a new ability or upgrades an old one. The abilities you get at first usually allow the giant to place an enhancement on a source. The enhancements provide a small boost to the source's point output and - that's the most important part - sources with enhancements can be upgraded into other types of sources with completely different symbiosis prerequisites. So now you have to completely rework your combo so that it supports the updated resource, because, well, with the right setups the upgraded resources ARE better.Don't even get me started on the fact that if you give too many points to the humans too fast they'll start being greedy and attack you or other cities (and that's under a time limit, remember). Or the fact that each type of source (mineral, plant or animal) has a specific mechanic that further sets it apart from others. Or the fact that you will never have enough ambassadors to fully upgrade your giants so you'll have to pick which enhancements and sources for each giant you prefer. Or the fact that you unlock new upgrades for sources by completing specific tasks like ""have 500 food in use by the end of the era"".Beneath a simple facade, beautiful artstyle and soothing instrumental music lies a game that manages to be relaxing and brutal at the same time. Each and every element in Reus serves a purpose and they all come together to create one of the best games I've ever played. If you like puzzles, things that make you think, you cannot miss this one.			"

												Reus is... something that begs a total edit of my original review. Before, I thought it was a ""good little time waster"", a ""frustrating case of something that should have been so much cooler"". Quite simply, I had missed the most amazing part of the game and I've since found it, meaning that I can't not change my opinion.Reus is actually really, really fun once you sink your teeth into it. The only thing I didn't realise was that, where I thought I had got to the marrow of it before, I was still gnawing my way through the bare bones. They were pretty tasty bones to be honest; tasty enough that I thought they would be the main gameplay... well you know what they say about assumptions, this one certainly came back to bite me.So what actually IS Reus? It's a puzzle-strategy game that looks like a god game. On the surface it looks like a simple progression from the stone age to the space age (or, if your whims are so inclined, maybe they stay in the stone age); and the ""god game"" elements seemed to just revolve around plonking down resources for the humans to use and then slapping them around with earthquakes and muck bombs if they do something you don't want them to do. You start with a bare and barren planet, and you use four giants with powers over the environment (ocean, mountain, forest and swamp) to create biomes, creatures, plants and minerals; then you grow and evolve those natural resources for the humans to use (or sometimes abuse) while trying to shape the growth of humans so that they unlock the next round of resources. The other thing to note with giants is that, each time you get the humans to complete a project, the humans send you an ambassador and that ambassador will work with one of your giants to unlock further abilities.However, that's just the SURFACE. In all its glory, Reus is a progressive strategy puzzle game where you have to solve the puzzle theoretically beforehand, then progress through the stages in-game to reach your predetermined solution (dealing with any disasters which you hadn't set in motion; like that mad scientist who wants you to destroy the Bluerock Tribe even though you need them to finish their shrine so you can give the mad scientist his new reptiles to play with...). In other words, you have to think something like a god seemingly would; knowing the details of Your Great Plan and slowly convincing the humans to give you the tools needed to implement it.That's very abstract, but remember the example of the mad scientist? Well, each time the humans complete a project for the first time, it unlocks a new species you can add to the world. So if you want to get a mad scientist so you can unlock its associated species, then you need to factor in ALL of its requirements - that includes creating a sacrificial village in this case since destroying a village is one of the requirements to complete that project. You might have to give the humans certain resources, impress them with Awe, start wars (and probably end them too to make sure that the chosen village wins), directly interfere with global trade or learning to make sure that a given village takes the lead in that category... there's a lot to consider when you're a god. Each species is used differently by the humans; they all give common resources but different combinations of resources have different results. So in a kind of psuedo-Chaotic (as in Chaos Theory, not dark gods of destruction) algebra, you shape the game world the humans make use of the resources you give them so that you can give them the next lot, and the next lot, and the next lot until you get them to complete that project and unlock that new species (which has been the goal of thousands of years of evolution).That's a big part of the game. Naturally you only start out wit a RELATIVELY small number of species - but this is where the game tricked me, because you still get a LOT of species to start with. Like, hundreds. And then there's another couple of hundred to unlock... but in that first hundred or so species, there are symbioses and interactions enough to make a thriving world; so I assumed that the unlocks were ""endgame"" content to polish off the basic systems.Nope. Not even close. The unlocks build, and build; not just with extra layers of unlocks but also with ""tiers"" (which you can only unlock with certain combinations of ambassadors). You don't just need to unlock all the species, you also have to create a world that can sustain them and make sure - so if you want the coffea tree to caffeinate your mad scientist in order that he can stay up all night and do astrology; then you have to get certain things happening in the world to be able to make a coffea tree.In other words, you're eventually going to need a spreadsheet. At the start, Reus looks like it will work if you just add a bit of this and a dash of that and then see what comes out at the end. However, the truth is that if you want to unlock everything, sooner or later you're going to have to really seriously stop and plan the whole pathway to get there. You need to know what the humans need, in what order and in what combination, to make a certain project; and you also need to remember that in order to get some species thriving in the world you'll have to give up on the others that won't help your path.Yes, that's right, to fully play this game you have to move past the ""I want everything in a glorious utopia!"" thinking that's immediately obvious to new players; and start thinking about your planet as a means to an end. It's not that species are mutually exclusive - every species will work with every other species - but rather, the requirements for some species will preclude you getting other species because you simply won't have enough room to get both. Whether it's not having enough room on the planet, or not having enough room on your giants, getting to the marrow of this game means coming to terms with the sheer number of possible pathways available, and then figuring out which ones you want to pursue.That's why I I invoke Chaos Theory to explain Reus. Einstein summed it up pretty well: ""Life is like a game of dice - if you know all the variables, your throwing force and the wind and the room's air pressure and the weight of the dice and everything; then you can roll a 6 every time"". In Reus, you DO know all the variables - that's why there's an in-game link to the wiki. I missed that bit in the tutorial because I was having too much fun making fish, but if I had paid attention I would have seen how much more complexity there is in Reus.And then there's in-game challenges - scenarios where you can only use so many of one ambassador type. Scenarios on a strict time-limit (all games are timed, but some of the challenges make it a real race against the clock). Scenarios where whole branches of the ""tech tree"" are closed and you have to come up with a creative way to replace them... the more you play, the more complexity you find.And my gosh it's fun to explore that complexity. If you happen to be a completionist, or if you really like problem solving, then Reus gives you a really nice challenge to sink your teeth into. If you don't like complicated maths or grinding, then this probably isn't your kind of game - there is a big chunk of repetition involved, although there are ways to minimise it some missions simply won't work any other way except starting from scratch on a very specific path. That said, if you do have that urge to totally control history and like working with really complex, abstracted challenges; then Reus is still a great hobby - not just a time-waster, but an investment of loads and loads of time into possibly the greatest sense of satisfaction for completing a challenge that you'll eve find in a game.

A design puzzle of sorts, surprisingly simmilar to SpaceChem or other Zachatronics games. You got your tools (the giants) and you try to accomplish some objective, being having some population, a rich civilization, a pacefull, prosperous civilization, etc...And it is wonderfull. I've spend too many hours on this game and still captures me from time to time. Go play it.			"

												This game offers a charming presentation and approachable core mechanics, giving it the appearance of a marked improvement over other ""god games"".Unfortunately, there are a few major factors holding it back-1. Too much of the game experience is sacrificed for the sake of the whole ""giant"" fantasy. All of your commands feel unresponsive because you have to wait for your incredibly slow giants to move for each order, and then complete a painstakingly slow animation when they get there. This delay adds up and can account for literally 30-50% of your actual time ""playing"" in any given round. The animations are charming and immersive at first, but quickly become a source of frustration.2. The game relies on ""randomly generated math problems"" to create the majority of its depth. Since you have control over the placement of absolutely everything, the only thing in the game that actually poses a ""challenge"" and offers a ""reward"" is the completion of your humans' randomly generated ""projects"". These projects require you to meet certain ""productivity"" targets, and doing so requires you to solve a complex math problem to determine which resource placements will grant you the correct symbiosis/specialization benefits to meet the target.Because of the way the ""Ambassador"" system works for unlocking your giants' powers, you have very few options early to solve very easy problems. Then later on you have tons of choices, but usually ONLY ONE RIGHT ANSWER, or possibly no answer at all depending on how you slotted your Ambassadors.Math problems are tolerable once in a while, but it's the hallmark of a ""god game"" that you get to make lots of ""fun"" choices that really tailor your world and your experience to match your own playstyle. Reus offers none of that.3. The initial experience does a good job of guiding you through the basics, but then the game throws you at a wall of ""achievements"" that you have to complete to unlock additional ""choices"" (Possible solutions to the aforementioned math problems). Your initial set of choices is very limited, so naturally the goal is to complete these ""achievements"" ASAP.These achievements are all very similar and can generally be completed at a rate of 6+ per game if you do your math well. But then you move on to the next set, and it's all the same challenges with bigger numbers. Get 600 Prosperity. Ok now 1200. Ok now 2400... It's really just completing longer and longer games and bigger math problems, and no other twists or challenges added in.I would have much rather been presented with a series of carefully crafted and themed ""challenges"" with specific goals that all feel distinct from one another. If you ever played ""Sim Earth"" back in the day and did, for example, the Mars/Venus terraforming challenges, that's what I'm talking about.--ALSO: There's a major bug where your Forest Giant can get ""stuck"", and the only way to fix it is to Save/Load your game. All in all, it's clear that the developers put a lot of effort into this game, and it was a very fun and polished experience until it started feeling repetitive about ~3 hours in. I would recommend spending a few hours with it if you can get it on sale, but I wouldn't consider it worth the full purchase price.			"

You only give certain commands and your tribes will form and build upon their self, the game has a huge variety of things to achieve, and allowes for a lot of replays to get a lot of different types of civiliztations/tribes to exist.The only big complaint is that it becomes rather slow at a certain point and the beginng is prett much the same most of the time. Also sometimes you aim for a certain goal and the civilization might juts not go into that direction.If you like the genre, give it a try, or maybe watch a lets play first.I presonally stopped playing because of the overall pace of the game.'nuff said.

												Ive played alot of games in my time, though short it has been. some innovative, some revolutionary, some very beautiful and touching. But this game, among many others, tried to do something that has become a trend of indie's lately: It is trying to be ""more"" than it actually is. I say this because this game has LOADS of content. so many unlockables and achievements and fun things that just look pretty. But thats where the list of good things ends (except maybe the controls, which by the way are flawless IMO). Ive played enough of this game to unlock 90% of everything and found myself wanting more, which is not a good sign. Dont get me wrong, this game is amazing and i WOULD recommend this game... if there wasnt a lack of solid story. The only actual story is the tutorial... yes you read that right. I love games that let you craft your own story and make a new world each time, but this isnt that. This is a game that allows you to build and build and build until you cant build no more (or run out of time). But there is no objectives (except those that are required for a building) and there's no element to this game that truely makes this game stick out other than an interchangable/interlinking environment. Sounds very nice doesnt it? Well it is, for 5 minutes. Then its a hassle to deal with.So to wrap this up im going to finish with my honest opinion of this game: Its beautiful, its a great time waster, and it can be a good stress-reliever. But that isnt enough for this to be considered a good, long-lasting game. Buy it if you'd like. In the end you'll come to the same conclusion i have.			"

Every legacy decision carries over to cause bottlenecks in the future. Each new development comes with a swath of irreperable collateral damage. Every slightest work order, from digging a lake to planting dandelions, requires mobilizing an entire hulking, ill-motivated workforce across the entire district. This is a game about working for the world's worst civic development bureau, and watching with bedgrudging sympathy as disgruntled civilians form a mob and attack your incompetent workers for doing a bad job.

												This game was somewhat deceiving (though when I say that, I don't mean that in an entirely bad way). The game is barely what I'd consider a strategy game. It's much, much more closely a puzzle game. You basically are mix and matching different pieces of life that synergize with each other to complete objectives. It's almost like those element combining games mixed with Tetris, since you don't have much room to do all this. When I think of strategy games, I think of games like Civilization, Starcraft, DOTA 2, etc... This game even looks like an RTS meets simulation game by the videos and screens. But like I said, it's much, much more puzzle-like. I did not even remotely feel like I was playing with a simulation or strategy game. There's supposed to be some combat between villages, but I never got that far into it. I just wasn't having enough fun to do so.If you like space management, puzzle games, then you would probably find enjoyment in this, but I like deeper, more accurately described strategy games, so I can't recommend it.

												So sad to not recommend this. But the thing is, it's just not fun to play.When I saw the art and the idea and the trailers I was hooked. I thought it was brilliant. I got it and was even making plans to buy a copy for my 10yo niece so she'd have some fun and learn a bit about how nature works, how it interacts with humans, how symbiosis works, those kinds of things. Did I have too high expectations? Maybe.When you get to the gameplay, problems start to arise. Let me try to list a few:1) The planet is super small. As far as I could find there's only one size, that's it. 2) Then you go through the tutorials. Which is a nice thing of course. Except that you can't save. And the gameplay is a bit boring so I wanted to play for a few minutes, save, and come back later. Nope, can't do that. Gotta endure the whole thing at once.3) There are three tutorials (eras). Every time you advance to a new one it starts from scratch. Oh, come on. I just spent some time building and caring for my planet and first thing you do is take it away from me and make me start again. And then again. And then again. Really?4) My misunderstanding but I thought gameplay would be a bit more... natural and less calculative. Everything is numbers calculation, there doesn't seem to be any space for a more natural and organig development, for luck/chance, nothing. That's not how nature works! That kind of mechanics might cater for some but it's not for me.5) The main gameplay seems to share that major flaw with the tutorials: You won't care for ""your planet"". Because you'll play for 30 min. and ditch it, then for 60 min. and ditch. What? :(    I don't know but I love tycoon games and one of the things I like is how attached I grow to ""my city"", ""my prison"", ""my civilization"". In Reus you seem to be just starting over all the time.Anyway. I could go on but these were the first/main things that struck me. To be honest I couldn't wait to just close the game and go play Banished or Prison Architect or Civ V or Cities: Skylines or any other game that may have a resemblance to this one. They are all just... better and more fun.TL;DR:The art is beautiful and the idea is amazing but the gameplay falls short. It's repetitive, boring, calculative, and just not engaging or entertaining enough. A real shame as my expectations were high and I really wanted to like it so much.			"

												It's a very nice game. Hooked me instantly from the start and still fascinate me after several days. But slowly it starts to get pretty repetitive but that's totally fine as of now. You will have at least ~10 hours fun playing this game! Probably even 20-50 hours.			"

												Oh how I love this game!Reus is one of those games that is easy to learn but harder to master! You control four giants (mountain, ocean, forest and swamp) in order to create a planet on which humans will settle. You will fill this planet with animals, plants and minerals for the humans to use. They will expand their villages and start projects in your honour. But, beware as humans can also get greedy and start wars against each other, and, if they grow to big and bold against even your giants which are not indestructible! You can't control the humans fully, only give them the possibilities which makes this game quite challenging and rewarding when your plans come to fruition! Definitely a recommended title!			"

												Reus is probably my favorite god-game of the past decade.At its core, the game is something of a 2D (or really, technically 1D) Sim City RTS. You cannot directly control humanity, but you create and arrange resources in order to help them thrive. Villages need Food, Wealth, and Tech, which can be gained in various combinations from Animal, Plant, and Mineral resources.It may not be obvious from the screenshots, but the planet is divided up into individual tiles. Each tile can only be occupied by one resource or building at a time, though you can usually ""overwrite"" a tile's contents.You direct your four giants (Ocean, Rock, Forest, Swamp) to terraform the world's surface and to place resources on specific tiles. Eventually humans will settle near a resource, reserving several contiguous tiles as a town square, and setting up borders a certain distance from the square. As a village develops, the borders will be pushed back, opening up additional tiles for the village to use.Most of the game's progression is context-sensitive.Giants have vague powers, such as ""Create Exotic Animal,"" but the TYPE of animal is determined by which biome (Forest, Swamp, Desert, Mountain, Ocean) the power is cast upon. Individual resources may grant bonuses depending on what occupies the adjacent tiles (Salt is more useful if there is a different mineral right next to it).Giants are able to upgrade the attributes of certain resources. For example, the Swamp Giant is able to increase the amount of Tech provided by any plant tile. Improving aspects in this way unlocks the ability to upgrade the resource to a more valuable/effective (but often more specialized) resource. By manipulating aspects, you can develop Blueberries into either Strawberries or an Apple Tree. Each of those choices also has branching upgrades with different bonuses. In order to keep the choices from getting overwhelming, certain upgrades must be unlocked with achievements.There are two separate classifications of animals, two of minerals, and two of plants. With all the valid combinations of resource-types and biomes, there are 25 possible entry-level resources, each with various upgrade paths.A village's ""type"" is determined by whether the town square is planted on Forest, Swamp, or Desert tiles. This will determine what sort of civic projects the villagers will want to build (Forest emphasizes agriculture, Desert emphasizes wealth, and Swamp emphasizes technology).Villages will occasionally decide to construct specialty buildings. In order to successfully complete these projects, the village must reach a certain quota of Food, Wealth, and Tech (or other factors) within a predetermined length of time. It's worth it to help villages reach these goals, because they unlock achievements and award you a village ambassador. Each ambassador can be assigned to one of your giants, who will as a result unlock (or strengthen) a creation or aspect power. The type of power affected is determined by what type of village provided the ambassador.Each village has a Greed meter. When a village acquires resources too rapidly, the Greed meter will fill, encouraging that village to attack neighbors (or the giants!). This is disruptive to your ability to efficiently and effectively develop these communities within the time limit (Once time runs out, your accomplishments are judged and you are allowed to continue playing, but some achievements must be reached while the clock is still ticking).The real meat of this game comes from trying to shuffle your resources around within a village's borders in order to maximize context-specific bonuses, because the project the village wants to build just requires SO MUCH of a given resource (or several!) that it needs to be your singular goal. Except it's your multiple goal, because your other villages are also trying to build their own projects, and you can't upgrade this mineral over here until that giant walks over there and casts that aspect upgrade on it (Did I mention the giants have to walk to the tiles where you want them to take action? They're not fast). Since different projects have different dependencies, it's often necessary to maintain at least one of each type of village (Forest, Desert, and Swamp) to ensure a variety of ambassadors (and, by extension, upgrades).Reus has vibrant art assets and a pleasant soundtrack. The game is fairly easy to pick up but the depth of it might catch you off-guard. You can also choose from a variety of modifiers (such as planet's size or a speed boost for your giants) when starting a new game. Some of these modifiers prevent you from unlocking high-level achievements, but they are a nice way to get a head start in what can easily turn into a several-hour session.If you like Populous, Sim City, or Black & White, I would recommend giving this game a try.

												Reus is far more complicated than it is on first sight. Though that the core elements are simple, and easy, to understand, especially the effects of synergies/symbiosis have to be mastered first so that you can actually dare to build the higher tier projects.The unlock system is simple, complete an achievement, and if it contains a reward you get a new feature on how to upgrade your plants/mines, etc. Each era (or game) is parted into 30, 60 or 120 minutes lengths, which unlock as you progress in levels. There are 3 levels, 2 to earn, which give access to new ressource options aswell.Each giant has different abilities, in addition to their normal powers like planting bushes or other ressources, that become available as soon as this giant takes a certain ambassador onto its shoulders. Those are gained by completing building projects. These abilities give you access to moving ressources around or higher damage values for attacks (which you need to defend yourself, if a village becomes too greedy) or upgrade a ressource with either aspect of science, wealth or food, which are the only three ressources needed in the game. You can have up to four ambassadors on each giant.You can activate different modificators before starting an era, that make gameplay much easier for beginners, but you are then unable to complete higher tier achievements, to unlock the last upgrade stages of ressources. This, in my opinion, adds just the right amount of difficulty. (Yet, I still gained 2 achievements in this alt mode, that were tagged as not achievable in alt mode, cough.)There are five terrain types, consisting of forest/grassland, swamp and desert, with mountains and water/sea being the last two, though there are no villages to be built on either. Village types are, as you could guess, three, habitating the forest, swamp and desert. Every village in the different terrains wishes for different projects, and they also have a main ressource aswell to finish thoseEven though, that the game is cheap, and definitely worth its price, i would really like to see more updates, with more combinations, more natural ressources and upgrades.I hope, that I didn't forget to mention anything...

												Reus can be summed up as a god game, the first major game published by Abbey Games. But in this game you don’t control a giant benevolent hand, able to squish your people between thumb and forefinger. You control gigantic… giants that wander around your planetoid, manipulating nature and the elements to help create the best possible ecosystems for all the villages that settle there. I’m going to call them titans since every time I play the game, I imagine the guys from Hercules.Reus is very fun and by setting a strict time limit on each game, you don’t get carried away spending hours trying to perfect your planetoid, or trying to perfect a single village… which never happens since they inevitably get too greedy and turn on your, despite the generations of aid you have provided them.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/11/08/reus/ "

It`s already the same size as the desert city!1 hour,15 minutes in.Another village has settled across the water,in another part of forest,it has become a fishing village and is actually a good size,growing at a rapid rate but not as fast as the other city did1 hour,20 minutes in.The desert city has just become EXTREMELY greedy after i put a tree down that gives out 100 FOOD,they`re declaring war on everyone,and im constantly having to muck bomb their armies1 hour,25 minutes in.Because the desert city has lost all of its armies,its lost all protection too,and it`s getting eaten up by dangerous and absolutely terrifying...MARTENS!1 hour,30 minutes in.The desert city has been destroyed,I removed the tree but its too late,the two forest cities have become massive,even though I had been trying to make the desert city the big cheese the whole game,but now I have two big cheeses :D10/10 so much drama			"

												Reus can be summed up as a god game, the first major game published by Abbey Games. But in this game you don’t control a giant benevolent hand, able to squish your people between thumb and forefinger. You control gigantic… giants that wander around your planetoid, manipulating nature and the elements to help create the best possible ecosystems for all the villages that settle there. I’m going to call them titans since every time I play the game, I imagine the guys from Hercules.Reus is very fun and by setting a strict time limit on each game, you don’t get carried away spending hours trying to perfect your planetoid, or trying to perfect a single village… which never happens since they inevitably get too greedy and turn on your, despite the generations of aid you have provided them.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/11/08/reus/ "

												I have played quite a few create-a-world games by now, and I still find Reus one of the nicer ones out there. There is a lot of diversity in choices you have and a ton of achievements that guide you into possible goals for your game.You can also choose between having a short game (30 minutes, 1 hour etc) or freeplay (endless game) Which is nice if you want to play one last small game before you go to bed and not find yourself still playing at the time you should be waking up.All in all, this is one of the nicer games I own :3 It seems small but there is a lot more in there than you would think.

												This is unique sandbox take on the God Game concept.Rather than the usual God Game where you must indirectly help your followers prosper and defeat their enemies, in Reus you must oversee the whole world.   You get to control 3 giants with the powers of the elements to create various natural resources and environments.With multiple villages needing your attention, you can chose to help, ignore, or smite each one.    Be careful not to help too much, though, as humans are greedy creatures who, if not faced with challanges, will simply want more and more, until they attack your neighbors, and eventually you!As more villages prosper and complete projects, you become more powerful, and the more games you play successfully in different ways, the more powers you unlock.

I spent most of my time trying to find which giant had which ability/blessing and hoping my investments in one part of the tech tree would pay off down the road. It's a puzzle game with a learning curve that could be overcome in a few hours - but once overcome would lose it's purpose. 6/10 - spend your money during a Steam Sale.			"

												Hours of fun and great value for money game, especially if bought on special. Reus is a sort of puzzle building game (if I can call it that). If you enjoy building/city mangement games you will really enjoy this. Pros of this game:> New items unlock after completing challenges (this happens after completing most missions)> Different play styles can (and should) be used to finish missions> Challenges (which unlock new items once you finish a mission) force you to try different play styles> Gets harder the more you play> Very nice and clean graphics> Unique play style and different to other city buildersCons of this game:> Can be a bit repetetive if played a lot> Some lag when I zoom out of the map completely> The map sometimes feels a bit small, espcially when you reach late game, but I suppose this is part of the game style that the developers chose> No campaign or story line, the game is built around completing a set of challenges			"

While this may sound enjoyable, it never really goes beyond that, and to be honest, it gets old fast.			"

												When it comes to Reus, the game is very one dimensional in gameplay and gets old quickly. It is peaceful and cute but there are man other games out there that are peaceful and cute that don't simply rely on that, they have gameplay that is stimulating and engaging. Reus is a game that forces you to be slow, not one that lets you. Plus, just when you think that you have a nice city and you think about building another one, one of your cities develops greed and declares war on another village. You like both those cities, but now, you must let one be destroyed or destroy the other with your giant rock monster. I just didn't have the patience for this game. It's just a sandbox game that is too limited and structured.4/10			"

												Reus is a bad game that's bunch of random concept thrown haphazardly in without any care about how they fit together. Resources are just colored spheres that don't do anything other than meet arbitrary demands for various demands the villagers randomly give you. You have no control over what the r****ded chimps you watch over will decide to build or where they will s*** their worthless buildings. So good luck trying to accomplish your goals which depend completely on villagers a) deciding to build the right building b) getting the right goal/bonus for the building they build c) that they don't drop the building in middle of your tree chain and thus ensuring that you will accomplish absolutely f*** all during this game because without the synergy chain you have zero f***ing chance of collecting anything. You would think that villages would require food to grow and other resources would fill other needs and thus guide the villages' development but nope, the dudes are happy to eat Wealth and Science and grow big. Or that the villagers would build the extra buildings depending on what resources they have at hand but nope, Food/Science mountain village will always build that Tax Office that you already have all achievements for and scream that they need f***ton of wealth !!STAT!, Wealth/Science forest village will build Granary without fail and who knows what the f*** swamp villages build, they live in swamp so they are probably actually r****ded. There's also really no other gamemode than timed Sandbox, during which you try to accomplish achievements which give you access to more buildings, which do basically the same as old buildings except better so when your r****ded villagers demand five thousand more red spheres and also two thousand blue spheres, you can look at the last free plot you have free and then check your build options:a) You have the required advanced building - Congrats, a winner is you! Have your giants squat that pile of rocks out and collect your savings.b) You don't have the required advanced building - Ignore that s***ty little village that will never progress more and give you the achis you despair for, pray for better RNG next round.There's also the hilarious game mechanic where, if the resource source sits on blessed ground, it will have chance of jumping into SUPERADVANCED when you upgrade it. PERCENT CHANCE. Some of the building goals basically require you to get these sources, so you will be spawning, blessing, upgrading and demolishing sources for a while. Good luck. The giants also have cooldowns on their skills, probably to f*** you over at this because they also lumber around slow as all f***. Enjoy watching your morons slowly roll around and scratch their asses while you wait for something to finally happen. This also brings up the upgrade mechanic, where the good stuff is locked behind Village Ambassadors. Help village build a building and they'll let one of your giants to pick up an ambassador, who gives THAT giant the Aspect of Forest/Swamp/Mountain. In practice this means that you first try to desperately see into future to figure out what Power you are going to need to complete next building and then figure out which of your giants has that Power. Did I mention that all the upgrades and powers are split among your four giants basically randomly? Having all buttons spread between four different a***oles allows you to wonder who had that power you need now and then remember it's on the worthless crab that's still at the bottom of the sea. Now watch him slowly waltz around the whole world to get to where you need him. Overall, my time playing Reus was split between, waiting for cooldowns to come off, waiting for giants to drag their asses to where I need them, wondering why my villagers are so r****ded and wishing I was playing a better game.

												I didn't think it was possible to turn a slow-paced, freeform game like a god simulator into a compulsive skinner box, yet here we are.Once you get past the tutorial, you realize the game proper ends after a set time, during which you have to clear challenges to unlock new upgrades and technologies. So you have to keep playing one short morsel of a game after another to progress. There's a freeplay mode, but it's limited to what you managed to unlock.And yet, you can't go *too* fast either, because of the greed mechanic. Villages that acquire resources too fast get greedy, and start waging war on other villages and will even try to kill you, ending the game prematurely. There are ways to prevent this, but they're only vaguely covered in the tutorial.And by the the time you managed to unlock everything, the game's practically over because in the end there really isn't much to do. It's both rigid and shallow, and it ultimately comes down to memorizing synergies to bolster resource acquirement. So the truth of the matter is that all the limitations are there to squeeze as much game time as possible out of what little game there actually is.In short: stay away from this game if you still have some self-respect.

												This game is marketed as a city-building god game, but ends up playing like a poorly executed puzzle game.  You have to place plants and animals near each other to create synergy, but you have to initially place things without knowing how they'll interact because the UI does an awful job of communicating what will happen.You end up spending most of your time replacing things because it turns out you should have build it 1 space over.  Imagine doing a jigsaw puzzle with your eyes closed, your hands (the gods) moving at a snail's pace, and every time you place a puzzle piece, you have to wait a minute before you can move it.  And then, before you can even finish the puzzle, the timer runs out and deletes all your work.The game fails to deliver satisfying, intelligent gameplay, has absolutely no depth whatsoever, and within a couple hours you'll have experienced everything it has to offer.

												Reus promises nice and smooth design and a smooth gameplay within a game dealing with creating your own planet, helping civilization bloom and beeing able destroy it with your immortal and dandy looking Giants. And honestly, you can do all of that. Awesome, right!?...Well...After playing the tutorial, I got a really bitter taste of dry boredom on my tongue. As a game i wanted to play occasionally (like Binding of Isaac or FTL) Reus feels way too complicated in parts that should not be and simplistic (food- wealth- and tech- symbiosis) in the ones that require more depth (Giant's creation abilities). For a sale price of 3,39€ I do not recommend to anyone. Trust me, watch the trailer and some pictures of Reus, and you got it's best part without playing it. "

												Part Sim City, part Black and White, Reus is a very unique indie God/World Builder game.You controll 4 gods that have the power to create biomes (ocean, forest, desert, swamp, moutain) and minerals that will attract humans to build and expand towns.They expect a lot of the gods, but may become greedy and go to war with each other, or even you.Help the humans complete building projects to unlock more powerful abilities for your gods to better maximize your towns, unlocking bigger and better building projects for even more powerful abilities.While it may seem deseptively low content at first glance the game uses a combo system where just about everything can stack up with something else, mastery is required and learning is half the fun. Wonderful artistic graphics and soothing music make this brain crunching game a lot of fun.			"

 Review Please note that this is my opinion of the game and you can choose whether you think the game is good or not.I bought the game because it sounded fun, and at first it was fun. It was only fun for about an hour though and then it got boring. It's not a bad game at all, it's just one of those games that you either like it or you don't. It does have some pretty cool features in it such as being able to pretty much control how the world looks and make the villagers happy. If you like simple games with no action and very little combat, and some strategy involved, then this game is for you.Again, you might like this sort of game, but I didn't and I don't think it's a good enough game to reccomend, but it's not bad by any means, just not really good. Bugs I didn't notice any bugs at all, but I haven't played it a lot. Overall 6.5/10I can't reccomend this game due to how easy it is to get bored with it. Watch some videos about it and see if you would like it before buying it. If the price was lower, I would have bumped the score up a bit, but I feel that $10 is a little too much for this type of game. $5 or less would be an appropriate cost.			"

												Reus is a deeply complex strategic real time puzzle god simulator. One can get lost in it, which is exactly what I did for many many hours.The art design is beautiful and there is pretty much hundreds of hours of potential. The game pace is soothing and yet interesting at most times.It can get repetitious after a prolonged while of play, but it is fun to get back to it now and then.			"

												Overall relaxing god game. Once you figure out the min/max it becomes clear that the depth of the game isnt' as deep as one would hope. However, what it sets out to do I think it does it real well. I'm more appreciative of the fact that the devs managed to make a commentary on humanity's nature as a whole (deliberately or not) and not be so heavy-handed with it making the message way more impactful.

												Gem of a game! Good example of a game that is somewhat lacking in long-term playability but makes up for it with a beatiful visual style and innovative mechanics. Biggest critique is that the game turns from fun exploration in the first part to tiresome fiddling & optimzation in the later half, but it is a great find regardless.			"

												    Games Like Reus don't come along as often as I'd like. Rarley is a god game so simple and full of heart and charm. Playing inviisble giants that roam the world, givng and taking life gives the gameplay more meaning than one would think. The design behind these giants is very totemic and spiritual, and having to pick up devoted followers, or ""ambassadors"" in order to unlock most of thier full potentail makes them seem more wordly as well, a god without followers has little power.     Seeing your creations grow, providing for them and occasionally wiping them out gives you a feeling like you've made something, like you've been actually produtive instead of playing a video game all day.     My only quibble with the game is a performance issue, You need a halfway decent Graphics card (i.e. one with a brand name like Nvidia or ATI attached) to run the game at the moment due to the engine and the limited staff Abbey Games actually has. Not to say that the potentail for beautiful graphics isn't wasted, Ultra high settings are fantastic and stunning.    I thuroughly enjoy Reus and Highly reccomend picking it up, You can wait for a sale if you wish, but in my opinion, it more than earns it's ten dollar price tag			"

												First of all, I recommend this game only for people who are EXPERIENCED in playing time management and strategy games. I do not recommend this game for people who rarely play them or who aren't used to them. This game is way too challenging for my taste, but it may be appropriate for more skilled players. The impression the videos gave me was that the game was cute and easy going, up until war broke out among the neighboring tribes, but the needs between the villages are so demanding that I could not keep up. I was very over whelmed. I really admire how the tutorials eased you into the gameplay, but it didn't do a good enough job of preparing you for managing multiple things at once because once I got into the actual game, I felt thrown into disorder. The fewer number of villages you have, the easier it is. I tried to limit myself to only two villages, by not giving the requirements for them to spawn. However, regardless of this, they were still popping up! I had to run around maintaining four or five different villages, and I thought it would be easier than that but it just seemed to be too much.The biggest thing that made this game so difficult to me is sort of an infinite cycle. Each village has a project it wants to be built that needs to be completed in a certain amount of time. In order to complete the project, the village needs so many resources (food, wealth, or tech). In order to increase the amount of resources, you have to spawn things like animals, herbs, plants, mines, ect that will yield the desired resource. However, to get enough resources, you need enough space within the village borders to spawn them. The villages will expand their territory automatically over time but after several different playthroughs, my villages expanded extremely slowly and in most cases, they just stopped all together and barely expanded. I simply had no more room to spawn anything else, therefore I couldn't get anymore resources than what I had. Even when I would with apply ""upgrades"" to make the items produce more resources, which are called attributes in the game, I still sometimes wouldn't meet the quota. So with insufficient resources, the time limit would run out, and I wasn't able to complete the projects the people wanted done. This was especially hard when I had four different tribes to tend to who all wanted projects completed. These demands and limitations really restricted gameplay. There's just a lot going on at once in this game that's hard to handle.			"

												I like the premise of this game-the idea of the multiple giants and the dynamic of using the entire planet. It's a little too overtly new-age environmentalist for my taste, but it has potential. Unfortunately, so far I have been very underwhelmed by the game-play. I'm not exactly sure why, but it's simply not all that fun. I'm going to keep playing it a bit more to see if it will grow on me. I think it's because there is no logical connection between all of the different abilities and upgrades for the giants. It's difficult to choose which path you want to go in upgrading, and it doesn't seem to make a huge difference anyway. If there is a Reus 2 ever-if they deal with some of the gameplay problems, I think this could be a great game.			"

												A charming, surprisingly deep god game overflowing with style and personality - and a lot deeper than it may seem.  As The Planet, you control four powerful giants (Mountain, Swamp, Forest, and Water) .  Using these beings you raise mountains, create herbs, sew plants, form oceans, and more.  As people settle you help them out by altering and improving their lands so they can advance as civilizations.  However humans can get greedy  and violent, your giants powers have different effects, and various combinations of minerals, animals, plans, and environments have radically different effects.  Simple to play, it takes effort and attention to master, and there's complex trees of relations and evolution of the environment.  Fun, engaging, surprisingly deep, it's really a good example of game as art AND entertainment.  A must-buy if you like god games.			"

												Here's a real review:The majority of you shouldn't play this game. That's the truth. In this ADHD and short-attention span era we live in (which I myself have) this game has a steep learning curve, especially for somebody like me who's never played games like these before. And even with the three part tutorial (which took me about 2 hours total and which I repeated again), I'm still confused about a lot of things. I also bought Abbey Games' (the developer) other game ""Renowned Explorers"" which I briefly started up (and which I plan to get further into when I've become a little more comfortable with this game). That game also isn't accessible in terms of play. That's not specifically a criticism of either game or of Abbey Games. To some gamers, the sophistication of gameplay and mechanics is a draw and part of its appeal. That's why I'm not giving this game a thumbs down. That, and the fact that it is kind of fun (albeit frustrating) trying to learn how the game works. Essentially though, you're dealing with three elements: food, wealth and technology. One of the main objectives in the game is to get efficiency from the land by trying different combinations with animals, plants and minerals which allow you to get more food, wealth and technology from the land and complete timed missions in a village. Completing one timed mission in a village allows you to get an ""ambassador"" which then unlocks a skill that you can use to help you in the game. The game is obviously more sophisticated than that, but that's my version of a simplified way to explain it. Only buy it if you have a track record of fighting through (what I consider) games' steep learning curve. I'll update the review as I play more of it and hopefully unlock more developments.			"

												I really enjoyed Reus, but I think that it often got a bit too busy, with sustaining all of your villages and completing all your projects at once, as well as not making the village greedy. Other than that, I think this game is well worth what you pay for it. "

												A charming, surprisingly deep god game overflowing with style and personality - and a lot deeper than it may seem.  As The Planet, you control four powerful giants (Mountain, Swamp, Forest, and Water) .  Using these beings you raise mountains, create herbs, sew plants, form oceans, and more.  As people settle you help them out by altering and improving their lands so they can advance as civilizations.  However humans can get greedy  and violent, your giants powers have different effects, and various combinations of minerals, animals, plans, and environments have radically different effects.  Simple to play, it takes effort and attention to master, and there's complex trees of relations and evolution of the environment.  Fun, engaging, surprisingly deep, it's really a good example of game as art AND entertainment.  A must-buy if you like god games.			"

												Use your four giant hero units to terraform the world and make humans complete projects on it, while also trying to scare them into not killing each other.Gameplay is basically like you're redrawing a Civilization map (mixing terrain types, placing/upgrading resources, etc) to help villages exist and meet project goals. They'll start attacking other villages if you don't balance their growth, and there's a time limit of 30/60/120m for each game.Art, music, controls, and tutorial all work pretty well, so there's atmosphere.Casual and a little slow, but it's kinda fun.[disclaimer: I never played Populous, so idk if it'll appeal to you jerks who did]			"

												A lot less fun than it looked for some reason. -.- I mean it's kind of fun but very limited. It's not that big and open world as you would believe. A fairly linear evolution of tribes and end sequence. I thought it would be like 1 tribe pitt against another backedby different Gods. But it's more like you control a bunch of Gods and make the planet into places where suddenly human tribes started to settle down and build towns and cities. And if they become greedy, they'll attack one another. Then you just simply destroy that aggresive tribe into dust. No real replay value.			"

												Intriguing game idea but the game gets monotonous before 3 hours. The terraforming is what initially attracted me to the game, but then you realize that the options are rather limited and the game quickly devolves into making the numbers of your resources meet whatever requirement you need to achieve next. The game becomes tedious as you will need to do this over and over again to unlock achievements which are tied into unlocking new abilities for your gods.The progression of the game is too slow for my taste and the amount of time I have to play games. A fast forward feature would help as you can wait quite a while for your gods to move around the planet among other events leaving you with nothing to do but stare at the screen.			"

												Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was ""The Perfect Game"" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10			"

												The synopsis of this game speaks strongly when it mentions of the fact that while you can control everything, you can never control humans. Give them too little and they will stay stagnant in time. Give them too much and they will turn into greedy devils. You control 4 elemental giants to shape the world to an ecology of your choice and while you can allow the world to prosper, there's a strong chance for the world to crumble and shatter.Do you want to create a mountain in a swamp village with blueberries beside a nest of poisonous frogs? Go ahead. Do you want to add sharks to the pier to force the people into a state of isolated fear? Up to you. Do you want to control your rock giant and level a whole village with two seismic punches? Sure.These are all posibilities and the best part is, there is no right and wrong. It's a simulation game that relies on unlocking its unlockables to unlock (phew) more content in the game itself. For example, you can't exacly breed sharks if you have not completed, say, the challenge to win 5 wars. On the other hand, you can't unlock mango trees if you even had a war in a single session in the first place.The game also introduces a mechanic known as the symbiosis system. It adds a lot more depth to the gameplay while still making it simple enough to follow from the get-go. It's a system that makes use of the the ecology within your village and how you link them all up together. The giants each possess a number of skills which are used to help produce and maintain the symbiosis of the village(s). Mastery over the system and the skills would ensure global prosperity and ultimately, that is the true main goal of the game.Its art style, music and atmosphere come together sweetly and makes for an enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of the genre, then by all means, give it a go. I highly doubt you will regret the decision. "

Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was ""The Perfect Game"" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10			"

												This is a good game, it has a beautiful art style in my opionion. Runs great, and has no major problems. If you like any kind of game where you can create and build you will love this game. My only real complaint is not being able to stay in an Era and do more work. The Era time seems a little short to me, but then again the planets are only so big and you can only do so much.			"

												Reus is...I like a lot of things about this game, but unfortunately, it's somewhat limited.  The game has a very pretty art style and is a literal god game, as you control four titanic beings who can terraform and cultivate the land so that humans will settle and develop it.This is a great...framework for a game.  Sadly, Reus is very limited.  After the tutorial, there is no story to speak of and you can only play in segments of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and an hour.  You can play endless, but you cannot unlock new animals, cultural goals, etc. in endless.  This is very much a make your own story/adventure and...it feels kinda lacking after the tutorial, which is well done and guides you through how to use the titans, while giving a bit of story fluff.I wish this game had a campaign.  I'd recommend picking it up on discount if you like god games or just enjoy the pretty art style, but for me, it didn't hold my interest too long after I finished the tutorial.  I really do like the game, despite how it sounds, but it needed more.  Still a decent purchase, but not a must have game.			"

												Reus is a simple, yet challenging resource management god-sim. The objective of each era is to help the humans progress as much as possible before the time limit. After each era, if certain criteria are met, additional play modes and resources become unlocked. Be warned, this game can get pretty repetitive. But the unlockable resources mix things up just enough to keep you hooked. The price for the entertainment of this game makes it entirely worth it.			"

												Reus is an oddity. On the face of it you'd presume it was a god-game but in actuality it is a puzzle crossed with a strategy game. The worlds you play are more like stages whereby challenges appear and you have to change the resources to meet the goals while attempting to limit how greedy you villagers become as you give them enough to progress to the targets needed for the challenge. As you play you kind of need to plan ahead a little as you can reach a point where you basically end up limiting your options or not really finding the optimum combination of Giant upgrades to suit the challenges appearing in the towns. While I wouldn't recommend this at full price I would certainly suggest checking it out when on sale.			"

												Reus is an enjoyable and unique strategy game. It combines the all-mighty power of 'Gods' with the endless problems of 'the people', providing for a fun and challenging game. Every move in the game is governed by the four possible Giants of the world. By their actions, you may guide human inhabitants into settling, growing, and thriving, or into struggling, agitating, and invading. Human behavior cannot be directly influenced--you have to plan ahead and use your Giants wisely. And while the game is decidedly simple in concept, the execution is brilliant and provides for a complex range of strategies. For game play, there is a nice assortment of achievements and difficulties, and players can customize game play for all sorts of goals and styles. As someone who takes a bit of time to 'grasp' the right strategy for a game, I appreciated being able to figure things out through playing, and being able to take on more aggressive challenges as my skill grew. The bright style of the game also drew me in visually. Pros:-Well executed strategy -Fun balance of God Powers with Human Problems-Simple or Complex Play-Super customizable set-upsCons:-They had bugs for a while that limited play on some systems-Lack of add-ons (though base game is pretty fun)			"

												Got this on a deep sale as part of a bundle, and its a neat concept, but there's a couple big reasons I'm not recommending this game:-Cannot speed up the game at all: Only pause or play.  Village use of resources and creature cooldowns will take their sweet time and there's nothing you can do about it.  That'd be okay if this were a ""relaxing"" game, but...-Its not a relaxing game because its a management game where I'm eager to get onto the next thing, and I'm not an impatient guy either.- Low number of core game modes.  There's some basic changes that can be made like length of time and some basic mods, but that's it.			"

												At first glance you might think this is a strategy game, but unfortunately, it really isn't. It's more like piecing together a puzzle in slow motion.This game boils down to memorizing nonsensical synergies and watching grass grow. LITERALLY watching grass grow. It takes at least 40 minutes to get the ball rolling. And even then the game is pretty boring. Your actions are limited to placing resources in a way they can synergize with each other and striking down villages with some bland powers if people turn against you.As far as I can tell the only strategy element in this game is planning which achievements you want to farm.

												Interesting game, I like the building/optimising concept, but the game as it is now requires too much brain capacity to be enjoyable. There isn't any in-game way to overview all the possible resources, transmutations, aspects and synergies, so the player either has to constantly alt-tab or keep the whole system in their mind to achieve even the medium-difficulty unlocks.Also, even though while advancing through the game the system of resources, transmutations, aspects and synergies quickly become VERY complex, the gameplay itself still stays quite repetitive and shallow with an overwhelming amount of micro-management needed. And players can only unlock more advanced resources by replaying the game over and over again, which just kills any remaining joy over the fresh concept and makes playing a chore. (It also doesn't help that you can only play fixed-length games, so even if you finish your goals for the given game early, you still have to micro-manage your way until the end of the half hour / 1 hour / 2 hours session.

												Its fun, its pretty, and its not very well thought out. let me explain:You basically have to use these 4 elementals to terraform everything. you upgrade land plots, a leader pops up and gives one of your elementals a special ability of your choosing, you have to assign evenly.  sounds kind of cool right?Yes, but...The more and more people grow, the more and more their demands, demanding upgrades. the problem is, depending on where the villagers randomly and permanently plant their village can mean the difference between having enough land, or ruining your game. you cannot tell villagers to move, they always stay in the same place, and... get this... if you DO manage to do enough to help a village grow, they turn into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and start killing your other healthy villages!SHORT REVIEW:Great idea, not great implementation, cant recommend. I do hope something is done in the future, but it doesn't look likely.			"

												Reus is visually interesting but, I exceeding complicated for no real apparent reasons. I played the game long enough to get through the tutorial (which took two tries for me since the game lagged and locked up even though I completed the assigned task) and a few of the ""levels"" afterwards. It reminds of the old Lionshead Studios game Black & White, except terrible, laggy, buggy, and unnecessarily hard. I would advise avoiding this one as the entertainment value and visuals are ruined by the game play itself. Glad I picked this one up for dirt cheap, that being said this game should be a free download since I regret paying money for it.			"

												I might be a bit unfair to this game but for some reason the game didn't really do a good job of keeping me hooked. I think in terms of design the game is pretty great, but the problem I feel is that scale of the game feels very limited and it didn't boost the content and multiple scenarios to really give it replay value like Civ IV did. Also I really hate the idea of having to unlock techs and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that...			"

												I like the game, but why is it so short? Seriously, it's a really short game. And it starts off painfully slow, so that by the time you get rolling, the game is already over! The mechanics are unique but get headache-inducing fast.I got this game at a deep, deep discount, and I recommend you do the same if you really want it. It isn't worth 10 dollars, not even close.

												This didn't end up being the game I expected it to be. That's not bad, I could have done more research. What I was expecting was some sort of sandboxy world builder, where you add things and see how their affects spread or change what you currently worked on. Sort of like a ""Mother earth"" game where you call the shots but in the end you are just balancing things out so they work, with little variance. Is that the game's fault? Nope, if you enjoy this you will get a huge kick out the game and the pricetag is good.   That being said while I'm not into these games I'll probably go back at some point just so I get my money's worth. It's not worth it to me, so I can't give this a positive review. That being said though if you look at all the reviews in general there's some quality here.			"

												It's more of a puzzle game than a god game. Sure, you have four giants you can control and you try to please humans by creating stuff, but the entire game revolves around putting either food, technology, or wealth-generating stuff on ""patches"" of ground. A town forms when you make a resource on a patch of ground, and the town is freaking tiny (its borders). You then have to place resources next to other resources which have synergies. If you don't use the right synergies, your resource totals won't go high enough. The entire game seems to revolve around putting the right resources next to other resources, and if you can't figure out what order to put them in, you have nothing to do in this game. The game doesn't seem to progress until you unlock a bunch of in-game challenge/achievement sort of things. If you don't unlock enough of them, you have to keep playing in 30 minute increments until you do. This game is a huge time-waster puzzle game wearing the indignantly sliced off face of a god game, and the puzzle aspect wasn't fun at all for me. I got the game for three bucks and I'm still not happy with this purchase. The only thing I will say I like about the game is the art. It's quite nice to look at, but you can get that from watching the trailer. The gameplay is horrid.			"

It isn't awful, but I wouldn't recommend Reus to anybody.			"

If you don't like games where you have to pause every 5-10 seconds to make the most out of the game, stay away from Reus.It's a neat game with a lot of interesting depth, but I really wish I was allowed to just take my time with it. The time pressure was a huge turn off for me.			"

												This game looks absolutley wonderful and has a really likeable interface with good graphics.My review of this, however, is painfully limited. As I have only been able to experience the first 2 eras, while never being able to complete the second one. The reason being that the game lags beyond recognition as soon as the people appear and make a village. It could possibly be my own computer, however I doubt this is the case as this machine runs much bigger and higher detailed games online with no lag whatsoever. And after searching for a fix or a reason for such lag, it was only confirmed that this was an issue, with no other acknowledgement. Such a shame really, I was looking forward to this, but it is completely unplayable.			"

												As another reviewer put it: ""Or you could just go search the wiki for optimal builds, because ultimately, memorizing what building goes with what other building is your end goal. Once you know that, the game is over, and that just isn't enough depth to persuade me to choose it over the myriad of other strategy titles."" - HenggelerzI am a forest ecologist and a gamer. I was really, really looking forward to this game. And after playing it a while I came to the same conclusion. This isn't even a game. You can only progress by placing down the correct combination of improvements to make the next improvement to complete the goals. That's the game, and you can do it via memorization or with a webpage open. Everything else is visuals to accompany the mechanic of placing the right combination of improvements. Developer fail. "

												I had relatively high hopes for this game after finding several small gems in the most recent sale, but I am very dissapointed in this. The jist of the game is that you control several giants, each with their own powers such as creating oceans, mountains, wildlife or minerals, and you try to create an environment in which a human settlement will start up and hopefully thrive. While this sounds like a fun god game, unfortunately, for me it was boring and cumbersome.The main problem, as well as the real draw of the game, is that each ability that your giants have can synergize with another ability, meaning that if the two are together, they will produce more food, science, or minerals. While this good be a very interesting mechanic, allowing you to create strands of synergizing areas for a town, this element is stifled by the fact that each village can only have two plots of land on either side of it that it can use, so even when you have 40+ abilities to choose from and syergize, you can only do to synergies, then that place is done. On top of that, the giants move very slowly, for no apparent reason, meaning that the game takes much longer than it should to get things done, which can be a problem when each world has a time limit on it.Ultimately I feel this could have been a very good game, but the fact that the giants take so long to get places and the creative and strategic ability of the player is limited by the small areas around settlements puts this game out of my mind as I move on to better games.

												This game looked real fun and looked as if it had a nice feel to it...until I started playing for awhile....it gets utterly boring because it becomes about getting a good score or acheivements in order to unlock future items and have fun with them.Come on guys they're freaking Gods....FREAKING GODS..they should already be able to do this cool stuff.....I don't care if they fell asleep for a few thousand years...You would think that they wouldn't forget how to make use of themselves and their powers.....Also some Gods are depicted as ALL knowing.....They shouldn't be able to forget..Even so it becomes very boring because the people on the planet don't do much...They either ask you to perfect their lands or you get rocks and spears thrown at you.Those are the only two interactions with the people.Its also not that entertaining to sit for an hour or 2 perfecting a planet for little imfs.Also I'm pretty sure that getting a person on your back wouldn't suddenly be a memory jolt to get a new power..So in full...its dull, boring, lacking, and completely unrealistic.I had hoped for more...

												Jason peered in through the crack of the doorway to the computer room, curious of the moaning sounds coming from inside. He saw Matthew and Victoria sitting across from each other, confused, he did not intervene. He stared intently in disgust, yet glued to the spot, in order to see clearly what was happening. Victoria rubbed Matthew's nipples ferociously. Matthew by this point was turned on to holy hell, and was ready to rip her clothes off. He loved the smell of her, her scent, her taste, her hair, all of it just made him desire her more. She smelled of raspberries and cassadea, his favorite. As she pressured her fingers into his nipples more and more, his raging erection hardened to that of a rock solid metapod. He moaned and squealed in pleasure, obviously never being touched this way before by Michael, it was new and it was exciting. She increased the speed of her hands, rapidly rubbing his nipples to the core. As her speed increases, so does Matthew's constant moans. The rushing of rubbing was tearing his insides apart.. He was ready to burst. In a sudden motion of pure euphoric emotion and pain, Victoria ripped Matthew's nipples off in an aggresive motion, blood and lactate juice splurged from the missing chunks on his breasts, he screamed in pleasure, shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from his small but erect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it sprayed on to Victoria's thighs, leaking into her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ almost instantaneous. They both sat bolegged apart from each other, staring intently, but happily at one another. Jason closed the door and began to shake rapidly. He was not prepared for this, and he would live with it for the rest of his life. He slumped down against the wall, his hands in his face, confusion and anger filled his body.. He would never be okay again. "

												Artwork unfleshed out. Example Hunter fires an arrow with two frames of animation, arrow lands on ground, monkey sprite disapears after half second, hunter animation is suddenly facing oposite direction walking and wearing a pack with sticks in it. Whats there is passable looking at whatever still frame you catch it but once all parts are moving you realize its a flash game with poor polish. The mechanics are unorigonal, unintuative, and bland and slow; though the game itself moves so fast that you are forced to pause it while all forms of your incredibly slow interaction tools are given time to catch up and damage controll. -Titans have 8 abilities each and atleast 2 of the 8 are combat abilities (I didnt get far enough to try two of them.)-There is no acruing of resources.-There are no forms of timers except the ocational failure timers that make you count the incredibly slow steps of your titans   even more than you do already as there is literally nothing els you can do while they are moving.-the humans are completely souless, the creators seem to think the human race can summed up in; ten skins, thirty two picture bubbles, and constant poorly executed war.-there is no goal, there is no story.-game rounds are 30 minutes... this is far to much, but thank god at the end of it you realize is over and it is impossible to win or lose so you can stop.-the interaction you do have boils down to A:s**t a brick of gold on them. B: derp some berrys or dumb animals which behave like berries into existance. C:Smash the humans with origonal donkey kong smash graphics while they two frame run back and forth.-There are no physics. This is a earth and there is no form of random physics interaction with anything.-NOTHING HAPPENS everything above is it.Wouldn't play for free, regret the $2.50.			"

												You'd think it is some form of civilization developement game at first, when it then cleverly blends into a puzzle game all about getting the highest score. Using the four giants powers to shape the planet and fill the earth with riches, the goal is to feed the settling towns and help them develop as much as possible.The skill curve involved is surprisingly large as in order to gain the highest scores you need to combine, match, remove and replace resources to maximise the bonuses on -every-single-tile-.You're basically trying to build a tower as high as possible, but having to repeatedly tear down and replace the pillars as you get stronger materials to build with, in order to build even higher.

												Reus is a strange story of contradictions. On paper it's about controlling a pack of world shaping titans, and crafting the planet to your will. Each new forest or ocean is a place to drop animals or minerals, and before too long the humans arrive like unwelcome houseguests. Caring for the pests, helping their cultures thrive becomes the mission of the titans. Theoretically that sounds liberating. Build an entire planet, shape its cities, and if they ever get a little uppity or violent, simply turning their city into a new Atlantis is always in the cards. Well, if you don't mind seeing all of your hard work go away, that is. My problem with Reus is that it's actually very restrictive. The creators had a divine plan for how various minerals and animals work to make the best bonuses, and as the game gets longer, the ability to create variety or personality vanishes. There is only ever one path to success in the later stages, and that holds Reus back from greatness.Still, it's visually pretty, and the whole power of being Gods is worth a few dollars.			"

I know there's a free play mode, but it seems like it'll take quite a lot of the timed eras to unlock everything to play that.			"

It's a fine balance increasing the abundance of natural resources without creating too much greed in your potential worshippers.

The only thing you can not controll is humanity and her whims.Observe them, spread your gifts but beware. Greed can make a human do terrible things. Even kill their mighty benefactors.

												Reus is a game that sits in a very particular niche. Though I do enjoy this game, and am recommending it, it's usually only fun in short bursts. The game involves controlling different giants (such as an ocean giant and a forest giant), using their abilities to help villages of humans settle and grow. In the regular game mode, you are given a certain amount of time (the first mode is 30 minutes) to see how far you can develop the human cultures. The game is enjoyable overall, but the giants move very slow, sometimes have long cooldowns on abilities, and, ultimately, don't do very much. The core game mechanic seems to be helping the humans build and upgrade special building, which usually just involves spamming the same resources in the area surrounding their village. The game gets repetitive very fast, has very little to offer in the long run, but is actually pretty charming and decent. As a gamer, this game gets a little boring. As a graduate student who dabbles in video game studies, this game offers some interesting mechanics to the civilization building genre, offers some interesting ideas about religion and the environment, and serves as a good experiment in different forms of game design. I wouldn't spend too much on this, and would do a good deal of research on it first.			"

												This game took me by the heart.Normally, I would dismiss such a game as a time-killing iPad app in PC clothing. But something about the charm of it lead me to anticipate its release.Reus takes everything wrong with humanity and wraps it up in an atmosphere of childish innocense--- a beautiful take on our own world and on who we are.The gameplay, smooth and accomodating, can be called puzzle-solving on analysis but does not feel that way at all; it feels like everything you do is for a reason and yields a natural consequence as in any good simulator. The challenge and reward system also makes for a heap of replayability and excitement for more to work with as you progress.My only wish is that there had been more content and greater limits to strive toward--- but that is my desire of any great game. I'm looking forward to Abbey Games' additional contributions to my library.			"

												This game is really fun. You control 4 giants that represent different elements/abilities: Water, Forest, Rock and Swamp. Using these giants you terraform a planet and create different environments for the people that come to the planet. The people build little villages and using the giants you supply them with the resources they need to grow their cities.Along the way you are given challenges from the cities which upon completing give you ambassadors, people who climb upon your giants and give them extra abilities. Depending on the type of village the person is from and which giant you choose for them to mount on you will get different abilities. Eventually the people become too greedy or confined and begin to launch war on each other or even attack the giants. A simple game that becomes quite challenging.			"

												I quite enjoy reus. It's so simple but yet complex in it's own right. It's easy to jump in to and not too too complicated like some ""city sims"" which this is and isn't at the same time. Also, I like that the ""campaign"" is set in 30 minute games where you try to achieve your goals. Keeps it fun and fresh! There is, of course, a sandbox mode as well if you'd really like to test it out and grow your villages to be more than they can be in the 30 minute spurts the main mode offers. I'd pick it up, especially if you find it on sale. My only complaint is one small issue with the camera, as it will jump from the regular view to a zoomed out planet view and sometimes when I'm just getting started and trying to multi-task I'd like to zoom out JUST A LITTLE BIT more than they allow as it just jumps to the zoomed out planet view.8/10			"

												Okay, this game got me by surprise. I got it expecting some primitive city builder and what I got was a very interesting and addictive puzzle game. Basically you use 4 giants, that are aspects of Mother Earth to create a living space for human settlers. These things you create combine and transform as you create other things beside them, giving you access to bigger and better resources, thus reaching higher and higher prosperity (essentially, highscore).The game also comes with these flavours: A comprehensive tutorial, a 30 minute game, 60 minute game, 120 minute game, complete sandbox game and built-in cheats to make your life easier AND harder, but disabling achievements.About achievements: in this game, they matter! The more achievements you unlock the better stuff you can place and transmute, you actually HAVE to hunt achievements to reach better tier stuff to place to reach the higher tier resources.It's a VERY fun little game that often leads me thinking where the past 2 hours went, it's incredibly addicting and YOU decide the pacing and path of each game.Recommended at full price, it's a gem.

												I say to myself, when I play god games, 'man, I wish I could be a proper deity and control the land, the animals, the elements- the world and allow the mortals their free will.... so that I can punish them for their hubris'. Reus is pretty much that- you have yourself some basic elements and landscape tools and use them to guide humans down the paths you want. The addition of timed matches and challenges to unlock new manipulations is brilliant because it means there are goals to strive for- and goals are essential when you're playing an almighty deity. After a few challenges and short runs of the game, you have more complicated matches, more elaborate goals, the ever-present danger of a population attempting to challenge you for a perceived slight against them. It's a game of simple controls but it's exceedingly difficult to master. Y'know, kinda like divine power would be. In a nutshell I strongly recommend Reus to any fan of God Games who wants a more involved aproach to divinity.			"

												An unexpected delight. Black & White done right. You take the role of the planet in your quest to make yourself prosper through (ideally) sustainable ecosystems. There's quite a bit of depth to explore here, thankfully the depth gets rolled out at a decent, graspable pace. Play sessions are actually divided up into different time blocks - basically get as much done in the selected time period as possible and see if you can unlock some achievements to further expand the game.Highly recommended. Give me those sweet, sweet Steam achievements!			"

The premise of the game is you control 4 giants and for 30 minutes you have to use these giants to help build and grow the world. Each time you play the game gives you new objectives to work on, which are the achievements. You can unlock more time as you do the objectives. Right now I have 60 minutes unlocked enabling me to do more. This game is all about unlocking new things, upgrades, and time.

												Reus is a world-building simulation style game, where your god-like interaction with the world is done by way of four giant monoliths with magical powers. You and your four vast minions will help grow small settlements of nomads into bustling village-sized cities, providing the citizens with enough resources to survive, expand and thrive. At first glance Reus seems like a very small and simple god game done a thousand times before, but upon further inspection the game reveals a huge level of complexity that is both shocking and fantastically deep.Reus only really has one real gameplay mode – Era . The aim of Era is to work towards completing all of the available achievements in the game, and Reus serves up a generous dose of replayability with a staggering 120-odd levels to grapple with. This replayability is thanks in no small part to the curious way in which you control the lives of your nomads.The mysterious Planet of the Creepy Giants is an artistic 2D slice of barren rock onto which the environments, plants, animals and minerals are spawned from your giant helpers, and the lack of space means efficiency is key. A village might start a project to complete a school or church, and it’s up to you to find the space to squeeze in the mind-numbing amount of food, wealth or technology the project requires. Enter symbiosis,the mechanic where every object your giants summon has the potential to interact with nearly any other object in the game and every base object has about 4 – 6 different ways to evolve.Reus is a very pretty game to play, if a little repetitive at times. Your 2D slice of planet-pie has a 3D-like surface. The game’s major weakness is the lack of art assets, borne from its small development roots. When every blueberry bush and snake den has the same picture, a row of the same resource breaks the immersion of world-building somewhat, and replaces it with a slightly lesser world-assembly feel instead, and this jarring sensation does hurt the feeling of power and mastery a good god game strives for.Similarly due to the small team the game was built by, the other major weakness Reus suffers is a poor user interface. The graphics options allow users with poor eyesight to change the resolution to the lowest settings, but even when all the icons and fonts are as large as possible the tutorial text proves impossible to read without 20/20 vision. The few controls the player has on-screen are so minimal and unnoticeable, the tooltips and hotkets are in approximately font size 6. While such a minor graphical issue might go unnoticed by the majority of players, Reus is almost certainly not appropriate for players with less than perfect eyesight.That said, once the game gets going and the Era progressing, Reus has a huge amount to offer to keep a player engaged. All of the players’ efforts are focussed on pleasing the tiny humans who settle in your lovingly planned environments, and when your forest-dwelling humans plan to open up a world-class mine there are a few options before you, depending on what sort of god you want to be. You could form a large amount of forest-based minerals around the tiny village, terraform a forest into a mountainside landscape or just burn the village down and hope the next squad of settlers aren’t as greedy. A word of warning, however – if a new village settles amongst in a land of plenty, they are much more likely to become greedy and violent.Weaknesses aside, Reus is a new twist on a god game with a huge amount of gameplay behind it for those who can bear their way through the slightly arduous tutorial. It offers at least 30 hours of entertaining god play, with the ability to command your mountainous workers to bless or crush human villages as you see fit, and that is no bad thing.7/10			"

												Got this while looking for a God-game, it's more a elemental-gods-create-a-perfect-village-to-build-a-structure-and-keeps-the-other-villagers-from-invading-game. If you ever wanted an actual reason to get achievements in a video game, this game gives it to you. Animals, plants, and minerals are locked until you get a certain achievement which gets a little annoying when your university or observatory is about to be completed when the deadline hits. Oh yeah, there's a deadline for games too, half an hour to a few hours. I liked it, nuff said.			"

												Reus is an interesting and quant god game, with a unique world view and control of 4 giants that require teamwork to make the world better place. Although not easy at first the game has a deep complexity within it, that rewards the use of intelligent symibosis. The charm of the giants and the details within the townspeople add quite a lot to thee enjoyment factor of the game(if you have the mad scientist completed and you look at the village, you will notice that zombies walk around the town). However there are some faults, aside from era and freestyle there is not much variety within the game,this is even more sad considering the fact that Abbey Games has stated that they are not expanding or otherwise doing anything with the game, because of the new game that they are creating. Also the fact that many plants, animals, and minerals are locked until you do acheivments really puts a damper on going freestyle without grinding some random eras. In summary, despite its faults Reus is still an amazing game with unique charm and complexity and i would recommend it to any patient person wanting a breath of fresh air in gaming.			"

												A fun little indy take on the ""god"" genre. Although the time limit is frustrating at first it really makes one strive to accomplish much in a limited time period and makes the game slightly more competative. When you finally manage to unlock the extra time limit options, as well as achieving the complicating tasks within these limits it is in many ways more satisfying than in previous god games I've played.Of course one must accept that a game this size has a limited AI and the downside of the time limit is that the game really does force the player to have to replay so many times to be able to try out the different giants abilities and how they best combine that I found the game to be best experienced in on and off periods rather than sitting for several hours straight.Still, one can't complain for the meger price of 10 euro!

												Reus is a world builder sim in the most literal sense.  You begin with several giants representing different aspects of nature and raise mountains, spawn oceans, and cover the world with flora and fauna.  Deceptively simple gameplay on the surface gives way to layers of complexity as you attempt to create a world upon which humanity can thrive.  Symbiotic chains make or break villages as you attempt to give the people what they need.Games have a 30 minute time limit at first, with longer games unlockable.  The time flies with this one.  An amazing game that I would recommend to anyone enjoying puzzles.			"

												A world building game where you control giants to give natural resources to the environment, (plants, animals, minerals). As you place them, they provide food, wealth, and technology to the people of the world. Placing the right combination of resources can increase the benefits greatly (some animals are better next to mines, while others excel if near plants, for example)As your villages develop, trying to meet their needs can become challenging, especially if they begin warring with each other, or even attack your giants if they become too greedy. Keeping everything in balance becomes more and more challenging. Meeting goals within a 1 or 2 hour timed game will unlock rewards, and if you like you can continue playing after the time expires, or start over with a new world and try to achieve different goals.Overall, a very fun simulation/god game for the price.

												A game with simple rules yet complex emergent gameplay. Effectively a puzzle game in genre, it feels like playing a game of Civilization with no AIs -- you control everything, and must make an optimal empire as rapidly as possible. So far, the early game has been defined by simple puzzles phrased as demands by your cities (city X wants 30 food to build a granary!), with each city having all the space it wants and being basically independent. The next phase appears to be more space-crunched, and I expect puzzles of the ""satisfy both cities with limited, overlapping land"" sort to become prominent. A good value in the Humble Indie Bundle, or for a couple bucks on its own.			"

												A lot of fun to be had in the simple, but challenging God simulation game. You won't regret your purchase. While playability may vary from player to player, for myself, it's something I can come back to from time to time and play an hour or two. Great casual game to have in your library for a very cheap price, especially when it's on sale.			"

												Reus is a very interesting game. You have to learn to balance your villages and manage your Giants quite well in order to succeed. Many people complain about how the Giants move so slow, but I think it adds strategy to the game. You have to think: ""Is there anything else I need to do with this Giant before I move him all the way to the other side of the planet?"" I think it is a very nice game, something that you can play when you need to kill time and feel rewarded and satisfied, rather than want  to play something serious.8/10			"

												Foremost, anyone who hasn't played the game for at least 3 hours hasn't played it. This is quite simply the case. The game expands, and deepens, and becomes simultaneously easier and harder as you go. From what I judge is a good 1/3 to 1/2 of the way towards the fullest, deepest parts of the game (this based on my achievement progress -- which seems thus far to be directly tied to the ""skill tree,"" if you will, that unlocks new Giant upgrades and longer, more varied game modes), I have to say that I'm quite pleasantly impressed. I was drawn to the game by its artistic look and its unique mechanic -- and more than a couple fond memories of Black and White -- and I am beheld a fascinating, endearing, and from time to time backstabbingly painful, altogether simple and beautiful experience. It was a great impulse buy - I've certainly gotten my $3 or so out of it already, and I doubt I'm done with it yet. Fully recommend.			"

												If you enjoy playing highly goal-oriented strategy games in short bursts, planning out and thinking about the game alot before your even start, and accept ingame randomness that you have no control over, then this game can bring you hours of enjoyment. Reus has problems, but the core gameplay is in my opinion worth the irritation of the programming and design shortcomings. It's casual friendly and it can be played without having to dedicate huge stretches of time. You can put in 30 minutes or down for a 6 hour session and accomplish something either way.Reus is the very definition of an achievement hunter game, where your game mode choices are a set timed level or the free play option. It's very important to understand this, because your enjoyment depends on your approach to the game. In Reus you play either a 30-, 60- or 120-minute round with a gameplan decided before you even start for unlocking predetermined achievements, then you end that round and start anew. There's no grand strategy per se, you don't build anything to last. If you can accept this and adjust, you can have some really enjoyable times with Reus and I would highly recommend it to you.This point needs to be reiterated: you will have to be going for achievements. There's no choice, really. You unlock the stuff you build through clearing them, meaning if you don't bother with them then you *will not* progress in the game. It's designed around that concept, of doing one or a set of achievements per run.Some achievements are really tricky, and if you're partial to that kind of stuff you will definately find some of these challenges to your liking!If you're looking for a Civilization-, Sim City- or Paradox Interactive-style game, this is not it. Unless you do a ""free play"" run, your upgrade limit to your four giants, your builders, means you *have* to specialize in one or two areas. You will not be able to min-max your towns, but with time running out fast you wouldn't be able to anyway. Decide what you want out of that run and specialize your giants to achieve that goal.Once you've unlocked everything, however, there's a ""free play"" option that allows you to get every upgrade to your giants. You could easily spend 15-20 hours min-maxing a huge world that way, and absolutely love it! Problem is, the people who don't give a damn about achievements are forced to sit through hours upon hours of achievement hunting to get there, and the people who only care about achievements are done by that point.Additionally, a large part of the game has been randomized for some reason, from the quality of upgrades to your buildings (applying aspects to natural resources) to where your peoples build their towns and what projects they undertake. Having them place a town one, two or three spaces wrong can be a huge source of irritation, and it will lead to ""save-load-load-load""-situations for the OCD crowd of gamers. Also, town projects give bonuses, sometimes really good and sometimes really useless depending on what kind of run you're going for. So if you've upgraded your giants for the plant and/or mineral tech tree and your towns insist on making animal projects, then you can either destroy the town and hope the next one will build in the same spot as well as hope they make another project, or you can just say ""screw it"" and make the project to just not waste even more time. If someone tells you that the game encourages adjustment to your peoples' randomness, they're lying. There's no adjusting in the game, because once you've upgraded a giant, it's not going to change. You get four upgrades per giant, and to get the best buildings available for each game mode time frame, you need to know beforehand what to go for. Runs get very messy very quick, and if you see the randomness as ruining your plans, you should stay away. If you look at it as just another layer of added difficulty, it's surmountable.When it comes to some of the more technical problems with the game, know that windowed mode tends to crash the game eventually. The game also has weird crashing problems when trying to move the window from one screen to the other. Also, the ingame text does not scale well and can become hard to read. The game can also stop working from too much happening at once, or sometimes just from having been running for too long, so make sure to have auto save active and frequently save manually. You will also notice ingame bugs happening once in a while, like your giants getting stuck and become unresponsive after trying to do an action. Just save and reload and they'll start working again. Also, sometimes your giants attacks against angry mobs or armies won't work, and that can have dire consequences for your runs, but I've found no way of rectifying this other than reloading an older save and hoping the town won't send out that army or angry mob again.In conclusion: I mostly enjoyed playing Reus, partly because I'm a huge fan of strategy games where you build and develop your surroundings. It's a flawed game, however, with bugs, randomness and imbalances that can bog down an otherwise great run. However, for me, the upsides and the good times outweighed the bad.			"

												Fun simple game with few glitches. It's worth a couple bucks. Only downsides are no fast forward option, gets old fast as theres not as much variety as you would think, and you are forced to play with a 30minute time limit to unlock new stuff instead of being able to go straight into sandbox mode. It can be annoying restarting every 30minutes. The time limit goes up later but it's still irritating. Besides this, the game has a very nice atmosphere to it and is rather fun to play casually while relaxing. Be warned though it may feel more complicated than you would think at the beginning.			"

												This is a game that's well under-rated. It's not a Black and White style god game, so you cannot go into this game expecting that.  Reus is about transforming the world to help humans achieve projects, and in turn unlock new rewards. Its a game of transformation and optimization. The ""campaign"" consists of 30 minute, 60 minutes, and 120 minute plays. To unlock the higher timed modes, you have to complete aforementioned projects, and unlock developments. I found that unlocking developments can be done just by playing - it was harder to try to target a specific development. While that makes the game sound easy on its face, the true fun of Reus is in its complex symbiosis system. Everything in Reus interacts with the world differently. Blueberries and Chickens will form a symbiosis, and grant more powerful combinations than any one on its own. Reus' challenge is to discover how plants, animals, and minerals work together to form food, wealth, and technology - the three primary resources for completing projects. The symbiosis system is constructed upon the interlocking resources each giant can uniquely create, the varied aspects each giant has to augment a resource's innate power, and the upgrading of a resource to a more powerful tier. These three factors mean the Reus world is constantly changing, and as a player the challenge is to adapt your world so that greater unlocks can be achieved. It is not possible to succeed relaying on any one giant, or on any combination of basic resources and aspects. Added to this are additional, secondary, factors. Natura, danger, and awe augment how some resources act and how human villages respond to the world. These secondary factors are just that, secondary. I've played several games without any awe or danger, but in those games the humans became greedy and went to war with each other, or would attack the giants. As these challenges arise, the giants are equipped with a couple destructive powers. I feel Reus is amazingly well balanced, and no playthrough will be the same twice. The game has a large number of symbiotic combinations to discover, and as the player acheives new developments, new resources are unlocked. I would remind any new players to use the spacebar, and take the time to plan your developments. A 30 minute game seems like a short period of time, but one can easily spend several minutes planning a move, and a few seconds letting the game unpause to complete that before pausing again to plan. I'll end with the only significant negative: at time of writing, Reus does not have Steam Cloud support! This bothers me the most, because I feel Reus is a game where a single ""profile"" or sorts is best. Because so much time can be spent crafting an optimal world, I don't relish the thought of re-unlocking developments whenever I migrate from my desktop to laptop. As a casual game, Reus needs cloud savegame support. Regardless, I highly recommend Reus. Don't let its seeming simplicity fool you.			"

												Reus is an interesting little god game that came out recently. Since I enjoy god games, I decided to pick it up, and I was not disappointed. Behind the cute, aesthetic and deceptively simple interface is a surprisingly deep game that will suck hours out of your day.The premise of Reus is that you are mother earth, in command of four giants: the Rock Giant, Swamp Giant, Ocean Giant and Forest Giant. Your goal is to foster and build human civilization through the interaction of these Giants and their powers.When you start a new game, you go through The Beginning mode. Here, through three Eras, you are taught the basics of how to manipulate the world, attract settlers and grow your community. Once you complete this tutorial, you are then presented with Era mode, where the main game lies. Here you progress from 30-minute game modes to 60-minutes to 120-minutes as you unlock developments, such as building certain projects or reaching a certain population goal. There is also a freestyle mode where you can play as long as you want, but you will not gain any achievements.What is surprisingly compelling about Reus is how its simplicity leads to some pretty deep choices in regards to how you terraform and build your civilization. For instance, if you want a desert civilization you will need to create a mountain which spawns desert tiles next to it. However, if there is an ocean nearby and the mountain is not directly next to it, you will have forest tiles popping up instead. Plants and animals have certain synergies that can only be applied when next to a specific organism. For example, snakes give out additional gold if they are next to smaller animals. To add, the various resources can also be upgraded, or transmuted as the game calls it, to new and different resources; for instance, stone can be transmuted into salt or copper, each giving different resources. These transmutations are only possible through completing projects set out by villages. How it works is that depending on the villages (there are three types: desert, forest and swamp), each gives their own ambassador, which in turn unlocks specific abilities for each of your giants. Certain abilities even require multiple types of ambassadors, but Giants cannot have a monopoly on them so it is going to take some stratagem on your part to decide how you want to develop your villages.The villages themselves add another layer to the game. If they get too greedy, they may start attacking other villages. You can prevent this by either easing up on how many resources you give them, or increasing their danger level through planting dangerous animals in their territory. The former is tricky because if you do not handle their concerns they may turn on you and start attacking the Giants. The latter requires some caution as well, for if you increase their threat too much, the village will slowly die off. Some projects even ask you to destroy other villages using your Giants’ powers, which lead to the conundrum of whether the end justifies the means, depending on how developed the targeted village is and whether you had another development to achieve in mind.Reus, in the end, is a very charming and addictive god game, and at under $10, it is practically a steal. If you are in the mood to be a world of your own, do not hesitate to pick up Reus.(Taken from my submitted review for the Boropulse.com) "

												This is the resource management part of Civ on crack. This game makes you manage growth and forces you to think long-term, and the ambassador system complements that well. The variety of possible resource combinations and the ""platformer"" aesthetic is a combination that takes some getting used to, as well as the unique interface of using 4 giants to do anything. But once you get the hang of it, it's very easy to get hooked into hour-long games. The achievements challenge you with different playstyles, and helps keep a high replay value. Very fun game, worth a try.			"

												A very enjoyable puzzle/god game. It manages to blend casual atmosphere and a surprising degree of strategy together seamlessly, while still remaining fun to play. The look and feel of the game is lovely. Reus manages to be both a challenging and relaxing experience simultaneously, and I recommend it highly.Der 2D-Grafikstyle des Spiels ist wunderbar. Alles ganz fein gezeichnet und liebevoll animiert. Überhaupt hat dies Spiel einen ganz eigenen Character des Aussehens. Für mich eine gänzlich neue Erfahrung-Das Spiel ist eine Mischung aus Godgame, Aufbau- und Strategie. Strategisch von der Seite her - man sollte genau schauen, das man zueinander passende Produkte auf der Erde plaziert, wie z.B. Beeren, und genau darauf Hühner. Dies gibt noch einmal einen ExtraBonus in der Erzeugung von Nahrungsgütern.			"

Overall, a fun game for the price, would recommend.			"

												In games like Reus, replay value needs to be high. Sadly, my experience with Reus in this regard has proven to be poor. While fun to play, the game requires constant resetting to start a new ""world"". Given the amount of times Reus requires this, the content should be much greater and less dull. Building a world requires quite a lot of effort and once time runs out, players are essentially forced to start over from scratch to reach new goals. I can see this system working for some, but for me it only serves to frustrate. Since the game is fun and worthwhile for a decent amount of time I'm giving it a 7.5 out of 10 instead of lower. Get it during a sale is my advice.			"

												I've been playing this for just under 3 hours, and I have to say, it's an very well engineered indie game! Think of it as a cute, toned-down version of Civilization. You control 4 elemental giants (Forest, Water, Swamp and Rock - that basically looks like Groot) that ultimately build up a down-scaled version of Earth. You choose your time limit and see how you get on. It's addictive, HOWEVER there can be a waiting time for the giants to make their next movement - namely travelling. The game has human-based objectives set out too, which need to be met within a time limit. These usually require the basics of food, wealth and tech. If you're happy juggling all that info and playing an easy-going game with elements of ""god-gaming"", I recommend.			"

												Reus is simple enough to get into for a casual half-hour game here and there, but if you are a big fan of strategy games then the resource development trees offer enough complexity to keep you coming back to better your scores and get more achievements (unlocking more things to place/build). I hit a wall after about 8 hours when I first started playing Reus and left it alone for a while (a recent splurge meant I had other exciting new titles to switch to). It was a few months before I came back. I found the Walkthrough page on wiki.reusgame.com gave me enough pointers on my return to properly get into more advanced town-building tactics, focussing on using the symbiotic relationships a bit better. I do still have to pause the game a lot to check reference charts, but with regular playing they're becoming more familiar.I am a big fan of strategy games, and I think if you're not then your interest in Reus may be short lived. Except that I guess if you like god-games for the ""Release Godzilla!"" type of actions, then Reus will allow you to build a world and then watch it burn in a variety of ways. And what an attractive looking world it can be.			"

Grinding to unlock some of the natural sources can take a while, and the random choices of projects is annoying when you only have a few left to atttain...Interesting take on a god game, specialisations and projects leave you thinking about how to lay everything out to lead to the highest prosperity whilst also trying to avoid greed... Tea is overpowered, which is nice since I drink so much myself.Remember to enable beta and use the advanced options for the tiny (50 plots) and large (150 plots). Needs some polishing in the descriptions of specialisations and bringing everything into consistency, but doesn't detract from the game.			"

												A Really Zen, relaxed, casual, slow-paced, god game. Grow some nature, turn a dead rock into a cozy♥♥♥♥♥garden of eve, watch humanity flourish.You basically command four Titans to carry out your orders and use their MS paint powers over nature to cultivate your own world. The humans just sort of work with it, provide you with power and upgrades, and everybody is happy- oh wait, no. If you provide too much the humans can get greedy and kill each other, attack your titans, and be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... so watch it.Surprisingly a very fun, addictive, and satisfying game- lacks real depth though and is pretty straight forward. Reall just feels like a ""well done"" iphone game.Currently there are only about Five different environments: Ocean, Desert, Forest, swamp, mountain (with specific resources for each) and only three different types of ""Villages"": Forest, desert and swamp. Game would benefit in the long term with a little more diversity and more content.At 10 dollars though it's DEFINITELY worth a purchase. Especially if you enjoyed the Black and White Series, doodle god, or have a soft spot for nature.			"

												This game took me by the heart.Normally, I would dismiss such a game as a time-killing iPad app in PC clothing. But something about the charm of it lead me to anticipate its release.Reus takes everything wrong with humanity and wraps it up in an atmosphere of childish innocense--- a beautiful take on our own world and on who we are.The gameplay, smooth and accomodating, can be called puzzle-solving on analysis but does not feel that way at all; it feels like everything you do is for a reason and yields a natural consequence as in any good simulator. The challenge and reward system also makes for a heap of replayability and excitement for more to work with as you progress.My only wish is that there had been more content and greater limits to strive toward--- but that is my desire of any great game. I'm looking forward to Abbey Games' additional contributions to my library.			"

												Reus is far from a bad game, but it is very difficult to actively recommend it. From personal experience during the first four hours of so I had an absolute blast trying out different combinations of powers and land types. It's quite enjoyable to unlock new structures and lands that can then help you achieve further unlocks.Unfortunately there is a mechanic where towns will actively go to war if they suddenly get too many resources, and if ther aren't any towns to attack they will prey on your titans. At first this was a nice challenge and forced me to try to up danger levels as well put the titans other skills to use. However when building upgrades are on a time limit you're forced into the position of increasing resources and boundaries, but then if the resources you need don't produce danger you have to put up with beating down warring jackasses for the next couple of minutes until they finally simmer down.It is unbelivably frustrating and it is unfortunate because up until that moment it was a fun game. Perhaps there was some secret method or technique I hadn't discerned to make the game less aggravating in the longer modes? I think it bears repeating that Reus is looks amazing and the general gameplay is interesting and enjoyable - up to a point. You will at least wring a few hours out of it, but if you're a completionist you will have to weather some extremely trying mechanics.			"

												A puzzle like god game that's all about synergizing your different powers and resources to help the planet and its people flourish. Its slow paced and can be challenging at times but can also be very fun and relaxing in the right mindset. It keeps you from progressing until certain achievements are met so you’ll be playing through it multiple times if you want to see everything. A single game is only played in either a thirty or sixty minute “Era” though so that's not a problem.  Reus is a good purchase if you’re looking for something simple you can pick up and play whenever without a huge time investment.			"

												Reus is a sim game where you control four giants capable of terraforming the planet to make it a place where human villages can thrive. But, if you give them too much, they may turn against each other or against you. Each time you play, your progress will allow you to build bigger, better things the next time around.I love these types of sim games, and I've had a ton of fun with Reus. I love trying to figure out the best way to give my village as much food as possible so they can build the next upgrade in the small amount of space they have. There are many ways to go about playing, and lots of viable strategies. Greed can make the game tough at times, though, because some of the villages will gain greed without provocation and start burning other villages down, which gets annoying at times.The graphics are simple and colorful, and they do their job well. The sound and music are fine. The game controls fairly well. My biggest criticism against this game is that the tech tree is pretty complex, and there's no way to pull up a map of it inside the game.If you like sim games or slower-paced strategy games, Reus is definitely worth buying.

												This is a great little game! I found this on a really good sale the other night and have gotten more than my moneys worth. It's not rediculously difficult by any means but it's not as comedic and silly as I was expecting. There is a slight learning curve because it is a game of balances. Everything you use as a giant has another piece that will counteract or enhance the first. By having this systems, Reus becomes more of a puzzle game than a true ""GOD"" game. You will have to experiment with many different systems to create a perfect world. If you are looking only for a game where you hurl fireballs at innocent villagers, this may not be the game for you. I would recommend this for someone who is looking for a sharp cartoonish looking, casual, world building game. My only complaint is that there is no controller support. The controls are fairly basic and could translate easily to a gamepad. With the way this game looks, I would love to sit on the couch after work and play via Big Picture.			"

												A fascinating little god sim. The amount of strategy and thinking needed to maintain and upgrade villages is so wonderfully complex that it took me hours just to get the hang of it. Slow paced, never frustrating, and with dozens of resources and projects to unlock, this should keep any achievement hunter busy to a long time.			"

												Reus is a fun ""little"" game.Little an understatement. the amout of depth this game has may not seen my all and certainly at first glance. The premise of the game is you have the control over four giants. Sea, Nature, Rock and swamp (for some reason). Each giant has his own unique abilities. combining these abilities is essential as combining certain elements provides you with better prosperity that humanity uses to complete building projects. completing these projects brings ambasadors. these ambasadors provide new skills for your giants or upgrades it's current depending on which ambasador you wish to give to which giant.May people overlook the potential of this game and the tutorial barely even gives you slightly less information than you need to know to really understand what you're doing the first ""real"" game you play.At the start of the game itself you're forced to play the tutorial itself, these are about basic navigation, how to complete building projects and what to do when a town gets too greedy.after the tutorial you unlock the half hour game. when you've completed enouth in-game (and steam) achievements you unlock one hour games and after some more achievements the two hour games. Many achievements are achieved rather easily, although some of the harder ones really test your skills as the controller of the giants. thus making this game one of those easy to learn hard to master games.all in all i would say that this game is worth the money and certainly the time. the game has beautiful and clean graphics, an easy interface that is quite inviting and gameplay that keeps challenging you.

												A fun indie god/creator style game that is refreshingly new in the way of gameplay and graphics, inspired by the likes of Civilization but also by the Binding of Isaac in some retrospects. Playing as up to four diffrent god-like beings, to create a new world for humanity to settle, it makes for a refreshing and relaxing game, occasioanlly stressful if you've bitten off more that you can chew as humanity develops out of control. An enjoyable and fun game to sink many hours of your life.			"

												Reus is a world builder sim in the most literal sense.  You begin with several giants representing different aspects of nature and raise mountains, spawn oceans, and cover the world with flora and fauna.  Deceptively simple gameplay on the surface gives way to layers of complexity as you attempt to create a world upon which humanity can thrive.  Symbiotic chains make or break villages as you attempt to give the people what they need.Games have a 30 minute time limit at first, with longer games unlockable.  The time flies with this one.  An amazing game that I would recommend to anyone enjoying puzzles.			"

												Reus is an interesting and quant god game, with a unique world view and control of 4 giants that require teamwork to make the world better place. Although not easy at first the game has a deep complexity within it, that rewards the use of intelligent symibosis. The charm of the giants and the details within the townspeople add quite a lot to thee enjoyment factor of the game(if you have the mad scientist completed and you look at the village, you will notice that zombies walk around the town). However there are some faults, aside from era and freestyle there is not much variety within the game,this is even more sad considering the fact that Abbey Games has stated that they are not expanding or otherwise doing anything with the game, because of the new game that they are creating. Also the fact that many plants, animals, and minerals are locked until you do acheivments really puts a damper on going freestyle without grinding some random eras. In summary, despite its faults Reus is still an amazing game with unique charm and complexity and i would recommend it to any patient person wanting a breath of fresh air in gaming.			"

												I have to admit, when I first started playing this game, I was put off by it. It seemed to be clunky, at best. However, now that I've gone through it a few times and have unlocked more options, I have to say that I've grown quite fond of the game.The game plays out in a challenge session that's going to be different each time you play, either by chance of the people or by how you build your world. One thing that I really enjoy about the game is that you learn about things as they unlock so that you can get used to things and memorize how to build things. If not, the in game unlock library helps you out between sessions.Overall, this is definitely something that can easily take up a couple hours of my time in one sitting. Thumbs up.			"

												Checking out the trailer of this game, you'd think ""Oh, it's just like that GodFinger[en.wikipedia.org] app!""  GodFinger and Reus both allow you to manipulate your world as a deity and watch how your people will react to your actions.  You can make land formations or cast down destruction.  However, unlike GodFinger, Reus is more of a strategy and puzzle game.  For me, this was a disappointment as I could not build entirely what I wanted as the quests expected something else of me.  I probably will not pick this up again anytime soon.			"

												I was on the edge about recommending this title but the lack of a good in-game guide of the resources really makes playing it more arduous than it should be. The advanced achievements require huge synergy bonuses.

												This game is really fun. You control 4 giants that represent different elements/abilities: Water, Forest, Rock and Swamp. Using these giants you terraform a planet and create different environments for the people that come to the planet. The people build little villages and using the giants you supply them with the resources they need to grow their cities.Along the way you are given challenges from the cities which upon completing give you ambassadors, people who climb upon your giants and give them extra abilities. Depending on the type of village the person is from and which giant you choose for them to mount on you will get different abilities. Eventually the people become too greedy or confined and begin to launch war on each other or even attack the giants. A simple game that becomes quite challenging.			"

												Well this game was a lot more involved than I was expecting. You have 4 giants, and each one has one main skill (terraforming).  Forest makes forests, Water makes oceans, Rock makes mountains/desert, Swamp makes swampland. Then each one can make plants, animals, or mineral deposits. Each thing you place interacts with other things you can place, to give bonuses. When a town forms in each area (desert, forest, swamp), they start a project objective you have to help them meet by adding more things to get their scores up. If you win, you get an ambassador, which opens new upgrade options. Then each thing previously placed can be upgraded. Those upgrades interact with each thing differently than the original, so you change all of your bonuses each time you change something. As you go along the projects get more difficult. That can make for a lot of different play combinations.The 30 minute games advance you, but I have not worked through those yet. I wanted to do some free play to figure out how everything worked together first. There is definitely plenty of game play for days, here. It's a good game to fiddle with and then save to come back to. Once you become familiar with the rules, you can then alter things further with game options (e.g., world size, ""speed play"", and ""no pause"") to challenge yourself further.			"

												A cautious recommendation. I do enjoy this game, but it's just not enticing me to come back to it. An overview of the gameplay first. Reus is a game where you control several giants who can terraform the land, with the ability to create things like forests, oceans, mountains, deserts, etc. Once you create one of these areas, nomads will move in and settle cities. Once these nomads are settled, you need to nurse them by giving them food, wealth, and science, while trying to stop them from getting greedy and having wars.Every ""biome"" has a different type of city. For example, forests house cities that require food to grow. Deserts create cities that require wealth, and swamp cities require science, or knowledge. Each giant specializes in one of things. The forest giant can make bushes and trees for food, the rock giant can create minerals for wealth, and the swamp giant makes herbs for science. The water giant can make animals, which contribute to food. Most giants can do something for each of these. The rock giant can create minerals for science, the swamp giant animals for wealth.Cities need these things to build ""projects"", which allow them to expand. These projects have time limits in which you need to get a certain amount of food, science, or wealth. Every project you finish rewards you with one of the cities' respective ambassadors. These ambassadors unlock (or power up) abilities of your giants.Giants have more abilities then just creating bushes or minerals; they can also infuse things with certain attributes. Some attributes raise the food of bushes, or the science of minerals. There are three strengths of attributes, normal, potent and greater. Some of these tile improvements can transmute into better versions once they are infused with a certain attribute. Blueberries can transmute into strawberries, strawberries into pear trees. The greater transmutations require stronger attributes.So with transmutations out of the way, there is another important mechanic about tile improvements. This is called symbiosis. Symbiosis is something that raises the amount of food/wealth/science an improvement gives under certain conditions. Some minerals give double wealth when near another mineral, some animals give extra food while near berries. This is extremely important, considering you only have a small amount of tiles in the city to work with. You need to take advantage of this to maximize the city's resources.You do not want to make a city too large too fast, though, because then they'll get greedy. When cities get greedy, they are going to start wars with other civlizations, and potentially destroy them. They might also start to take your giants for granted and attack them. Don't worry though, because the swamp and rock giants have attacks. You can use these attacks to destory armies, riots, and even cities themselves if they become problems. There are a couple of ways to regulate greed in this game. The first is to very slowly give them resources. Their greed is raised when the number of resources they have available is higher then the amount of resources they are currently using by 20.The second way is to infuse animals near the city with the attribute of danger. Certain amounts of danger with stop their greed from rising completely. Be careful, though, because too much danger will cause the city to slowly die.If their greed does rise, you can simply humiliate them by dealing damage to the city to lower their greed. Make sure your attacks won't kill them, though.Something you might have noticed from the overview of the game is that it is about keeping balance. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it gets kind of slow sometimes. I found myself waiting quite a bit for their resources in use to rise so I could return to optimizing my tile improvements, without them getting greedy. This is a very casual game. The meat of it is trying to develop the cities certain ways in a 30/60 minute time limit to get new transmutations and achievements. If you are the kind of person who seeks out to have every unlockable in the game, then this isn't too bad. I personally didn't quite like it, but I do enjoy unlocking the new transmutations, which let you make your cities bigger from the larger boosts they give, allowing you to get larger achievements.My main problem with the game is that I never really had a drive to play it more. I do enjoy this game, and whenever I play it I have fun, but I feel like I haven't got anything worthwhile left to do. The transmutations, which I am interested in unlocking, do not say what you need to do to get them, like the achievements do. I'd assume that getting an achievement also unlocks a corresponding transmutation, but this seems kind of inconsistent for me. Another thing I really don't like is that you can't see how much time you have left for your particular game. As I've said before, you can choose between a 30 minute session and a 60 minute one. You can also play an unlimited game with no time limit, but this doesn't contribute to your achievements. At the end of the time limit, your giants will go to sleep one by one. This is really annoying, because the time it takes and the order they go to sleep is all random. Many times I need to place just one improvement or one transmutation when the giant I need goes to sleep, resulting in me having to start a whole other game for the achievement I was just about to get. There are lots of things I like about this game, though. I always enjoy keeping balance between two greedy cities, or working to optimize my tile improvements to help the civilization with their projects. In conclusion, this is a fun game that is just too casual to be fully recommended. There are a few problems I have with the game that takes away from the experience, but if this sounds like something for you, go right on ahead. There's lots of ways to develop your cities, so each game stays pretty fresh, although sometimes the requirements of the achievements are quite limiting.  "

												Story:There is a theme, but not really a story, which is fine for this game. You are the planet, and you control four sentient giants that place resources to develop villages and unlock new resources. Presumably after your giants fall asleep, the world keep developing and at some point annihilate each other through thermonuclear war, which is why you wake up to a wasteland each time.Gameplay:I think Reus' mechanics stand out as the reason why I would come back to this game. There is a race against time to get as much prosperity as you can, but grow a village too fast and it will get greedy. On top of that, random developments means there is never one cookie cutter ""best"" option, and the ambassador system gives you the hard choice of picking which upgrades you want (and which ones you forsake).Having said that, I dislike the progression system, where you have to get achievements to unlock higher level resources. Playing two hours to unlock one achievement so you can use the resource that it unlocks to play another two hours to unlock another achievement is not fun. It is possible to get all of the achievements with a minimal number of well-planned playthroughs, but a casual player will not accomplish this.UI/Controls:The controls work fine, but the camera can be a pain to manage at times, and it would be a lot better if there was an option to queue up commands. One pain point for me is that the game doesn't tell me which high level natural resources I have access to and what they do until I actually transmute into them, so I often found myself alt-tabbing between the game and the online wiki (which has quite a few errors) when planning what to build.Graphics/Audio:Not much to say here. There's some pleasant background music to listen to as you play, and the animal sprites can be fun to watch if you zoom in enough.Replayability:I have mixed feelings on this. On the one hand, the game mechanics around developments means that each playthrough will be different, and you can make it even more different if you choose different ambassador setups. Also, the one-hour challenges that appear after you unlock all of the achievements are a reason to keep at the game. However, after playing through the 2-hour era a couple of times, I felt that the minor variations in each playthrough were not enough of an interesting new experience to keep me playing.Summary:I would cautiously recommend this game to people who like god games. People who like optimization in games will enjoy the mechanics of this game, but otherwise the slow progression system will likely cause players to burn out.			"

												Reus plays almost like a card game. The planet is split into tiny sections were you can place your 'cards' (plants, animals or minerals) and these differ depending on the land type they're placed on (swamp, forest, desert, mountain and sea). These ""cards"" for my analogies sake, work in combination with those surrounding, either the section next to it, a highlighted range around it or the village's range. Together they give bonuses to one another and give your villages their resources.You are the planet and you help the villagers using your giant avatars. The villagers will want resources for projects, complete these and your giant can pick them up, unlocking a skill. These skills can be used to transform the 'cards' you've put down into more advanced or specialised 'cards' making the combos etc more complex. You can unlock the advanced and specialised cards by completing achievements in the game. Your villagers will get greedy if you spoil them however and destroy other villages through war. You don't have a faction, you gain skills by having villages of different land types so you want to keep everyone flourishing. To try and keep your greedy villages at bay you have to provide them with dangers that keep them occupied in the form of predators or dangerous mines etc but this is quite difficult and occasionally you may need to intervene with your giants. Villages may turn on you and attack your giants if they are unhappy, not in enough awe of the giants or just greedy but eventually enough pummeling will set them straight.As well as unlocking more of the advanced/specialised 'cards' to place you will also unlock longer play time as well. So each time you play you start of with a dead planet but have a few more tricks up your sleave allowing you to advance farther quicker and with more time in which to do it. After a few goes it felt like I was playing the same game over and over but depending on your villager's projects depends on what you place, how your planet looks and which skills you can unlock for that particular playthrough. So it always ends up different and the more you achieve the more you unlock. A very addictive game, with a bit of a learning curb as you learn what all the skills the 'cards' have. Its really satisfying get good combos working however. I'd highly recommend the game if you like strategy or card games but won't mind if their aren't actually any cards.			"

												Sometimes we just want to settle down and watch something grow. Reus is that kind of game, or at least would be if it wasn't for a fiendish amount of experimenation and micromanagement lurking just moments under the surface.Deceptively simple, you control four giants with different abilities trying to shape the world around them. Each one interacts with one another allowing you to make the world of your choice and there's a huge balance going on with it all. The catch is, everything's timed. As humanity starts moving in, they'll want the help of the giants to help build projects which will require different amounts of synergy between food, wealth, and technology. And that's not all, you have anywhere from 30 to 120 minutes to make your planet as good as you can, after which humanity is on its own. If you have a couple of villages running about, it isn't too hard. But that isn't the best way to play the game. You need to have at least one of each type of village which will give you ambassadors which will give your giants additional powers. Before long there's an insane and ingenious amount of micromanagement going on and unless you're paying attention to your giants, you won't play at the best of your ability.The game knows this though and takes it slow, giving you a few different types of animals and plants to start with, moving you up over time. The faster you adapt, the more you get to play with. There's also a free play mode too so you can figure out just what to expect from a timed run. All the while, the game remains cute, innocent, and calming, which helps.Definately recommended, though there's a learning curve. Don't get discouraged if you don't do well for a couple runs.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game, it is a fun game for me but could I recommend it? Well let's talk about it first.Reus is a God game, you have 4 gods, Ahem Giants, at your control. A water, rock, forest, and swamp giant. (By your powers combined, I am really cruel...) you start on a baron planet of nothing and using their powers attempt to build a world where humans can settle and hopefully survive (Because apparently they keep killing the planet while you are asleep. Um...) You get 30 minutes to 2 hours (Possibly longer, idk) to mess around and build up the landscape for people to enjoy.   The challenge comes from progression. You have certain tasks to complete, such as making a swamp village with 500 prosperity by the end of the game. You need to complete these challenges to unlock better plants, animals and minerals. And you need better resources to get bigger projects done later in the game in order to progress more. Once you make a forest, hill, or swamp area simply put any resource near it (It does not matter what) And a settler will move in to occupy that. Create more resources for them to grow. Villages will grow once they complete projects, projects are random buildings that pop up requiring X amount or resources to be finished. Then poof, the village grows and someone from the village will become an ambassador  (For your giants, they pick them up and for some reason can make better resources.)   Resources you place can give multiple, well resources, (like some fish give both Food and Gold) They can be given buffs to give out more, placing them near certain other resources will grant a bonus to their yield, and sometimes location determines how much they produce. (For example, a fruit tree will do better if in a forest and surrounded by other trees) You wont know what works where until you just try it out, then beat the crap out of the test village you just made extremely greedy before they kill someone.2 problems I have with resources.1) Resources at first will confuse the crap out of you if you are anything like me. You assume a village needs food right?  WRONG!!! Unless they are building something that requires food, it is a worthless resource that only takes up very limited space. You dont need a balance of all the resources, you just need whatever it is the villagers happen to want at the time. This means that your villagers could want to build a granary one second requiring a bunch of food, and after that is done they suddenly want Gold so you have to replace all of the food squares with gold. Which can be really annoying. 2) To add more challenge I guess, villages also have a ""Greed"" meter. Give them to many resources at once, they will do one of two things. attack and kill another village or attack and try to kill the closest giant to them, basically forcing you to send Rocky to pummel their settlement into dust (Also forcing you to start over, do not walk off or another village will spawn almost instantly in the same place and get greedy almost instantly because of the resources that are there, destroy them) This is so irritating when something requiring completely different resources pops up. You can combat greed with danger, say put some scary animals near the boarder, they will kill them instead of going to war. But again, uses up space.   The game is about managing multiple villages at once so that they will all grow slowly around the same time and wont get to greedy. (Until one of the little S***s tries to build something that requires them to win a war, in which case give them a bunch of crap and say goodbye to another village) Give them what they need so they will give you what you want (ambassadors) so you can make bigger better towns to populate your planet before your timer runs out and your tired giants pass out ending the game. It is simple to learn, very hard to master.    It is a lot more fun than it is irritating I will say that, worth a try at least.			"

You have four giants who use their powers to create villages. As you make more villages , everyone grows and etc.Well first off, every world is timed. Starting at 15 minutes. Not a long game, secondly it's a completely sandbox game. There's no form of campaign or multiplayer or cool unlocks. You get to tier 3 I think it was and you're done unless you want to farm achivements.  I felt like there should have and could have been a lot more work done.			"

												A very simple concept played out in a masterful and complex way.  Management of villages, resources, and ambassadors quickly becomes crucial, and you'll find yourself very proud if you are perfectly prepared for your villagers' requests, and kicking yourself if you mixed up ambassadors.  An easy way to kill a few hours, and the relative brevity of each game (anywhere from half an hour to two) makes it easy to pick it up anytime and try to unlock more.  Unlockable progress is well-paced, continually expanding the experience.Mild irritations with the in-game help, as it sometimes provides erroneous information, but there is also an in-game link to a wiki page, which provides the correct information.

												Reus is a surprisingly deep strategy game where you indirectly control the growth of villages through the seeding power of four giants. Playing the game multiple times and achieving certain goals unlocks new plants, animals and minerals, that help your villages flourish. There is something particularly satisfying about testing out different combinations and watching it all come together in the form of huge caches of food, wealth and/or tech. But it also requires balance as being over generous to your world can turn villages greedy, resulting in war with other villages or even the giants themselves.			"

												I was one of the people who was hit by the ""your graphics card does not support the XNA"" framework diologue box. that being said, once i got a graphics card that supports the XNA framework, the game is actually quite enjoyable. the game does take time to progress, but i found that the 30 minute game setting was a great study break.pros: great overall concept, good animations, the symbiosis idea is fantastic, and the gameplay is well-paced. it doesn't feel that rushed once you get the hang of it.cons: while the tutorials are great at explaining the basics of the game, there is a bit of a learning curve afterwards. i didn't find this to be too bad (i play EVE, and this is nowhere near that learning curve. i'd put it at about a Sim City 3000 learning curve). also the obligatory XNA framework stupidness.conclusion: if you have a dedicated graphics card that supports DX10 (the GTX400 series and later should do, no idea about ATI though, sorry), then go ahead and get this. if you have a first gen Intel processor and an Intel GMA, hold off for now. i'm not sure if the Intel HD series will run this, but i know the GMA will not.

												Reus is excellent. The gameplay is addictive and keeps you thinking how you could of done things differently as you play through an era... Then you start another and go through differently. At first I only ever had one structure. 1 swamp, 1 forest, 1 desert. But soon i was planning different arrangements with multiple biomes in different areas. The game gives you freedom to shape this world and its villages. The second part of the game i loved is it's look. Even as you zoom in no detail is missed. The world, cartoony as it might be, looks great from the view of the creator (YOU!). The giants that you control manage to look adorable and epic at the same time. They are cleverly and creatively drawn and I would not change any of them one bit. I would gladly recommend Reus to any gamer who likes creating.... and destroying ;)			"

												Reus is a nice little strategy/god game. At first I found it annoying the game runs in real time and there is no way to speed it up.. but once I realized things get very busy and challenging, there would be no real way to play this game well with a speed-up option. So if you pick 60 min game, expect to sit there for 60 real-life minutes.			"

												Difficult or just pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Starting out isn't too bad but as you get better things start to get more complicated. The game is based on placing certain resources near eachother in order to compliment eachother to produce a benefit which will benefit the town you are trying to grow. Ex. an apple tree next to a diamond mine will create more food and wealth. This is  done for the whole game with the goal to follow the objectives which are usually resource based. There is no fast forward so waiting is one of the annoying parts. The only conflict in the game is that the towns will eventually turn rebelious because of the advanced resources or the mass influx of resources will cause them to get greedy and start attacking other towns and or you the gods. The only prevention is to build resources that cause danger to the town such as wild snakes, though too much will destroy the town. If the town cannot be quelled then the town must be desroyed or if one of your gods die the games over. Another complicaton with the game is that there are four gods and each having their own ability to spawn resources. In order to get more of their abilities their town must build a wonder which is built with the resources. For each wonder built a ability is granted to the gods but must be balanced out among the four gods. So one god cannot have two when everyone else has 0. Which means favoritism for each god is usually impossible if you want to get every ability and complete every goal.			"

												Reus is a beautiful looking game with a cool, unobtrusive soundtrack.  When I first saw screenshots and footage of this, I imagined that the giants would have a lot more direct and extensive involvement with the landscape and people, but as it turns out this is mostly a simple resource management game overlaid with the god mechanic to give the impression that there's a lot more to this.At the lower levels, this is quite a calming game, it's the sort of game that's really good to play occasionally to take a break from more involved gaming.  As you gain achievements and advance to the final era, things become a lot more involved and challenging, but you can always go back to playing shorter games if you like.It's worth getting, especially if on sale.

												This game is really buggy. I had a swamp village that needed 150 science for a druid and I had a total of 92 science boosts from tiles inside the village borders, yet the village was stuck at 72/74 science.I hate the fact that the game requires you to unlock things from timed games. Not my idea of fun. Also villagers attacking giants with spears when they get too prosperous is a really stupid idea.If you are on the fence on Reus, I would recommend you pass on it. Go get something, anything else to play.			"

												Reus (which means giant in Dutch) is a charming, quirky game in which the player controls four nature giants to shape the world. Once humans move in and start building projects the player must strategize to help them complete their projects and keep an eye on the greedy villagers.It is easy to play, and even though simple, can get very challenging as harder projects emerge.Its simplicity ensures that there are generally no bugs and glitches- meaning you get smooth gameplay.You may just spend hours just to unlock the satisfying achievements. It really is a brilliant, original, satisfying game- a must have for people who like strategy games.			"

												A game with simple rules yet complex emergent gameplay. Effectively a puzzle game in genre, it feels like playing a game of Civilization with no AIs -- you control everything, and must make an optimal empire as rapidly as possible. So far, the early game has been defined by simple puzzles phrased as demands by your cities (city X wants 30 food to build a granary!), with each city having all the space it wants and being basically independent. The next phase appears to be more space-crunched, and I expect puzzles of the ""satisfy both cities with limited, overlapping land"" sort to become prominent. A good value in the Humble Indie Bundle, or for a couple bucks on its own.			"

												Fun simple game with few glitches. It's worth a couple bucks. Only downsides are no fast forward option, gets old fast as theres not as much variety as you would think, and you are forced to play with a 30minute time limit to unlock new stuff instead of being able to go straight into sandbox mode. It can be annoying restarting every 30minutes. The time limit goes up later but it's still irritating. Besides this, the game has a very nice atmosphere to it and is rather fun to play casually while relaxing. Be warned though it may feel more complicated than you would think at the beginning.			"

												This is a game that's well under-rated. It's not a Black and White style god game, so you cannot go into this game expecting that.  Reus is about transforming the world to help humans achieve projects, and in turn unlock new rewards. Its a game of transformation and optimization. The ""campaign"" consists of 30 minute, 60 minutes, and 120 minute plays. To unlock the higher timed modes, you have to complete aforementioned projects, and unlock developments. I found that unlocking developments can be done just by playing - it was harder to try to target a specific development. While that makes the game sound easy on its face, the true fun of Reus is in its complex symbiosis system. Everything in Reus interacts with the world differently. Blueberries and Chickens will form a symbiosis, and grant more powerful combinations than any one on its own. Reus' challenge is to discover how plants, animals, and minerals work together to form food, wealth, and technology - the three primary resources for completing projects. The symbiosis system is constructed upon the interlocking resources each giant can uniquely create, the varied aspects each giant has to augment a resource's innate power, and the upgrading of a resource to a more powerful tier. These three factors mean the Reus world is constantly changing, and as a player the challenge is to adapt your world so that greater unlocks can be achieved. It is not possible to succeed relaying on any one giant, or on any combination of basic resources and aspects. Added to this are additional, secondary, factors. Natura, danger, and awe augment how some resources act and how human villages respond to the world. These secondary factors are just that, secondary. I've played several games without any awe or danger, but in those games the humans became greedy and went to war with each other, or would attack the giants. As these challenges arise, the giants are equipped with a couple destructive powers. I feel Reus is amazingly well balanced, and no playthrough will be the same twice. The game has a large number of symbiotic combinations to discover, and as the player acheives new developments, new resources are unlocked. I would remind any new players to use the spacebar, and take the time to plan your developments. A 30 minute game seems like a short period of time, but one can easily spend several minutes planning a move, and a few seconds letting the game unpause to complete that before pausing again to plan. I'll end with the only significant negative: at time of writing, Reus does not have Steam Cloud support! This bothers me the most, because I feel Reus is a game where a single ""profile"" or sorts is best. Because so much time can be spent crafting an optimal world, I don't relish the thought of re-unlocking developments whenever I migrate from my desktop to laptop. As a casual game, Reus needs cloud savegame support. Regardless, I highly recommend Reus. Don't let its seeming simplicity fool you.			"

												I say to myself, when I play god games, 'man, I wish I could be a proper deity and control the land, the animals, the elements- the world and allow the mortals their free will.... so that I can punish them for their hubris'. Reus is pretty much that- you have yourself some basic elements and landscape tools and use them to guide humans down the paths you want. The addition of timed matches and challenges to unlock new manipulations is brilliant because it means there are goals to strive for- and goals are essential when you're playing an almighty deity. After a few challenges and short runs of the game, you have more complicated matches, more elaborate goals, the ever-present danger of a population attempting to challenge you for a perceived slight against them. It's a game of simple controls but it's exceedingly difficult to master. Y'know, kinda like divine power would be. In a nutshell I strongly recommend Reus to any fan of God Games who wants a more involved aproach to divinity.			"

The point of them game is to find good combinations of buildings to satisfy the town.  There is no perfect combo since you will constantly be given different challenges and depending on how you level your giants, you will only have access to certain buildings.  Due to the massive number of combinations, the game can be played many times without repeating yourself. Well worth $3.			"

												Reus is an interesting little god game that came out recently. Since I enjoy god games, I decided to pick it up, and I was not disappointed. Behind the cute, aesthetic and deceptively simple interface is a surprisingly deep game that will suck hours out of your day.The premise of Reus is that you are mother earth, in command of four giants: the Rock Giant, Swamp Giant, Ocean Giant and Forest Giant. Your goal is to foster and build human civilization through the interaction of these Giants and their powers.When you start a new game, you go through The Beginning mode. Here, through three Eras, you are taught the basics of how to manipulate the world, attract settlers and grow your community. Once you complete this tutorial, you are then presented with Era mode, where the main game lies. Here you progress from 30-minute game modes to 60-minutes to 120-minutes as you unlock developments, such as building certain projects or reaching a certain population goal. There is also a freestyle mode where you can play as long as you want, but you will not gain any achievements.What is surprisingly compelling about Reus is how its simplicity leads to some pretty deep choices in regards to how you terraform and build your civilization. For instance, if you want a desert civilization you will need to create a mountain which spawns desert tiles next to it. However, if there is an ocean nearby and the mountain is not directly next to it, you will have forest tiles popping up instead. Plants and animals have certain synergies that can only be applied when next to a specific organism. For example, snakes give out additional gold if they are next to smaller animals. To add, the various resources can also be upgraded, or transmuted as the game calls it, to new and different resources; for instance, stone can be transmuted into salt or copper, each giving different resources. These transmutations are only possible through completing projects set out by villages. How it works is that depending on the villages (there are three types: desert, forest and swamp), each gives their own ambassador, which in turn unlocks specific abilities for each of your giants. Certain abilities even require multiple types of ambassadors, but Giants cannot have a monopoly on them so it is going to take some stratagem on your part to decide how you want to develop your villages.The villages themselves add another layer to the game. If they get too greedy, they may start attacking other villages. You can prevent this by either easing up on how many resources you give them, or increasing their danger level through planting dangerous animals in their territory. The former is tricky because if you do not handle their concerns they may turn on you and start attacking the Giants. The latter requires some caution as well, for if you increase their threat too much, the village will slowly die off. Some projects even ask you to destroy other villages using your Giants’ powers, which lead to the conundrum of whether the end justifies the means, depending on how developed the targeted village is and whether you had another development to achieve in mind.Reus, in the end, is a very charming and addictive god game, and at under $10, it is practically a steal. If you are in the mood to be a world of your own, do not hesitate to pick up Reus.(Taken from my submitted review for the Boropulse.com) "

												A fun, friendly little god game where you control four elemental giants as they rebuild the world and shape it to help it's inhabitants prosper.  The old adage, simple to learn, yet tough to master definitely applies here, as there's a lot of interplay between what abilities the giants use to shape the environment.  Forests and swamps won't appear without some oceans nearby, but desert biomes need to be separated from the sea,  As well, some animals, plants and minerals have a form of symbiosis with one another, and making chains of terrain that stack bonuses with one another is very satisfying.  Throw in small independent human towns that spring up and depend upon you to help them thrive without becoming greedy by growing too fast, completing challenges that unlock new creatures, plants and minerals, and you've got a fantastic game with great replayability.  Well worth the look!			"

U create ocians, mountains, forests and swamps... then people come they want to live happily ever after and they want more of your gifts, but beware if u gave them much they will become greedy and they will want more and more and event try to kill your giants if they are not satisfied.Basicaly u just try to make happy living planet, few villages on it, it may seems easy at first, but after few hours u discover there is pretty deep rules and every progress will require understanding of game principles and deep strategy.For this price definitely must buy!

Intersting and fun the first houres, after that you kinda get bored. Like really bored. Like "" ♥♥♥♥ this im gonna use my giant to murder all my people i just spend 3 houres to get "" bored. Ye...

												This is a fun strategy game that starts simple and quickly expands into a complex, rewarding mathematical experience. The more I play Reus, the more I learn about its breadth of resources, driving me to play more games and unlock faster ways to reach humankind's goals.I would recommend this game to someone looking for a relaxing game that will engage a portion of your attention at a minimum and will take as much attention as you give it.

												This game is one of the god/puzzle games that i most enjoyed, and i've played quite a few. Not only do you unlock more options by completing achievements, the different options are amazing. The best part? You don't play endlessly to achieve everything, each game you start you have to predefine the timelimits. Buy this game if you want a nice game that you can play every once in a while without getting addicted and still enjoy yourself.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game, it is a fun game for me but could I recommend it? Well let's talk about it first.Reus is a God game, you have 4 gods, Ahem Giants, at your control. A water, rock, forest, and swamp giant. (By your powers combined, I am really cruel...) you start on a baron planet of nothing and using their powers attempt to build a world where humans can settle and hopefully survive (Because apparently they keep killing the planet while you are asleep. Um...) You get 30 minutes to 2 hours (Possibly longer, idk) to mess around and build up the landscape for people to enjoy.   The challenge comes from progression. You have certain tasks to complete, such as making a swamp village with 500 prosperity by the end of the game. You need to complete these challenges to unlock better plants, animals and minerals. And you need better resources to get bigger projects done later in the game in order to progress more. Once you make a forest, hill, or swamp area simply put any resource near it (It does not matter what) And a settler will move in to occupy that. Create more resources for them to grow. Villages will grow once they complete projects, projects are random buildings that pop up requiring X amount or resources to be finished. Then poof, the village grows and someone from the village will become an ambassador  (For your giants, they pick them up and for some reason can make better resources.)   Resources you place can give multiple, well resources, (like some fish give both Food and Gold) They can be given buffs to give out more, placing them near certain other resources will grant a bonus to their yield, and sometimes location determines how much they produce. (For example, a fruit tree will do better if in a forest and surrounded by other trees) You wont know what works where until you just try it out, then beat the crap out of the test village you just made extremely greedy before they kill someone.2 problems I have with resources.1) Resources at first will confuse the crap out of you if you are anything like me. You assume a village needs food right?  WRONG!!! Unless they are building something that requires food, it is a worthless resource that only takes up very limited space. You dont need a balance of all the resources, you just need whatever it is the villagers happen to want at the time. This means that your villagers could want to build a granary one second requiring a bunch of food, and after that is done they suddenly want Gold so you have to replace all of the food squares with gold. Which can be really annoying. 2) To add more challenge I guess, villages also have a ""Greed"" meter. Give them to many resources at once, they will do one of two things. attack and kill another village or attack and try to kill the closest giant to them, basically forcing you to send Rocky to pummel their settlement into dust (Also forcing you to start over, do not walk off or another village will spawn almost instantly in the same place and get greedy almost instantly because of the resources that are there, destroy them) This is so irritating when something requiring completely different resources pops up. You can combat greed with danger, say put some scary animals near the boarder, they will kill them instead of going to war. But again, uses up space.   The game is about managing multiple villages at once so that they will all grow slowly around the same time and wont get to greedy. (Until one of the little S***s tries to build something that requires them to win a war, in which case give them a bunch of crap and say goodbye to another village) Give them what they need so they will give you what you want (ambassadors) so you can make bigger better towns to populate your planet before your timer runs out and your tired giants pass out ending the game. It is simple to learn, very hard to master.    It is a lot more fun than it is irritating I will say that, worth a try at least.			"

												Reus, released May 2013, is a simulation game developed and produced by Abbey Games. In Reus, the player has control over four 'giants' (forest, water, rock and swamp) and  must use the powers of each in combination to create a world suitable for the uncontrollable people (Villagers) and support them as they grow larger and expect more from the giants.Every so often, a village will ask the giants to help them create a special kind of building which will require certain resources based upon what type of village it is (Forest, Mountain or Swamp) and what resources the town is based around (Food, Wealth or Tec). Resources come from minerals, plants and animals, which can be upgraded to supply more resources and gain different symbiosis abilities. symbiosis is the name of the special abilities each different resource has, for example, one mineral will increase the resources it gives if next to a plant and one animal will increase resources if its next to the same kind of animal. If the player successfully supplies the village with the supplies in the required time limit, and build the special building, they will be rewarded with a village ambassador which, when given to  a giant, will either unlock or upgrade the giants ability and allow them to create better resources.As a village gets bigger, the villagers will become less impressed with the giants and instead of giving the giants an ambassador for every building, they will only reward the play when they help create upgraded special buildings and after a while they only reward the player for every third tier building they help create.At the same time, a player cant give a village a lot of resources too quickly, or else that village will become greedy and go to war with other villages and the only way to stop a village that has declared war is to use your giants to destroy the village, removing it from the game, but allowing another village to take its place. This dynamic stops a player from instantly creating a village with a lot of resources.After a village gains a certain level of prosperity, it spawns a nomad, who scours the globe looking for another place to live, if the player doesn't create any other inhabitable areas, the nomad will create a village close to the already existing village, inhibiting the villages of expanding in that direction.This is definitely one of the best indie games on the market. I liked the use of achievements to unlock better upgrades for plants, which allow for the creation of better villages. The graphics are also very well done and give the game a nice cartoon-y feel. Mechanically, the game is well thought out, with mechanics stopping a player focusing on a single are of the planet, and stopping them from upgrading a town too quickly.It would be hard to change this game too much without changing the game completely, but one thing the game could probably do as an improvement, would be to introduce another giant, or adjust existing giant abilities that allow for the use of the sky above the villages.In short, this game is defiantly worth picking up, and I look forward to seeing what Abbey Games does next.

												Reus is what i'd call a god game, but not like any god game you've seen.In most god games, things tend to become stale exactly because you're allowed to do whatever you want. It doesn't matter if people live or die, usually. You reach your objective either way. But in Reus, it's beneficial to you as the player to help out the little dudes while allowing you to turn on them and destroy them if they become a problem. It's a good genre done well, complete with unlockables via an achievement system and pretty relaxing gameplay.			"

												At first glance and the first couple playthroughs this seems like an awesome fun experience, but after that comes the grind.  Projects so advanced you can't get them without either a math degree or upgrades you have yet to unlock.  The game just starts an arms race with the player and wins.  I loved my first 10 hours with the game but the rest of my time in it is from missing the game, starting a run, and getting frustrated that every single project I need to do requires me to have a plant or animal I haven't unlocked and then just quitting without finishing the game.

												This is another game that can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it, and can be played in any number of ways. Try to keep the villages peaceful, or lead them to war; focus on one village, or try to help them all equally; use complex strategies to try to maximize your development by making every square count, or just plop things down and see what happens. Plenty of developments to keep the completionist striving. You can keep yourself to strict half hour breaks by choosing the 30-minute era and not pausing, or play for hours and hours. And let's admit it: it's fun to control giants that control the landscape and the lives of cute little villagers. Art style is a definite plus, and the giants' idle animations are a nice touch.			"

												FIRST OFF, I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GOOD GAME, ONE THAT PEOPLE COULD ENJOY. HOWEVER, I PERSONALLY CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO TRY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT FOR A SALE.Reus has a whole lot of interesting ideas and features to it. It has a really complex and intricate system and the mechanics of the game compliment this. I personally bought the game because I love god games, I have played Black and White (and 2), populous, dungeon keeper (and 2) and these games are all really great. Mastering control over a 2d planet and its inhabitants sounded like a really cool idea to me. Unfortunately it wasn't my thing, the idea of re-playability to me is being able to invent and control your own game every time. I understand that you are not supposed to be able to control the populous to a great extent, but I ended up playing what felt the same type every time. The achievements and unlocks I was trying to accomplish were obfusticated by these villagers. I'm sure if I stuck with it, I'd be unlocking plenty of features of the game, but I couldn't figure out how to do so. The guides and people's Q and A's did not really help. I was stumbling a lot. I felt that the unlocks should have been changed to meeting certain, more specific (and controllable) criteria. What I mean by this is that borders should have influences (people should build out for the resources they want) and projects built should be based around certain needs (so if there are tons of fish in the ocean, then they should build a harbour rather than a school, its very frustrating). This would have worked a lot better, giving the player more control for what they want to do but not give then complete power over their villages. The main issue is that villagers build what they want to build and start essentially when they want to start. You have very little control over this besides a few environmentally-based projects and smashing down a project you don't want built. This is a nice and interesting feature, but time constraints make it feel as if I'm constantly working against the villagers. Rather than actually helping these people out and feeling that I earnt the achievement I was going for, I feel I am competing or fighting against the people. It isn't a nice feeling. The gruel of getting achievements is also slow, I understand that this is the main part of the game, but you essentially build up the same way to get the same things to expand your horizons later. Also, I have a small gripe with you seeing the achievements you already have when you are finished with an era. Why do I need to see these again? It confused me into thinking I didn't have these, initially creating a false sense of mass achievement. Not too big of a deal, but still there.I feel this is more a game that doesn't appeal to me, rather than being a bad game. I just wrote this review in case there are those of you who are like me and might have similar expectations.			"

Its colorful and rich 2D visuals, combimed with a fantastic sound track are a treat within themselves, but its also extremely deep and strangley satisfying. A wonderful 2D take on the classic God game genre that shouldnt be missed, especially considering its insanely low price.

												Very interesting.That's pretty much what I have to say about it.Obviously I'm kidding, but this game just gets  boring . It's very fun on the first playthrough, and I had a blast in the sandbox-like mode. But this game easily bores you. It might get confusing for someone looking at this review and seeing my hours, but that was my hours trying to find any fun after the first five or so. I've played off and on for the past year, but I just can't recommend this game to may people. So, decide for yourself. Pros - Cute graphics- Easy controls- Lots of things to upgrade- Giants are balanced and are not super OP- Fun for the first playthrough Cons  - Amount of work to get something upgraded even on easy- Balancing happiness and greed can be very difficult (game-breaking difficult)- Weird pacing - Acts more like a puzzle game than anything elseSo if you like puzzle games that can be quite difficult, this game is for you. If you like god games or anything else advertised... ehh... wait for the Universim to come out.			"

												*Not I mostly played this offline when I was stranded in a rural area so my actual game time is ~20 hours.This is, as others have said, a puzzle placement game. However, I think it is also something of a god game. Other reviews have mentioned greed levels getting way out of control and only being able to be brought down by destroying part of the villages; this is not true. Typically, destroying any armies sent out by villages increases their awe rating; as long as you continue to perform miracles and/or kill insurgents, no one will challenge you. This is a challenging god game with a heavy reliance on synergy, balance, and intimate knowledge of the game's mechanics. While the unlock system is annoying and the game becomes unwieldy during longer sessions, it is satisfying and has a lot of heart.TLDR; Greed can be controlled by awe and redistribution of wealth. Game requires certain goals to be met to unlock new gameplay. Annoying during longer play sessions but overall a great experience.			"

												Absolutely flawless timeconsumer. Love it. However since I got 100% acheivements it doesn't lure me back. Challenges set by those achievements are quite hard as long as player is willing to stick to using all sources. Replayability isn't ultra high, since people are randomized - they go to different projects thus producing different bonuses further changing your terraforming focus around their city. Interface takes some time to get used to even for moba players. Graphics and music are adorable, they make user wanna come back, unless of course one has completed achievements thus unlocking all game elements. Game lacks global scoreboard or any other element of player-player intaraction, but than again planet has fixed number of spaces and people can develop limited number of projects thus mathematically one can produce highest possible score without any options for other players, apart from repeating the scheme.Overall 8+/10			"

												This is a very good game, in my opinion. However, it requires far more patience than I have and I feel like most people have. There is so, *so* much content to it, but a great deal of it is blocked behind a massive time wall. You will be lucky to unlock one or two new plants, animals, or structures after an hour long game. The game's progress is measured through very difficult tiered achievements, making it a very hard game to recommend.On the plus side, it means that there's always something to look forward to, but you'll need to ask yourself how big that ""something"" needs to be for it to be worth it. You can potentially get hundreds of hours of entertainment out of this game, but you'll have to really, really enjoy the act of slowly, *slowly* progressing through it.It goes on sale often enough, at a very affordable price. Buy it then, and it'll definitely be worth it.			"

												I enjoy this game a lot more than its tutorial led me to believe, for some reason. Mechanics that seemed convoluted in training actually add an interesting level of difficulty and strategizing during actual play.Overall, I'd say that Reus is a very well-designed strategy game, with a good progression and a lot of variety in objectives which encourages you to explore all of the different play strategies. Depending on whether or not you use the pause option, it can be very zen or a bit more intense.However, I really prefer the shorter game duration, as I feel like 1h+ runs can feel like they're dragging on for way too long when things are not going as you had planned. I'm not sure yet what that means for me and this game in the future - but in any case, it has already provided me with a solid 10 hours of entertainment.			"

												Sometimes we just want to settle down and watch something grow. Reus is that kind of game, or at least would be if it wasn't for a fiendish amount of experimenation and micromanagement lurking just moments under the surface.Deceptively simple, you control four giants with different abilities trying to shape the world around them. Each one interacts with one another allowing you to make the world of your choice and there's a huge balance going on with it all. The catch is, everything's timed. As humanity starts moving in, they'll want the help of the giants to help build projects which will require different amounts of synergy between food, wealth, and technology. And that's not all, you have anywhere from 30 to 120 minutes to make your planet as good as you can, after which humanity is on its own. If you have a couple of villages running about, it isn't too hard. But that isn't the best way to play the game. You need to have at least one of each type of village which will give you ambassadors which will give your giants additional powers. Before long there's an insane and ingenious amount of micromanagement going on and unless you're paying attention to your giants, you won't play at the best of your ability.The game knows this though and takes it slow, giving you a few different types of animals and plants to start with, moving you up over time. The faster you adapt, the more you get to play with. There's also a free play mode too so you can figure out just what to expect from a timed run. All the while, the game remains cute, innocent, and calming, which helps.Definately recommended, though there's a learning curve. Don't get discouraged if you don't do well for a couple runs.			"

												A charming, simple, world-building game. If you don't consult the wiki it will challenge your memory for what plants, animals and minerals go where, what they can be transmuted into and what bonuses they give each other. To build the world you want and satisfy the humans you will have to plan far ahead. It's almost a puzzle game in that regard.There is considerable variety to be had, aiming for all the achievements will require many different worlds and styles of play. And there's just something satisfying about the gentle pace of progress and lovely animations that will keep you coming back.			"

												So in my opinion this game is heavily influenced by the modern style of games. What do I mean by that?It feels like a mobile/tablet game as it rewards you a lot for playing, especially at the beginning when you are still new to the game you can unlock a lot of achievements and new objects just by playing it once. Of course later, these ""easy"" ones are gone and you have to focus on a few achievements to unlock them in a game but then you have more experience so it balances out again. On the other hand you have these very specified time lengths for your games. I found myself mostly playing the 30 minute mode up to now but you can decide yourself and also go for 1-hour-games for example. The graphic is really cute and good in my opinion and it fits this game perfectly. The rounds you play will be always a bit different from before even though you always start with an empty planet of a certain size. But because of the possible achievements and your own preferences you can change it into different planets every time but the bigger the planet and the more cities you have, the more you are running around with your giants and sometimes you might lose track of one village because you concentrate so much on the other side of the map. Overall I really like this game and I think it fits the newer gamer generation very well with the short but rewarding round-style. But if you like build-up games you can have lots of fun with this game.			"

												There once were four great beings who shifted from the very earth itself...They made the planet habitable, and filled it with all kinds of life... That including humans.Many civilizations formed, but after countless years of war, poverty, and advancement, three Kingdoms remained...In their modern era, all three kingdoms lived in peace, and happiness among one another... Until...The giants grew jealous if each other's weath and influence... Built alliances... Influenced there little humans to... Assault their neighbors.This led the planet to War... Chaos... Causualties beyond compare...In the end... A single village remained... It had been heavily war-torned, and all the giants looked down upon it in grief, for having caused so much trouble to humanity...The Giants grew tired, and depressed, and decided it was time to form back into the very earth itself.Without the giants to watch over it... Humanity, and all life died...For an unknown amount of time, the giants finally awoken, and repeated the process.GG. 10/10. Best God Game on the market.			"

												Although it seems like a god-game, this is more of a puzzle. With your population divided into Forest, Swamp and Desert villages, and each one having specific resources, and each of them having specific Reactions and Evolution, the game quickly turns into a lot of thinking about where to put your resources, as your villages demand more and more.  While that would make it a really enjoyable game, the unlock system, where you need to complete in-game achievements to be able to make upgrades, puts a dent in the fun, as some of them are annoying or plainly against common sense(Such has having a Village declare and/or win multiple wars).

												The art style is nice and the idea behind the game is cool, but the developers made some stupid decisions that devalue the overall experience:- The giants move too slowly.- The music is boring and unremarkable. Good music in a game of this type is a must.- Free-play mode has barred features that can only be unlocked by playing the campaign.- The campaign is nothing more than free-play mode with a 30 minute time limit.- Achievements (most of them) are tied to the campaign and can’t be unlocked in free-play mode.Overall, even if you like the game, there’s not much to do or see after only a few hours of gameplay.Reus: 7.0 / 10.0			"

Where Taiga Villages spawn. You guys can make the models and plants. And a Weather giant. Random weather happens, depending on what happens, villages have a reaction. Weather giant is the most thought of with me, he can make a tornado, that does 30 damage to wildlife, and 70 to Villages. He also can't make a special biome! He is a Defensive one.

												Okay, this game got me by surprise. I got it expecting some primitive city builder and what I got was a very interesting and addictive puzzle game. Basically you use 4 giants, that are aspects of Mother Earth to create a living space for human settlers. These things you create combine and transform as you create other things beside them, giving you access to bigger and better resources, thus reaching higher and higher prosperity (essentially, highscore).The game also comes with these flavours: A comprehensive tutorial, a 30 minute game, 60 minute game, 120 minute game, complete sandbox game and built-in cheats to make your life easier AND harder, but disabling achievements.About achievements: in this game, they matter! The more achievements you unlock the better stuff you can place and transmute, you actually HAVE to hunt achievements to reach better tier stuff to place to reach the higher tier resources.It's a VERY fun little game that often leads me thinking where the past 2 hours went, it's incredibly addicting and YOU decide the pacing and path of each game.Recommended at full price, it's a gem.

												Reus plays almost like a card game. The planet is split into tiny sections were you can place your 'cards' (plants, animals or minerals) and these differ depending on the land type they're placed on (swamp, forest, desert, mountain and sea). These ""cards"" for my analogies sake, work in combination with those surrounding, either the section next to it, a highlighted range around it or the village's range. Together they give bonuses to one another and give your villages their resources.You are the planet and you help the villagers using your giant avatars. The villagers will want resources for projects, complete these and your giant can pick them up, unlocking a skill. These skills can be used to transform the 'cards' you've put down into more advanced or specialised 'cards' making the combos etc more complex. You can unlock the advanced and specialised cards by completing achievements in the game. Your villagers will get greedy if you spoil them however and destroy other villages through war. You don't have a faction, you gain skills by having villages of different land types so you want to keep everyone flourishing. To try and keep your greedy villages at bay you have to provide them with dangers that keep them occupied in the form of predators or dangerous mines etc but this is quite difficult and occasionally you may need to intervene with your giants. Villages may turn on you and attack your giants if they are unhappy, not in enough awe of the giants or just greedy but eventually enough pummeling will set them straight.As well as unlocking more of the advanced/specialised 'cards' to place you will also unlock longer play time as well. So each time you play you start of with a dead planet but have a few more tricks up your sleave allowing you to advance farther quicker and with more time in which to do it. After a few goes it felt like I was playing the same game over and over but depending on your villager's projects depends on what you place, how your planet looks and which skills you can unlock for that particular playthrough. So it always ends up different and the more you achieve the more you unlock. A very addictive game, with a bit of a learning curb as you learn what all the skills the 'cards' have. Its really satisfying get good combos working however. I'd highly recommend the game if you like strategy or card games but won't mind if their aren't actually any cards.			"

I think the idea that you start out with just 30 minute play sessions/challenges is benefitial for really getting to understand the symbioses between the systems. It also gives you a challenges on time pressure, that is actually fun. Often in sandboxy godgames you can quickly get bored if you just aimlessy putter around.			"

Basically you lay down tiles of ocean, forest, swamp or desert and then place tiles of plants, animals, or minerals on those tiles to make up resources for the villages that settle nearby. The villages grow and you help them complete the projects that they attempt to construct but altering the resources you laid down, each project has different completion requirements. I recommend if you enjoy strategy or god-type games where you attempt to walk a line and help civilization survive and thrive.			"

												It's a pretty decent game, worth more than the $2.50 I paid for it.  While my initial impression was that the game was overly restrictive in its lack of a second dimension, the layout actually plays into the strategy.  I won't get too into the details of the mechanics, but the idea is to be thoughtful in your placement of natural resources, which gain different bonuses depending on the resources that surround it.  Upgrades to the basic improvements get pretty extensive as you unlock more and more, and more and more strategy is required.  To this end I find that the game paces itself pretty well.  You don't have control over humans in this game, so trying to manage them into developing further while not letting them mess up everything is the name of the game.  Perhaps there is not much replay value after you unlock everything, but overall it was pretty entertaining.			"

												Surprisingly deep game which I initially shrugged off due to first impressions. I am so glad I gave it another chance. The time limit forces you maximize the yield you get from placing various animals, minerals, and crops. There are many things to consider regarding the placement of these things however, and one of the biggest challenges is trying to figure out the most optimal way to arrange everything in the limited town borders.

												I've been playing this for just under 3 hours, and I have to say, it's an very well engineered indie game! Think of it as a cute, toned-down version of Civilization. You control 4 elemental giants (Forest, Water, Swamp and Rock - that basically looks like Groot) that ultimately build up a down-scaled version of Earth. You choose your time limit and see how you get on. It's addictive, HOWEVER there can be a waiting time for the giants to make their next movement - namely travelling. The game has human-based objectives set out too, which need to be met within a time limit. These usually require the basics of food, wealth and tech. If you're happy juggling all that info and playing an easy-going game with elements of ""god-gaming"", I recommend.			"

It doesn't make any sense that they would attack what made them, guarding the giants becomes your top priority because you don't gain any achievments if you lose one..........   That's stupid, why should I lose all of my progress because some village became fed up with me for no reason.  after getting to a certain point in the game you can't help but have villages that get greedy,  even with the danger up in the middle this is my only nitpick with the game, other than that its great			"

												This game can seem confusing at first, but really it is only because the game is fairly original. It is simply amazing once you figure out how to play it. Very relaxing to play (ok not at first when you have no idea what you are doing, but trust me it DOES get relaxing).PROS:- Very orignal- RelaxingCONS:- It is hard to plan out how you are going to  grow your villages because the game is lacking one very important thing; a visual upgrade tree for your placed resources. For instance, when you get an ambassador (which allows you to build new types of resources) you have to decide which giant will get it. It is hard to make that decision without being able to quickly see what you need to get particular upgrades. You CAN use the wiki in game, but it is a subpar way to do this. - I don't see how anyone can win the later achivements without alt mode. I strongly suggest playing in alt mode, as it is just more fun this way.All in all, great game! "

												Well this game was a lot more involved than I was expecting. You have 4 giants, and each one has one main skill (terraforming).  Forest makes forests, Water makes oceans, Rock makes mountains/desert, Swamp makes swampland. Then each one can make plants, animals, or mineral deposits. Each thing you place interacts with other things you can place, to give bonuses. When a town forms in each area (desert, forest, swamp), they start a project objective you have to help them meet by adding more things to get their scores up. If you win, you get an ambassador, which opens new upgrade options. Then each thing previously placed can be upgraded. Those upgrades interact with each thing differently than the original, so you change all of your bonuses each time you change something. As you go along the projects get more difficult. That can make for a lot of different play combinations.The 30 minute games advance you, but I have not worked through those yet. I wanted to do some free play to figure out how everything worked together first. There is definitely plenty of game play for days, here. It's a good game to fiddle with and then save to come back to. Once you become familiar with the rules, you can then alter things further with game options (e.g., world size, ""speed play"", and ""no pause"") to challenge yourself further.			"

												It's a good game, but not for everyone. You are in control of 4 different giants that shape the world and help the civilizations grow and develop. You'll be doing things like creating patches of food, mineral, etc for the cities, and  also stoping them from destroying each other(optional).There is really no story to it.  You'll always start same way, with same limited number of patches for cities and resources. The point of playing will be getting the achievements and unlocks. The cities provide ambassadors which unlock abilities for the giants. The different combinations of ambassador-giants will provide the differentiation from game to game.			"

												Foremost, anyone who hasn't played the game for at least 3 hours hasn't played it. This is quite simply the case. The game expands, and deepens, and becomes simultaneously easier and harder as you go. From what I judge is a good 1/3 to 1/2 of the way towards the fullest, deepest parts of the game (this based on my achievement progress -- which seems thus far to be directly tied to the ""skill tree,"" if you will, that unlocks new Giant upgrades and longer, more varied game modes), I have to say that I'm quite pleasantly impressed. I was drawn to the game by its artistic look and its unique mechanic -- and more than a couple fond memories of Black and White -- and I am beheld a fascinating, endearing, and from time to time backstabbingly painful, altogether simple and beautiful experience. It was a great impulse buy - I've certainly gotten my $3 or so out of it already, and I doubt I'm done with it yet. Fully recommend.			"

												It's a pretty silly game about building your planet by planting and upgrading resources around your planet. The game mechanics are pretty fun, while the game itself has a pretty neat premise. The more levels you successfully complete, the more advanced minerals/plants/animals you can seed. Pretty relaxing, until humans start to attack their own gods, leaving you with the decision to run or destroy them and start anew.			"

												A world building game where you control giants to give natural resources to the environment, (plants, animals, minerals). As you place them, they provide food, wealth, and technology to the people of the world. Placing the right combination of resources can increase the benefits greatly (some animals are better next to mines, while others excel if near plants, for example)As your villages develop, trying to meet their needs can become challenging, especially if they begin warring with each other, or even attack your giants if they become too greedy. Keeping everything in balance becomes more and more challenging. Meeting goals within a 1 or 2 hour timed game will unlock rewards, and if you like you can continue playing after the time expires, or start over with a new world and try to achieve different goals.Overall, a very fun simulation/god game for the price.

												A cautious recommendation. I do enjoy this game, but it's just not enticing me to come back to it. An overview of the gameplay first. Reus is a game where you control several giants who can terraform the land, with the ability to create things like forests, oceans, mountains, deserts, etc. Once you create one of these areas, nomads will move in and settle cities. Once these nomads are settled, you need to nurse them by giving them food, wealth, and science, while trying to stop them from getting greedy and having wars.Every ""biome"" has a different type of city. For example, forests house cities that require food to grow. Deserts create cities that require wealth, and swamp cities require science, or knowledge. Each giant specializes in one of things. The forest giant can make bushes and trees for food, the rock giant can create minerals for wealth, and the swamp giant makes herbs for science. The water giant can make animals, which contribute to food. Most giants can do something for each of these. The rock giant can create minerals for science, the swamp giant animals for wealth.Cities need these things to build ""projects"", which allow them to expand. These projects have time limits in which you need to get a certain amount of food, science, or wealth. Every project you finish rewards you with one of the cities' respective ambassadors. These ambassadors unlock (or power up) abilities of your giants.Giants have more abilities then just creating bushes or minerals; they can also infuse things with certain attributes. Some attributes raise the food of bushes, or the science of minerals. There are three strengths of attributes, normal, potent and greater. Some of these tile improvements can transmute into better versions once they are infused with a certain attribute. Blueberries can transmute into strawberries, strawberries into pear trees. The greater transmutations require stronger attributes.So with transmutations out of the way, there is another important mechanic about tile improvements. This is called symbiosis. Symbiosis is something that raises the amount of food/wealth/science an improvement gives under certain conditions. Some minerals give double wealth when near another mineral, some animals give extra food while near berries. This is extremely important, considering you only have a small amount of tiles in the city to work with. You need to take advantage of this to maximize the city's resources.You do not want to make a city too large too fast, though, because then they'll get greedy. When cities get greedy, they are going to start wars with other civlizations, and potentially destroy them. They might also start to take your giants for granted and attack them. Don't worry though, because the swamp and rock giants have attacks. You can use these attacks to destory armies, riots, and even cities themselves if they become problems. There are a couple of ways to regulate greed in this game. The first is to very slowly give them resources. Their greed is raised when the number of resources they have available is higher then the amount of resources they are currently using by 20.The second way is to infuse animals near the city with the attribute of danger. Certain amounts of danger with stop their greed from rising completely. Be careful, though, because too much danger will cause the city to slowly die.If their greed does rise, you can simply humiliate them by dealing damage to the city to lower their greed. Make sure your attacks won't kill them, though.Something you might have noticed from the overview of the game is that it is about keeping balance. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it gets kind of slow sometimes. I found myself waiting quite a bit for their resources in use to rise so I could return to optimizing my tile improvements, without them getting greedy. This is a very casual game. The meat of it is trying to develop the cities certain ways in a 30/60 minute time limit to get new transmutations and achievements. If you are the kind of person who seeks out to have every unlockable in the game, then this isn't too bad. I personally didn't quite like it, but I do enjoy unlocking the new transmutations, which let you make your cities bigger from the larger boosts they give, allowing you to get larger achievements.My main problem with the game is that I never really had a drive to play it more. I do enjoy this game, and whenever I play it I have fun, but I feel like I haven't got anything worthwhile left to do. The transmutations, which I am interested in unlocking, do not say what you need to do to get them, like the achievements do. I'd assume that getting an achievement also unlocks a corresponding transmutation, but this seems kind of inconsistent for me. Another thing I really don't like is that you can't see how much time you have left for your particular game. As I've said before, you can choose between a 30 minute session and a 60 minute one. You can also play an unlimited game with no time limit, but this doesn't contribute to your achievements. At the end of the time limit, your giants will go to sleep one by one. This is really annoying, because the time it takes and the order they go to sleep is all random. Many times I need to place just one improvement or one transmutation when the giant I need goes to sleep, resulting in me having to start a whole other game for the achievement I was just about to get. There are lots of things I like about this game, though. I always enjoy keeping balance between two greedy cities, or working to optimize my tile improvements to help the civilization with their projects. In conclusion, this is a fun game that is just too casual to be fully recommended. There are a few problems I have with the game that takes away from the experience, but if this sounds like something for you, go right on ahead. There's lots of ways to develop your cities, so each game stays pretty fresh, although sometimes the requirements of the achievements are quite limiting.  "

												Really great game for someone with a day off. At first its pretty addictive while you're learning the basic's, how to move, build, and maximize resources and unlocks. After tat initial day the game has a remarkable ability to drag you in for one to two hours, based on the time you have to spare.It gets annoying because you have to remember all the little tricks to be great at it, but after not playing for 2 months, that's pretty hard.I still play this game from time to time, though less and less often.Really recommend if on sale for a single day off.

												I was one of the people who was hit by the ""your graphics card does not support the XNA"" framework diologue box. that being said, once i got a graphics card that supports the XNA framework, the game is actually quite enjoyable. the game does take time to progress, but i found that the 30 minute game setting was a great study break.pros: great overall concept, good animations, the symbiosis idea is fantastic, and the gameplay is well-paced. it doesn't feel that rushed once you get the hang of it.cons: while the tutorials are great at explaining the basics of the game, there is a bit of a learning curve afterwards. i didn't find this to be too bad (i play EVE, and this is nowhere near that learning curve. i'd put it at about a Sim City 3000 learning curve). also the obligatory XNA framework stupidness.conclusion: if you have a dedicated graphics card that supports DX10 (the GTX400 series and later should do, no idea about ATI though, sorry), then go ahead and get this. if you have a first gen Intel processor and an Intel GMA, hold off for now. i'm not sure if the Intel HD series will run this, but i know the GMA will not.

												This game seems so simple. But, its got a supprizing amount of deph. It starts simple with your giants molding the earth. Then it just snowballs from there. You need to create enviroments for your cities using different combinations and the amount of combinations can be quite intimidating. Its on sale now on steam and for that price its really a steal. Its not game for everybody. Not for cod action fanatics. Still a good game and recommended for people who like these types of games.			"

												This game is  fun, kinda addictive social management game.   You make strikingly different cities, each with a resource focus, and must manage and control them to progress.   Your giants are kinda your avatars as they carry the abilities you will need to reach your goals.  Music is pretty great here too.There are some drawbacks however.  oftentimes your cities will go crazy for no reason at all. The game claims its when they are too fat and happy, but i found they would destroy themselves for no apparent reason even if they were dirt poor. Also the game gets really samey after awhile, but those first 8 or so hours are pretty golden.For the price, its right.  If management isnt your thing (a la black and white/populus/darwinia) then pass it.			"

												This is NOT a bad game. It’s not a game you shouldn’t buy.  It's just that while a lot of AAA games tend to be dumbed down for the masses the indie lot sometimes suffer from the contrary effect (not enough/proper/any focus groups?). Immediately after the tutorial ended this game started to really feel LIKE WORK. Do that, remember this, experiment with that, and BTW if the village settles 1 slot too close/too far then it's tough luck because you'll not have enough adjacent room for the grand symbiosis you were planning. Restart. Are you having fun yet? No. I’ve been playing god games from Populous times and now, after playing Reus, it think that reducing the concept to just one dimension might just be enough to brake it. Or maybe I’m just too old of a dog to learn new tricks.			"

												First off, If you're looking for quick gratification all the time, this game probably isn't for you. As you play the game you unlock new animals, plants, minerals and upgrades for the previously stated through a progression system built around achievements. The more achievements you manage to achieve in a single game period, the more you unlock. The game periods expand as you unlock more stuff and it goes back and forth. As you progress though, the challenges get much harder and take much more time and effort to complete. This can be devastating to your own morale when you lose but you can taste the fruits of your victory when you win.It's a game of experimentation, seeing what works and what doesn't, that comes with losing (not getting any or only one achievement). It takes a lot of patience, thought and effort like any true puzzle (only if you didn't use the internet to cheat). If you're willing to put the time into it though, this game can be a treat. I've personally enjoyed it.			"

												The first time I played this game I didn't play it very long. I thought it was gonna be a fun game to mess around with and just see what happens, but doing this gave me the feeling of not being able to do much pretty fast. Combining oceans/mountans with forests/swamps doesn't do anything different, having a wide range of mountains only prevents anyone from ever living there, and other than that there is just raising different plants, animals or minerals that people can use. I finished the longest era and thought I'd pretty much seen it by then, stopped playing it for about a year.Well last month I came back to the game and I'm enjoying it so much more now. Instead of wanting to mess around I noticed how many of the things I never unlocked in this game and decided to really complete it. It's a lot more challenging than I thought and I really love it. In the end I'm playing it far less like a god game and much more like a city building kind of game, which makes a lot more sense because it involves a lot more 'building' planning than being all powerful, it's just that the buildings are animals and plants brought to life.Anyway it's kind of hard to play this game in the background because at times you will need to spend quite some time looking up things on the wiki and thinking out a strategy to reach your next goal. However there are also some times where you just need to wait around for a while, because you've finished setting everything in place. This is where the gorgeous graphics and little details help a lot to still enjoy the time where you're doing nothing. I was quite surprised how far you can zoom in, much further than really necessary, and it'ce nice to see what's going on with this world you've created. Even though not much happens, everything is just so pretty to look at. And this really makes me want to unlock more things too, not just for the helpful effects but I really wonder what it will look like.I'm not sure what else to say about the game, I just wanted to make sure it gtes my recommendation.

												It feels good to be back and reviewing Reus. Let’s begin.I – Story [7/10]Reus is a simulation, god game from Abbey Games. Story-wise there’s not much to Reus. The player takes control of four elemental giants and uses their powers to indirectly influence humanity developments and expansions. It is very much a choose your own adventure style of game and it worked rather well with this one.II – UI [10/10]The user interface in Reus can be pretty intimidating if you rush in before you get a decent handle on what you’re doing. Not to worry, as the game provides you with an excellent tutorial to walk you through it. Once you’ve played through said tutorial, the world will be your oyster as far as Reus is concerned. Everything you need to see is plainly displayed on the screen. If you’re not sure what something is just from the icon, hovering over it with the pointer for a few seconds will tell you all that you need to know.III – Gameplay [9/10]Getting things to happen that you actually want to happen in Reus can be challenging at times. As I stated above, you cannot control any humans directly. You are left to influence any advances through using your god-like powers and shaping the world around them. In order to get things done, you’ll have to experiment around and see exactly what things will do in what locations. It’s all very much trial and error.Additionally, a balance must be kept between the giants and humanity. If you give too many resources to the humans, the can grow greedy. A high level of greed can lead to villages warring with each other or even with the giants themselves. There are several methods you can employ to keep the greed level in check. Certain combinations of symbioses with animals and minerals/plants can raise the village’s danger level. This makes the humans wary and keeps them too busy to get very greedy. Alternatively, you can sync up certain animals/minerals/plants to generate awe. This also keeps the humans in check and humble. Attacking the villages with the giants can cause the humans to become humble once more, but, on occasion, you may be left with no choice but to lay waste to their village in it’s entirety.Ultimately, it is your call on how you want things to take shape, but you’ll have to lead it carefully in that direction. IV – Content [8/10]There is a seriously large amount of content in Reus and it will take you quite some time to discover/unlock all of it. There are five types of biomes for humanity to settle and explore. There are a great many varieties of animals, minerals, and vegetation alike. The giants all have their fair share of powers, but I feel like there could have been a little bit more content in that department. Cultivating a world is hard work with a limited tool box, but it still gets the job done in an enjoyable manner.V – Visual [10/10]The artwork in Reus is hand-drawn and beautiful. The giants are all very detailed and unique. All the animal and plant life you’ll encounter throughout the game is likewise intricately detailed the more you zoom in on it. Reus is eye candy for sure and it makes the game that much better.VI – Audio [10/10]Music appears intermittently throughout Reus, but when it does, it’s fantastic. It’s very lighthearted, even during combat sequences, and often incorporates overtones of victory and accomplishment. The sound effects are, likewise, good. Whether your using your powers to help humanity or put it back in it’s place, the sounds are wonderful. They are also relative to how closely zoomed in you are on the map.VII – Overall [9/10]Overall, Reus is a great game with deep gameplay and balanced learning curve. I picked this one up during the Steam Holiday Sale (what a bargain), but I wouldn’t have felt bad for paying full price on this one. If you’re looking for a weekend activity, Reus is a good choice.

												If the greed of some humans does get the better of them, you can let them wage war on (and possibly destroy) other villages; you can try to punish them into a state of humility; or you can always opt for a good old-fashioned smiting via your rock giant's mountain ability. On one hand, it can be disappointing to destroy everything you've worked to help your humans build. On the other, demonstrating your tremendous power and sending a clear, wrathful message about how foolish the humans were to behave the way they did can be morbidly satisfying.Pretty much smite humans for being greedy what's not to like.

												Good solid Indi god game - but waaayy too much focus on replayability. I picked up this game on a sale, and I'm both glad to have picked it up, and to have done so whilst it was on sale. The gameplay works on a sort of time line, where you (the planet & gods) 'wake up' and try to shape a world for humans to grow in, until you fall asleep and the session ends. The next time you 'wake up' you find the world has become barren again, and the cycle continues. The game focuses on repeatedly playing through, to unlock more upgrades, to help you achieve more each time. It's kinda cool the first few times, but after a couple of games you get sick of what is essentially going through the same motions. You're supposed to play it diferently each time, and you have the scope to do that, but the variation and unlockables aren't enough to make it disimilar from previous plays, and it becomes less engaging. That's my only real issue with it. But as it's a core game mechanic it's a pretty big one. Otherwise it feels balanced and it works really well if you're just a casual gamer. In spite of this I'd still reccomend it, I have enjoyed playing it and I can tell I will go back to it.			"

												Ever wanted to control and build a civilization? Ever wanted to create and grow a society? Reus can do it!However, i prefer to take the more direct approach. example; Send a massive rock monster to an innocent village and smack the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Watch as it burns to the ground and children fall from windows aflame. Laugh as they are trampled in the panic. Reus is a game where you can basicly ♥♥♥♥ a community over for having too many rocks.10/10 would command and conquer			"

												First off, If you're looking for quick gratification all the time, this game probably isn't for you. As you play the game you unlock new animals, plants, minerals and upgrades for the previously stated through a progression system built around achievements. The more achievements you manage to achieve in a single game period, the more you unlock. The game periods expand as you unlock more stuff and it goes back and forth. As you progress though, the challenges get much harder and take much more time and effort to complete. This can be devastating to your own morale when you lose but you can taste the fruits of your victory when you win.It's a game of experimentation, seeing what works and what doesn't, that comes with losing (not getting any or only one achievement). It takes a lot of patience, thought and effort like any true puzzle (only if you didn't use the internet to cheat). If you're willing to put the time into it though, this game can be a treat. I've personally enjoyed it.			"

												A fun and interesting game that allows you to build a planet. Similar to the classic Black and White without the lengthy tutorial. The game is managed and played to your liking as you manipulate enviornments through the powers of your giants. Each Giant is a master of nature with the four basic terrains represented as Ocean, Mountain, Forrest, and Swamp. If you combine the powers of the giants you can create exotic elements and animals on your planet that will eventually spawn human civilization. If you cater to a civilization of humans by repsonding to their prayers you can advance them and unlock new powers and quests to complete. However, if you harbor to much to a civilization they may become greedy and warlike and destroy other tribes on your planet, and eventually attack your giants to defy you. How you maintain and build your planet is completely up to you as the overlord of the world.			"

												This game is a little different from other resource god sims I've played. It's less of a resource management game and more of a resource optimization game. You don't really get to choose what the resources get used for, but rather attempt to place the resources as efficiently as possible in order to build the things the humans want.The art style is very clean, colorful, and has a very distinct style. The music is relaxing. The game mechanics are simple, but interesting, operating on a 2D circular planet. The only real downside I find this game has is that in the early ""era"" games, you are limited to a 60-minute game which feels very restrictive. I can see how this is a necessary balancing mechanic given that the giants' powers don't really cost anything other than a cooldown time. However, it did mean that the game didn't start really feeling interesting until I started unlocking longer time-spans (which is done through earning acheivements).Overall, I think I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of it. It's simple, it's fun, and it's a little different from other games out there.			"

												Im not a hundred percent sure what this is supposed to be. The mechanics are actually kind of difficult since you can only control the giants and its up to you to use thier powers in such a way that you allow the humans to prosper the best they can.. which is a ♥♥♥♥in nightmare.. personally i Havnt played this a lot its really not my thing but as far as I've seen the gameplay is unique to this game.. Like Secrets of Raetikon or whatever this is just a unique game that ""Could"" be great fun to the right people so yea .. ill reccomend this to anyone whos litterally bored of the rest of thier games otherwise probably not a great use of your money if youd prefer something else at all =)			"

												This game is really buggy. I had a swamp village that needed 150 science for a druid and I had a total of 92 science boosts from tiles inside the village borders, yet the village was stuck at 72/74 science.I hate the fact that the game requires you to unlock things from timed games. Not my idea of fun. Also villagers attacking giants with spears when they get too prosperous is a really stupid idea.If you are on the fence on Reus, I would recommend you pass on it. Go get something, anything else to play.			"

But they can be over come be greed, starting wars with other villages. That can sometimes can be annoying because the only solution to that is to destroy the village, resulting in all your hard work was a waste of time. The game is visually interesting and the gameplay is simple although some concepts are unecessarily complicated.This game has lots of potential, the idea is wonderful and most aspects are done well.69/100			"

												I normally don't like any civilization-building or strategy type games, but I really liked this. I was drawn to it because of the art, it just looked so pretty and it was on sale! I love games where there are a huge number of achievements and possibilities. This game is great. Visually, it is very nice and calming, though simple. You control 4 giants that control different aspects of life on the planet; for example, the Rock Giant can create mountains and deserts, ore mines, can give upgrades to a few different parts of the game, and can destroy villages with earthquakes. (Other giants are swamp, forest, and ocean)You have to create a balance...two of the giants can give different types of animals, two can give different plants, and one can give ores/minerals. Each land type (swamp, forest, ocean, desert, and mountain) creates different options for what resource can be placed, and each resource gives off a different reward (wealth, food, technology, danger, etc.) (Example - you can use the Ocean Giant's animal resource in the forest and get a chicken or swamp for a frog (each area has a different outcome.)) Placing certain things beside each other will, also, give special rewards. You can use the upgrades from each giant to transform the resource into a better and different one that may give off different rewards. As you build up your planet, humans will settle and begin building villages. As they become more prosperous, they start trying to build shrines, churches, trade markets, schools, etc. Each one requires a certain amount of wealth, food, etc so you have to carefully plan out where to place everything for the most reward in a small space. There is a time limit, you can open longer times as you play. You can also unlock new animals, plants, ores, achievements, etc. If you don't get the balance right, the village may not thrive. If the village becomes to prosperous, it may cause wars against each other, or even against the giants themselves. This game can be maddening and overwhelming, especially when you are still a low level, but it really fun and rewarding when you accomplish your goals. I enjoy playing it when I just need to relax or, maybe, take out some villages with some swamp slime.  "

Every aspect of the game influences every other part. The best way I can describe it is one part populous, one part sim earth, one part puzzle, with a time limit and progessive fun and aspects that is deep and rewarding, alongside real time challenges that arrive to give you frantically moving to solve or not, given they may be conflicting in nature.A great buy for the cost.

Good music in a game of this type is a must.- Free-play mode has barred features that can only be unlocked by playing the campaign.- The campaign is nothing more than free-play mode with a 30 minute time limit.- Achievements (most of them) are tied to the campaign and can’t be unlocked in free-play mode.Overall, even if you like the game, there’s not much to do or see after only a few hours of gameplay.Reus: 7.0 / 10.0			"

Everything about it just makes sense and all the little things you figure out by trying new combos really open up new strategies!Bottom Line: Get this game if you like City Building OR God Games.I am currently playing it on my C720 Chromebook!(Xubuntu installed currently, probably going back to Fedora soon though.

												It looks like a real-time strategy, but it's more of a ""real-time puzzle."" You terraform the land and manage it's flora and fauna and watch as the human population settles around what you've created and, if they grow too greedy, war with each other. Certain achievements unlock resources that may be used in future sessions to advance humanity even further. Overall an addicting experience, with a nice graphical charm all its own. Relaxing to play, unless you're scrambling in the final minutes of a session to finish off that one last challenge; Exhilirating if you pull it off. Definitely recommended.			"

												I had high hopes for this game when I saw trailers for it. I thought it looked ""AMAZING!!!"". Being able to shape your own world and rule over villages with 4 gods. However of all the games I got excited for and bought the second it came out... It was just ""ok"". It was fun for the first round goofing around with the giants, testing out their skills. But then like that the 30 minute timer was over. I tried to unlock the 60 minute mode but I realized this isn't a goof off god simulator, it's a strategy game. Giving the resources to whichever village needs it, smiting the vilages that have become bloodthirsty or who defy you. And that may seem  fun. But it isn't. I have played over 22 hours trying to unlock the 1 hr mode but I am not that good in this game, because it isn't meant to be fun it is meant to be a puzzle to get achievments to unlock more game time (and buildings) to unlock more achievements. And really that's all this game is. Before each session you can choose which 3 of the many acheivments you'd like to strive for. It sold itself as a fun god simulator. While it is, it just isn't really that fun after the initial first hour or 2. This game would be perfect for people who love a challenge and figure out the best way to put the earth together.But I am not that person. In the end it's just an ""ok"" game. If the timer wasn't so limiting it might be better. (Oh also there is an infinite time mode but it just isn't satisfying because you have to unlock a ton of buildings from the timed sessions.)			"

												This game would be pretty sweet if everything didn't move at a tenth of an inch per hour. I mean really, pretty much all the systems feel well thought out, the combinations feel clever (most of the time, at any rate), but it all moves SO SLOWLY. There's no option for fast forwarding as far as I can tell, and barring that or a boost in default game speed, I can't recommend it unless you're significantly more patient than I am.			"

												This is the resource management part of Civ on crack. This game makes you manage growth and forces you to think long-term, and the ambassador system complements that well. The variety of possible resource combinations and the ""platformer"" aesthetic is a combination that takes some getting used to, as well as the unique interface of using 4 giants to do anything. But once you get the hang of it, it's very easy to get hooked into hour-long games. The achievements challenge you with different playstyles, and helps keep a high replay value. Very fun game, worth a try.			"

												A very enjoyable puzzle/god game. It manages to blend casual atmosphere and a surprising degree of strategy together seamlessly, while still remaining fun to play. The look and feel of the game is lovely. Reus manages to be both a challenging and relaxing experience simultaneously, and I recommend it highly.Der 2D-Grafikstyle des Spiels ist wunderbar. Alles ganz fein gezeichnet und liebevoll animiert. Überhaupt hat dies Spiel einen ganz eigenen Character des Aussehens. Für mich eine gänzlich neue Erfahrung-Das Spiel ist eine Mischung aus Godgame, Aufbau- und Strategie. Strategisch von der Seite her - man sollte genau schauen, das man zueinander passende Produkte auf der Erde plaziert, wie z.B. Beeren, und genau darauf Hühner. Dies gibt noch einmal einen ExtraBonus in der Erzeugung von Nahrungsgütern.			"

												Reus is a surprisingly deep strategy game where you indirectly control the growth of villages through the seeding power of four giants. Playing the game multiple times and achieving certain goals unlocks new plants, animals and minerals, that help your villages flourish. There is something particularly satisfying about testing out different combinations and watching it all come together in the form of huge caches of food, wealth and/or tech. But it also requires balance as being over generous to your world can turn villages greedy, resulting in war with other villages or even the giants themselves.			"

												Reus is simple enough to get into for a casual half-hour game here and there, but if you are a big fan of strategy games then the resource development trees offer enough complexity to keep you coming back to better your scores and get more achievements (unlocking more things to place/build). I hit a wall after about 8 hours when I first started playing Reus and left it alone for a while (a recent splurge meant I had other exciting new titles to switch to). It was a few months before I came back. I found the Walkthrough page on wiki.reusgame.com gave me enough pointers on my return to properly get into more advanced town-building tactics, focussing on using the symbiotic relationships a bit better. I do still have to pause the game a lot to check reference charts, but with regular playing they're becoming more familiar.I am a big fan of strategy games, and I think if you're not then your interest in Reus may be short lived. Except that I guess if you like god-games for the ""Release Godzilla!"" type of actions, then Reus will allow you to build a world and then watch it burn in a variety of ways. And what an attractive looking world it can be.			"

												I so badly wanted to like this game, but the tutorial killed it for me. Not only did it seem long-winded (a half hour of tutorial play and you still aren't released on your own to enjoy the game), but over thought. Instead of exploring the game and discovering abilities on a trial basis, you're told exactly how things work and where you can and can't place abilities. The long cool off times are frustrating and the micromanaging and constant reloading of graphics doesn't sit well with most MacBook Pros. Sadly, Reus plays like a clunky iPhone app that looks appealing but has very little staying power.			"

												A fun, friendly little god game where you control four elemental giants as they rebuild the world and shape it to help it's inhabitants prosper.  The old adage, simple to learn, yet tough to master definitely applies here, as there's a lot of interplay between what abilities the giants use to shape the environment.  Forests and swamps won't appear without some oceans nearby, but desert biomes need to be separated from the sea,  As well, some animals, plants and minerals have a form of symbiosis with one another, and making chains of terrain that stack bonuses with one another is very satisfying.  Throw in small independent human towns that spring up and depend upon you to help them thrive without becoming greedy by growing too fast, completing challenges that unlock new creatures, plants and minerals, and you've got a fantastic game with great replayability.  Well worth the look!			"

												Reus is far from a bad game, but it is very difficult to actively recommend it. From personal experience during the first four hours of so I had an absolute blast trying out different combinations of powers and land types. It's quite enjoyable to unlock new structures and lands that can then help you achieve further unlocks.Unfortunately there is a mechanic where towns will actively go to war if they suddenly get too many resources, and if ther aren't any towns to attack they will prey on your titans. At first this was a nice challenge and forced me to try to up danger levels as well put the titans other skills to use. However when building upgrades are on a time limit you're forced into the position of increasing resources and boundaries, but then if the resources you need don't produce danger you have to put up with beating down warring jackasses for the next couple of minutes until they finally simmer down.It is unbelivably frustrating and it is unfortunate because up until that moment it was a fun game. Perhaps there was some secret method or technique I hadn't discerned to make the game less aggravating in the longer modes? I think it bears repeating that Reus is looks amazing and the general gameplay is interesting and enjoyable - up to a point. You will at least wring a few hours out of it, but if you're a completionist you will have to weather some extremely trying mechanics.			"

												A great game that you can lose yourself in for hours at a time. The art style isn't very memorable but not under-whelming. I found the rounds with time limits are far more fun than the mode without. You can upgrade your 'Gods' in a rogue-like leveling system that is very creative. And there are many ways to combine luxuries, food etc. to enhance or hinder other luxuries, food etc. While it definitely had parts that stood out, there was still quite a bit that comes standard with God games or the like. I was hooked on it when I first bought it, but after playing something else and coming back, it wasn't as fun. Maybe it's just me, but after my initial playthrough, I just didn't want to play this game again.			"

												Good fun. Grinding to unlock some of the natural sources can take a while, and the random choices of projects is annoying when you only have a few left to atttain...Interesting take on a god game, specialisations and projects leave you thinking about how to lay everything out to lead to the highest prosperity whilst also trying to avoid greed... Tea is overpowered, which is nice since I drink so much myself.Remember to enable beta and use the advanced options for the tiny (50 plots) and large (150 plots). Needs some polishing in the descriptions of specialisations and bringing everything into consistency, but doesn't detract from the game.			"

												Reus is a great game that involves controlling 4 giants. They are the swamp, earth, water, and forest giants. Each of them has unique powers, but are usefull even when in other giants areas! Villages will rise if you give the world enough resources, and you get to help them or destroy them. Giving them too much will make them greedy. Not giving them enough resources will make them resort to war for resources. If you like games that let you ""Become A God"", this is an excellent choice!			"

												Probably one of the best value gifts I've ever received. The learning curve is pretty steep, but once the player figures out his or her basic set-up and learns which aspects benefit the player better earlier or later, the game is really fun (and adorable). The acheivement system provides a linear system of game-play and gives the player a set of goals. Some are much more difficult to acheive than others, but you're not locked into the ones that are too difficult.On the downside, there are a couple minor glitches in which the giants freeze and will not move, but saving and reloading the save fixes the problem.

												Reus is a lighter game than I originally thought it was, but it also feels very comfortable in the game that it is.Reus plays to me like a cross between Doodle God and Civilization super-light edition. You play with just yourself to help some number of civilizations to live and develop on a planet. Through your giants, you improve/create/plant various substances to encourage food, tech, and wealth. Over time, special projects will be proposed and you will have to make sure the requirements are met within the time.By helping the people to develop, you unlock more plants, animals, spells, etc. to use in the future. Some (""developments"") are persistant such as unlocking new plants. Others are for that game only.The games are timed when trying to make progress (versus free play where there is no time limit but developments cannot be unlocked) which also helps the goals feel more interesting to achieve. There is definitely a difficulty curve that is pleasant that appears as one tries to balance the needs of several settlements at once including choosing to destroy settlements.So long as you go in with the correct perspective, the art style and well-rounded-ness of the game can prove for a fun experience. My experience with Reus has thus far been short, but more unlocks will only add to the game surely.			"

												Good solid Indi god game - but waaayy too much focus on replayability. I picked up this game on a sale, and I'm both glad to have picked it up, and to have done so whilst it was on sale. The gameplay works on a sort of time line, where you (the planet & gods) 'wake up' and try to shape a world for humans to grow in, until you fall asleep and the session ends. The next time you 'wake up' you find the world has become barren again, and the cycle continues. The game focuses on repeatedly playing through, to unlock more upgrades, to help you achieve more each time. It's kinda cool the first few times, but after a couple of games you get sick of what is essentially going through the same motions. You're supposed to play it diferently each time, and you have the scope to do that, but the variation and unlockables aren't enough to make it disimilar from previous plays, and it becomes less engaging. That's my only real issue with it. But as it's a core game mechanic it's a pretty big one. Otherwise it feels balanced and it works really well if you're just a casual gamer. In spite of this I'd still reccomend it, I have enjoyed playing it and I can tell I will go back to it.			"

												Excellent challenge pacing.  The achievements push you toward different strategies rather than simply rewarding progress. It makes for good conveyance. I like that the play sessions are broken up by the stage timer (30/60/120mins). It keeps things from turning into a slog. It feels like it's halfway between GodFinger and SimCity. It's casual with a few degrees of complexity that should satisfy a hardcore gamer who wants to relax, or a casual gamer who's looking to step it up.			"

												Reus is a 'god' simulator whereby players are given control of 4 elemental giants: water, forest, swamp and rock. Each giant has a unique skill set that allows them to place materials and enchant materials in the world to improve their value. The three resources are technology, wealth and food.Reus has an 'arcade' style feel as players are given a choice about how long they wish a game session to last and are tasked with attempting to develop a world with the most 'prosperity' rating they can get. Placing materials in the world to improve village's prosperity and controlling their developement to minimize the risk of your human becoming too greedy. In-game achievements, when earned, unlock additional building and uprading options for future games.Different materials that can be placed have complex interactions with the surrounding world. These complex relationships ensure that players have a challenge to ahceive very high synergy in their worlds. Your villages will begin projects that require certain amounts of resources. Large projects will require a very well constructed village to be able to acquire enough resources to complete them. Overall, the art style is fantastic. The resource synergy system introduces a great challenge and the game will keep making you want to come back to try to finish the difficult projects and acheivements. The advancement that each world takes on can be random, and while there is some repitition, the game does well to create a new experience each time you play. There are also several game modes that can be selected to stream line the type of game you wish to play. "

												The play time seems to fly away as the gameplay is complex enough to intrigue and infuriate while being rather simple: maximise resources, appropriately.Those that enjoy a strategy in a colourful and beautifully presented game that designs the development of humanity on the globe would like this.  It is definitely something that fills time without dragging as you are managing and changing strategies.  As well as this, there are plenty of achievements to aim for; hours of fun to show that you can nurture humanity to a golden age!It is simply well done :)			"

												I had high hopes for this game when I saw trailers for it. I thought it looked ""AMAZING!!!"". Being able to shape your own world and rule over villages with 4 gods. However of all the games I got excited for and bought the second it came out... It was just ""ok"". It was fun for the first round goofing around with the giants, testing out their skills. But then like that the 30 minute timer was over. I tried to unlock the 60 minute mode but I realized this isn't a goof off god simulator, it's a strategy game. Giving the resources to whichever village needs it, smiting the vilages that have become bloodthirsty or who defy you. And that may seem  fun. But it isn't. I have played over 22 hours trying to unlock the 1 hr mode but I am not that good in this game, because it isn't meant to be fun it is meant to be a puzzle to get achievments to unlock more game time (and buildings) to unlock more achievements. And really that's all this game is. Before each session you can choose which 3 of the many acheivments you'd like to strive for. It sold itself as a fun god simulator. While it is, it just isn't really that fun after the initial first hour or 2. This game would be perfect for people who love a challenge and figure out the best way to put the earth together.But I am not that person. In the end it's just an ""ok"" game. If the timer wasn't so limiting it might be better. (Oh also there is an infinite time mode but it just isn't satisfying because you have to unlock a ton of buildings from the timed sessions.)			"

												A game that I found hugely enjoyable, with lots of replay value as no two games you run are likely to be the same. Cute and cleverly designed giants, with an overall level design that's very easy on the eyes. Easy to pick up but the harder you work at it the more challenging it becomes, and the better you get the harder the game gets for you to achieve the same level of success.In some ways reminiscent of Black & White, however you don't interact directly with the people and instead can only instruct the giants to do your bidding.Would recommend to anyone who enjoys logic puzzles, or anyone wanting to take a break from FPS games. Adorable, interesting, puzzling, challenging. 9/10 "

U create ocians, mountains, forests and swamps... then people come they want to live happily ever after and they want more of your gifts, but beware if u gave them much they will become greedy and they will want more and more and event try to kill your giants if they are not satisfied.Basicaly u just try to make happy living planet, few villages on it, it may seems easy at first, but after few hours u discover there is pretty deep rules and every progress will require understanding of game principles and deep strategy.For this price definitely must buy!

I hit a wall after about 8 hours when I first started playing Reus and left it alone for a while (a recent splurge meant I had other exciting new titles to switch to). It was a few months before I came back. I found the Walkthrough page on wiki.reusgame.com gave me enough pointers on my return to properly get into more advanced town-building tactics, focussing on using the symbiotic relationships a bit better. I do still have to pause the game a lot to check reference charts, but with regular playing they're becoming more familiar.I am a big fan of strategy games, and I think if you're not then your interest in Reus may be short lived. Except that I guess if you like god-games for the ""Release Godzilla!"" type of actions, then Reus will allow you to build a world and then watch it burn in a variety of ways. And what an attractive looking world it can be.			"

												In games like Reus, replay value needs to be high. Sadly, my experience with Reus in this regard has proven to be poor. While fun to play, the game requires constant resetting to start a new ""world"". Given the amount of times Reus requires this, the content should be much greater and less dull. Building a world requires quite a lot of effort and once time runs out, players are essentially forced to start over from scratch to reach new goals. I can see this system working for some, but for me it only serves to frustrate. Since the game is fun and worthwhile for a decent amount of time I'm giving it a 7.5 out of 10 instead of lower. Get it during a sale is my advice.			"

												In this game you can control nature but you can't control people.You manipulate nature through Gigants, sort of elemental semi gods. They have different abilites for terraforming and controlling natural resources. The Gigants can use their abilities in different combinations in order to increase richness and help populations grow and get more resources. If enough resources are left on an unclaimed area, a new tribe will settle, as the villages grow, humans will start different projects and your challenge is to help them complete those projects. As a reward for helping them, they will give an ambassador for each project completed. The ambassador can join a specific Gigant, giving them new powers or improving their old ones. People will continue starting bigger and bigger projects, raising the challenge level quite fast. Each project will require different types of resources and your goal is to help them get what they need from nature. Eventually, the different settlements will start competing for space and resources, they will fight and die to each other and even attack the gigants if they are greedy enough.The mechanics are simple. The game is easy to learn but the dificulty raises before you know it. Your decisions will profoundly affect the world so one miscalculation can mean the ruin for you and your villages.The tutorial teaches you all you need to know (it is basically letting you play a normal game with assistance texts) You can pause the game to think and even give your gigants orders during pauses. Also you can save at any point in case you need to backtrack your steps.An experience I definitely enjoyed and would recommend to anyone. Weather you are looking for new game styles, are into indie gems or simply want a fun way to spend your time, consider giving this one a try.			"

												This is a great little game! I found this on a really good sale the other night and have gotten more than my moneys worth. It's not rediculously difficult by any means but it's not as comedic and silly as I was expecting. There is a slight learning curve because it is a game of balances. Everything you use as a giant has another piece that will counteract or enhance the first. By having this systems, Reus becomes more of a puzzle game than a true ""GOD"" game. You will have to experiment with many different systems to create a perfect world. If you are looking only for a game where you hurl fireballs at innocent villagers, this may not be the game for you. I would recommend this for someone who is looking for a sharp cartoonish looking, casual, world building game. My only complaint is that there is no controller support. The controls are fairly basic and could translate easily to a gamepad. With the way this game looks, I would love to sit on the couch after work and play via Big Picture.			"

Product received for free
												1- GENERAL Reus is a strategy God game where your control and coordinate 4 different giants (oceans, forests, rocks and swamps) to provide to a planet conditions to humans to settle and prosper. From where do the humans arrive? Who knows, but they came in a donkey.  You start in an empty planet when the giants awake, and then you have to coordinate them and all of the available abilities to sustain life and unlock new stuff during the predefined amounts of gameplay time. Yes, you are not able to choose how many time your gamewill last...  2- GAMEPLAY You start from playing 3 different tutorial, and they are very good to be honest, and then you start your slow paced journey through eras. Having no fast forward option surely helps giving the slowish feeling to this game. Placing minerals, plants in animals in the correct spots to boost production to the max is the secret. This resources will allow us to finish projects that will give us ambassadors, that unlock new abilities, that will allow us to upgrade the resources, to allow new projects to get new ambassadors, to unlock... you understand the point. In top of that you are not able to select projects, and people sometimes are bumb and select projects impossible to finish. Some upgrades are worse than the previous version of the resource, and I do not know that previously to the upgrade. That's not normal. If you give a lot of resources at a time, people will start to become greedy and will start wars against other villages or even against the giants, and then you'll have to just finish them off. That is fun, but some achievements depends in having war, and you need villages to have those. Bummer! It's not hard to unlock all content, but you can get bored quite easily with the lack of content of the game.   3- CONCLUSION This is a small and fun game, but with not much to offer. The general mechanics of the game is very good, but I was a bit disappointed with it. It seemed different when I saw some gameplay. Do not get me wrong, the game is fun and entertaining, but it lacks some must have stuff of this kind of games. At the moment only costs €9,99 and I think this is a fair price for what the game offers.

												This is a really fun God game, with interesting mechanics and surprisingly deep strategy.What's really nice about this game is how easy it is to pick-up-and-play, but how deep it can be after prolonged play. With every round of the game, you complete different achievements, which in turn unlock new things to create, and new modes.However, this game requires a little bit of patience. If you are looking for a short and sweet game, this may not be for you.If you're a fan of God games, or are simply looking for a unique take on an expanding game, this is for you. However, if you don't like long play sessions, waiting or strategy games, I'd steer clear from this game.			"

												A ""god"" management game where you use giants to create resources and strive to furfill to the villagers needs. This leads them to give you an ""ambassador"" which allows your giants to do additional stuff..Mainly to do the same thing already stated. My main gripe with this game is the lack of purpose you have other then to serve the people, which wouldn't be so bad if they did other intresting things, but they don't..Would not buy this game at current price. 6/10.

												I tend to only play Reus when I'm traveling, but that doesn't mean it's not a great game. I really enjoy it, and it's challenging in unique ways. I'm not very adept at it, but even for someone not overly good at the game, it's really entertaining. I like to play it when I travel (via train) as it passes time very well. I get motion sickness from reading while in motion (even on trains), and once you get the hang of reus, the reading is very minimal. I should play it more often now that I think about it.			"

												For the most part this is a very mellow game of shaping the planet to help the people that live on it. Each playthrough is 30-120 minutes, but the real game is in completing challenges that unlock new things for the next playthrough. Once you get to the harder ones you'll have to watch everything carefully, and you'll curse the stupidity of people going to war for reasons you couldn't prevent. It's a very unique take on the ""god game"" genre, and probably my favorite.			"

												Good fun. Grinding to unlock some of the natural sources can take a while, and the random choices of projects is annoying when you only have a few left to atttain...Interesting take on a god game, specialisations and projects leave you thinking about how to lay everything out to lead to the highest prosperity whilst also trying to avoid greed... Tea is overpowered, which is nice since I drink so much myself.Remember to enable beta and use the advanced options for the tiny (50 plots) and large (150 plots). Needs some polishing in the descriptions of specialisations and bringing everything into consistency, but doesn't detract from the game.			"

												This is a very good game, in my opinion. However, it requires far more patience than I have and I feel like most people have. There is so, *so* much content to it, but a great deal of it is blocked behind a massive time wall. You will be lucky to unlock one or two new plants, animals, or structures after an hour long game. The game's progress is measured through very difficult tiered achievements, making it a very hard game to recommend.On the plus side, it means that there's always something to look forward to, but you'll need to ask yourself how big that ""something"" needs to be for it to be worth it. You can potentially get hundreds of hours of entertainment out of this game, but you'll have to really, really enjoy the act of slowly, *slowly* progressing through it.It goes on sale often enough, at a very affordable price. Buy it then, and it'll definitely be worth it.			"

												*Not I mostly played this offline when I was stranded in a rural area so my actual game time is ~20 hours.This is, as others have said, a puzzle placement game. However, I think it is also something of a god game. Other reviews have mentioned greed levels getting way out of control and only being able to be brought down by destroying part of the villages; this is not true. Typically, destroying any armies sent out by villages increases their awe rating; as long as you continue to perform miracles and/or kill insurgents, no one will challenge you. This is a challenging god game with a heavy reliance on synergy, balance, and intimate knowledge of the game's mechanics. While the unlock system is annoying and the game becomes unwieldy during longer sessions, it is satisfying and has a lot of heart.TLDR; Greed can be controlled by awe and redistribution of wealth. Game requires certain goals to be met to unlock new gameplay. Annoying during longer play sessions but overall a great experience.			"

												Very interesting.That's pretty much what I have to say about it.Obviously I'm kidding, but this game just gets  boring . It's very fun on the first playthrough, and I had a blast in the sandbox-like mode. But this game easily bores you. It might get confusing for someone looking at this review and seeing my hours, but that was my hours trying to find any fun after the first five or so. I've played off and on for the past year, but I just can't recommend this game to may people. So, decide for yourself. Pros - Cute graphics- Easy controls- Lots of things to upgrade- Giants are balanced and are not super OP- Fun for the first playthrough Cons  - Amount of work to get something upgraded even on easy- Balancing happiness and greed can be very difficult (game-breaking difficult)- Weird pacing - Acts more like a puzzle game than anything elseSo if you like puzzle games that can be quite difficult, this game is for you. If you like god games or anything else advertised... ehh... wait for the Universim to come out.			"

												Absolutely flawless timeconsumer. Love it. However since I got 100% acheivements it doesn't lure me back. Challenges set by those achievements are quite hard as long as player is willing to stick to using all sources. Replayability isn't ultra high, since people are randomized - they go to different projects thus producing different bonuses further changing your terraforming focus around their city. Interface takes some time to get used to even for moba players. Graphics and music are adorable, they make user wanna come back, unless of course one has completed achievements thus unlocking all game elements. Game lacks global scoreboard or any other element of player-player intaraction, but than again planet has fixed number of spaces and people can develop limited number of projects thus mathematically one can produce highest possible score without any options for other players, apart from repeating the scheme.Overall 8+/10			"

												A charming, simple, world-building game. If you don't consult the wiki it will challenge your memory for what plants, animals and minerals go where, what they can be transmuted into and what bonuses they give each other. To build the world you want and satisfy the humans you will have to plan far ahead. It's almost a puzzle game in that regard.There is considerable variety to be had, aiming for all the achievements will require many different worlds and styles of play. And there's just something satisfying about the gentle pace of progress and lovely animations that will keep you coming back.			"

												An intriguing god sim with with beautiful visuals and interesting mechanics. Overall a good  and challenging indie game that has occupied me for many hours so far and that I keep coming back to every now and again. It does, however, have some small issues that stop it from reaching it's full potential; 1. Unlocking further upgrades and paths via achievements can be fairly tedious, although it does ensure multiple playthroughs using different styles and gives a purpose to achievement hunting I suppose.2. as far as I can tell there is no visual guide to the various upgrade paths of different resources or what is required to do so. I often must have the wiki with it's upgrade webs open on a different screen to plan out what I want to do. As it currently stands you can only preview what the next immediate upgrades will be and the rest relies on remembering what turns into what.3. there are some minor stability issues very infrequently though (crashes, and does not like it when you hibernate/stand by your computer while the game is open.) The Auto save function almost always covers this issue though.Again, despite these minor grievances a great game for those who enjoy strategy/ god sims, would definitely recommend especially if it is on sale.

												The best thing in this game is the progression. When compared to other games like this most often you need to lose/fail to get any progresion (Don't starve comes to mind). In this game actually you can (and should) win a scenario to progress further.And it does a superb way doing this. First when you start the game it seems like a simple game with not really many choices, but as you win scenarios and complete achievements your choices will widen, and you will be able to do really special combos.Anothe important aspect is the randomness. First of all in this genre you do not want something too random, because it screws with your planning. You do not want something too predictable, because repeat scenarios would become boring. I think the game has perfectly found middle ground in this aspect too.Absolutely recommended.			"

												Looking for a somewhat different economical strategy game with gorgeous comic graphic and a god-mechanic? Look no further. Reus is a complex strategy game based all around cultivating a planet, building settlements and helping the people by terraforming, influencing nature and enriching the lands. To do this you are given four giants with different elements and abilities. Combining these abilities is crucial in keeping your settlers developing. You can even get new abilities for your giants which helps you specialize.A very rewarding and unique game that i can recommend to everybody who likes Anno, Tropico or similar games.			"

												FIRST OFF, I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GOOD GAME, ONE THAT PEOPLE COULD ENJOY. HOWEVER, I PERSONALLY CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO TRY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT FOR A SALE.Reus has a whole lot of interesting ideas and features to it. It has a really complex and intricate system and the mechanics of the game compliment this. I personally bought the game because I love god games, I have played Black and White (and 2), populous, dungeon keeper (and 2) and these games are all really great. Mastering control over a 2d planet and its inhabitants sounded like a really cool idea to me. Unfortunately it wasn't my thing, the idea of re-playability to me is being able to invent and control your own game every time. I understand that you are not supposed to be able to control the populous to a great extent, but I ended up playing what felt the same type every time. The achievements and unlocks I was trying to accomplish were obfusticated by these villagers. I'm sure if I stuck with it, I'd be unlocking plenty of features of the game, but I couldn't figure out how to do so. The guides and people's Q and A's did not really help. I was stumbling a lot. I felt that the unlocks should have been changed to meeting certain, more specific (and controllable) criteria. What I mean by this is that borders should have influences (people should build out for the resources they want) and projects built should be based around certain needs (so if there are tons of fish in the ocean, then they should build a harbour rather than a school, its very frustrating). This would have worked a lot better, giving the player more control for what they want to do but not give then complete power over their villages. The main issue is that villagers build what they want to build and start essentially when they want to start. You have very little control over this besides a few environmentally-based projects and smashing down a project you don't want built. This is a nice and interesting feature, but time constraints make it feel as if I'm constantly working against the villagers. Rather than actually helping these people out and feeling that I earnt the achievement I was going for, I feel I am competing or fighting against the people. It isn't a nice feeling. The gruel of getting achievements is also slow, I understand that this is the main part of the game, but you essentially build up the same way to get the same things to expand your horizons later. Also, I have a small gripe with you seeing the achievements you already have when you are finished with an era. Why do I need to see these again? It confused me into thinking I didn't have these, initially creating a false sense of mass achievement. Not too big of a deal, but still there.I feel this is more a game that doesn't appeal to me, rather than being a bad game. I just wrote this review in case there are those of you who are like me and might have similar expectations.			"

A wonderful 2D take on the classic God game genre that shouldnt be missed, especially considering its insanely low price.

												At first glance and the first couple playthroughs this seems like an awesome fun experience, but after that comes the grind.  Projects so advanced you can't get them without either a math degree or upgrades you have yet to unlock.  The game just starts an arms race with the player and wins.  I loved my first 10 hours with the game but the rest of my time in it is from missing the game, starting a run, and getting frustrated that every single project I need to do requires me to have a plant or animal I haven't unlocked and then just quitting without finishing the game.

												This game took me by the heart.Normally, I would dismiss such a game as a time-killing iPad app in PC clothing. But something about the charm of it lead me to anticipate its release.Reus takes everything wrong with humanity and wraps it up in an atmosphere of childish innocense--- a beautiful take on our own world and on who we are.The gameplay, smooth and accomodating, can be called puzzle-solving on analysis but does not feel that way at all; it feels like everything you do is for a reason and yields a natural consequence as in any good simulator. The challenge and reward system also makes for a heap of replayability and excitement for more to work with as you progress.My only wish is that there had been more content and greater limits to strive toward--- but that is my desire of any great game. I'm looking forward to Abbey Games' additional contributions to my library.			"

												Reus is a rather simple game, and although I like it I have to admit that it best serves it's function as a session based game - the kind that you play rarely but get an urge to come back to.The reason why my rating is ""not recommended"" is simple, at 9.99$ this game is simply not worth it, as far as it's mechanics go. The artwork is really well done, the soundtrack fits the theme, and the game is rather challenging if you want to unlock all of the different resources available to be collected.However, I find it important to note that the game had an update that turned off the ""feature"" of blocking achievements being unlocked in it's ""alt mode"" (which makes earning them a sane prospect instead of nigh-impossible in some cases), and that it really is very simplistic in it's game mechanics.I really like this game for the price I got it at, when it was on sale, however 9.99$ is asking for nice artwork and a nice soundtrack instead of a game with more than one-dimensional mechanics of interaction.

												Reus is a world-building simulation style game, where your god-like interaction with the world is done by way of four giant monoliths with magical powers. You and your four vast minions will help grow small settlements of nomads into bustling village-sized cities, providing the citizens with enough resources to survive, expand and thrive. At first glance Reus seems like a very small and simple god game done a thousand times before, but upon further inspection the game reveals a huge level of complexity that is both shocking and fantastically deep.Reus only really has one real gameplay mode – Era . The aim of Era is to work towards completing all of the available achievements in the game, and Reus serves up a generous dose of replayability with a staggering 120-odd levels to grapple with. This replayability is thanks in no small part to the curious way in which you control the lives of your nomads.The mysterious Planet of the Creepy Giants is an artistic 2D slice of barren rock onto which the environments, plants, animals and minerals are spawned from your giant helpers, and the lack of space means efficiency is key. A village might start a project to complete a school or church, and it’s up to you to find the space to squeeze in the mind-numbing amount of food, wealth or technology the project requires. Enter symbiosis,the mechanic where every object your giants summon has the potential to interact with nearly any other object in the game and every base object has about 4 – 6 different ways to evolve.Reus is a very pretty game to play, if a little repetitive at times. Your 2D slice of planet-pie has a 3D-like surface. The game’s major weakness is the lack of art assets, borne from its small development roots. When every blueberry bush and snake den has the same picture, a row of the same resource breaks the immersion of world-building somewhat, and replaces it with a slightly lesser world-assembly feel instead, and this jarring sensation does hurt the feeling of power and mastery a good god game strives for.Similarly due to the small team the game was built by, the other major weakness Reus suffers is a poor user interface. The graphics options allow users with poor eyesight to change the resolution to the lowest settings, but even when all the icons and fonts are as large as possible the tutorial text proves impossible to read without 20/20 vision. The few controls the player has on-screen are so minimal and unnoticeable, the tooltips and hotkets are in approximately font size 6. While such a minor graphical issue might go unnoticed by the majority of players, Reus is almost certainly not appropriate for players with less than perfect eyesight.That said, once the game gets going and the Era progressing, Reus has a huge amount to offer to keep a player engaged. All of the players’ efforts are focussed on pleasing the tiny humans who settle in your lovingly planned environments, and when your forest-dwelling humans plan to open up a world-class mine there are a few options before you, depending on what sort of god you want to be. You could form a large amount of forest-based minerals around the tiny village, terraform a forest into a mountainside landscape or just burn the village down and hope the next squad of settlers aren’t as greedy. A word of warning, however – if a new village settles amongst in a land of plenty, they are much more likely to become greedy and violent.Weaknesses aside, Reus is a new twist on a god game with a huge amount of gameplay behind it for those who can bear their way through the slightly arduous tutorial. It offers at least 30 hours of entertaining god play, with the ability to command your mountainous workers to bless or crush human villages as you see fit, and that is no bad thing.7/10			"

												Reus is an interesting and quant god game, with a unique world view and control of 4 giants that require teamwork to make the world better place. Although not easy at first the game has a deep complexity within it, that rewards the use of intelligent symibosis. The charm of the giants and the details within the townspeople add quite a lot to thee enjoyment factor of the game(if you have the mad scientist completed and you look at the village, you will notice that zombies walk around the town). However there are some faults, aside from era and freestyle there is not much variety within the game,this is even more sad considering the fact that Abbey Games has stated that they are not expanding or otherwise doing anything with the game, because of the new game that they are creating. Also the fact that many plants, animals, and minerals are locked until you do acheivments really puts a damper on going freestyle without grinding some random eras. In summary, despite its faults Reus is still an amazing game with unique charm and complexity and i would recommend it to any patient person wanting a breath of fresh air in gaming.			"

Each playthrough is 30-120 minutes, but the real game is in completing challenges that unlock new things for the next playthrough. Once you get to the harder ones you'll have to watch everything carefully, and you'll curse the stupidity of people going to war for reasons you couldn't prevent.

												This is a really fun God game, with interesting mechanics and surprisingly deep strategy.What's really nice about this game is how easy it is to pick-up-and-play, but how deep it can be after prolonged play. With every round of the game, you complete different achievements, which in turn unlock new things to create, and new modes.However, this game requires a little bit of patience. If you are looking for a short and sweet game, this may not be for you.If you're a fan of God games, or are simply looking for a unique take on an expanding game, this is for you. However, if you don't like long play sessions, waiting or strategy games, I'd steer clear from this game.			"

												1- GENERAL Reus is a strategy God game where your control and coordinate 4 different giants (oceans, forests, rocks and swamps) to provide to a planet conditions to humans to settle and prosper. From where do the humans arrive? Who knows, but they came in a donkey.  You start in an empty planet when the giants awake, and then you have to coordinate them and all of the available abilities to sustain life and unlock new stuff during the predefined amounts of gameplay time. Yes, you are not able to choose how many time your gamewill last...  2- GAMEPLAY You start from playing 3 different tutorial, and they are very good to be honest, and then you start your slow paced journey through eras. Having no fast forward option surely helps giving the slowish feeling to this game. Placing minerals, plants in animals in the correct spots to boost production to the max is the secret. This resources will allow us to finish projects that will give us ambassadors, that unlock new abilities, that will allow us to upgrade the resources, to allow new projects to get new ambassadors, to unlock... you understand the point. In top of that you are not able to select projects, and people sometimes are bumb and select projects impossible to finish. Some upgrades are worse than the previous version of the resource, and I do not know that previously to the upgrade. That's not normal. If you give a lot of resources at a time, people will start to become greedy and will start wars against other villages or even against the giants, and then you'll have to just finish them off. That is fun, but some achievements depends in having war, and you need villages to have those. Bummer! It's not hard to unlock all content, but you can get bored quite easily with the lack of content of the game.   3- CONCLUSION This is a small and fun game, but with not much to offer. The general mechanics of the game is very good, but I was a bit disappointed with it. It seemed different when I saw some gameplay. Do not get me wrong, the game is fun and entertaining, but it lacks some must have stuff of this kind of games. At the moment only costs €9,99 and I think this is a fair price for what the game offers.

												A simple civilization manager type game. Well executed, good music and art-style, fun gameplay. For me it didn't last long, the long round times prevented me from really enjoying this but that's just me. Some multiplayer CIV games can last hours and that's never stopped anybody. Buy if you're into that kinda thing. I recommend because it's really good at what it does.			"

												A ""god"" management game where you use giants to create resources and strive to furfill to the villagers needs. This leads them to give you an ""ambassador"" which allows your giants to do additional stuff..Mainly to do the same thing already stated. My main gripe with this game is the lack of purpose you have other then to serve the people, which wouldn't be so bad if they did other intresting things, but they don't..Would not buy this game at current price. 6/10.

												Reus is a beautiful little game that has hidden depth. A unique blend of god game, tile placement, city management; it plays a lot like a RPG rubics cube.I highly recommend picking up this game and praise Abbey games on this gem. I spent nearly 100 hours on a game that cost me less than 5$. I enjoyed trying to build the villages in all the possible ways which is complicated by the ambassador mechanic which I found interesting.			"

												I really enjoy the strategy the game gives you, You can play it casually and just enjoy the relaxing athmosphere, but to unlock everything you need to master your synergies and make the most out of the spaces within the city. Some people will find it repetetive, since it's more about making the most efficient cities than choosing your own ways to delevelop them, which leads to repeating similiar builds. But the randomly generated goals for cities and achievement hunting kept me hooked.			"

												This is a puzzle game.  Your job is to get the most out of available resources in limited space, but not too quickly.  If you don't check how fast your villiage is growing, or if you don't add counter measures, it will attack other villiages and even you.  As you play and unlock achievements new animals/minerals/plants will be available for the next game, so each game builds upon itself.			"

												It looks like a real-time strategy, but it's more of a ""real-time puzzle."" You terraform the land and manage it's flora and fauna and watch as the human population settles around what you've created and, if they grow too greedy, war with each other. Certain achievements unlock resources that may be used in future sessions to advance humanity even further. Overall an addicting experience, with a nice graphical charm all its own. Relaxing to play, unless you're scrambling in the final minutes of a session to finish off that one last challenge; Exhilirating if you pull it off. Definitely recommended.			"

												Reus seems relatively simple at first, but becomes more and more complex. As space becomes more limited (with population increase), the task of balancing resources requires ever more clever ways of combining them. With the building threat of villages going to war with each other, it can become quite a challenge.This is a strategy game with an indie feel and no real fighting, so it's not for everyone, but if that's your jam then Reus is worth checking out. The concentration required in solving these environmental problems certainly had me immersed.			"

												In games like Reus, replay value needs to be high. Sadly, my experience with Reus in this regard has proven to be poor. While fun to play, the game requires constant resetting to start a new ""world"". Given the amount of times Reus requires this, the content should be much greater and less dull. Building a world requires quite a lot of effort and once time runs out, players are essentially forced to start over from scratch to reach new goals. I can see this system working for some, but for me it only serves to frustrate. Since the game is fun and worthwhile for a decent amount of time I'm giving it a 7.5 out of 10 instead of lower. Get it during a sale is my advice.			"

												This game looked and sounded super cool. What I liked about it: I love upgrade-tree games like Element Tower Defense, the WC3 custom map. During the tutorial, it felt like this game was going to be like that. You plop down a plot of animals/plants/minerals, which has different attributes based on what kind of land you plop it down on. Then, you influence that plot of whatever with an ""aspect"", pushing it towards its next level where it gets different attributes. Then you can do it agan (and maybe again). Pretty sweet, right? What I didn't like: The upgrades don't make sense. I'm not saying they SHOULD make sense, but if they don't make sense, they should feel good in some other way. Every upgrade is a gamble. You hope that it will keep being symbiotic with the things around it, or keep providing the same kind of resource. For example you might upgrade a plant that gives food and money, and its next level will only give technology. This might not sound like a big problem. Sure, it's a ""strategy"" game; if you want to play it ""right"" you have to learn it. But you play in 60 minute sessions, and what progress you made in that session determines what is available for you in the next session, in a rogue-light way. But if you lose towards the end of that session, you just lose everything. It's a cool idea, cool visual style, but in the end the execution makes it one of the few games I would advise people not to bother with.			"

												Well this game was a lot more involved than I was expecting. You have 4 giants, and each one has one main skill (terraforming).  Forest makes forests, Water makes oceans, Rock makes mountains/desert, Swamp makes swampland. Then each one can make plants, animals, or mineral deposits. Each thing you place interacts with other things you can place, to give bonuses. When a town forms in each area (desert, forest, swamp), they start a project objective you have to help them meet by adding more things to get their scores up. If you win, you get an ambassador, which opens new upgrade options. Then each thing previously placed can be upgraded. Those upgrades interact with each thing differently than the original, so you change all of your bonuses each time you change something. As you go along the projects get more difficult. That can make for a lot of different play combinations.The 30 minute games advance you, but I have not worked through those yet. I wanted to do some free play to figure out how everything worked together first. There is definitely plenty of game play for days, here. It's a good game to fiddle with and then save to come back to. Once you become familiar with the rules, you can then alter things further with game options (e.g., world size, ""speed play"", and ""no pause"") to challenge yourself further.			"

												It's a good game, but not for everyone. You are in control of 4 different giants that shape the world and help the civilizations grow and develop. You'll be doing things like creating patches of food, mineral, etc for the cities, and  also stoping them from destroying each other(optional).There is really no story to it.  You'll always start same way, with same limited number of patches for cities and resources. The point of playing will be getting the achievements and unlocks. The cities provide ambassadors which unlock abilities for the giants. The different combinations of ambassador-giants will provide the differentiation from game to game.			"

												Good fun. Grinding to unlock some of the natural sources can take a while, and the random choices of projects is annoying when you only have a few left to atttain...Interesting take on a god game, specialisations and projects leave you thinking about how to lay everything out to lead to the highest prosperity whilst also trying to avoid greed... Tea is overpowered, which is nice since I drink so much myself.Remember to enable beta and use the advanced options for the tiny (50 plots) and large (150 plots). Needs some polishing in the descriptions of specialisations and bringing everything into consistency, but doesn't detract from the game.			"

												Reus is far from a bad game, but it is very difficult to actively recommend it. From personal experience during the first four hours of so I had an absolute blast trying out different combinations of powers and land types. It's quite enjoyable to unlock new structures and lands that can then help you achieve further unlocks.Unfortunately there is a mechanic where towns will actively go to war if they suddenly get too many resources, and if ther aren't any towns to attack they will prey on your titans. At first this was a nice challenge and forced me to try to up danger levels as well put the titans other skills to use. However when building upgrades are on a time limit you're forced into the position of increasing resources and boundaries, but then if the resources you need don't produce danger you have to put up with beating down warring jackasses for the next couple of minutes until they finally simmer down.It is unbelivably frustrating and it is unfortunate because up until that moment it was a fun game. Perhaps there was some secret method or technique I hadn't discerned to make the game less aggravating in the longer modes? I think it bears repeating that Reus is looks amazing and the general gameplay is interesting and enjoyable - up to a point. You will at least wring a few hours out of it, but if you're a completionist you will have to weather some extremely trying mechanics.			"

												This is an interesting game, and to be honest it reminds me (in terms of perspective and mechanics) of some free online games I've played in the past (i.e. Crimson Warfare and Feudalism 2), but that's not a criticism. This is a very easy-to-learn and enjoyable RTS that is much more refined and smaller than a AAA title like Civilization or Age of Empires. The menus and controls are also straightforward, making it an easy game to get into. I wonder if the dev team had an idea of mixing Shadow of the Colossus with Swords and Soldiers when they came up with this... ****			"

												You'd think it is some form of civilization developement game at first, when it then cleverly blends into a puzzle game all about getting the highest score. Using the four giants powers to shape the planet and fill the earth with riches, the goal is to feed the settling towns and help them develop as much as possible.The skill curve involved is surprisingly large as in order to gain the highest scores you need to combine, match, remove and replace resources to maximise the bonuses on -every-single-tile-.You're basically trying to build a tower as high as possible, but having to repeatedly tear down and replace the pillars as you get stronger materials to build with, in order to build even higher.

Every aspect of the game influences every other part. The best way I can describe it is one part populous, one part sim earth, one part puzzle, with a time limit and progessive fun and aspects that is deep and rewarding, alongside real time challenges that arrive to give you frantically moving to solve or not, given they may be conflicting in nature.A great buy for the cost.

												It's an interesting puzzle that falls short in terms of being a fun game.  There are core features of gameplay that turn what could be an exploratory sandbox god sim into a specific achievement hunt just to make the game playable.  And once you've painstakingly hunted the nearly dozens of required achievements, one of the last things you're going to want to do is play it again.  It's certainly a clever indie game, but I cannot recommend it as more than a concept to be reimagined and implemented better at some point in the future.			"

Everything about it just makes sense and all the little things you figure out by trying new combos really open up new strategies!Bottom Line: Get this game if you like City Building OR God Games.I am currently playing it on my C720 Chromebook!(Xubuntu installed currently, probably going back to Fedora soon though.

												Bought this game in the sale and didn't expect much for the price. I was rather surprised as to the depth of the game. It's certainly not easy and there's quite a lot to it. The graphics are quite smart too. The only downside I'm finding is that as the game progresses you unlock longer scenarios which tend to become a bit boring due to the length of them, and it's basically just repeating the same thing but for longer to get a bigger score. I may get round the final one some day when I have the fortitude.			"

												I've got to be honest; I'm not entirely sure what the point of this game is.Alright, alright. On the surface, Reus is a game about creating the perfect environment for a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPCs who get really murdery when you pamper them too much. You do this by placing down various types of tiles whose properties vary based on biome and which can be upgraded further with upgradable upgrades you get from upgrading the NPC villages, which you use to upgrade the NPC villages more. ""Upgrade"" totally just stopped sounding like a real word. There's not really a lot of room for personal styles in this game; things have to be placed together in very specific ways for optimum benefit, and the game runs on timed rounds so even if you did create something asthetically pleasing it'll vanish sooner rather than later anyway. Going for achievements is all there is.And that's... just about it, really. It feels like a mobile phone or flash game, not something that really should be on Steam. A lot like the game itself, the surface is all there is despite any visual appearances to the contrary.			"

												I recommend this title to anyone who enjoys micro-management games, a-la Sid Meier's titles, as well as those who enjoy experiences with slow paced poeticism, like you would find in Flower.  As strange as that combination sounds, this game finds a happy medium along those lines.  You literally play as the slumbering earth who awakens every so often over aeons and uses elemental giants, (Reus is danish for Giant) to foster life and guide the advancement of humanity.  They can rebel, and you can rebuttle with natural disasters that keep their expansion and eventual verocity in check. Its truly a wonderful experience, especially for the summer sale price.			"

												Very unique Indie ""God Game"". I can honestly say i have never played a game such as this. At first few hours the game might not seem like much, but then you start to see patterns on how to play more efficiently and get the challenges done. After playing for 6 hours i have become addicted and i cannot stop playing.     The core gameplay : you control giants to provide resources for your civilization. You have to complete challanges in a limited amount of time. If you rush the evolution of your settlement it will become violent and start attacking you and other villages on the planet. pros: 1) unique gameplay2) lots of challenges3) good music4) good graphics (just right for this kind of game)5) nice and detailed tutorial.cons:you will spend first few hours getting the hang of the game.(you have to get used to the gameplay)			"

												Ok this game probably won't garner much attention. Sure you don't get to shoot or slash anyone to bits and sure there isn't any multiplayer at all but the game itself has its highlights. First what is this game about. To strongly put it, its similar to any other game that is in the similar genre as the sims. The game gives you some control but what seems like you have control turns into a cluster@#$% of chaos if you don't manage it. In the game you , the player, are the planet. You start out barren, no water, no life, no plants, and because of this as the planet your power is weakening.  With what power you have left you summon the giants in effort to bring back life to your barren body. Thats pretty much the jist of it. The gameplay is fairly solid and easy as you use the mouse to both direct your giants and turn your planet. Now lets talk about the giants. Honestly I love them . They appear powerful as they are giants but at the same time their endearing. The art style, atleast to me, shows that. We have the Rock Giant who can raise mountains, and place minerals, The forest giant who can grow forests, and certain plants, The Ocean giant who provides water and animal life, and then the Swamp giant who's a combination of the forestand ocean giant. These are the players tools and with these lovable giants you create a lush world for which , you guessed it, Humans to live on. Now remember that control I mentioned before? Well this is where you lose that control. Humans are an indepedant character of the game and create villages in deserts, forests, as well as swamps. To the planet they're beneficial as well as problematic. They help you as well as your giants grow in power but when they get too greedy they ruin everything attacking any other nearby village. As the pseudo god to these human with your giant tools its up to you to provide humans with food, natura, technology, and wealth. These are the things that each village needs in order to succeed in projects, which when completed , increase one of the four parameters as well as creates a "" giant  ambassador "" to which the giant picks up and let it ride on his head and unlocking its ( locked ) latent powers. In a way the game is both one of those big sandbox, life simulators, that has a hint of strategy. Deciding which giants gets an ambassador to unlock it's powers as certain powers can help you greatly and other ones can really do nothing until you unlock something else. Also did I mention that if you wanted to you can just have your giant just completely smash a village?   Which leads to my problems with the game, I want multiplayer. If this game had multiplayer I'm sure people  would flock to it. I mean maybe some nice game modes like who can build their civilzation the fastest; A Pvp where both players struggle to build a village and have their villages fight one another; or even just a fighting mini game with the giants, hell I'd even settle for co-op in building a world. This game, with so much potential, lacks this. Now another thing that bothers me is the Human AI in the game particularly how they settle their villages. I mean I'd plant a blueberry bush here and the bloody village ends up spawning in an area where I had plans to place something. I mean honestly don't randomly spawn the villages. Just give me a pop up saying the humans are settling and allow me to place the village down myself. Its not a giant issue but its just something that urks me just alittle. Overall the game is still fun. The designs of the giants are great and lovable, and the gameplay is simple enough to understand until you get to the more complex bits such as upgrading things and trying to fullfill the projects that the humans start. If you love Sim games I recommend this to you , if you aren't into the cute and adorable things then no. I give this game a solid 4  out of 5 on my rating. It would be a 5  if it just had any form of multiplayer.			"

												In this game you can control nature but you can't control people.You manipulate nature through Gigants, sort of elemental semi gods. They have different abilites for terraforming and controlling natural resources. The Gigants can use their abilities in different combinations in order to increase richness and help populations grow and get more resources. If enough resources are left on an unclaimed area, a new tribe will settle, as the villages grow, humans will start different projects and your challenge is to help them complete those projects. As a reward for helping them, they will give an ambassador for each project completed. The ambassador can join a specific Gigant, giving them new powers or improving their old ones. People will continue starting bigger and bigger projects, raising the challenge level quite fast. Each project will require different types of resources and your goal is to help them get what they need from nature. Eventually, the different settlements will start competing for space and resources, they will fight and die to each other and even attack the gigants if they are greedy enough.The mechanics are simple. The game is easy to learn but the dificulty raises before you know it. Your decisions will profoundly affect the world so one miscalculation can mean the ruin for you and your villages.The tutorial teaches you all you need to know (it is basically letting you play a normal game with assistance texts) You can pause the game to think and even give your gigants orders during pauses. Also you can save at any point in case you need to backtrack your steps.An experience I definitely enjoyed and would recommend to anyone. Weather you are looking for new game styles, are into indie gems or simply want a fun way to spend your time, consider giving this one a try.			"

												Curator Review:Fun little game. The premise of the game is to be a planet, control your giants, and guide humanity to success. Easier said than done. You take control of four giants and meld the terrain to your fitting. Make it habitable and humans will settle. But be careful. Give one village too much power and they may just start a warpath!Reus is a slow and chill game, with each session taking 30mins to two hours. I personally find this game charming. The music, the aesthetics, and the graphics are quaint. If you can pick this game up on sale, do so. It is worth the buy.Single player only.

Works like a charm (on a debian/stable). Technical stuff aside: The game is a fun Godsim. 4 giants with slightly asymmetric skill trees and more layers of gamedynamics than I can remember. The challenge maps are all timed with a preset that you have to pick yourself. Might feel weird to you if you prefer to god it at your own pace and wouldn't finish the tutorial under 6 hours.But I like knowing in advance that I can play one or two rounds in an hour.			"

												If doing the same thing over and over is your thing, go for it. Buy this game if you're willing to go through insanity.Pros:+Nice and cute graphics+Simple controlsCons:- After the tutorial, you HAVE to play fast, taking your time is a fantasy in this game.-not knowing where the village is gonna settle can sometimes ruin your resource placement.

												Gotta start by saying: I'm nowhere near done with this game, but I don't think I'm going to stop playing anytime soon either.It's a super fun God-sim with a neat world-building mechanic. The round world with limited space means that a lot of micro-managing needs to happen in order for your world to thrive and for your villages to exist in-tandem. The art is bright and engaging, and really sets the tone (for me as a pacifist-style player, anyways). Power-ups are initially a bit annoying to get used to, in my opinion, just because of all the combinations available. This is to the benefit of longer games, however, where specific resources become more valuable over others. My 4-year-old niece really likes it because it reminds her of Minecraft, only with ""cute monsters."" Nothing beats a cute monster.			"

												At first glance this game might seem slow and boring. But it's one of the most hectic and in-depth time management games I've ever played. Very stressfull and very challenging (considering you aim to unlock everything). It's not perfect but with some more game modes or a campain then I would rate it as a 10/10 game. A lot going for it. Give it a few hours and you'll be very excited to spend a few more.			"

												Reus is a very decent godgame, that comes with its own unique playing style. Despite the small world you're working on, the game is plenty challenging, with six villages keeping you busy with their demands. Because it's so small scale and has easy-to-learn gameplay, Reus is fun even for those who never liked games like Populous or Black & White.			"

												Reus's gameplay revolves around the giants placing resources and upgrading them. This is both simple and completely complicated all in one game. On the one hand the only thing you have to do is place resources. On the other once you get past the entry level then upgrade paths get complicated with what the best choice is and managing your symbosises correctly for best results.Additionally the entire time you are placing resources the villagers will be asking you for specific resources for ""projects"". These are just things they want to build some of which require massive amounts of resources....and on top of that every project you complete you get to level up a single giant. you need to choose which one carefully though so you get the effects you need.Reus is a good game that manages to be both simple to learn but hard to master. It is an addictive game and great for a time wasting good time.			"

												Too much rote memorization, and the artificial limitation on how easy it is to actually use the game mechanics introduced to you immediately left a bad taste in my mouth. Very bad first impression, and likely my last.More detailed:You've got to micromanage and memorize which of your ""units"" can perform which actions and where, and what tiles you place where and how they interact with other things. There's obviously an optimal configuration of tiles to give the resources desired, but to achieve that you've got to trial and error and memorize it all yourself. This game obfuscates its features behind repeated play, for, as far as I can tell, no god damn reason.I played through the first four maps (tutorials), and was done with it.If you like sandboxy games, need something new, and don't mind gimmicky, needlessly trifiling interfaces to first access and then to _constantly_ micromanage, this might be for you.

												This is a puzzle game.  Your job is to get the most out of available resources in limited space, but not too quickly.  If you don't check how fast your villiage is growing, or if you don't add counter measures, it will attack other villiages and even you.  As you play and unlock achievements new animals/minerals/plants will be available for the next game, so each game builds upon itself.			"

												Curator Review:Fun little game. The premise of the game is to be a planet, control your giants, and guide humanity to success. Easier said than done. You take control of four giants and meld the terrain to your fitting. Make it habitable and humans will settle. But be careful. Give one village too much power and they may just start a warpath!Reus is a slow and chill game, with each session taking 30mins to two hours. I personally find this game charming. The music, the aesthetics, and the graphics are quaint. If you can pick this game up on sale, do so. It is worth the buy.Single player only.

												1- GENERAL Reus is a strategy God game where your control and coordinate 4 different giants (oceans, forests, rocks and swamps) to provide to a planet conditions to humans to settle and prosper. From where do the humans arrive? Who knows, but they came in a donkey.  You start in an empty planet when the giants awake, and then you have to coordinate them and all of the available abilities to sustain life and unlock new stuff during the predefined amounts of gameplay time. Yes, you are not able to choose how many time your gamewill last...  2- GAMEPLAY You start from playing 3 different tutorial, and they are very good to be honest, and then you start your slow paced journey through eras. Having no fast forward option surely helps giving the slowish feeling to this game. Placing minerals, plants in animals in the correct spots to boost production to the max is the secret. This resources will allow us to finish projects that will give us ambassadors, that unlock new abilities, that will allow us to upgrade the resources, to allow new projects to get new ambassadors, to unlock... you understand the point. In top of that you are not able to select projects, and people sometimes are bumb and select projects impossible to finish. Some upgrades are worse than the previous version of the resource, and I do not know that previously to the upgrade. That's not normal. If you give a lot of resources at a time, people will start to become greedy and will start wars against other villages or even against the giants, and then you'll have to just finish them off. That is fun, but some achievements depends in having war, and you need villages to have those. Bummer! It's not hard to unlock all content, but you can get bored quite easily with the lack of content of the game.   3- CONCLUSION This is a small and fun game, but with not much to offer. The general mechanics of the game is very good, but I was a bit disappointed with it. It seemed different when I saw some gameplay. Do not get me wrong, the game is fun and entertaining, but it lacks some must have stuff of this kind of games. At the moment only costs €9,99 and I think this is a fair price for what the game offers.

												A ""god"" management game where you use giants to create resources and strive to furfill to the villagers needs. This leads them to give you an ""ambassador"" which allows your giants to do additional stuff..Mainly to do the same thing already stated. My main gripe with this game is the lack of purpose you have other then to serve the people, which wouldn't be so bad if they did other intresting things, but they don't..Would not buy this game at current price. 6/10.

												Reus is a beautiful little game that has hidden depth. A unique blend of god game, tile placement, city management; it plays a lot like a RPG rubics cube.I highly recommend picking up this game and praise Abbey games on this gem. I spent nearly 100 hours on a game that cost me less than 5$. I enjoyed trying to build the villages in all the possible ways which is complicated by the ambassador mechanic which I found interesting.			"

												I've wanted to play this game for a long time. After it first showed up as playing on Mac OS, I gave it a try, but it was apparently still in beta. I waited a couple of years. Now it does run, but the performence is absolutly terrible. There aren't a lot of quality options, but running at the lowest resolution, and without vsync or antialiasing, it is still unplayable on my machine. As in, I have to click multiple times to get even a single click to register. Unfortionatly, games developed with XNA/.NET are very difficult to port…I did make it through the tutorial, and started a new game in the hopes that it was the tutorial scripting that was bogging things down, but it's just not going to happen. I would reccomend the game based on my limited experience, but it's a reccomendation with reservations (obviously, I have no idea what the end game is like!).			"

												I bought this game when it came out, and played it through 100%.  In fact, I enjoyed it enough that I reset the in-game progress, just so I could unlock everything all over again.  Even with all the achievements unlocked, I still play the game, although obviously making my own challenges is required to keep the game fresh.  All in all, I cannot recommend this game strongly enough for anyone who wants to sit back and just make their dream planet.For gameplay, this game is essentially an evolving puzzle where you need to find which available resources will best go in each spot to maximize the effectiveness.  The challenge results from nurturing your cities fast enough to meet their challenges, but not so fast that they declare all out war on each other.  The visuals of the game give you enough information to tell what is happening for the most part and make the world feel alive, while at the same time not stressing my computer too much (which many other modern games tend to).

												This is not only a great puzzle game, it's one of the best god games I've played. I've spent hours in freeroam just messing around with my planet and it's inhabitants.Reus is, like I said, a puzzle game wherein you wield god-like power. You control 4 Giants: Forest, Mountain, Swamp, and (Mr Krabs) Ocean. Your goal is to place down resources to help the people of the land grow their towns in different ways. Each giant has a set of powers that allow them to change the planet in different ways. The forest giant, for example, can create fruit plants, Each giant also has the ability to add aspects to placed plants, animals, and minerals, which not only gives the resource a buff, but lets you ""upgrade"" it into a new kind of resource. Giving a blueberry bush a fruit aspect will a: make it produce more food, and b: let you upgrade it into a apple tree, which produces more food the more apple trees are around it. While on this topic, different resources have ""symbiosis"" with other resource types, letting you combo them together to create tons food/wealth/tech. This, of course, is for the humans that live on the planet, and your goal, once again, is to make them as prosperous as possible. The humans, however, tend to be greedy, and if you give them too much to fast, they will begin to attack each other, and then you. A angry mob of peasants fighting agains mountain sized giants goes about as well as you'd expect.There's more to it but I can't be bothered to explain the whole game. So...TL;DRThis is a fun little puzzle title with god game elements. If that sounds like something you'd like, go read another review first because I'm bad at explaining things.8/10 would accidently remove the ocean turning the entire planet into a desert again.			"

												In this game you can control nature but you can't control people.You manipulate nature through Gigants, sort of elemental semi gods. They have different abilites for terraforming and controlling natural resources. The Gigants can use their abilities in different combinations in order to increase richness and help populations grow and get more resources. If enough resources are left on an unclaimed area, a new tribe will settle, as the villages grow, humans will start different projects and your challenge is to help them complete those projects. As a reward for helping them, they will give an ambassador for each project completed. The ambassador can join a specific Gigant, giving them new powers or improving their old ones. People will continue starting bigger and bigger projects, raising the challenge level quite fast. Each project will require different types of resources and your goal is to help them get what they need from nature. Eventually, the different settlements will start competing for space and resources, they will fight and die to each other and even attack the gigants if they are greedy enough.The mechanics are simple. The game is easy to learn but the dificulty raises before you know it. Your decisions will profoundly affect the world so one miscalculation can mean the ruin for you and your villages.The tutorial teaches you all you need to know (it is basically letting you play a normal game with assistance texts) You can pause the game to think and even give your gigants orders during pauses. Also you can save at any point in case you need to backtrack your steps.An experience I definitely enjoyed and would recommend to anyone. Weather you are looking for new game styles, are into indie gems or simply want a fun way to spend your time, consider giving this one a try.			"

												The best thing in this game is the progression. When compared to other games like this most often you need to lose/fail to get any progresion (Don't starve comes to mind). In this game actually you can (and should) win a scenario to progress further.And it does a superb way doing this. First when you start the game it seems like a simple game with not really many choices, but as you win scenarios and complete achievements your choices will widen, and you will be able to do really special combos.Anothe important aspect is the randomness. First of all in this genre you do not want something too random, because it screws with your planning. You do not want something too predictable, because repeat scenarios would become boring. I think the game has perfectly found middle ground in this aspect too.Absolutely recommended.			"

												This is a management game that is simple on the surface but quite complex when playing for the achievments or playing longer rounds.  You control 4 demigods that then control different biomes. From there you build up settlements by laying down ground layers of different biomes then planting various resources that accompany the demigods.  Each resource reacts differently with different biomes.  As settlements build you will be presented with requirements of various resources to upgrade the city.  Upgrade too fast and the settlement will become greedy and attack nearby settlements.  Upgrade too slow and you will lose the opportunity to achieve that upgrade and will have to wait some time for a new set of requirements.  Through these mechanics you can play relaxing games of 30 minutes that will have little chance of greedy settlements killing each other, or you can play much longer games on bigger maps that will require a greater level of skill to beat.  This is why I would recommend Reus.  It is entirely viable to be played as a casual game, but it also has a pretty high skill cap and level of depth.  Not to say it doesn't have its flaws though.  It can be frustrating at times, and slow.  You will feel like you don't have any control, but control is something you will achieve with practice if you desire.  Also if you are going to play a longer game a fair amount of planning can be involved.  You will be surprised how fast the time goes by when you are actually trying to achieve something specific.

												Sometimes we just want to settle down and watch something grow. Reus is that kind of game, or at least would be if it wasn't for a fiendish amount of experimenation and micromanagement lurking just moments under the surface.Deceptively simple, you control four giants with different abilities trying to shape the world around them. Each one interacts with one another allowing you to make the world of your choice and there's a huge balance going on with it all. The catch is, everything's timed. As humanity starts moving in, they'll want the help of the giants to help build projects which will require different amounts of synergy between food, wealth, and technology. And that's not all, you have anywhere from 30 to 120 minutes to make your planet as good as you can, after which humanity is on its own. If you have a couple of villages running about, it isn't too hard. But that isn't the best way to play the game. You need to have at least one of each type of village which will give you ambassadors which will give your giants additional powers. Before long there's an insane and ingenious amount of micromanagement going on and unless you're paying attention to your giants, you won't play at the best of your ability.The game knows this though and takes it slow, giving you a few different types of animals and plants to start with, moving you up over time. The faster you adapt, the more you get to play with. There's also a free play mode too so you can figure out just what to expect from a timed run. All the while, the game remains cute, innocent, and calming, which helps.Definately recommended, though there's a learning curve. Don't get discouraged if you don't do well for a couple runs.			"

												Reus, released May 2013, is a simulation game developed and produced by Abbey Games. In Reus, the player has control over four 'giants' (forest, water, rock and swamp) and  must use the powers of each in combination to create a world suitable for the uncontrollable people (Villagers) and support them as they grow larger and expect more from the giants.Every so often, a village will ask the giants to help them create a special kind of building which will require certain resources based upon what type of village it is (Forest, Mountain or Swamp) and what resources the town is based around (Food, Wealth or Tec). Resources come from minerals, plants and animals, which can be upgraded to supply more resources and gain different symbiosis abilities. symbiosis is the name of the special abilities each different resource has, for example, one mineral will increase the resources it gives if next to a plant and one animal will increase resources if its next to the same kind of animal. If the player successfully supplies the village with the supplies in the required time limit, and build the special building, they will be rewarded with a village ambassador which, when given to  a giant, will either unlock or upgrade the giants ability and allow them to create better resources.As a village gets bigger, the villagers will become less impressed with the giants and instead of giving the giants an ambassador for every building, they will only reward the play when they help create upgraded special buildings and after a while they only reward the player for every third tier building they help create.At the same time, a player cant give a village a lot of resources too quickly, or else that village will become greedy and go to war with other villages and the only way to stop a village that has declared war is to use your giants to destroy the village, removing it from the game, but allowing another village to take its place. This dynamic stops a player from instantly creating a village with a lot of resources.After a village gains a certain level of prosperity, it spawns a nomad, who scours the globe looking for another place to live, if the player doesn't create any other inhabitable areas, the nomad will create a village close to the already existing village, inhibiting the villages of expanding in that direction.This is definitely one of the best indie games on the market. I liked the use of achievements to unlock better upgrades for plants, which allow for the creation of better villages. The graphics are also very well done and give the game a nice cartoon-y feel. Mechanically, the game is well thought out, with mechanics stopping a player focusing on a single are of the planet, and stopping them from upgrading a town too quickly.It would be hard to change this game too much without changing the game completely, but one thing the game could probably do as an improvement, would be to introduce another giant, or adjust existing giant abilities that allow for the use of the sky above the villages.In short, this game is defiantly worth picking up, and I look forward to seeing what Abbey Games does next.

												This is a fun strategy game that starts simple and quickly expands into a complex, rewarding mathematical experience. The more I play Reus, the more I learn about its breadth of resources, driving me to play more games and unlock faster ways to reach humankind's goals.I would recommend this game to someone looking for a relaxing game that will engage a portion of your attention at a minimum and will take as much attention as you give it.

												At first glance and the first couple playthroughs this seems like an awesome fun experience, but after that comes the grind.  Projects so advanced you can't get them without either a math degree or upgrades you have yet to unlock.  The game just starts an arms race with the player and wins.  I loved my first 10 hours with the game but the rest of my time in it is from missing the game, starting a run, and getting frustrated that every single project I need to do requires me to have a plant or animal I haven't unlocked and then just quitting without finishing the game.

												All and all, this isn't really a terrible game. It's a great time waster if you've got a game on download and you have time to kill. I'll admit that the game will seem empty at first, and I would really enjoy a larger world from this game, but it forces you to have to make decisions on the game itself. The characters that you get are important to moving through the 'story mode' (more on that later), and it hurts to have one of them be killed because they are important to your gameplay. In brief, if you lose a character in the game, the game is significantly more challenging and sometimes overly difficult. The story mode isn't anything to write home about. You are dropped into a world and somehow humans exist in a lifeless wasteland and you gotta bring life to it. Have fun friend. There is no set story and it does kinda suck how there is little in the form of scenarios. It's just you, four giants, and a ratio of female to males that would make Dr. Strangelove  walk . In boxer-briefs: pick it up on sale. Download it and set that puppy to always allow background downloads. Download your big games and play for a little bit. It's not a bad game.			"

												Looking for a somewhat different economical strategy game with gorgeous comic graphic and a god-mechanic? Look no further. Reus is a complex strategy game based all around cultivating a planet, building settlements and helping the people by terraforming, influencing nature and enriching the lands. To do this you are given four giants with different elements and abilities. Combining these abilities is crucial in keeping your settlers developing. You can even get new abilities for your giants which helps you specialize.A very rewarding and unique game that i can recommend to everybody who likes Anno, Tropico or similar games.			"

Гиганты могут изменять игровую планету в соответствии со своими уникальными способностями: создавать моря, воздвигать горы, засевать леса, разводить болота и заселять их разнообразной флорой и фауной, которую впоследствии можно модернизировать через применение к ним особых свойств.Главной задачей игры является достижение максимально возможного уровня развития планеты до того момента, когда все четыре гиганта заснут.

You control 4 demigods that then control different biomes.

Each resource reacts differently with different biomes.  As settlements build you will be presented with requirements of various resources to upgrade the city.
