												im a fan of tt war games which is why i got this game. Today they released the Full Release.  Honestly, i am shocked... This is not a complete game, or at least not worth anywhere near the price they are asking.  I have only played about 20 minutes because i still encounter game breaking bugs.  The devs in the forums listed all these ideas they had for the game... then just released without them and said ""if the game sells, we would like to add this stuff in updates"".  That is just not how you conduct yourself.  Isn't that why you were in EA to begin with, to get money to make your game? Instead no one bought it, so its just a big F.U. to the people who did?  Simply put, this game isn't even worth the 50% off its on sale for right now.(update 5/28) 4 months later.... a new update.  Complete with game breaking bugs.. STILL.  It pains me to be so rude to a couple guys in a garage trying to live out a dream, but honestly, they are just really not doing their job,  there is just no way around it.  There is zero reason to buy Exodus Wars as of now, and clearly, thats the way it is going to stay.  (update) Furthermore, here is another  quote from the developer...""We had to leave much of the Exodus Wars universe and its units out of scope for the Release version of Fractured Empire. We very much hope we have the chance to bring more of those units, along with the relevant mechanics (e.g. artillery) into the game, but with the limited budget we had, we needed to draw the line somewhere as to which units we could include in the initial scope""First off, since when is ""Release"" a version? Sure, after release should be patches, balancing fixes, ya know , all the normal post-release things. You do not make a 1/4 of the game then release it lol  I orignally felt kind of bad about this review.  The big red thumbs down as your first review with an 80% helpful rating tends to be a nail in the coffin for many steam indie games.  However, after reading the comments from devs in forums, seeing the lack of progression, constantly seeing devs refer to their budget as a crutch for making a terrible game, i no longer feel bad.

Early Access Review
								The conceptFor those who are familiar with table-top war games its basically Epic 40,000 translated to PC, so a modern day Final Liberation. The two factions available are effectively elite imperial guard troops plus their tank and super heavy tank support, vs Penal Legion imperial Guard with Titan Legions / Knight Titan support.For those not familiar with Games Workshop games, its basically the Total War series battles, but turn based where each side takes it in turns to move one set of troops. One side has huge tanks and men in armour, one side has big robots and poorly armed conscripts.The Good:It’s a genuine recreation of table-top mechanics, with morale, % to hit, armour, turns, army deployment, objectives, overwatch, cover. No stupid ultra detailed rules that can plague tabletop rules and require extensive learning - things do what you expect them to..Build your own army, based on their points costs (price to buy) etc.Intuitive simple mechanicsBalanced factions and units.Scale – this is war between armies and massive war machines, not squads.Responsive dev team – they are active of the forums and have implemented feedback from the community in the alpha tests.The maps and infantry look good.Performs well on low-end pcThe Bad: (written when game in early access alphs testing phase)Bugs. Mostly visual rather than game-breaking, e.g. unit facing the wrong way.Limited number of unit types per side. - 4 different units on one side, 6 on the other.Only two factions - both are human. i think there are aliens in the IP, dont know if they will make it into the gameNo online multiplayer - but it is plannedNo army painter (first world problems)The vehicle models are presumably placeholders and need to be upgraded to the same level as the infantry models. OverallThe core feel of table top warfare is clearly there, the graphics wont set the world alight but they are up to Total war standard and its a strategy game afterall. It just needs more units, multiplayer, and some bug crunching which we will hopefully get over the next few months, and then we’ve got a great game,			"

												Single player only.Has 2 campaigns that each look about 5 missions long.  Three maps.  Yes.  Three. Two factions, one with 6 units, other with 7.The game system is interesting, and it shows you all the dice rolls.  However I have to say that I don't recommend this at $10, let alone $20, given the limited amount of content here.  This game could turn into something very interesting given the addition of multiplayer.  10 missions and skirmish isn't going to keep my interest very long at all.  Especially given that the forces are a couple types of infantry, and light/med/heavy tanks.  All missions are ""hold objective zone"".  Let me put it this way, I've won the first three games I've played in 4 turns, because I rush the flags and sit on them.  Wave this one off, and circle back when they've finished the content.  Don't pay over $5 for what is here today.			"

												This game has the core framework necessary for a very good game, but needs some improvement. The biggest issue for me is that the AI; it doesn't react to your moves at all and as soon as you work out the single strategy that it uses it is very easy to win every game. The AI will stubbornly keep half of it's force on the other side of the map whilst you decimate the other half with your whole army. It also fails to identify threats and will spend time shooting at weak unthreatening units whilst your powerful units are decimating theirs.Unfortunately there is a lot to like about this game but because singleplayer is the only option and the AI is so predictable it fails to deliver what it could. However if the AI Improves and/or a multiplayer and coop gamemode was released. I'd recommend this game in a moment.Pro's:The game seems relatively well balanced.There is lots of room for expansion.The mechanics behind the game are interesting whilst not too complex.Cons:No multiplayer gameplay.Unintelligent AI.Awareness:The UI is not bad but can be quirky.The graphics and animations in the game are quite basic so if graphics are very important to you, you may be disappointed.

								This game is obviously still in it's development stage. It has the potential to be a great version of a tabletop battle game. It is set in the future, and the battles take place on various worlds. You control an army, built up of various infantry and mechanised units. The different units have different points values, and each battle you have a set number of points to make up your army from. Just like a tabletop battle game, and this game is a PC version of the tabletop battle game Exodus wars.The game lets you see the results of all the dice rolls, which is great for a fan of tabletop battle games. The graphics aren't great, it's a bit like controlling an army that's been airbrushed in one colour. I expect that will be sorted out in time, and I hope they add controller support.			"

Early Access Review
								First Impressions:I'm a big fan of the ""Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures"" and ""Star Trek: Attack Wing"" games, so the process of prepping my forces was fairly easy (each side is allotted so many points to spend).  The gameplay took some getting used to however in that your units will first have to pass a roll check before they move to where you want them to go.  The sound effects and animations are very basic right now and clicking/moving ""formations"" can be trivial at times.  The number of unit types available are also pretty limited at present and the game has a tendency to ""break"" on me halfway through a match.  Still, I'm anxious to try a more polished version later down the line as it has a lot of potential.

												A friend gave this to a few weeks ago because he had a spare from backing its kickstarter, and I really wasn't expecting to like it because I'm not a big fan of war games, but he recommended it because he knows I used to play WH40K and Epic, so I thought I at least owed it to him to try it. The Early Access version was too buggy for me, so I thought I'd come back to it when it was finished.I'm so glad I did! This is a surprisingly fun game! And it's actually a lot like tabletop games like 40K!I'm about half way through the first campaign and enjoying it. The story is pretty thin, though interesting enough, but it's the game play and the AI that actually gives you a decent game that's got me hooked.It's actually kind of giving me the bug to go back and play some 40K again...which I think is exactly what my friend intended! Hmmm. Maybe I should get the Sisters out again...If you like miniatures games, I think you'll really really like this. If you like strategy games, you'll probably really like it too. But if neither of those things are for you, you probably won't. For what it's worth, though, I really liked it. :)			"

The game is a fast paced tactical strategy game. Easy to learn the basics yet hard to master. A exelent combination and superb game to bring miniature wargaming to the computer.Keep up the good work and this will become a awsome game			"

												What is it?Exodus Wars: Fractured empire is a turn based strategy game.  The ambitious result of taking an established tabletop and miniature ruleset and optimising it for electronic gameplay.  Tabletop players, of which I only identify as a casual player, tend to be a very rules focused bunch and it is clear that the Membraine team have exposed their tabletop gaming roots by their faithful implementation of the Exodus Wars rules and units.  This results in an easy to pick up, hard to master, strategy game with a few twists.How does it play?The game focuses on formations, rather than individual units, requiring you to activate an move them across the battlefield with reasonably tight constraints on movement and actions.  Victory is also primairly determined by controlling locations on the field, as opposed to destroying or defeating your opponent.  As a result this places a much greater emphasis on positioning and placement of your formations rather than straight out combat.Games are also limited to four turns, and can be even shorter if you control the victory locations.  While I understand this is primarily a tabletop constraint, where each turn can take several minutes to measure and move all your formations.  As this is all handled automatically by EW:FE the battles are sometimes over just as I'm getting set up.  That being said, I've found it a great game to pick up for a quick battle when I have a few moments to spare.The emphasis on victory positions vs straight out combat is another positive shift from the tactical gameplay of other computer strategy games to the deep strategic gameplay of the tabletop rules.  You're almost forced to consider formation placement and control of the victory points.  Spend too much time focusing on destroying enemy formations and they'll win by capturing the battlefield.What about controls?There is a simple mouse point and click interface for most formations and actions with mouse-overs for detailed formation stats.  Membraine have done a pretty good job of showing formation feedback and status and the overall victory status of the battlefield. It is accessible and simple to use, however I do miss some of the more advanced UI elements like radial command menus and right click context menus from other titles.It looks a bit complex!While initially intimidating, EW:FE does a good job of trying to bring you up to speed with the core rules the game is based on.  Most of the well established strategy precepts of infantry and armor and their relative effectiveness against different unit types is present in the detailed unit statistics, if not extensively explained.  Fortunately a few skirmish matches and experimentation during play sored out what did what pretty quickly.How does it look and run.I understand the game is based on Unity and so it runs and looks good on my platform.  The units, when zoomed in, are beautifully modelled and detailed but are an almost missed detail considering you spend most of your time zoomed out looking at the whole battlefileld.  The battlefields are well textured and detailed with cover and concealment, but I do find myself wishing for more diversity; a ruined cityscape, enemy fortification or capturing a starbase.  Hopefully Membraine will consider this for any expansions or updates in the future.Any downsides?One aspect I wasn't used to was that each formation has a chance of not ""activating"" or not following your orders. In most computer strategy games you click on a unit, give it orders and off it goes.  While initially surprising and frustrating, it is another tactical element of the tabletop game which a player needs to be aware of, that formations may be unable or unwilling to execute your orders. Once you understand it, the activation rule becomes another layer in the overall  strategic outcome.Final thoughts.Overall, Membraine have done a highly faithful and realistic conversion of the Exodus Wars tabletop game and ruleset, but they have also taken the opportunity to streamline the command system and interface for rapid gameplay.  This improves upon some of the slower tabletop elements like measuring, dice rolling and referring to manuals to compare unti stats and combat outcomes.  This, in my opinion, provdes the best of both worlds; solid rules and gameplay simplified and accessible gameplay interface.I am interested in where the developers go from there.  Expansion campaings, additional units and battlefields, more sophisticated victory conditions, perhaps even online multiplayer.  Well done guys... "

												Early access title that has been botched up. I review in the opinion, that this game has been unjustifiably ""released"" prematurely by the developer.The developer claims that development is still underway, and if that is true, the game might still operate in a state you could consider early-access, in terms of possible future additions in content. I review with the conclusion that I do not personally find any enjoyment in playing this game in the current state, and would not buy regardless the number shown on the pricetag.			"

												Long and short of it:  This is a prime example of a crowdfunding failure.I backed this game on Indiegogo, for a lot of money (hundreds of dollars), when the idea was first floated back in 2012.  I was already a big fan of their pewter miniatures line for wargames, which basically took the place of Warhammer 40k ""Epic""/""Space Marine""/""Adeptus Titanicus"" for me after Games Workshop shut those down.  I was crazy excited and was happy to share my reward game keys with others and get them excited too.Sadly it wasn't long before it became apparent the developer could not devote much time to the game at all, and you will see immediately the age of the engine.  It's almost no different than it was back then.  Some effort was put into some things, and very little in others.  The splash screen is sophomoric and unit models are unadorned, some not even fully solid.  There is no movement animation and the colors and textures are blurred and drab.  I was momentarily impressed with some intro scenes and the tutorial narration but the rest looks very much like a high school project.The developer didn't get his full funding on Indiegogo and decided to accept the partial payout, and still never delivered much of what was promised.  The game is buggy and very shallow, with no multiplayer, despite showing good potential.  The original website, ""FracturedEmpire.net"" is now just a parking site.  I don't recommend anyone actually purchase the game ever again, because it will never be finished.  Better to let it fade into obscurity.Even so, I don't wish ill upon the developers, so long as they've learned their lesson.  They still appear to be an active development house and hopefully the next thing they put out will have more effort and thought behind it.  But they should not under any circumstances be trying to capitalize on this failure any longer.  Have some dignity and let it die.			"

												An enjoyable, unique,  if somewhat incomplete turn based wargame.Only clocked up 3 hours, but rushing through a review in case it helps fellow gamers make their minds up on whether to take advantage of the sale.Pros:* The non grid based free form movement has not been done before in this sort of PC  game AFAIK. Together with the games other unusual rules,  it feels like it's more faithful to the challenges a real battle field commander would face, and it gives you a unique wargaming experience.* At least for the parts of the game that are well polished,  the production values seem outstandingly good for an indie developer.*  No significant bugs at all  (At least not for me, Im on Win 8.1)* Nice music and good ingame sounds (could do with more variation though)Neutral:* The UI is ok but far from excellent.  Took me about an hour to learn the controls, unlike say Armageddon 4000 where I was up and running in 3 mins.  Less than optimal use of small fonts, have to sit quite close to the screen to read the full unit info.Cons:* Not many units or scenarios* Very little in the way of unit & weapon description. Some unit types stuck with bland generic names like ""Conscript heave weapons"".* Poor story, both  plot wise and in delivery.   (In fairness I may be biased here, as am not the sort to like a story where the capitalists seem to be the good guys and the traditional / religious side seem to relatively oppressive)In summary,  great value while on the half price launch sale, and even at full price it would be good value for wargamers wanting something different,  especially if they don't mind a lack of good story and a lack of unit / scenario variety.

												Short version - if you're into tabletop games, you'll probably like this game.Positives: I'm a few missions in, and the developers seem to have delivered a good dice-based tabletop experience as a computer game.I'm finding controls pretty easy to manipulate my view across the battlefield, I can move the units around as I'd expect - the UI is pretty accessible.  In the game itself, I am getting into the unit stats and am enjoying working out the game mechanics and those strategies that might help defeat my foe.  Overall - the battles 'feel' right.Negatives: it's a little light-on in terms of eye-candy - I'd love to see more of the environment as the battlefields feel a little static and the interactions between the shooters and shootees could do with some work.  That said - what's there is solid.Overall, a good indie title.  Apparently there is more to come, so ... bring it on!			"

												I've been playing this game a lot more today than I thought I would, since I bought the Early Access version but didn't play that much. I almost didn't get it at all because I don't know the Exodus Wars minis game, but now I'm glad I gave it a chance cause it's turned out to be a great little TBS game. Reminds me of 40K, which is a very good thing!I think I prefer the Guild space marines to the REM guardsmen, but I havent really given them a proper go yet.There's an okay number of maps, but could be more. There's an okay number of units, but should be more. The AI is a bit tough on a noob, but you get the hang of it quickly.It's pretty sharp for an indie game, but it is an indie game.If you like TBS games, I think you'll enjoy it.			"

												This game is so badly done steam should not only remove it from sales but ban the developers from ever using steam.Graphics: look like they were made by a preschool class. The terrain, lighting and visual effects use a dark tone which not only hurts the feel of the game but makes it difficult to select units.Sound: You would think the developers would spend the time they saved on graphics, maps and unit design to make some great sounds; but this was not the case. The music is one basic song that loops over and over, the weapons sound like a cheap modern weapons fx pack the developers bought somewhere Gameplay: The gameplay has promsie but the rush job the developers did on the piece kill it. Movement works by   a. Select the unit and you cna move or choose a fe other options (regroup, attack_     If you choose to move you have a choose on how far you move based on what you goal is            1. Move as far as you can             2. move 50-75% of max distance but get to attack an enemy unit at the end of movement            3. Move short distance and get an assualt attack agaisnt a unit    Problem is the dark ungly grphics make selecting the targeting unit so difficult its not worth messing with. Even if you maange to select an enemy unit you do no real damage. I attacked a group of enemy infantry, first wiht tanks then 2 more tiems with infantry and only did maybe 5 casualties anong all teh attacks. The next round that same enemy infantry attacked my tanks with machien guns (well that is what the sound effect was) and destroyed 2 tanksUnit selection: There are two factions each has maybe 5 total units to choose from. Not sure who thought that was a high eneough number but that person should be fired This game is really that bad, not sure how it made greenlight. Stay away from this game. The only bright side is that the development team learned some lessions when making this, which means either they will make a better game or stop making games all together			"

												I have been playing strategy games for many years now and I have always been a fan of games that do not get into the base building and resource gathering. Just give me my forces and start the battle! This game is one of those perfect games for just sitting with a coffee or beer and pretzles and just enjoying a nice quick battle or two or three.  In an hour you can see the tutorials, play a couple skirmishes, and be right up to speed on how to play. I can see the love that went into the conversion of a table top game into a blast of a computer game. I have never played an actual table top game, but I have always enjoyed playing computer versions of them. This game is just pure fun. It rewarding to see your good decisions pay off as you command your units to do your bidding. I hope this team makes more games of this quality. As always there is room for improvement and this title could certainly stand to have some single scenarios beyond the campaign to play out, although the skirmish mode is a terrific replayable bit of fun! Over all this is a great game well worth its price, and for those who like to play heavily complicated eight hour long battles then this will not be for you. What are ya waiting for, pick a faction and win the day!!!			"

												This game is just plain garbage.  I don't know if it designed to screw you over or if I got lucky.  The first mission from either faction is the same.  I played for an hour and a half unable to beat the first mission.  almost 50% of my commands failed, and even when they did it didnt help.  The infantry dealt 0 damage to vehicles consistantly.  Over 3 dozen attacks by an infantry to a vehicle and it never dealt any damage.  The enemy of course, always dealt damage to my vehicles.  Seriously, I play alot of RTS and war games.  This one has bad graphics, terrible control system, inconsistant game play, and computer controlled advantage.  Should have released a demo.  Instead I wasted 20$ on this trash.  Thanks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.
