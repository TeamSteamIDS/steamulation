												Yes. Buy this is you like proper strategy games. Multiplayer centric, don't play this for the SP experience. Worth every penny, more if you have friends to play with.Do not treat this like Star Craft or C&C - it is more like SupCom, minus base building and ""super unit rush"" - you need to think about what you are doing.Graphics work on nearly any machine conceivable and cross platform.10/10For those going ""How can it run on nearly any machine?"" please check this screenshot of minimum settings.

												Best GLORIOUS VICTORY simulator ever created.This multiplayer real-time strategy game centers itself on the scenario of the cold war going hot. With authentic representation of units from NATO and Warsaw PACT.Before going into a game you can build your own decks. In these you can put a variety of units to choose from a pool of 800+ ranging from infantry men to air superiority fighters. This deck has a limited amount of points for ""cards"" depending on the faction or nation you choose. Also it allows for specializations such armored or paratrooper decksThe game lacks base building and instead it is focused on the control of zones in the map with Command Vehicles, depending on the game type, these areas provide income to buy units or victory points.The game has a pretty steep learning curve, but it is really adictive. Highly recommended			"

												I want to give all you good people of Steam a candid review of this game, since most of the top reviews, which while funny and informative IF you've already played the game, don't really give you a good idea of what you're getting yourself into. Doesn't that circumvent the whole point of a review, which is to inform people who haven't bought the game? If you are considering buying this game, please read this review in its entirety.This game is hard. Its brutally unforgiving. The tutorial is, like those found in many difficult games, worthless. The learning curve is a vertical wall that you must scale, and, for the most part, the only assistance the community is going to provide you is brutal death, game after game. Its a logistical nightmare to keep all of your units refuled, repaired, and rearmed, especially on the front lines where supply vehicles are particularly vulnerable. Forgot a couple key units when reinforcing an objective? Too bad, the enemy reconed your weakness, and you just got steamrolled. Now your teammate is having to divert assests to his flank because your lackluster defense left it exposed. Your teammate is mad because he is now working twice as hard with half the points. You're mad because, despite your best efforts, you got annihilated. Your team loses the game.Such is life for most of your matches when you start playing. You will want to stop playing. You will have played 14 matches, and your opponent will have played 1283 (and presumably will be having way more fun than you are at that point). Things will happen more quickly than you can react. You are going to lose a lot.But please, I urge you, do not stop. Because, at some point, you will have breakthough. You will begin understand why you were getting wrecked. You will begin to understand how to fix it. You will begin to grasp how to function on the battlefield. Then and there, you will be hooked. Granted, the time it takes to this point may vary for you, dependent on your aptitude for games of this nature. But it will come. And at that point, you will be able to enjoy the depth and complexity of the game, as opposed to just being confused and frustrated by it. Since the amount of units and consequently wide variety of tactics are available, you will find yourself for hours thinking, ""Hmm, what if I did this instead..."" and then going to battle to see if it works. Its a nearly infinite loop of trial and error, and in this game, achieving success is so immensely gratifying that, even after decimating an opponent, you will still want to go back to the drawing board to see if you can improve your tactics even further.-The graphics are wonderful, and even aren't terrible on a laptop.-The unit selection is more deep and broad than you should ever need it to be, but its there for you anyway.-The bang for your buck for this game (especially if it is on sale) is unparalleled.-The game is superbly realistic, and all the unit models are built to near photo accuracy.In conclusion, I want to recommend this game to everyone, but I just can't. It takes a lot of time and a lot of patience to get proficient. Personally, I love the game. I love games that make you think and that don't give you any help along the way. Its a game that says, ""Here's the problem: solve it or you die"" and, while you may have 50 solutions to choose from, you're going to have to figure them all out yourself. If that sounds appealing to you, then please, whether its on sale or not, buy the game. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Wargame Airland Battle may quite possibly be the best RTS game I have ever played and I have played a lot of them. Airland Battle certainly goes to the top-3 anyway.In 1970s and 80s Cold War gets hot and it's your job to command NATO or Warsaw Pact troops. There is an alright single player campaign with interesting innovations and relatively challenging AI. That however is mostly training for multiplayer, because that's where the most fun is going to be.We Wargame players always like to remind people about the fact that Wargame is not Command & Conquer. In most cases you can't just send tons of tanks against enemy and expect the side with more units to win. Enemy is propably going to be hiding in cover in an innocent looking forest with ATGMs that may take out one third of your units and suppress the rest before you even spot the enemy.No, you have to take into account all sort of things. I'm not sure how to explain clearly enough how many things, so I figured a bunch of examples could do the job.You need to have command vehicles that can claim sectors and give you more points. You should also have at least something in reserve guarding these CVs (or artillery units for example) because many players like to send special forces in choppers to take out these expensive and vulnerable units. You have to keep your units supplied because your costly heavy tanks are going to be useless without fuel or ammunition. You need to have AA because there are propably a bunch of tank killer planes or choppers waiting for them. You need recon vehicles because most units (especially armored ones) have poor optics and they can't really shoot if you haven't spotted their targets for them.The list just goes on and that's what makes Wargame cool.In other words, Wargame series is more complex and way more realistic than standard RTS games. There are over 800 Cold War-era units from 12 nations. They all have their own stats like eg. armor (frontal/side/rear/top), weapons (type/range/precision/power/guidance system etc.), speed (in terrain and on road), size or experience. Sometimes the fight is won by the player who knows the technical data of the units better.Of course you aren't going to use all these units at once when you play. Wargame Airland Battle has an innovative system called ""decks"" that define what limited amount of units you have available. Basically you can either make a standard deck in which you choose from all the NATO or Warsaw Pact units the ones you want. Often it is more interesting to choose some limitations for your deck and get some bonuses in return. You can choose to use one specific nationality, to specialize as an armored deck or marine deck for example, or to have only older units. Players can have tons of different decks that can specialize in specific roles and strategies.Oh yes, the strategies. I love the way you can get enemy totally off balance with a successfully pulled cunning plans. Once we managed to attack an enemy reinforcement sector with choppers full of special forces and a command chopper. It was hilarious when we took the reinforcement point allowing me and my team mates to call in heavy armor right behind enemy lines. The poor enemy team got stuck between two fronts.Still, you shouldn't be intimidated by the amount of stuff to learn even if these things weren't somewhat familiar from other games. Play some singleplayer campaigns against the kind of challenging AI. Go watch a couple of Wargame videos on Youtube because there are some guys who really know what they are doing. Lastly, you can play the campaigns of the previous game, Wargame European Escalation, because they actually teach a lot of basics in a humane pace. It's not the end of the world even if you happened to loose a multiplayer match.TL;DR: What im trying to say is that Wargame doesn't really get old like many other games because every match is at least a bit different.  Wargame is fun because there are so many strategies to use and anything can happen on the field. That's why it's also challenging always allowing players to get better at it. Wargame combines depth and realism with inventive strategies and kind of Starcraft-like need to react fast to changing situations. If that sounds good, I sincerely reccommend Wargame Airland Battle (as we wait for the sequel).			"

												Sadly, I have to start off by saying my time in the military playing with the toys that this game has for units has somewhat colored my experience with this game...  There are quirks about this as a military veteran and wargamer that drive me up the wall (AV-8 Harriers losing eyes on the target they are inbound for when a friendly ground unit is destroyed for example, never mind that the Harrier is inbound and should be 'eyes on' the target already before attacking).  However, EVERY WARGAME I PLAY HAS THESE PROBLEMS.  That is the nature of the wargame, to include the ones we played in the military to prepare for actual wars.This game is darn close to what you can expect from a tactical simulation in the 'real world' training environment.  If you get too focused in one area of the battlefield, you will get flanked and bombed from another.  This chaos in a consumer RTS is priceless and should be embraced.  I don't know how many times I've won a scenario and gone 'huh?!' in much the way I'd respond to ENDEX (end of excercise) in the miltary.  Frankly, this is a credit to the developers.  Scenarios can be frustrating hard compared to other RTS wargames out there because of this.  Once you get into the flow of how things work in this game, you'll find yourself enjoying it and likely getting better and some of the other lesser RTS games out there.While there are times I wish the units acted more like real units with the cabilities of their real counterparts, the above described chaos makes this well worth it.  Developers:Do some more homework on how Close Air Support aircraft work.  Just because a friendly ground unit is destroyed doesn't mean that the aircraft magically can't see its target anymore.  Quite the contrary, when an aircraft is inbound onto a target, that unit should stay visible to it, even if others get lost in the blur (fog of war for fixed wing aircraft especially faster movers like the F-16 and MiG-27).  A-10 and SU-25 pilots are less likely to lose their targets, and in fact should be able to spot targets better than others, this is the nature of the attack pilot.  I'm hoping some of these issues are because of lack of processing power and AI limits....Morale seems a bit too finicky.  I've seen units in plenty of firefights continue on better than units in this game.  It never ceases to amaze me how in RTS games with morale, units break so easy (or conversely, not at all in others).  Going back to the aircraft, loiter time for some of these aircraft is agonizingly so small, it negates much of the realism I see in other parts of the game.  Even short duration fast movers hang out much longer than the short 30 seconds you get with some of the games airframes.  Perhaps a future scenario set can include units that are limited to the TO&E of actual units.  You get a battalion of this, and that is it for the scenario.  Support is what your brigade/division/corps allocates.  Command points aren't bad though, the cost of units is pretty reasonable to keep the forces limited and close to actual NATO/WARPAC levels in the region.I will likely play this a lot over the next few years.  Good job, and I highly recommend this to any serious wargamer or anyone burned out with base building RTS games that get too much of a grind to them.			"

												One thing the developer did ruins this game for me...there is a 20 minute time limit to battles in single player campaign mode.  This was not there in European Escalation so that game is better for single player as you can take your time and play your way and not be rushed by a timer.Since we are paying money for this, the developers should make the time limit something players can control.

ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECEThis is a fantastic strategy game with many layers of tactical challenge. You can dominate and destroy your opponets via aircraft, helicopter, or heavy armor! Additionally, the ability to sneak behind enemy lines to disrupt the chain of command and/or supply with special forces such as S.A.S. or Delta Force can prove to be the best option. Though, this game can be difficult to learn and to become farmiliar with the 800+ units and vehicles.

												Alright, let's get on with the fact that this game is AWESOME!!! This game is almost an exact replica of RUSE, except for a few mechanics that are overall different with the game. Wargame: Airland Battle is a sequel to the huge-hit of a strategy game called Wargame: European Escalation, which sets you on a collision course with the Warsaw Pact, an alliance of communist nations including Russia. You can play as either the PACT or NATO in an epic campaign to blow up your enemies before they destroy you. It has more units, WAY better graphics, and the new addition of jets. Anyway, let's get to the pros and the cons.Pros:- It is easy to run this game on any computer. You can even run this on a laptop with decent graphics.- There is a HUGE unit variety. Each unit in every faction serves a purpose, and sometimes you will actually lose a battle because you don't have a specific unit.- There are 12 countries, all spread out through 2 factions.- There is a decent amount of gamemodes at your disposal.- The graphics are BEAUTIFUL if you have a computer able to handle ultra-high graphics.- There is no damage bar or health bar for your units. Instead, there is morale, which can be crushed by artillery and prolonged suppressive fire. And if your units are armored, like the M1A1 Abrams, it will be a tough time to even penetrate it's armor.- The strategy and tactics in this game are absolutely CRUCIAL to even get far into this game. You need to maintain a stable economy of supplies while at the same time sending more units out to kick some moreâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥- The sounds in this game are pretty good. The explosions sound like explosions, and the whistling of artillery shells and tank cannon shells wizzing by is extremely satisfying.- There is an enormous amount of effort for the units, as they look really good.- There is a suppressing mechanic, which if you fire artillery or something else at an enemy unit, they will be supressed, meaning they won't be able to move for a short time.- The best mechanic is probably the fact that once you lose a unit, you can't get it back for the rest of the game, so tactics to minimize your losses and maximize your kills is crucial for survival.- There is an actual fog of war mechanic, as every unit has a sight range. You will NEED scouts and recon units to scope out enemy units and to know what is happening most of the time.Cons: (no game is without its defects)- This game is brutal to new players, as even the AI can catch you off guard if you aren't paying attention.- The Hud is a huge clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ in large battles, you will be spending precious time trying to find your tank group in the middle of an apparently huge staging area for your allies while your forces get destroyed one by one.- The fact that there is no way to get back your units after they are destroyed.- The 'maintaining an economy' factor is more often than not overwhelming for noobs.- The fact that a group of weaker tanks are almost no match for a stronger tank. Armor is a factor, but eventually the armor has to give, right?Overall, this is a complex but very fun strategy game. it's like RUSE, but with better graphics and a WAY bigger unit variety. Not to mention the fact that each country has it's own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, America seems to be the most balanced between maneuverability and firepower while being expensive, whereas the Russians are cheap, but pack a big punch. This game is the perfect game if you are a fan of RUSE or any other strategy game like this one.I will rate this a 9/10. Only missing 10 because of the HUD and some other factors that are in question.			"

												Before reeding, please accepte that i have bad Englsih :) 90 hourse online and 300 offline game time. Short: This game are taking the RTS in a new lvl and twist. Cause the game have made it massive and ""smal"" in the same time. I feel the developer have made it realistic and smoth. And I feel like i have the countroll over whats happening while playing.Long: I go after 6 thing i going to rank. GIGS-COGameplay: I find it realy great. It is many thing that bring it easy to play, but in same time funny to countrol. One eks: can give many comands; move fast, move, attack, spread, regroup, split. This is very importan when it comes to winning or losing. (You can say witch direction thay gonne stay at if you are holding in left mouse butten).The zoom out and in fuction are working so well, and so smoth. Thats make it easy to play and fun. The redring is being well done. When both of this is working very well, It vil make the game play both funny and ""easy"". Unit countrol is Good and Realistic. It is easy to control them when you have many ordes to control them with. And it realistic cause of many resons, eks. tank. fuel, accrresy, experience, ammo, speed on road and off road, optic, range, camuflage. All this are making the game realistic.Tha combat system are very good. It is like in real life. Sitting in a tank. Does you see the enemy. shoot them or hold. Units does have moral and experience. That make them better or worse. This Game does also have a very good AI. I have played likly 50 RTS. And many of them is very sad story. Couse of a bad AI, but a good game is ruind. Score 6/6Interface:When you have played it a few hours. It will feel much better than the first hour. From my opinon, it was hard to know how thing work and wich unti and unittype tag was hard to learn. But after a few hours game time, It was much more easy to ""use"". The tutorial is easy to step 3. Inantry. From here a person must use his brain in a very diffrent way. It took my 12 hours of skrimish and online to complete the last one. The interface is a little hard to ""accept"" new players. Witch making it hard and boring the first hours. But when you have gone in to the system and gain some experience. Fun as *****. (sory for bad use of words :(   ).Score 4/6Grafic:The job is done well. Looking good on best grafic. The zoom in and out sn redring while playing is making the experience soo good. The terreng is flat. (mostly for making the gameplay better and more fun). If you zoom close in. The detail is HUGE! Everything from a soldier to a tank to houses, bringdes, houses, trees, grass and so on.Score 6/6System Requirements:Find it a little high. Can be boring to have a bad Pc and playing and lagging so on... But for what of details and redring. I find it well optimased.Score 5/6Campaign:Find it funny, and both easy and hard. It is alot of fun while playing. Both part is fun playing and alot of experience that helps to play online. I have read and fund out that people are complaining since it is a tima limmits on 20 min. I find it fine. Couse playing one match against the AI in 90min. Than I have likly 20 match agan... It is a good move from my opinon. 4.5/6Online:Was funny to play, before the release of Red Dragon. But I fund the multiplayer funny and ""hard"". It is a little problem here and there. (mostly caused by players). But online is like offline = FUNNY! And the community, never try to join. Never going to either.4/6Total: 5/6 or 6/6 PS. Funny and challenging game!			"

												I really really wanted to like this game. Actually I wanted to LOVE this game. I got Wargame: European Escalation awhile ago and I personally loved that game, it was so damn cool. This game on the other hand is......damn awful. Its horrible!!!First what really pisses me off the most is the AI. Now if your planning on playing singleplayer than DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!! Multiplayer USED to be good but that was many moons ago. Nowadays multiplayer is completely dead and no one ever plays anymore which in turn forces the player to play against the hellish AI if you want to play this game. Guess what!!! The AI is a MASSIVE MASSIVE CHEAT!!!  Now I dont remember W:EE ever having this problem.I'm guessing your wondering whats wrong with the AI? well I shall tell you.......EVERYTHING!!! So at the start of a skirmish match with the AI you will notice that the AI instantly knows exactly where all your units are placed and what type of units they are. The AI doesnt do any scouting at all they just insantly know everything about your forces and send the exact counters to your units. Another thing that really grinds my gears is that the AI doesnt have a limited resource pool. See if you have ever played another game from the wargame series you would know that you the human player is limited in resourses and at the beginning of a match you must go around the map capturing resource zones in order to gain more resourses to deploy more units......well........... the AI doesnt have to do that AT ALL!!! The AI isnt at all limited in resources and at the very begining of a skirmish match they will simply spam ALL the units that they have in there deck and send them into a MASSIVE blob that steam rolls the player while you struggle to get even a small handfull of units. This combined with the fact that the AI always knows everything about your units and where there at makes playing singleplayer nearly impossible and not fun at all. Multiplayer was fun but now that its dead theres no point to this game. But wait! Theres more! The aircraft is unbalanced (kinda like this entire game) for example When attempting to play against the God awful AI you will need some Anti-Air systems because the AI likes to spam lots and lots of aircraft.But! the anti-air is completely uselsess mainly because they cant hit $hit. Even if its a top of the line anti-air system it still cant hit a helicopter thats hovering right in front of it....(not even moving just sitting there in the AA's face and the AA still cant hit it), and thats helicopters! dont even get me started on jet fighters which the AI spams like there going outta style. They zoom over and drop there huge @$$ bombs destroying what little forces you had before your (top of the line) AA can even aim at them, and even if your AA hits a fighter jet it still doesnt destroy it. It takes alot more than it should to shoot down a jet.This game was great when multiplayer was alive and if it still was I might actually have recommend this game.....but its not. They make this game look like a fine strategy game, but in reality its just a fancy arcade game with good graphics.My advice. Dont even think about getting this game. Save your money and get the newest Wargame: Red Dragon. I deeply hope that this review was helpful. "

												Even if the the family look is there, Wargame: AirLand Battle isn't just Wargame: European Escalation with planes. The games are easier to handle and the campaign changes its format. All this without damaging the strategic content that made the studio's lust. The wannabe soldier will be happy to find hundreds of available units, and it will be time consuming before you can master everything during online games. The players really fond of change might regret the seriousness of the graphics and interface.Hard to learn and tough to play well, this game will attract only the hardest-core RTS player, the kind who cares about realistic combat and deep strategy. This is a game that will repay effort with success, but many will find it too much effort for not enough payoff.Wargame: AirLand Battle is a great game for those that enjoy realism in the planning and execution of skirmishes and battles. It will certainly present a challenge to those used to diving straight in and getting to grips with the nuances of the games with little effort. This is definitely a game that requires your full attention from the get-go and will provide lasting fun through the campaigns and into the multiplayer component.The RTS genre will be alive and kicking until the day they stop making games like this one.

												I played 162 hours and really liked the game but I can't recommend it. The graphics and gameplay are excellent but it's hurt by the lousy single player and unfriendly multiplayer. The AI cheats and is either too easy or unfair. Do not buy for the singleplayer. I put a good chunk of time into multiplayer but it wasn't a very pleasant experience. Matches rarely felt balanced and there's no good ranking system. A lot of stomps and rage quitsI haven't played in a while, but I can't recommend the game because of the singleplayer. If you find it on deep sale and have friends, you can have a great time. It's too bad the AI is awful			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle is easily the most detail-oriented, intricate RTS game I've played to date. The game excels in textures, dynamic effects,unit diversity, and multiplayer options. Where it struggles in, however, is the learning curve. While the game, once mastered becomes an absolute blast to play, it IS ruthless and unforgiving to new players. And expect to be a new player for a while. But if you can oversee the learning curve, there is nothing else that hampers this game. It is smart enough to automatically assign the ideal graphic settings for your computer, intense enough to offer 10 vs. 10 player skirmishes on a variety of enormous maps, and open enough to make almost every action on the battlefield your call.In short, this game is a must-have for any RTS fans, hands down. If you aren't one, though, I strongly urge you to consider the learning curve, as it the steepest in any game I've ever played.			"

												Wargame AirLand Battle is an interesting one, it differs a lot from Wargame European Escalation and is based more on huge battles with limited units. In EE you could have a huge fight and topple your enemy from it, in ALB you have many small skirmishs to wittle your opponent down until you win or can push for their sectors.The latter offers far better gameplay and fun, plus less of a learning curve as it is much more forgiving.

												When troops run out of ammo they charge with knifes.When knifes break they fight with bare hands.When arms are broken you are allowed to leave the field.When tank runs out of ammo you charge the enemy and ram them.When tank treads break you pursue on foot.Only when the tank is on fire may the tankers leave the field.When plane run out of ammo it rams.When plane is severly damaged it preforms Hirro-Kari and commits a kamikaze.Only when wings are gone is when the pilot may leave his plane.This is the code of honor for all PACT troops.

												Wargame: Airland Battle is the extremely fun, and surprisingly unique sequel to Wargame: European Escalation. This game has many differences from its predecessors, all which are worth noting. But take into account that this is MUCH further from the typical RTS genre than its predecessor was as well. If you're looking for an old school experience, this is not the place to find it. This is the place to find the true Wargame experience instead.+Graphics, astounding, they still hold up, no doubt.+The sounds are very well done yet again. You can feel the weight behind every mortar.+Wonderful unit variety. The air becomes a lot more important in this game now that planes are a factor in addition to helicopters.+A truly fun and unique multiplayer experience. This game has pretty much abandoned Wargame:EE's more old-school approach with the 4v4 battles that mimic the genre many of us are used to and taken on 10v10 massive battles between massive armies, where every player's successes and failures can affect others throughout the map. In addtion there are battles where 20 players play on a smaller map, controlling simply a few portions of a regular-sized army, each player specializing in a field for the most part. Making you feel like you are an infantry squad commander, an artillery leader, or even a strike fighter specialist as everyone must work together to make their army work as efficiently as they can. It requires a lot of teamwork, and is a ton of fun.-The WORST idea of a campaign I have ever seen. They threw out the typical narrative/story-based campaign out the window for a more ""Dynamic"" experience, which sounds GREAT on paper. They even added co-op support! Doesn't that just sound fan-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-tastic!? It does! Unfortunately, it isn't! The campaign is a story-less fight set in the cold war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. You control one side and must defeat the other side by moving your ""chess-pieces"" armies around the map, initating combat with any unit they come in contact with. As you lose units in that army, the army becomes weaker. Meaning If they are nearly wiped out, you can find yourself fighting an army with rag-tag remains of an original offense force. Now imagine that in co-op? It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing HORRIBLE. Rather than giving you the ability to each have your own army pool, you draw from the same pool. My friend and I each controlled ONE unit in a battle once due to the miniscule pool we had. And you keep getting new ""Chess-piece"" units every few turns as well, most of them don't get wiped out (Nor do they regenerate units or command points) though since the AI is incredibly easy to beat on anything under hard difficulty, so you just fight massive armies with small rag-tag forces in the most painstakingly boring battles you've ever experienced. There's your campaign, enjoy.Putting my hate aside for their campaign system, this game is still REALLY fun to play with friends against hard AI and against other players. I give the game an 8/10 total. I had a bunch of fun with it, I just suggest very highly that you NEVER touch the campaign. This isn't a must-play, but its definitely an original take on the RTS genre.			"

I just can't get past the first one and I have a bunch of time logged in on the first european escalation.  hell i preorderd this one..but never again..If this would have gone more single player and you could save it during the battles and come back to it i'd do it, but once again the companies take aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on the single player.

												This is the finest wargame I have ever played, bar none. It is a classic and yet to be surpassed. If you are interested in wargaming, military history or current affairs then this is a great game to add flesh to the bones of your knowledge about military equipments around the World. This is primarily a tactical level game, fought at company to batallion level. It includes a rich choice of aviation [both plane and helicopter], tanks, mechanised units, infantry, artillery, air defence systems and miscellaneous units such as recon.If you are thinking of getting this game, realise that it includes over a thousand well-modelled units of actually existing military equipments and that you will come to understand the military world around you in a new way by using them and controlling them in very dynamic battles. It is a thinking man's game, and it rewards you in many ways for the time and interest you devote to it. If you have any interest in the military at all, get this game you will not regret it.			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle is a kind of a game I have never played before (I did not play any other games in the series). It's very unique, interesting, and finally, the gameplay is extremely entertaining! At least in multiplayer, because singleplayer sucks due to dumb AI. Playing with other players, however, gives a very fun experience, but you'd better have a lot of time for a single session because a single battle can take up to a few hours! In this strategy game tactics are more important than anything else, even weaker side may achieve an easy victory if it uses an effective tactics and its enemy does not. The game's units mostly play like rock-paper-scissors, some units are exceedingly effective against other, being average or useless against others, and being more susceptible to some enemy units than to other. Playing the game requires observation, thinking and adaptability to the changing conditions on the battlefield. The two sides are also very distinct and play quite differently. The only downside of the game is that ""turtling"" tactics works too well in many situations and some games end in stalemate because both players know whomever attacks first is likely to sustain heavy casualties and in consequence lose the game. Nonetheless, it is one of the best RTS games I have ever played and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys strategy games. Oh, and 10 vs 10 battles are just epic!  "

												I bought this game for single-player, and that was a mistake. Even the management of saved games in single-player is terribly implemented, and leaves you feeling like you wasted an entire evening, when you discover that the game only overwrites your save, without giving you any save history to go back to. Single player should really be RTWP, because the AI has the tremendous advantage of being able to simultaneously command all units, to the extent that I have seen it command 10 gunships to move around the invisible engagement circle of my AA units as I moved them forward. Ridiculous. The AI also cheats terribly, such as being able to take control of sectors within three seconds of start, and deploying with more points than it actually has.I regret this purchase. It might be great for multi-player, but they shouldn't promote the single-player aspect at all.			"

												Wargame AirLand Battle (WALB) is the best real time strategy I have played for quite sometime. Set in the 1970's-1980's you play as either either PACT or NATO members. Instead of the typical base building you are give a ""deck"" in this deck you build a battle group of unites from logestics, infantry, tanks, support, helicopters, assorted vechials and planes. With each card you select you are given a certain number of units who have a ingame cost (CP) which leads to a balance between cost and quality vs quantity. The nations that avalible to play are fairly well balanced with skill being needed to play certain decks over others. THe nations on NATO are Canada, France, UK, USA, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and West Germany. While the PACT has the Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechsolvakia and Poland. For the asking price of 40$ this game is well worth your time for its single play and multiplayer components id give this game a 9.5/10			"

Luckily it has a very good party system that lets me and my friend play together pretty much hastle free. The only issue we have had is that occasionally the game desyncs, but they are few and far between. Overal a solid 8/10. Very enjoyable. I bet the newer one is pretty much the same, just with an active community.			"

Recon is done better in this game than in any other game I have ever played. Air support, close and otherwise, is done better in this game than in any other game I have ever played. Tactical-level logistics are done better than in any other game I have ever played: e.g. every weapons syste has an exact amount of ammunition, which is matched exactly to the real-world loadout of that piece of equipment. Your tanks will absolutely run out of shells and require resupply at some point. Your jeep-mounted recon team will get stuck in the mud. Your fully-loaded attack helicopter  *WILL* suffer an internal ammo explosion from infantry rifle fire. Your heavy armor will get shanked at close range by 6 infantry because enemy mortar fire has kicked up so much dirt that your tank can't see the infantry anymore and yeah of course they have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing LAW. This is not an exaggeration, btw. Artillery fire and bombs kick up dirt and smoke that are fully visible to the player and obscure LOS to exactly the degree you would expect. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.			"

												Airland battle is an RTS with a tutorial that doesn't really teach you anything.  So it's up to you to figure out how to use your massive list of 50's-80s military equipment to either spread communism or contain it.  However, I feel that the game isn't sure if it wants to be a ""wargame"" or a simulation. It doesn't give cool special abilities to differnet units or try and add interesting mechanics, but on the other hand as a simulation it's severely lacking in depth and oversimplification.I personally didn't care for it, maybe it's because I didn't understand it? Either way, there aren't any other games is the same modern rts genre, I'd probably just get the newest game in the series despite the laughable ships.			"

												My first review didn't do this justice. So re-writing it. One of the best games I've ever played. The level of depth is absolutely huge, with 800+ distinct units spread out across NATO and Warsaw Pact nations during the mid 1980s. The complicated nature of this game is daunting at first but ensures that learning and getting better is hugely satisfying. There's not a single round I play where I don't learn something/gain experience. The game is also hugely interesting to anyone with a basic interest in the military, politics and warfare. Just pouring over the units in the armoury is a big amount of fun in itself. The developers do a fantastic job of modelling the strengths and weaknesses of each nation. Armies of large nations such as the USA and the USSR have all the usual units and vehicles you expect, but also many others too. Equal attention is given to the minor countries like East Germany, Denmark, Norway, Poland, etc. All of them are faithfully modelled and recreated.In short, this game is a must have for any fan of strategy. It rewards proper thinking, cool-headedness and a willingness to learn. One of my all time greats.			"

												***Edit: According to experts, the game is in fact pausible. I am a fool and a monster. Please down-vote my heretical review. It is offensive propaganda.***Short version: Great for people who love wargames that can (and want to) keep up with the blinding speed. Not so great for everyone else.***Iâve tried so hard to like this game. I really like the idea of the game, but after three separate goes of it, I give up. Despite the old-school vibe of awesome military minutia and an interesting and believable historical setting, the gameplay is closer to Starcraft than it is to Close Combat.The game looks and feels like it should have deep tactical gameplay, and frankly it probably does if you can keep up with the constant micromanagement demands of moving, supplying, mounting/dismounting troops, calling in airstrikes and watching every corner of your line while also purchasing and placing reinforcements for your losses. Before I played, I assume this was a slower and higher-echelon game in the Company of Heroes mold. Nope. Higher echelon yes, but the speed makes Company of Heroes look like Steel Panthers.Donât get me wrong, I donât think this is a bad game. For a small subset of gamers who love military minutia and breakneck RTS pace, Iâm sure itâs heaven. Everyone else is either going to be overwhelmed by the detail or the speed. For me, itâs the latter. I love all the detail. I just wish everything didnât move so fast that I couldnât possibly keep up with it.If the game had a âpause for ordersâ option, or maybe even a speed setting, I suspect Iâd really enjoy it. As it stands, the game is simply overwhelming, and I think Iâve just uninstalled it for good. If you love nitty-gritty, realistic military sims and have an ample supply of amphetamines to keep up with all the clicking, this game is absolutely worth your time. If not, Iâd pass.			"

For the more serious RTS player.No base building.Limited Ammo, Supplies, and Units.Attrition is as much a part of the game as Attack and Defence.RECON will be more important than almost all modern warfare RTS's.Wonderful detail and views when you zoom in.None of the strange time/distance dilation that you get when you play RUSE (from console), where the units appear to travel too fast and be of unusual scale compared to landscape when close up.Watch from above or zoom right down to ground level, it's all scaled well!Zooming in on the field is easy is quick and easy in free-cam or a nice solid chase-cam; swing the cam around from one you're locked in on and simply zoom to another vehicle or point with a quick mouse wheel roll.TONS of units, many nations, all available to put in your deck from the get go,   none of the ""unit unlocking"" required from the earlier Wargame version.Great Multiplayer. Co-ordination is key. Enough units and map space to play a specific roll for your team if you wish.

One of the few RTS's I've played where Air units behave like Air units.Limtied time in the air, they cover large areas when flying in a holding pattern, and need to be used wisely. Breaking off and getting them out of combat is just as important as getting them in. You will not be swarming the air with great numbers, in fact you'll be using them in tight pairsto double up aroll or to work in multiroll tandem. You'll find yourself cheering when a small group of fighters makes a great little sortie over enemy space just barely making it out alive as your cluster bombs and napalm lay waste to an enemy position. And tense when you watch an air-to-air battle take place over the front line and it gets down to the wire.

There is a good chance at first you will lose a lot at first. It can be very tough while learning the details. RECON is key. Keep your eyes hidden everywhere on the field, and destroy thier RECON as much as possible.Blind your enemy and you have them. This is not a game of just ""swarming"" with units. You'll need to use the terrain, overlap your defence and attack units. And figure out where to hide all the recon you'll need. This RTS feels far more like a good warfare sim, instead of just another generic RTS. Definately for the serious RTS'er who's looking for a good modern warfare based game. PLus you'll be nicely rewarded with some great imagery!

 the visually cinematic moments you could want when you put a plan into action.

												Ok Iâm obsessed with strategy games and have played an enormous amount of them now but I have to say this one is the most detailed in depth ones that I have played to date. Wargame Airland Battle is a modern day military real time strategy game where you command armies and units individually of your choice on massive maps with up to 10v10 games. You create your armies by creating decks where you get a certain amount of ""cards"" or units to choose from out of the hundreds there are in the game. The big part however is that each of these units are all different having their own extremely detailed unique stats making creating an army much more of a fun challenge then letâs say just spamming one or two types of a specific unit to win a game. You wonât win in this game without taking advantage of combined arms and although an M1 Abrams horde sounds appealing, a well-entrenched anti-tank team or attack helicopter will make short work of those tanks. So yes I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy because you wonât find anything more in depth in terms of tactics and strategy than this on the market currently.			"

												Wasted my money on this game. Computer has unlimited resources. Cheating is cheating whether it is a human or the computer. Game is also cheap in the way the units act especially the air units. No real war strategy here, just another video game. To the programmers I would say this, have you ever heard of entertainment? We want to have fun with the games we buy. This game just leaves you angry. The programmers can make the game easy or hard by letting the user set the difficulty thats comfortable for them. The bottom line is I'm not having fun with this game and I like strategy games. I've played computer and console games most of my life and I couldn't even get though the tutorial. Thats too hard!

												A really good game actually, poo on me if you disagree but I for one enjoy the need for combined arms, recon, cover ect. Line of sight plays a big part in combat as well considering as the US Army says ""If you can see it, you can hit it, and if you can hit it, you can kill it."" But be careful to regard your forces as important and rarely expendeble or you will wish you had'nt used those high mobility infantry with APCs for a diversion. Pros and cons?Pros:Im assuming fairly realistic. Fun as heck to use cluster bombs and napalm Many Countries to play as with they're own specialty unitsIt can be challengingOffline is pretty fun, as my internet sucksSpam attacking is just adorable to my variety of CAS assets.Cons: Lol, it's realistic you WILL lose units if you are not careful, hell even if you are.Damn cluster bombs are an infantry bane lol Fun to watch infantry use anti tank and cause mass confusion among the armored column... just make sure they get in and get out before the bad guys get help lol. My first steam review, if you'd like, you can tell me how I did, or what I could change in my methods of review for future review.			"

												Don't let the videos and screenshots fool you. This is not what it looks like. It is a RTS through and through. Not your run-of-the-mill one mind you. I'm pretty sure there are way more detailed reviews out there so I'm only going to a broad stroke.My main beef with the game is the accessibility curve is really steep. If you don't get put off by the terrible UI, the lack of *proper* tutorials what you will get is a gem of a game. Start with a premade game in skirmish mode, learn how the units work together (never leave a command vehicle undefended, don't send your units ahead of your recon units), master them then challenge yourself in the campaign playing in varying conditions with decks of varying effectiveness.The deck building of the game leave you in control and let you bring your tailor-made army; hundred of cheap and antique tanks to swarm your enemy with, countless artillery and missile launcher batteries (no don't do this).This is a very good game, certainly rough around the edge, but if you are a RTS fan, one you definitely have to try.

												Though this game may look intimidating, it really isn't. In fact, its as far from a grognard (read hex based 100 page manual) game as starcraft 2 is. However, that's the only comparison to Starcraft 2 that this game will get. Wheras in starcraft 2 economy is everything and APM is your life, in this game, strategy, positioning and most importantly, countering, are paramount. If you liked World in Conlict, you'll like this game. Also you might like this game if you are a fan of Magic: the Gathering, because of the deck building mechanic. In each game you play, you choose a deck of units to bring into battle, that you have preconstructed. Decks have various constraints that can be put on them to make them more powerful in certain areas, and the possibilites are endless, from Norwegian Armoured Decks, to Soviet Marine Decks, this game has it all.The best part? All the DLC is free. Not just for this game, but for every game in the series.Playing around with the various units, and building, testing, refining then testing your decks again is one of my favorite things in the game to do.The only downside to this game is that the sequel, Red Dragon is set to come out in March 2014. As of this review, that is less than 4 months away. If you are hurting for money, you may want to save it for Red Dragon. It promises to add naval units and East Asian nations like Japan and North Korea.All in all, whatever game happens to be the latest in the Wargame series at the time that you read this is a must buy.10/10			"

												Wargame is an absolutely brilliant RTS, very much unlike any other out there right now. It strives on realism, scale, cooperation between players and unit synergy. This makes it really complex, and thus, really challenging for new players, but given time, you will learn everything you need to win.The best part of this game is the customization. You can build unit decks any way you want. You can choose to only have units available from a single country, gaining access to its prototypes, specialize in a certain doctrine (mechanized, marine, air assault, etc.), and even restrict yourself to units developed up to a certain year (1980 or 1975), which bars you from choosing their more advanced units, but makes the units you do have available more numerous to balance it out.The single-player is pretty light on content; the real meat of the game is the multiplayer. You can choose to stage simple 1v1s, up to 4v4s, and finally, enormous 10v10s. The maps are large, and their terrain allows for several avenues of completing your objective. The combat is lovingly rendered with exquisite detail, allowing you to view them from a bird's eye view, all the way down to ground level, where the meat of the action is. The sound design is stellar, as well. Every shot fired gives off a meaty *THOOMP*, even when viewing the action from afar.So yeah. If you love complex strategy games and are a fan of modern warfare, buy Wargame: AirLand Assault ASAP. You won't be disappointed.			"

												This game, espeically in the 10v10s, allows excellent tactical and strategic gameplay and forces you to manage resources and men at a minute level and make sure not to waste men or machines on fruitless assaults. Overall it makes the player think and use innovative strategies to break through at key locations. Be that by overwhelming airpower or sneaky infantry assaults to weaken enemy lines. It also does a good job of portraying many nations involved in NATO and the Warsaw Pact, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The Deck system also allows the player to specialise to support the team against what the enemy can throw at you.			"

												Fantastic Strategy game that really comes into its own when you play multiplayer.Some of the players are elitist and ex-military, which can be daunting when you first start, this however is due to the transitional period of playing the computer based AI campaign, to a much more aware, skilled and battle hardened multiplayer, especially if you play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5. I advise playing 10v10 for a while just to get a feel for the ebb and flow of the battle. Be ready to have someone let you know you are not supporting, or if you are doing things wrong during the first few days, this is a given. The ""deck"" creation feature is a gem, this is where you create your armies for battles. You select which one of the decks you created to use before a battle, however the variations are staggering and this will generally dictact the way you approach a battle. If you want a balanced force or a heavily mechanized force, or want to reign air superiority then create the deck for your style and command them to victory! .... but beware, you will find yourself spending hours upon hours creating decks and trying them out to try get the perfect match, I know I have been trying for months because it is so addictive. The only ""con"" I have is that 'some' of the multiplayer community are a little childish/abusive, however that can be said about most MMOGs, on the flip side the majority of ex or current serving military personnel that play the game are a good bunch and are quite entertaining to listen/talk to, especially  when they start telling their military stories :)For me this is my favourite ""non-base building RTS"", and with the free DLC due to be released in the very near future this game is going from strength to strength!

												Make no mistake, this is the last true RTS. The developer is competent and clearly in love with the source material. Each unit is lovingly crafted. Matches can be long slugfests or blitzkrieg smack-downs. There's not a whole lot that's more satifsying than successfully punching through your enemies defensive line, or prying open weaknesses on the their flank, or strafing a light vehicle column. No RTS does contemporary warfare better than Wargame, and it'll probably be a long time until we see anything that even comes close.Graphics: Great. All the units look amazing. The level of detail you can get from zooming is phenomenal. Sound: The music is dull. I recommend playing classical or 70's era Rock and Roll. The sounds are fitting and in the case of the heavier weapons, satisfying.Gameplay: The UI is unobtrusive and conveys what it needs to to the player... most of the time. Sometimes things get hairy when there's a big engagement happening and it just looks like a mess of squares. There's no unlocking like in European Escalation, and that's a good thing. Airplanes are an amazing edition and well-balanced.Replayability: Multiplayer is where it's at, and whether you're trying to perfect your strategies or tinkering with a new deck, there's plenty of reason to come back for more.All in all, if you're a fan of RTS you should pick up this game. It won't disappoint you unless you've been spoiled on directionless, unevolving, slop like Starcraft.			"

												Oh, where to start with this game?This truly is an RTS with few comparable equals.  Forget everything you learned from RTS games like base building strategies, APMs, and abilities.  In Wargame, your army composition is determined long before the game starts and all units are equipped as theywould have been historically.  There are no upgrades or bases.  It's also a must-have for anyone interested in the Cold War era.  Wargame:  Airland Battle beautifully recreates the fast-paced and incredibly deadly environment of the world war that never happened, but with fewer nukes.That being said, expect your troops to die.  A lot.  Even though each tank and squad is individually named, don't get attached to them.  Sergeant Voldauer will take a missile through his tank and die.  Sergeant Adams will burn to death in a napalm strike.  And Captain Bond's plane will become a firey comet after that SAM strikes him.  At a scale of this size, individual units are, with few exceptions, very expendable.You'll also find out that the game is not all just ""America, ****yeah!"" and ""Soviet Union, **** yeah!""  Each nation represented has a distinct feel.  French are very mobile but very fragile (by Wargame standards), Eaast Germans overwhelm their enemies with massive concentrations of slightly older technlogy, West Germans are elite and expensize, assuring that they're often outnumbered, Poland can put lots of versatile helicopters on the field, Sweden has amazingly cost effective units, etc.  Additionally, don't expect to win just because you have the most expensive or coolest statline unit, because everything out there can be killed by something the enemy has (even if it's just a deluge of cluster bombs).The game, through its system of historical hard counters (SAMs wil wreck aircraft all day long, infantry is the king of towns, ATGMs stop vehicle rushes cold, etc.), highly encourages combined arms tactics. That may be a buzzword, but forces that are severly lacking in a unit type will suffer heavily.  Your tank heavy force will die to airstrikes unless you have AA and/or interceptors and will die from infantry or ATGM ambush if you don't have recce units scouting the terrain they're traversing, for example.All that being said, the game is incredibly fun to play.  Some of my highlights of playing this game include:-defeating a numerically superior Warsaw Pact invasion of Scandinavia as NATOby tactically retreating and funneling Pact brigades into killzones where I could surround them and smash them into submission with my concentrated forces-burn entire forests to the groundwith napalm strikes-listen to Russian helicopter pilots sing ""Ride of the Valkyries"" at random-goading my enemy into sending his best aircraft into the teeth of my air defence screen and racking up kill points from it-playing a goofy army of nothing but helicopters, airplanes, and infantry in helicopters (imagine Blackhawk Down x50)-playing a goofy army of T-34-85 tank rush (yes, the WWII tank is in this game)-storming a Norwegian beach as the USMC-storming a Swedish beach as Soviet naval infantry-pummeling an East German armyto death with a Swedish artillery park of 16 155mm cannons-forcing a battle to a draw by barely hanging on to my last reinforcement point until the time limit while being overrun by T-72s-chewing up a brigade in constant combat until it had nothing but support weapons and logistical vehicles left-watching the Russians nuke their own rear areas to attempt to stop my breakthrough-knocking out tanks with a cannon designed to blow up obstacles like barricades-HOLDING THE LINE!-etc.Overall, this is a very fun game and a must have for history buffs.  Also, check out Wargame: European Escalation (the original!, has more narrative-driven campaingns but fewer factions), Wargame:  Red Dragon (adds Asia-Pacific factions to the game,as well as boats)and their upcoming joint release with Paradox, Steel Division:  Normandy '44 (WWII, very similar game).

												Wargame: Airland Battle is one curious beast. It's an RTS, but it's also a reasonably realistic simulation of cold-war warfare. Players who are familiar with usual RTS (Starcraft, et.al.) may find the need to employ real-world tactics a shock (simply trying to overwhelm your opponent with a large number of your hardest-hitting units will not work). On the other hand, players who are more familiar with turn-based, realistic combat simulations (Combat Mission: Shockforce comes into mind) may get overwhelmed by the need to react in realtime. There is no such luxury as contemplating your move for several hours. Players who are neither an RTS nor a turn-based game veterans might be the ones with a slight advantage here. That being said, anybody willing to approach this game with an open mind will be able to start climbing the learning curve. It's a steep curve, I warn you, but with enough patience one might be able to master this game eventually (I certainly haven't!).If you are more into multi player games, Wargame: Airland Battle offers a quite robust multiplayer modes. I didn't get to test the multi player modes, however. But from what I've read (almost) everywhere, it's a blast.Wargame: Airland Battle offers a superb 3D game engine, capable of rendering virtually every blade of grass on the battlefield. To be able to appreciate this, though, you'll need to have a powerful PC. Even if you do, however, you might not have the chance to do so because you will be too busy viewing the battlefield from a zoomed-out strategic view rather than zooming in to each of the beautifully modeled (and animated) units.In the end, this is not a game to pass if you have an interest in modern (cold-war era) combined arms combat simulation. This is particularly true since the game is now offered at a very affordable price. Just keep in mind that this is not your average RTS, nor is it your typical realistic combat simulation. It is one curious beast, and if you can take it for what it is, you'll have a good time with it.Note for Mac owners: I have successfully played this game on my old-ish Macbook Pro (2012 13"" non retina). I've upgraded the RAM of the MacBook (it's got 8 GB of RAM) and the game ran reasonably well, albeit with mid-to-low graphics settings. It still looks good, but may not be as good as those videos of the game you've been watching on Youtube.			"

												Just buy Red Dragon or whatever the latest one is called. If you like cheating AI its fine. But 99% of people who aren't sadists won't. Any of the wargame games have a steep learning curve and are not for casual players. But this is just ridiculous. 70% of battles you will lose to the AI sniping your command vehicles with an impossible airstrike triggering an instant total loss. 20% of battles you will loose to massive artilery or helicopter spam which unless you have the reaction time and executive management skills of a supercomputer, you will be hopless to counter. 5% you will loose due to a single unit sneaking its way through all of your lines an assasinating your command vehicle. The other 5% of the time you'll lose due to being massivly outnumbered because your opponent was allowed to use a chemical or nuclear strike out of nowhere. 0% of the time you will loose because you actually were beaten fair and square by a superior AI. The game is majorly flawed, the entire appeal is supposed to be that its much more realistic or closer to a real ""wargame"" than other strategy games out there. But in no way does it come close to even simulating minute realism. Unlike real battles, the majority of the game comes down to using artilery and helicopters effectivly. The role of both these units is massivly exagerated as compared to their realistic value in modern warfare. And more than anything, it comes down to assasinating the enemy commander unit, which, while it would be valuable in an actual war, would never be the main objective in a battle. Capturing and holding territory and the role of infantry are massivly undervalued. Every unit also ballences another type of unit, which is fine for a game, but if your going for realism is really very silly, ie 1 AA unit is not going to protect from 1 advanced  bomber, in reality it would take a large network of AA unit strategically placed to deny that airspace. What you get is a big game of overcomplicated rock paper scizzors with more than 3 types of hand gestures, all hapening at lightining speed. Its not a game of outthinking your opponent strategically, its a game of who has the faster reaction time, which basically is ""who here is more like a computer"". Ultimately you realise its totally pointless as no commander in war is ever expected to micromanage all aspects of a battle at once, that all you're really doing is improving your reaction time, which is a simple banal task a computer will always outperform humans in despite not being at all actually inteligent. If you can lie to yourself and tell yourself that having amazing computer like processing speed and reaction time has anything to do with actual intelligence or strategic skill, this game will be great for you. Or you could just download a braintraining app for significantly less money and see how fast you can sort shapes and colors, then pat yourself on the back and tell yourself how smart you are becoming, same diffrence.If however that does not sound like fun, if you're a normal person, and you don't have effing beutfil mind syndrom and dont count the number of windows of every building before you walk into it, the game might not be for you. But hey maybe I'm just a pesismist and you'll love it.  Sometimes its actually funny when you play against skilled opponents, you can almost feel the AUTISM ooze through the screen as they crush you while sorting every pencil and pen they have on their desk in order of length and counting backwords by prime numbers.

												This game is just amazing, envolving all stuff of the modern war and very smart tacticts. We need to be carefull with our units because they are essencial to win and we can't buy unlimited like the other games, this make a revolution for me because before i just sent my units to die knowing i could buy more. Simply, buy the game e feel the battle!			"

												I think this game will be in the classics category for many years to come. I have never seen an RTS that so skillfully and with such stunning a presentation allows the player to control a wide scope of tactics. There is so much to be learned and even more to gain what you might call a ""mastery"" of the skills needed to play as perhaps a real-life general would. If you truly want to see what a General who might be in charge of the movements of units with a massively wide spectrum of capabilities are then this game is one to pick up. I personally love the timeframe that this is set in, there's a lot of diversity in the tech available with the old reliable stuff to cutting edge prototypes available (for a price) it's truly interesting. Multiplayer is well implemented although Single player experience is also satisfying. This is one I will keep coming back to for a long long time.			"

												The conclusion from my review of Wargame: AirLand Battle over at TCXS.co.uk:Wargame: AirLand Battle is a title that I would recommend to anyone interested in a RTS with depth. Co-op is a blast, and jumping in to a 10v10 lobby is an effective way to lose yourself for an hour or so. You'll have a lot to learn, but the game is so full of satisfying moments that it'll all feel worth it in the end.You'll like:    The sense of scale â It's nice to be a part of something bigger.    The authenticity poured into the units and weapons.    The community is mature and friendly.You'll dislike:    The learning curve may be a little too steep for some.    Very occasional de-sync between players when facing AI (not an issue when playing against players)    The lack of variety in maps â mainly comprising of countryside with a few sparse towns, but there are maps that feature a large city with docks.Read more over at: http://www.tcxs.co.uk/4/post/2013/08/wargame-airland-battle-review.html "

												Wargame: Airland Battle, like it's predecessor European Escalation, offers a unique strategic experience by putting you in the shoes of Cold War-era commander managing hundreds of different types of units over maps that are dozens of square kilometers. Though it has a very steep learning curve, the tactical combinations and realistic combat offer an unparelleled gameplay that would be reminscient of a larger scale, hardcore, modern-day Total War game.

												Here is my review of Wargame: Airland Battle.One of the best RTS's of the year in my opinion, Wargame: Airland Battle is a enormous game, with massive maps, and extensive number of military vehicles. This sequel to the original game ""Wargame: European Escalation"" now includes Aircraft such as the F-18, F-16, Tornado, Mig-21 and plenty more, and let me tell you there is nothing short of units in this game. The amount of nations and forces there are in this game make it extremely appealing to me, nations are divided by Pact and Nato then by countrys, currently there are 830 units in the game so there is a lot to chose from. Most of the maps are gigantic sometimes to the point where I am completely confused and overwhelmed because I am unsure what to do with my units but I am new to the game so I'm sure in due time that will pass. All the DLC has been free for both this game and its Wargame: European Escalation so that is definitely a plus, the DLC usually adds in new maps and vehicles. The games vehicles are very well detail in my opinion, taking into consideration the scale of the maps and all the stuff going on, the graphics are excellent to the point where it is kinda eye candy; I feel like good movie clips could be made with this game...The Game is updated quite regularly and the developers actually listen to the players through the forums and a third installment is scheduled for release in 2014 and I am personally quite excited for it, from what I have read it will be called ""Wargame: Red Dragon"" this sequel will include 5 new nations including the Chinese and the North Koreans, over 450 new units including ships, WHAT?! (as if it wasent chaotic enough) and they have also changed the location, this time we are in Central Asia between 1971 and 1991; The version I am really hoping for is a Modern Warfare Version 2000+ era vehicles, planes and such. In campaign is set in Europe, mainly around Denmark, Norway and Sweden area. You got back and forth between playing as Nato and Pact, the Campaign has definitely improved from the previous game, for this installment you have sort of a table top surface for the Campaign separating allied controlled blocks and enemy controlled blocks when you are not fighting, but you can do passive things to, like send in recon or bomb a enemy blocks which I actually like. Skirmish mode is a fun and good way to learn how to play the game without getting slaughtered in multiplayer, you are basically battling the computer and you can change the difficulty of the enemy and your allies. Multiplayer is chaotic at first to say the least, especially if its 10v10 it was definitely difficult but I'm sure in a few months I will get used to it.Making Custom Decks I believe has improved, you have way more vehicles to chose from then the previous game when you are first starting out and you also get bonuses for certain groups like Mechanized Group, Armor Group, Support Group; also you get bonuses for which time frame you want. You get units from a point system, it goes by how many enemy units you kill and if any of your units have died. There is one thing I don't like about this game and that is the game is $40 at the time I am making this, I don't get it because basically it's really just an add-on to the previous Wargame, and really there are not many new features besides, a few new maps, planes and a few new vehicles so I recommend buying this if it is ever on sale, I would say 50% or lower.My final verdict is this game puts the ""Real"" in Real Time Strategy; I enjoy this game I have a lot of fun with it. If you can maintain your units well on the massive maps, you will do fine. The game is very realistic with chaotic war scenarios and epic battles. Cheers \m/P.S. Here is there website go and learn more... http://www.wargame-ab.com/?rub=home#p1 "

												Just get it! Realistic yet fun Airland Battle pays an outstanding attention to detail and manages to provide a level of strategy lacking in most modern RTS packages. It's easy to get into with its intuitive UI but hard to master as the game progresses with an ever steeper learning curve as you advance. It also looks remarkable on max settings during its massive 200+ unit multiplayer battles yet surprisingly also runs extremely well on lower end systems. Overall despite the single player being rather lacking of any staying power this games multiplayer has caught and maintained my attention in a way that most RTSâs havenât for years.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys military strategy, modern military simulation or just great RTSâs in general! 9/10 "

												There are not many good strategy games nowadays.Wargame Airland Battle is very similar to World in Conflict, which was much more popular, but i think Wargame would deserve popularity more. It's realistic and has really big maps, but the gameplay is not too complex, it's easy to learn throughout the tutorials but hard to master. And this is how gameplay should be.The graphics are stunning for such a strategic game and at first i'm reminded of battlefield.Of cause the graphics can't be compared in detail, cause battlefield is a first person shooter, but the commander modus in battlefield 4 is really disapointing. Wargame AB give such a strategic part for big maps.And the combination of air and ground units is really fun.I'll recommend it :D "

												Sounds like the perfect game for war junkies with tons of units and potential to set up ambushes on enemies. This works great with multiplayer, but if a single player game is your cup of tea then it falls flat on this end. Why?? Well to start the AI is rather dumb so to keep it in the game it has unlimited resources. I set up a nice defensive position and murdered the AI to no end rarely losing a single asset. In the end I had shot every round and went through all my assets and the AI was still coming. You basically race against the clock to capture areas which may suit some people, but if you like to absolutely crush everything the enemy has you wont be able to in this game. If they removed the timers and constrained the AI's resouces it would be a game I would highly recommend. I just dont care for it in its current form.			"

												Wargame Airland battle is a fantastic game with a fun and interesting campaign and a robust multiplayer mode. The Game takes place during a alternate cold war gone hot scenario in the 80s (I think)and feautures the important front of scandinavia during this time. The games dynamic campaign is fun and offers a lot of replayability and makes you feel attached to your units and brigades since the losses you suffer are permanent and will carry on for the duration of the campaign. The only negative thing I can say about it is that there is not enough signle player content and the constant time limits on the campaigns can make them feel a bit rushed and loose a lot of their epicness. Sadly  I think the reason for this is that the AI simply isnt good enough to choose good targets and keep things interesting for the long run. That said the game still offers hundreds of hours of play time with hundreds if not thousands of realisticly modelled units. And speaking of units it is especially interesting to see the less known scandinavian armies from this time in some kind of action. The multiplayer is ok, but not my cup of tea and full of armchair generals and casual racism and ignorance you can expect in a game about alternative history so if that bothers you stay away from those parts. If you do venture into MP , try the big 10v10 battles since then you can mess up and it still will not sink the whole game. If you want to see the game in action I have a  campaign playtrhough here :

Talk about a sizeable scale. Combine Company of Heroes and Supreme Commander and this is what you get. Plus this game is always unpredictable no matter how many times you play it. One day its an army of tanks, the next is a swarm of helos. This is by far one of the best games I've played. A pity the devs went back to games like Act Of Aggression.

												Coming from being a console gamer with a obsession with RTS, this game blew my mind. Best strategy game ive ever played, super realistic, I always love improving my decks and strategies. Gotta love Stealth Bombers.The only con I have is that is crashes suprisingly often if you do anything else. Alt-TAB? Crash, somone disconnected from the game due to sudden loss of connection? Crash. And the thing that annoys me most is most of these crashes arent just crashes, they force you to restart your computer, task manager will not shut the game down to allow you to relaunch it. Even after months of these same crashes, its still not fixed. again, not too common, but when it happens its very frustrating. Even with the issue its not even close enough to prevent me from playing the game often and enjoying it.			"

												Any AI difficulty above the absolute minimum is nearly impossible to beat. They, as computers, simply play insanely quickly compared to you. If you spot their army, you have to scroll to the base, click your artillery, choose them to fire, go to your tanks, have them fire, then go infantry to have them attack.The AI on the otherhand has all that done within the first half second of you being spotted. The AI works so incredibly quickly that you can't actually keep up with the battle, so 99% of all engagements are on AI terms, as they can simply issue commands at the speed of their programming.Play against other humans, or don't even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play at all.

												Nowadays when people think RTS they think Starcraft or Company of Heroes, games which rely heavily on APM (actions per minute) and rote-learning build orders for maximum efficiency. Wargame doesn't do that, it doesn't demand fast reflexes or min-maxing construction, it requires you to understand unit synergy, positioning and cooperation with your team.At the same time this isn't a simulator, concessions have been made to make gameplay more fun. Like the name suggests, Wargame is best described as a virtual miniature war game, giving you the best of tabletop hills and painted tank models without the high price or extremely slow pace.The developers themselves are a dedicated bunch, releasing patches on a near-daily basis and listening to community feedback. The previous game, European Escalation, received several packs of free DLC, I expect the same to be with Airland Battle.The only letdown is the singleplayer component. While the AI is competent enough it cannot rival a human player, the campaign while fun against another person isn't entertaining enough solo.This is a multiplayer game first and foremost, if the idea of fighting 10v10 battles across the sweeping hills of Scandinavia using authentic Cold War weaponry appeals to you then jump right in without hesitation.

												If you want an in depth, large scale, realistic RTS set in the Cold War, look no further! This game has jets, infantry, tanks, artillery and helicopters.  It has a logistics system which includes limited ammo and limited fuel. Every unit in the game has its own stats, and its own advantages and disadvantages. You are able to select the units you bring into battle through an easy to use army building screen, which allows you to compare stats of units. All in all, a solid game, and easily one of the best RTS game to be released in recent times. The developers have also offered continued support for the game through rebalancing, and free DLCs.			"

												Cold War gone Hot? or Not?Luke Warm maybe.This RTS does everything wrong according to popular design these days including massive learning curves, complex designs and controls, 850+ units and massive scale. These are all things that in typical RTSs? Would be the wrong thing to do. As many would say ""Gameplay over Realism"". Wargame does the opposite in an attempt to prove that even simulations can be fun but unfortunately? It misses just by a hair. GFX - IRIS Zoom v4 is amazing. It can truely render a lot of detail at any range, making every land scape so wonderous that it's FPS worthy close up, and Hi-Res Sat image worthy from far away. It lacks in the partical department and animations, (which on infantry is down right BAD) but for a game of this scale? It still shines well on max settings.SFX - Language specific factions and realistic sounding weapons seemingly ripped right from the military recordings. Does well on accuracy but lacks in variety. Units say the same things over and over, just in diferent tounges and explosions all blend together since there is little sound emulation going on; just raw sound being queued on events.Interface - Needs some work. Once you get the hang of it, it's no big deal but little things like having the Hot Key letter listed some where on the buttons would be great. Also, the Info tabs for each unit would do well to add descriptions of that units militarial role. As it sits right now, massive amounts of research needs to be spent before one plays their first skirmish because unless you're well versed in Cold War era military hard ware and patient enough to read through the Key Binding tabs, you're more or less S.O.L.Game Play - Simulative, powerul yet lacking. It's a bueatiful game that fudges up very little however; eventually? The lack of ""design"" begins to show. So much detail seems to be spent on replicating the Cold War era units and maps that little attention has been given to the over all design of the game flow. In short, the polish is lack luster in one major area - Pacing. It's rock solid everywhere else from Soft Counters to Hard Counters to powerful deck building options to rewarding great tream work! But in the end? It's the pacing that I had problems with. The scale of the maps are misleading since the units are designed to be close to realistic; thus having effective ranges that in some cases? can = several miles on their own. When you take that into context, maps are no longer that huge, it's just the units are that small. Battles erupt very easily with little room to actually move since everything is so small that the time it takes to relocate is punishing. Couple this with Air Power and other forms of CAS and bullrushes of powerful air strikes or chopper raids punishes any newer player to dust; and becomes maintstream equivilents of the Starcraft Zerg 6pool builds in higher levels. After studying this strange flaw right after I at least picked up the basics, I concluded that pacing was the oddest ball in the court. You start each battle with a set amount of points to spawn your initial force. After words, it's up to capturing ""sectors"" to see a trickle of points come in. The issue here is that in large point battle, your first force will be brissling and wonderous; ready to wreack havoc. However once combat starts the slow trickle cannot replace either sides forces at a pace that justifies the start. If points are set low, then the force remains small period since the economic rate never changes; and often these small starting pulls leads to lame rushes anyway. If there was some player control over the rate of income and the ammount of income recieved, games could be set to be more diverse than they are now, all because the pacing is off.Verdict - Its grande, it's bueatiful and it's accurate. But a gold star game? It's not. It's damned close though. It needs better pacing options and greater player control over game play types for diversity. Add these and this would be my replacement for all things RTS. With that said? I'd recommend this game to any all hard core RTS gamers. It is like World In Conflic mixed with Total War in terms of mechanics. Just know that its better as a Sim than it is an Arcade game.			"

												One of the best games I've ever playedHowever, only buy this for the multiplayer, the singleplayer is an exercise in frustration. However, the multiplayer is a sublime RTS experience. Its emphasis is on realism, it is generally slow paced, and success requires much planning and caution. Many will find this dull however the pay off in satisfaction for success in this game is extrodanry. When you manage to sync artillery, aircraft, tanks and infantry to break and enemies' defence, you really feel like a great general. There are 100s of highly detailed units in the game, and it looks beautiful, it's easy to get distracted zooming in to watch your favourite vechicles fighting. It is also very well optimised and runs great. As of writing this review, the online community is smallish, but I never fail to find a decent game. I cannot reccomend this game enough.  "

												One of the best real time strategy games that I have ever played. Unlike faster paced strategy games, such as Starcraft or Command and Conquer, Wargame forces the player to plan out their actions beforehand. Those who rush into action will quickly find their units dead, armies depleted, and objectives lost. The deck system is an integral part of this, allowing players to create and tailor their decks for specific strategies with a large assortment of units. Want to build a mixed Scandinavian armor deck, or a glorious all-American deck? It's up to you. I've often considered building a deck to be as much of a game as the game itself. There is something to be said about watching hundreds of Norwegian tanks heroically charging (and getting slaughtered by) a dug-in Soviet force though :D "

												This game is truly enjyable, even if and while you are horribly pathetic at it. Took me about 100 hours of playtime to barely get the hang of it. I bet I am still one of the worst players in multiplayer (I only do single player for this reason, but soon to try multiplayer again), yet I truly don't mind the computer (set to easy) occasionally (or in the beginning, constantly) beating the pants off me. This is not one of those game where you find the ""broken unit"" and drive everyone insane. Any build can be broken by a counterbuild, and finding a consistantly lethal formation has been extremely difficult, though in time I have learned to build fairly consistent formations. Planes are in and out really fast unless you have good recon! By the time you see them, it is almost always too late to send out your own fighters if you didn't spot them ahead of time. Every unit is strong in certain conditions, weak in others. Swarm tactics can make up for some of this with some units, but rarely is it efficient enough to be reliable. Truly, truly a tactical gamer's dream game! Don't try to break the game, just don't. It won't work once someone knows what you are up to.			"

												An thorougly enjoyable game that balances periods of slow planning and careful maneuvering with frantic moments of intense order-giving in the heat of battle, just like in real life. While some aspects of ""real"" warfare have been if not discarded then at least carefully placed to the side, the end product achieves a very good trade-off between a simulation of an actual armed conflict and a thoroughly enjoyable game. Whether you prefer to play the solo campaigns against the computer, co-op with your friends against the AI or if you prefer to go all the way to the 10v10 multi-player arenas, Wargame: Airland Battle has something to offer you.

												Welp to start off with the game looks and sounds quite good. Massive battle(well large depending) look good due to the camera placement allowing the player to survey the entire battlefield and get to witness columns of tanks advancing, artillery shelling targets kilometeres away(BM-21 looks extra awsome) and of course jets firing their combat runs. Lots of units to pick from that are interesting to see used in combat and infantry that er........yeah skip them. Now the game does have resource managment of a sort, every unit has finite fuel, ammo etc. and can be re-equipped at an FOB or a handy truck. Now multipayer is good but what falls completely flat is the ""campaign"" and to an extent the skirmish mode. This can be sort of fixed by playing with friends but is still painful due to AI oddities. They almost never attack so you constantly have to make the first move and can be crushed due to the moral system which dictates how many units you can use from that army and can leave you with say......1/20 of what your opponent can use. To its credit it makes you not waste any units and think more tacically. So to rap it up sort of fun game that is better with people(as most things are) but falls flat on other modes due to AI difficulties i dunno maybe i am just terrible but that has been my experiance.

Also one of the few games that can be considered the 'thinking man's' RTS, and it can be a very challenging battle when two minds come together. Admittedly the Multiplayer is the heart of this game, but it only brings more diversity given how much flexibility the game allows for with player-made decks and strategies.			"

I found myself just playing and getting so engrossed in it that i didn't even notice the clock. You want to build strategicaly not play 'rounds'.You can beat the AI by basicaly 'rushing' into sectors and flooding them with units, but the AI can and does cheat and it's that part that of the game along with the timer that just frustrates.Cannot recommend it because the player should have a choice.

												A huge RTS, it has tons of units! There is planes, helicopters, tanks, SPG's, artillery, AT guns, etc. Infantry is extremely cheap, yet powerful in this game, and you can win games with infantry alone. Graphics aren't great, but maps are huge! Infantry models walk in giant circles, but it is only noticable up close.Overall a good RTS, but if you are looking for detail instead of units, there is better games available			"

												i liked the singleplayer campaign of the first game european escalation.this is basically the same game with added fighter jets. these fighter jets are an unnecessary addition that don't make the game any more fun. Then they made the single player campaign in this one un-fun and tedious (less work for lazy devs - its just a series of skirmishes with time limit and cheating ai). they also added unnecessary ships to their third game, which i also do not recommend. i recommend the first game, european escalation for the single nice player campaign.

												This game is brilliant graphics on the outside and hardcore-RTS at the core BUT absolutely NO fun for me. Most of the time I look at the max. zoomed out map, little dots moving. No battle intensity at this range. Just dots vanishing for one or the other reason. The fact that not that many units are present hides the worst path-finding IÂ´ve seen since C&C (the first one... ). I wonder why they implemented such fine graphics anyway.. you canÂ´t use them / look at them if you want to win or at least play this right...If youÂ´re into ""rock,paper, scissors"" games this might be your game. The best thing (for me) is that the matches are max. 20 minutes long..			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle is an excellent strategy game from the makers of R.U.S.E. and European Escalation. This game is a must-have if you enjoy RTSes, especially tactical RTSes (a la Men of War). In Airland Battle, you get a limited number of units, so each unit lost will affect the outcome of your game. The learning curve may be a little steeper than, say, Company of Heroes, but it's worth learning. The graphics are excellent, and I even have to say the audio is great. It really conveys the sense of the enormous conflict. Once again, if you enjoy RTSes or strategy games, you should pick this up!			"

												The only RTS out there at the moment that deserves the name. No BS basebuilding, no alien armies and no magic. Just you, your teammates and your coldwar-era army. Possibly as close to a battle simulation you can get while still having a game.Its hard on beginners and it helps a lot if you have some knowledge about coldwar vehicles and units, but once you get the hang of it its a purely amazing Multiplayer game.There is also a single player... ... ... but we dont talk about that ;)			"

												If you're looking for a action filled, constantly changing RTS game, then look no further!This game has given me several hours of wins and loses, but it is always a fun game when I am playing it.The pros of this game include the incredible gameplay of campaign, then you have the ridiculous multiplayer. In the multiplayer you can pick one of two sides, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), then you have the Pact (Warsaw Pact). Between both sides you have a total of 12 countries to choose vehicles and infantry units (these categories have been broken down from the game [Logistics, Infantry, Support, Tank, Recon, Vehicle, Helo (helicopters), Planes]). With 800+ units to choose from, between both Pact and NATO, this game makes a great RTS.Now for the cons, where this game is great and all, what I noticed through my time playing Wargame is that people love to camp artillery at the back of the map and spam it all over. This really annoys me quite a bit when I'm trying to play. Another thing to bring up is the plane spam (I don't like to take sides, but usually it's NATO who is spamming the planes, I'm not saying Pact does not, I'm only saying it is usually NATO). I think that this makes a quite large pain for when trying to play logistically, and playing it as a strategy game like it is supposed to. Not many cons besides those two pains, the spamming of artillery and spamming of planes.Overall I love this game, it was, and is a great game![9.3/10] - Fun and well-made campaign.[9.6/10] - Well-made multiplayer[9.5/10] - Model Design[9.9/10] - Visual FX[9.9/10] - Audio FX[9.1/10] - Realism[9.3/10] - Glitches (High is good)[9.7/10] - Entertainment[9.5/10] - Unpredictability[9.8/10] - Overall funRATING {95.6/100}			"

												I never played European Escalation, so I can't comment on how much of an improvement Airland Battle is over the original, but I can tell you this is damn fine RTS in its own right. There is a feast of strategy features to behold here: hundreds of units, a variety of different game modes, and unique pacing that rewards the patient, tactical mind. Players can choose from a list of prebuilt armies or ""decks"", or can build their own deck to suit their needs. In game, units are deployed via reinforcement zones that must be captured by having a ""control vehicle"" unit sitting somewhere on it. Battles are fought on a scale meant to represent an entire theater of operations. So basically there can be a ton of units on the screen or just a few, but the camera can zoom in and out accordingly. In addition to the good camera tech, the game looks gorgeous and scales well for lower powered machines. Highly recommended for any RTS fan who's tired of the extreme fast paced action of Starcraft or DotA, and doesn't have enough time to invest in the much slower ones like AoE and Sins of a Solar Empire.

												This game is amazing graphicaly and visualy stunning and the gameplay is much better than Wargame: European Escalation which ive put more than 40+ hours in and enjoyed every min of that game! I love this airland battle even more because in European Escalation ive always wanted airplanes / jets in the game and now finally am loving this game! I love using the A-10 thunderbolt II and hearing the gattling gun sound when it takes down its target such a badass and nice feeling and awesome to watch! I can see myself putting 80+ hours into this game double what Ive put into Wargame: European Escalation just because of the added airplanes / jets feature! Wargame Airland Battle is better played with your friends etc.. I love playing skrimish mode with my friends against AI its very nice and very fun and enjoyable then its good to do 1v1 against your friends also good feeling! then once we are done that we would team up against other players online and win yay!Id highly recommend this game if you've ever played Wargame: European Escalation or even if you havn't id still recommend this airland battle over Wargame: European Escalation anytime!My Score: 8.5/10			"

												Takes a moment to get into, but once you get all of the mechanics of the game, this is a game for all fans of good RTS games. I am a major historian myself, and the units in this game are all extremely accurate, right down to the last infantryman and what he has to bring to combat. The models are done really well, and the mechanics are extremely realistic. An example of this is the tank on tank combat when one tank fires at another. Instead of just always blowing up, the tank that is hit could have a computer system malfunction or a track blown off. I'll admit that the Campaign could be a bit better, but the tactics and strategy (which is what an RTS game is all about) is OUTSTANDING.			"

												This game is amazing graphicaly and visualy stunning and the gameplay is much better than Wargame: European Escalation which ive put more than 40+ hours in and enjoyed every min of that game! I love this airland battle even more because in European Escalation ive always wanted airplanes / jets in the game and now finally am loving this game! I love using the A-10 thunderbolt II and hearing the gattling gun sound when it takes down its target such a badass and nice feeling and awesome to watch! I can see myself putting 80+ hours into this game double what Ive put into Wargame: European Escalation just because of the added airplanes / jets feature! Wargame Airland Battle is better played with your friends etc.. I love playing skrimish mode with my friends against AI its very nice and very fun and enjoyable then its good to do 1v1 against your friends also good feeling! then once we are done that we would team up against other players online and win yay!Id highly recommend this game if you've ever played Wargame: European Escalation or even if you havn't id still recommend this airland battle over Wargame: European Escalation anytime!My Score: 8.5/10			"

												This is one of my favourite strategy games ever, and if they continue to make them as good as this, may become one of my favourite franchises. i was not a particular fan of european escalation, but this is brilliant. i have over a 100 hours already. the graphics are brilliant, the gameplay is great, and i love the deck building system. plus, all of the dlc is free! the only problem is a bit of a steep learning curve, but get past that and you will find a brilliant strategy game that i highly recommend.

												Wargame: Airland Battle is an excellent strategy game from the makers of R.U.S.E. and European Escalation. This game is a must-have if you enjoy RTSes, especially tactical RTSes (a la Men of War). In Airland Battle, you get a limited number of units, so each unit lost will affect the outcome of your game. The learning curve may be a little steeper than, say, Company of Heroes, but it's worth learning. The graphics are excellent, and I even have to say the audio is great. It really conveys the sense of the enormous conflict. Once again, if you enjoy RTSes or strategy games, you should pick this up!			"

												Takes a moment to get into, but once you get all of the mechanics of the game, this is a game for all fans of good RTS games. I am a major historian myself, and the units in this game are all extremely accurate, right down to the last infantryman and what he has to bring to combat. The models are done really well, and the mechanics are extremely realistic. An example of this is the tank on tank combat when one tank fires at another. Instead of just always blowing up, the tank that is hit could have a computer system malfunction or a track blown off. I'll admit that the Campaign could be a bit better, but the tactics and strategy (which is what an RTS game is all about) is OUTSTANDING.			"

												Build your own deck from a huge number of units including infantry, tanks, support vehicles, helicopters and airplanes  as you fight over Europe in this Cold War RTS. Wargame: ALB is a deeply strategic game that relies more on the understanding of tactics than on reflexes. It forces you to think about concepts such as reconnoissance, line-of-fire, cover, combined arms and supply logistics. It is a worthy successor to Wargame: European Escalation.			"

												The only RTS out there at the moment that deserves the name. No BS basebuilding, no alien armies and no magic. Just you, your teammates and your coldwar-era army. Possibly as close to a battle simulation you can get while still having a game.Its hard on beginners and it helps a lot if you have some knowledge about coldwar vehicles and units, but once you get the hang of it its a purely amazing Multiplayer game.There is also a single player... ... ... but we dont talk about that ;)			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle (ALB) is a great strategy game, i have to put it up there with Company of Heroes when it comes to RTS games. When it comes to the scale of battles it feels more like Supreme Commande tho. A Great game where you control Infantry, Tanks, Logistic, Anti-Air, Artillery, Helicopters, Airplanes (No navy tho, Will come in next game. Red Dragon).Game Lobby will automatically give you some options for maps depending if you play 1vs1 or 4vs4 (small maps for 1vs1/2vs2. Bigger maps for 3vs3/4vs4). You can even join som dedicated servers that have 10 players vs 10 players and thats just insane.If i have to find something negative to say about this game then it would be the somewhat lacking singleplayer.. It has some campaings (4), some are short, some are abit longer. But beyond that its just a rock solid game. Play it against relentless bots (Easy are easy to beat, normal are a challenge for new players, Hard is hard et.c.)			"

												10/10 masterpiece with stunning visuals and extremely deep gameplay. No hard counters in this strategy war game, only smart counters. Do you micromanage 4 tanks of 25 points to take out one of 135 or do you call in a 185 point strike plane that hopefully makes a succesful pass to buttrape even more tanks later? In this game your worst enemy are usually clicks per minute and a well thought out strategy with a coordinated use of stuns, smoke, terrain and flanking will always come out on top. Defiantly my GOTY and so far the best strategy game i have ever played.			"

												A very nice RTT, similar to R.U.S.E. This game is quite similar to RUSE which is also by Eugen Systems; you could almost say it's a Cold War version of it. The menu design in-game is similar, along with the awesome zooming capabilities, well it is built on the same game engine. This game is more realistic though, vehicles have fuel and ammunition which can run out who then need to be resupplied. Logistics is something you have to keep in mind. Quite fun though, my ATGMs needed to be replenished so I sent in a supply helicopter, couple of AAs opened up with missiles but luckily they all missed! Logistics can get stressed as well. A forward advance involves a lot of shooting and ammo is being used, keeping the units resupplied turns into a challenge. Supply trucks take time to reach the front so many times I've had to resupply with heavy lift choppers. And as the advance moves along the supply line gets even more stretched; that's why capturing sectors from which reinforcements can arrive is important.There's also a cool feature where you can actually turn off a specific weapon on a unit so it only fires ones which are on. So if I don't want my Apache to use it's Hellfire I can turn it off and it'll only use it's auto-cannon and unguided rockets. People say the game has a high learning curve which is true but If you like strategy you'll get a hang of it. Multiplayer is still active but not too much. Red Dragon might be more active.			"

												A brutal and rewarding multiplayer and skirmish game. It's awesome because it forces decisions at the tactical, operational and stategic levels of gameplay based on how deckbuilding has been refined and how airpower comes into play at the operational level. The game has its flaws sure, mostly in terms of how well trained infantry can't use 40 javelin rockets to kill a single chopper sometimes.This game reminds you of what a commander at battalion level would be thinking, such as making worthy tradeoffs like 16 points of infantry to take out a 40 point T-55 tank or a 105 point MiG-21 and so forth. Making worthy sacrifices and ensuring that no loss goes unjustified makes this game great and it is an all round improvement on European Escalation, which is an already great game.Visually the game looks and runs beautifully at a smooth 60 FPS on a 550Ti on maxed everything, there is no pop in and the texture swapping is seamless and unnoticable and textures of units and the environment also all hold up very well under very close scruitiny, allowing you pick out the details of the battlefield in glorious 1080p.

												The game is outstanding! The developers outdid themsleves this time. Removing the unlockable units (in my oppinion) was a good move. The way this game truly shines is through multiplayer and with all the units you have now , you can have a balaced multiplayer match (of up to 20 people which is insane if I may add). The visuals are stunning. Every little detail is there. The armory has a unit for every one: You like tanks, well then, pick your poison. Don't like going in to battle but still want to help out the team? Choose from over a hundred artillery units (MLRS included). Still not quite your cup of tea? Then you have the option of goin on a infantry + air devisions (Planes or Helicopters, which ever you prefer, or maybe both). The truth of the fact is that I am a hardcore RTS fan, I am quite picky and prefer a game to have base building, but this, this just caters to all my cravings ( From the detailed description of units, to the smallest of visuals), even though this game does not have the base building element. Don't get me wrong, it is not like a match lasts 10-15 minutes, oh no no no, some maches may last up to an hour or even more, if both players have exspensive units that they wish not to lose so quickly. Strategic positioning is keen in this game. You can't just rush and expect to win. You must look the battlefield over and plan where to position your forces, distraction units and so on. There are plenty of maps that have wooded areas and cities in which you can hide units.All in all this game is one of the best RTS-es that I have played. I am only deducting ten points out of its score, because they are spliting it in to 3 games (Wargame:European Escalation, Wargame: Airland Battle, Wargame: Red Dragon). But hey this way I can enjoy every game as soon as possible right? So my final score on this game is 90/100! Great game I would definetly recommend buying it.			"

												Even though Red Dragon has been released, I still recommend this game. The sheer amount of units is amazing. The game manages to retain balance while accurately portraying the armies of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The single player campaign is poor, but you can skirmish with the A.I., and multiplayer is still alive, though not like what it was at its heyday. For $20, this is a good purchase if you enjoy RTS or military games. I'd recommend reading guides or watching youtube videos before getting into multiplayer.			"

												RTS is a dying breed. That's a statement you may have read on a gaming site recently. Maybe gamers like me were simply waiting for the RTS genre to move into the modern age. WARGAME is the RTS I've been waiting for. Wargame manages to combine stunningly beautiful graphics with deep tactical gameplay. This isn't a game were you can mob a bunch of units together and throw them at you enemy. You will need to understand the terrain you are fighting in, and the units at your disposal. Heavy tanks can only be defeated with weapons capable of punching through their armor, or tactics clever enough to get you a shot at their weak rear armor. Infantry defending urban settings will need to be dug out house by house, street by street, with infantry of your own. AirLand Battle is also leaps ahead of its predecessor, European Escalation. Better terrain, more countries, a vastly improved deck building mechanic, air power, and a whole new high level strategic campaign make this the  definitive RTS of this era of gaming.			"

												One of the best RTS/RTT games out there today. Massive improvement over the previous ""European Escalation"", both in terms of singleplayer and multiplayer.It's definitely not babby's first RTS/RTT, because this kind of aims at a niche market. Clumping your units together and giving an attack/move order will never work, and the scale of the battles is absolutely enormous (only thing I can think of bigger would be Total Anihilation, or the first Supreme Commander).There's also a huge focus on creating battlegroups, and selecting the unit type good for the job, so expect to spend many hours browsing through the 700+ units in the game.Best strategy game of the year, especially after a really disappointing Company of Heroes 2.

												If you like slow-paced military strategy games on a company sized level, this game might interest you.  I personally like playing against AI, either by myself or with friends.  The main thing that can kind of ruin the fun in the game is how command units are required to hold sectors; regardless if you have multiple platoons in the sector or not, if the commander unit is destroyed even by a single air strike, you've lost control of the sector and no longer gain benefits from it until another command unit is within that sector.  This makes the game focus more on hunting command units, rather than encouraging you to use strategies to overcome the enemy's forces.I bought this game for $40 when it first came out, but it doesn't really feel like a game worth that much.  However, for $20, it's definitely worth it if you like this kind of stuff.			"

												I just picked up this game, and I have to say, it's not your average strategy game. It is much more complex than something like Command and Conquer, and you need to be quite strategic in your strategies. You need to keep your units balanced, so just sending in a ton of tanks won't win the battle for you.The aircraft, AAA, SAMs, and choppers add a lot to the game too. (I absolutely love killing planes with hidden SAM trucks. Boom!) Transporting infantry is well implemented. And then the units. 800+ units from all different countries, all well modeled and animated.The gameplay is difficult, but rewarding, and is fun to master. Buy this game if you want a slightly more realistic RTS game that has tons of replay value and good multiplayer. (The 10v10 multiplayer is beast.)BUY THIS. It's a good deal, and you don't need to buy Red Dragon unless you want ships, and this is cheaper. Wargame: Airland Battle is a great game.			"

												Amazing Strategy. This is one of my few recommendations, so do not take it lightly. Deep tactics with easy to learn controls and recognizable unit portraits lets new players know what they are generally up against, without needing to know the differences between a kPVfz and a kPVfz Konkours, the differences between a Strella and an Igla. Microing isnt necessary, but it will turn the tides of evenly, or slightly disadventageous battles. Remebering to have good supply lines with logistics also can make, or break, a frontline.9.8/10 - Solid RTS Experience, mixed with a Military Histroy lesson, this is the World War 3 we never had.

												Wargame: AirLand Battle is a super-fun, tactical RTS, with hundreds of units at your disposal, to be deployed on an expansive selection of large-scale and detailed Scandinavian-themed maps. Create decks full of military units from different eras, ranging from post-WWII up to the Cold War, and take your pick of categories all the way from light recon vehicles, to infantry, helicopters and planes, tanks, artillery and mortars, logistics, and everything in between. You can truly have some epic moments with this game, especially when playing with friends, and despite it's initial learning curve for players new to the genre, you can still have mega amounts of entertainment. I am still not the greatest at Wargame, but sending in a line of Leopard 2A4's with flanking support of AH-1F Cobra's, while a barrage of artillery rains down on your opponents infantry divisions, is guaranteed to make you happy. With Red Dragon, the next installment in the Wargame series on the way, it means that even more units will be added, but buying both AB and RD will not be a regret.			"

Deep tactics with easy to learn controls and recognizable unit portraits lets new players know what they are generally up against, without needing to know the differences between a kPVfz and a kPVfz Konkours, the differences between a Strella and an Igla. Microing isnt necessary, but it will turn the tides of evenly, or slightly disadventageous battles. Remebering to have good supply lines with logistics also can make, or break, a frontline.9.8/10 - Solid RTS Experience, mixed with a Military Histroy lesson, this is the World War 3 we never had.

												One of the best RTS/RTT games out there today. Massive improvement over the previous ""European Escalation"", both in terms of singleplayer and multiplayer.It's definitely not babby's first RTS/RTT, because this kind of aims at a niche market. Clumping your units together and giving an attack/move order will never work, and the scale of the battles is absolutely enormous (only thing I can think of bigger would be Total Anihilation, or the first Supreme Commander).There's also a huge focus on creating battlegroups, and selecting the unit type good for the job, so expect to spend many hours browsing through the 700+ units in the game.Best strategy game of the year, especially after a really disappointing Company of Heroes 2.

												A solid almost-modern warfage RTS which breaks free of so many conventional RTS mechanics that it is noteworthy sheerly for its originality in design. Rather than stapling you to a set list of units for a specific side and following a metagame written out by some MLG koreans who can twitch click ""Flight of the Bumblebees"" zerglings in their sleep, this game lets you BUILD a faction from anywhere between 100-400 units per ""deck"". Not only that, but the pacing of the game is in this insanely good sweetspot between being slow enough to make the game feel more about macromanagement and being fast enough that the feeling of intensity and engagement never dies. Expect medium difficulty learning how to play multiplayer well with a long climb to mastery.I would not recommend ranked, the games there are just awful and usually just consist of exploits in unit balancing. The singleplayer is somewhat fun, but has a lot less to keep your attention. The real fun is in playing with friends, or players you synergize with well in-game. Pulling off a good ambush or attack never gets old.			"

												This game is amazing. It's a real-time strategy but in the tradition of the great war games of old where you're worrying on a semi-tactical level. You can manage groups of infantry, groups of tanks, etc. and it really matters which direction the tanks are facing, it also matters if you have enough supplies for your troops.The campaign mode is really fun in multiplayer, and regular matches are also great. The AI is pretty good for both singleplayer and co-op games but you have to put it on Medium difficulty to really start feeling the pain. Sometimes the AI does some dumb things (or at least they seem dumb to me, maybe they're part of a grand strategy?).Customizing a deck of units is hard work but really fun and as you play you have to adapt and adjust your decks. Really fun game.			"

												Where to begin?12 countries, all individualy playable. You want a pure US deck? sure! You want to be a Czech nationalist? go right ahead. Any country is perfectly standalone and has every capability to be a winning force.800+ units. The amount of variety in this game is stunning.. I often spend more time browsing at my deck, making changes here or there, weighing up pros and cons before I actually even play.The gameplay is fun, and both PACT & NATO are balanced. Real world strategy applies here, If you can't perform a decent counter attack, your defensive line will be crushed. You can't maintain a prolonged assault if your flanks are open, fire & manouever. Your units will be worthless, crying babies if you let that napalm keep hitting your line, as their morale is broken. You need to continually manage your units ammo, supplies and maintain them via supply trucks and helicopters via convoys from your FOB. Best of all? if you're a 1v1 guy, that's fine. You fancy a 10v10 all-out war? fully do-able. This game gives you such a reward for completing even a minor objective goal, large scale or small conflict. For example - I offered to capture point Elena, and next to point elena is a town situated on a 4 way crossroad, with another point on the other side. Whilst I'd got my infantry in there, the enemy managed to rout me out via napalm & artillery, at which I had to withdraw to prevent losses. I got together some Delta Force in humvees & some Norweigan Stormers in M113's, got my teammates to assist creating a smoke blanket on one half of the town to cover my advance, and stormed the town back. Heavy casualties on both side, intense building-to-building fighting against entrenched Motostrelki + Spetsnaz, but we claimed victory after a good 15 minute fight. It's moments like these, that occur every game I play, that keep me coming back to play.Buy it. Srs.			"

												This game really captures the socio economic issues of the late 80's while maintaining a fun and engaging gameplay. The history buffs will enjoy the accurate portrayal of the two faction(The Warsaw pact and Nato) in a fictitious timeline, but may also be displeased by the inaccuracies portrayed by military hardware used by the opposing factions. The gameplay  has been sped up from its predecessor(WG:EE) while still maintaining a strategy over speed mentatility. Some fans of the more Micro/Macro based RTS' might enjoy the very micro heavy gameplay while disliking the less macro oriented aspects.All in all, I believe this game to be a great history tool in portraying a world where warfare dominated the late 80's and early 90's creating somewhat of a ""what if"" scenerio all the while still containing great gameplay and solid controls(some adjustments might necessary to achieve a more traditional RTS based keybind pattern).

												I just picked up this game, and I have to say, it's not your average strategy game. It is much more complex than something like Command and Conquer, and you need to be quite strategic in your strategies. You need to keep your units balanced, so just sending in a ton of tanks won't win the battle for you.The aircraft, AAA, SAMs, and choppers add a lot to the game too. (I absolutely love killing planes with hidden SAM trucks. Boom!) Transporting infantry is well implemented. And then the units. 800+ units from all different countries, all well modeled and animated.The gameplay is difficult, but rewarding, and is fun to master. Buy this game if you want a slightly more realistic RTS game that has tons of replay value and good multiplayer. (The 10v10 multiplayer is beast.)BUY THIS. It's a good deal, and you don't need to buy Red Dragon unless you want ships, and this is cheaper. Wargame: Airland Battle is a great game.			"

Logistics and reconnaissance are given the attention and respect they deserve since battles aren't just about blowingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥up and capturing territory, even if that's the ultimate goal. The only problem is finding like-minded individuals to give the game a crack due to it potentially being seen as too fiddly when compared to its mainstream competitors.

												It mostly feels like somewhat of a mix between World in Conflict and Ruse, which means that you do not have to trouble yourself with basebuilding, but that proper use of units is very important. However due to the sheer attention to detail, often complex mechanics and the games tendency to brutaly punish for mistakes, the learning curve can be a bit nasty. Still, the game is good fun, and I can recomend it.			"

												Much better than European Escalation. Airland (as the name states) now has more ""air"" with the addition of jets. This is no game for scrubs though. This is a realistic, brutal, strategy game  that literally requires your full attention to detail like enemy troop movement as well as your own. Airland is better with friends, so find a battle buddy. Airland is brutal at times but is constantly imroving and with Red Dragon coming out soon, it'll be better to buy it now and get a feel for the game.			"

												Do you enjoy a slower pace & larger scale RTS? Than this is the game for you, I cannot speak much about the single player but I really enjoy playing this in 10v10 online battles, as the pace and size of the matches allows for a really nice flow to the game. Also this is a must if you enjoy cold war era settings and equipment as this game has it in spades. Think of this as an unnoffical Tom Clancy - Red Storm Rising the game, because that is what it is.			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle is the sequel to the highly rated RTS Wargame : European Escalation, and I can honestly say, that it improves upon it's predecessor in multiple ways.For starters, as the name suggests, along the 361 different units available in the original all making their return, you can now take control of the skies with Cold War era Fighter and Bomber Jets, ranging from Russian Mig's to Allied F-14's and A-10 Warthogs. The introduction of these jets, plus lots of new tanks, artillery, infantry, helicopters and other vehicles and equipment from the Cold War Era means that there are now over 800 units featured in the game!If your sick and tired of traditional C&C style base building then Wargame:ALB is definately the game for you. You never need to build a single structure in order to get your favourite units and instead simply use points gained from holding key strategic territories in the multiple and vast maps to strengthen and replenish your existing forces. If you count yourself a fan of RTS's then this is simply a must buy. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and enjoy the chaos and destruction of the Cold War turning hot and crush those Capitalist swines with the Soviet led PACT forces, or stop the Russian Bear in its tracks with the American led NATO coalition.No matter which side you choose, prepare yourself to have lots of fun!

												Awesome, absolutely proves a challenge for some RTS players and the combined arms gameplay is absolutely stunning! The fact you're allowed to control Joint-Ops in the air and on the ground is awesome as it already is. A very wide range of units to choose from, each mission has its own form of approach on how to take your enemy down. Every unit has a counter measure, even the fastest of jets and the strongest of tanks may find themselves put down but what might appear to be the least expected unit to be thrown against them. This game takes into mind many aspects such as recon, armour penetration, accuracy, morale and even on-field errors and setbacks such as an Optical Failure or a track breaking loose, hampering the movement or accuracy of a tank or vehicle. Not even Helicopters or Jets are safe from the dangers of on-field setbacks.			"

Posted: January 18, 2016
												Backstory:   I grew up playing strategy games such as Command & Conquer and Starcraft, but after a while I grew tired of the arcade-y gather resources, build a base, spam a unit, upgrade, repeat archetype. I came to want a game with some more strategy than spamming a good unit. So, I told my friends the kind of game I was thinking, no base building, units that don't have unlimited fuel and ammo, and more sophisticated combat than 'this does more damage than this' and they said, ""you mean Wargame?"" Thus, I bought the game.Getting into the Game:   First off, there is the singleplayer, which is basically skirmishes with the nigh mindless AI. It's not much, even with a campaign of sorts, but it isn't a bad place to get used to the game and test things like new decks before you start playing multiplayer as the AI does know how to defend itself and keep the pressure on you. Next up is the multiplayer; unfortunately, with as few players as this game often has, most players will be either very good pros who've been playing this game a long time or almost completely new players to the game giving it a test. So, chances are unless you find someone willing to help you (whom I have seen a lot of; the community is typically fairly friendly), you'll have a lot of games were your allies can't pull their weight or your enemies have super-sneaky infantry and fire-support for them in every bush you don't want them to, making getting used to the game in multiplayer a difficult but not insurmountable challenge for the unseasoned.Gameplay:   The first thing that sets Wargame apart from most RTS games is the realistic attempt at mechanics.  Units are often very specialized for countering certain other units, and there are often counters for those units. I could go into great depths on the handling of the units and the importance of anti-armor ability, high-explosives, range, accuracy, stealth, supply vehicles, command vehicles, capturing sectors, radar AA, anti-radar planes, bombers, fighters, helicopters, manpad infantry, anti-tank guided missiles, artillery, recon, maintaining a good screen against enemy attack, and so on, but that belongs in a manual. For now, I'll leave it at large numbers of units not being a good stratagy, because an intelligent enemy can simply pick your guys off out of range and sight with ease. Positioning, recon, and being ready to kill whatever comes your way are typically what win the game.Decks:   The replacement of base building and research in contemporary games is the building of decks. You can create a deck in the deck editor to your liking (balanced approaches typically work best, but unique strategies have their place) and use it in any match that isn't campaign, and start with every unit you will be able to use that match at your disposal, only limited by the deployment points gained from capturing sectors with command vehicles. Do not be discouraged by the sheer choice of units: you can limit your selection by country, date, and general combat philosophy (mechanized, motorized, marine, airborne, armored, etc.)Vs. Red Dragon   Of due note is this game's sequel, Red Dragon. If you find the need for a lot of variety and a large playerbase, you might want Red Dragon instead. However, Red Dragon, while it adds more content, is broken in gameplay compared to Airland Battle. Simply put, Red Dragon is what happens when you put late 1990s top-shelf equipment in a game modelling the late 1980s; it isn't a perfect fit, and game balancing suffers.Pros+Solid gameplay. Nations are well balanced, while still being diverse in technologic advancement+Sweden. Sweden, a neutral, often forgotten country in warfare, has a lot of great strengths and perplexing weaknesses+Intelligence, preparation, and careful management over nigh-mindless spamming. Chance for good, in-depth strategy to develope over what often becomes stack-wiping battles+Diversity. Plenty of ways to win and get a sneaky one-up on your enemyCons+Aging graphics. Not bad by any means, but certainly not the shiniest toy on the block+Few people. Everyone pretty much has no idea what they're doing or knows the game like the back of their hand			"

												Wargame has an interesting take on RTS; its huge map and large amount of units creates a certain chaos in game that makes it extremely enjoyable to watch an airstrike wipe out an entire convoy of light armor and tanks.The air units in the game seem somewhat useless when it boils down to a point where if you're not using a YAK you're dead, everything has its own usefulness but the game is based mostly off of statistics and less tactics. Sending in a large convoy of Lepords that get wiped out by a single Abrams that just happened to stop on the street and start firing away without taking any damage seems a bit absurd.My biggest complaint is the whole focus on "" Large Scale "", it ignores what a game is about; The small details.The game forgets about efficent structuring for the Infantry and gives them a really horrible circle formation movement that ruins the whole game, not only that they only fire one by one, the unit will literally aim in the air and start shooting on his feet well all the other units hit prone...Then they switch around like some duck duck goose â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and then take turns hopping up and firing one by one. It totaly ruins the game for me when I want to fight endless hordes of infantry using infantry, because if they so happen to have one guyI'd say 6/10			"

												I'm still relatively new to the game, I read the 160 page guide and played (more like lost) several games (even though my most recent of which I held off 3 enemy assaults by myslef because, unknown to mee my teammates left). So I might change this review later. But for anyone who is looking to buy a Wargame and doesn't know which one to buy, do not buy this one. I regret asking a friend for this one during Christmas because it is nearly dead, if I could go back and get Red Dragon I would in a heartbeat. Besides that I love every part of this game, being a military nut I love the depth this game has and how accurately it depicts the growth of weaponry for a cold war that got a bit hotter. Retaining things like small arms development and changing things that do not fit the timeline. The deck system is a favorite of mine since I love creating my own decks in card games and making something unique that can be tweaked to perfection. This is my first military RTS so I cannot give opinions on most of the gameplay, but the idea of a 1-10v1-10 really makes me feel like I'm controlling joint combined arms operations in World War III. Eugen has made an amazing game - that, so far - I love.			"

												My very first RTS. Where to start.I love this game, it's such a good time to play. That being said, the game is ridiculously hard. I've played 30hrs and I still can't even do the campaign on easy. I gave up on it. Skirmishes are fun, but MP is almost dead, but now you have really nice people who play in pubs so that's good. I love the game, it has so many units, hours and hours worth, so you can change your army or deck as it's called and really have lots of variation. The learning curve is steep, but it's worth the time.			"

												Wargame in my mind is one of the best RTSs I have ever played.The game is set in the Cold War Era with the NATO forces fightning PACT forces. The game involes some strategy and a good deck of units. You can't just spam aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of units and hope to win,you actually have to think about your desicions.If you are looking for a good RTS then you will love this game.			"

Still, there is. I am so carried away with the game I do not my 5 euros at all. Very good worth for money. For me the only drawback is the soundtrack and the scale: both could have been much more epic. Anyway, it is recommended to any strategy lover or soldier wannabe.			"

The campaign mode made me buy this game and not Company of Heroes (which lacks such a mode). I did not regret it. It is not an easy game to get into and I prefere WWII but Cold War is also not bad and the game is very realistic (line of sight, realistic strength/weaknesses of units, logistic considerations, etc...). I only played it for 9 hours but I'm already hooked. I didn't buy my new computer for nothing after all.			"

												Note - this is not recommended for SP - there's better and far more realistic RTS games available (not being able to issue orders while paused, and an insanely sped-up gametime (real battles involving brigade-strength units are rarely over in 20 minutes!) mean that as a SP RTS it's limited (as is the lack of a tailored campaign, with the single player game being limited to tutorials and skirmishes thrown together in a 'dynamic campaign').  Fortunately, Eugen's sequel, Wargame: Red Dragon, provides time controls and is a far better single player experience, and well worth a look.However, for a fun, tactical MP RTS it shows a lot of potential and well worth a look.  It's just not my thing, and the game is advertised as both single-player and multi-player, and I'm reviewing this for it's SP content, which is lacking, and not near as ""impressive in solo play"" as the marketing suggests.  It's not terribly, mind, but the inability to give orders while paused, and the requirement of most maps to maintain multiple axes of advance, just turns it into yet another arcade RTS clickfest, cancelling out the benefit of what are very good underlying unit and combat models.

												This game is a very good rts that requires quite a bit of tactical play as well as strategy and unlike more traditional rts games this game focuses more on tactics than actions-per-minute or unit spamming.Before each battle you must select a deck of units which you can customise to suit your play style. Initially it is a bit overwhelming because of the sheer amount of units to choose from so it's best to start with any custom deck and fine tune it after every battle as you learn more. Eventually you could have different decks to suit different strategies and maps. It's a lot of fun creating a deck, previewing the units and checking out their stats.The graphics and effects are amazing but during a battle you probably won't get much chance to see them in all their glory. However if you win a good game make sure to play back the replay and you can view the action up close and personal.Multiplayer seems to be where this game is at it's best and although a lot of the player base seems to have moved onto it's successor Red Dragon you can still get a game in most times. There are also single player campaigns and a skirmish play mode too. Overall I would recommend this game. "

Make sure you have friends to play with or you are matched with very hard opponents. With a selection of 5 engaging and generally fun coop and solo campaigns, a lot of maps and units to play with and a very fun multiplayer, its fair to say that the game does NOT lack content. All wargame fans want and need now is a more modern variant. With wargame: Red Dragon just around the corner can it deliver. I would personally love a 1990-2010 wargame.			"

												Fun tactical game of modern warfare, with just enough realism to be enjoyable while still being more of a game than a simulator.One option of score keeping makes your soldiers's lives valuable so that zerg rushes lead to defeat, not victory. You have to attack the enemy where he is weak and without suiciding your units, like in civilized countries in real life.I applied lessons learned from modern war veterans to great success. Noobs get steam rolled, veterans are dueled in the realm of psychology (feints, bait and trapping, counter-attacking).Unfortunately the interface is trash, memorized key commands a necessity and air defense requires micro-management, so it's not the perfect game, but still fun occasionally.Turn off ambient noise or whatever it's called, otherwise it will drive you crazy and you'll still hear it hours after shutting off the game.

												This is perhaps the most fantastic RTS game I have every played! Set in the Cold War era, this highly tactical RTS pits NATO and the Warsaw Pact against each other in large scale epic battles. The mulitplayer is incredibly fun with matches that range from 1v1 to 10v10 (and let me tell you, 10v10 battles are chaotic!). This is a game where unit spam is not a viable option. You have to carefully study the units in the armory when creating your ""decks"" (these are armies you can make in the game that you bring with you into battles). The deck customization itself is impressive. The maps are huge but vary in size depending on the amount of players. This game requires that you put some time into it, but when you do, you will be rewarded with great victory. I highly recommend this game. I have had nothing but fun since I started playing. But just be warned that the next Wargame title is coming soon.			"

												This is the best RTS game ever made, plain and simple. There has never been before such a well refined and accurate Cold War RTS. Euguen Systems made Huge improvments over Wargame : EE. The Deck system has completely changed and is MUCH better that the EE deck system. Great maps, great units, great game. 10/10 Best RTS ever made.			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle is a distinct improvement over European Escalation. That said, there are obvious balance issues that the dev team can not (or will not) address. That said, access to aircraft really does fix many of the issues with EE (undefeatable ATGM/SAM nests, imbalance between newer and experienced players). Great game, lots of fun. The dynamic campaign is neat but lacks personality.			"

												I will reccomend this game to anyone who likes a game about war. However, like all games it has its flaws. Make sure you have friends to play with or you are matched with very hard opponents. With a selection of 5 engaging and generally fun coop and solo campaigns, a lot of maps and units to play with and a very fun multiplayer, its fair to say that the game does NOT lack content. All wargame fans want and need now is a more modern variant. With wargame: Red Dragon just around the corner can it deliver. I would personally love a 1990-2010 wargame.			"

												After some time playing this game, I'm met with kind of mixed emotions. I love a realistic war game. This game is that, but to a point. I would rather it be 100% realistic, or as much as it could be versus just making it balanced. They've taken away some of the realisim for the sake of game balance. I also realize that this would make the game less fun, as no one likes to loose all the time. So, is the game good? Absolutely! But it's a stratagy sim, not the most realistic war game ever made as some have claimed. But very fun to play nonetheless.			"

												""Wargame: Airland Battle"" is not one of it's kind only becouse it now has both - prequel and sequel. But in all other aspects I don't recall game like this. While on first sight it seems to be another Real Time Wargame it has something that makes it different. In ways that matters. It has genuine feel of actuall battlefield, putting weight on planning and executing strategy, right choice of troops, combined arms and maintaining your troops supplied instead of inhuman reflex and micro management. Really big list of available units equipped with things that matters (for example there is a difference between various types of guided missiles) gives players a lot of flexibility while constructing their own ""deck"". And the looks. Today a bit outdated, still has its appeal. I must confess that I constantly switch between zooms. Looking from far away I have a clear sight of what's going on, with nice icons marking location and troop type. And when looking at close it's hell of a fun to see how your tanks move along the road, escorted by choppers above them... If I were to give one reason why niot to buy and play ""Wargame: Airland Battle"" I would say it's becouse you can buy and play ""Wargame: Red Dragon"".			"

The online matchmaking could be better, the campaign could be better too, either I'm stupid or I sat on the campaign map for 20 minutes trying to figure it out. But over all the game is pretty fun when you know what you're doing, if you want a modern military strategy game, either for campaign or Multiplayer against other people then get this.			"

												Ok........This is a really good game...graphics are very smooth on the eye and excellent. The interface is easy to use, the game play is easy to pick up, but that's where the fun ends........Because s**t gets real!!!!It is not a game where you can just plop units down and say they are better than the enemies as you will get annialated.It took me hours of practising which unit is best for what.....airstrikes are not always the answer!!! You need to strike a balance of what you place out and always look at what the enemy has got, if you recon them, you can build a strategy straight away. It's impossible with a squadron of aircraft to decimate infantry and Tanks, like a mechanised infantry unit, because they'll be heavily protected by SAM and AAA emplacements.A good start is to build a wall of defence, with air support and a few tanks hidden in trees but overlooking your zone. infantry and support with artillery fire. Experiment with formations. Lose the plot, Lose the war. I did several times!!!The main campaign in the game is split into 4 missions, but they are really long winded missions that take a hell of a lot of planning. You start of in the map overview where you get to choose what units you can use, whether to re inforce the units etc....Then once your units and the AI units have moved into the same zone the war begins!!!!This game is also excellent in co op campaign mode.Would highly reccomend this game to anyone with interests in military RTSNow where are those Air units going???????

												Jeez , I've jumped into a 'p'review here before reading any other Steam reviews (and hence otherwise being influenced) . In a nutshell it's a game that you need patience to learn with such a steep learning curve ( I haven't even bugun to ascend onto the second rung  on said arc ).I came here from Company Of Heroes and Civ games and even a lot of Starcraft (mostly campaign be it granted).Personally I've found it sooo much tougher to get to grips with compared to those  afore-mentioned games, but boys-a-boys does it look like one hell of an amazing game . Now know where I'm aiming to sink all my spare PC gaming hours into from now on.This is a grown up game for grown ups.Anyone thinking this is some sort of second rate ,dumbed down RTS ...be prepared to be flabbergasted.I aim to keep updating this preview as I progress through the game .

												This game is way too fast for solid realistic tanctics. It looks like reailistic just on the skin ( with all detailed unit types ), but at the end it is just crazy run like C&C Generals or Starcraft.  Very bad THERE IS NO PAUSE or no time control unlike in other serious strategy games. It is almost impossible to manage so many units with detailed micro management required ( puting them to bush ). At the end it is not about tactis, but just about clicking fast enought to keep paste with computer :(. There is also no save in tactical battles. I think European Escalation was much better.From technical point of view there is also problem in Linux with nVidia GPUs, which cause the game to freeze. And technical support of developers does not respond to this issue. "

I don't have hundreds of hours of free time to learn everything, memorize each unit, just to be able to enjoy it.Sure, the game looks good, but the UI is just clumsy and feels very unnatural, BTW.I wish I could return it, but I've already spent enough time, trying to learn something from tutorial.

												This is a fantastic mix of tactical RTS covering the semi-modern military genre. You can zoom out to the edges of the map for a strategic and tactical view of the battlespace, and zoom right into the individual A-10 making a strafing run on those powerful USSR T-80's bearing down on you. Aircraft, tanks, helicopters, recon, infantry, IFV's, artillery...of all shapes sizes and variety. Are you American? Use the American unit group and get access to the stealth bomber, many nationalities have their own prototpye units. Single player game is a bit bland and borning, where this game is...is in the multiplayer. You can go head to head against one player, or be part of the MASSIVE 10vs10 matches.

												By far the best and most interactive RTS game ive played quite a bit played the campaign with two of my friends one for NATO and one for PACT done tonnes of hours into Skirmish only touched public multiplayer twice and it was a meh everyone just spams helis, jet or wheeled light tanks with artillary but i digress. This game is extremely fun well worth its total selling price but with WARGAME RED DRAGON its everything AIRLAND BATTLE has but with ******G!!!!! CRUISERS AND DESTROYERS QUIT READING THIS AND GO BUY THE GAME ITS AMAZING!!!!!!This one time i got over 200 tanks from mid 90s from the USSR and got 8 artillarys with 255mm cannons and it was a blast i lost over 150 tanks trying to secure the enemy base from leopards and m1a and constant swoops of A10 warthogs and i would see all my troops change there status to ROUT and instanding run in all direction while getting picked off by long range tank destroyers ok the morale to the story is i should of bought more tanks nothing else and maybe some anti air			"

												I have never been a big fan of real time strategy games. After trying Age of Empires, World in Conflict and Supreme Commander type games I never considered myself a great fan of having to rush building units, dashing them to the front line and then endlessly mass firing at enemies who are doing the same thing.But this game is nothing like that! There is real strategy involved in scouting out areas with Gazelle helicopters and Warrior scouts before sending in your MTBs and infantry. I love the way the armour and penetration are protrayed - you can see the shells bouncing off the Abrams hull armour. And then you get realistic things like infantry getting panicked under fire, but managing to be deadly against tanks that are stupid enough to wander through infantry defended villages.This game is just so addictive, the graphics are superb especially low down - not that you have much timem to watch them, and the command GUI is really well designed. The enemy AI is very good at both defending and attacking, but even better is multiplayer - this game is completely fluid between the solo and multiplayer modes - I havent been much of a multiplayer gamer before but that could well change.If you have ever wanted to play the Close Combat games in real time with modern units or the Total War games set in the modern day, this game is it.

Even rerun them a couple of times!!!! Wargame is a fun and gorgeous military rts game that lets you play with some of the most current military hardware. While I disagree with some of the devs ratings on some of the vehicles, none the less it is blanced & fun to play. HIghly recommend for any real military rts gamer.			"

												Even though I only have about 21 hours in experience in Wargame Airland Battle, (As of the time I'm typing this) I can see that this is a very great game and a very good one for RTS lovers. It has a, ""Total War: 1985"" feeling to it, as it shares a lot of characteristics with total war, but with a higher learning curve. And not just some, ""Oh, new game. Better see what to do,"" its like dumping all of your experience in other games to adapt to this one. It is a very confusing game at first, and a lot would not get into the game at all. But for some RTS lovers, like me, it would be a strategical fiasco of combat. With so many units, and with soooo many stats for the units, its a very balanced game. You got tanks, that can be countered by airplanes, which could be countered by AA, which could be countered by infantry, which could be countered by helicopter, which could be countered by AA, which is countered by tanks. You get the gist. It has a very big, rock, paper, scissors, feel to it as you play. In the end, great game.			"

Dat rocket artillery.Do not, however buy European Escalation as ALB is the superior version with more of everything. They really should 1: find better name for this product (Cold WarZone?) 2: label ALB and the upcoming Red Dragon as sequels because right now they look like (standalone) expansion packs. Which might be the case. Weird.			"

												This is by far the most complicated game I've seen on the market. You can spend hours delving into various unit traits, learning about their roles on the battlefield but after each battle there's always something you can do to improve your deck. The amount of strategies you can possibly use is also impressive and actually limited by amount of units and your imagination. This is not a game for everyone and you need to spend days or maybe even weeks to learn how to win. But the result will be satisfying.			"

												Love this game!! Only played a few hours and although there is much to master, a quick runthrough of the tutorial will get you somewhat familiar. A lot of depth with many units/countries. This is a very tactical RTS!!! every decision is important and units wasted can devastate you in the long run! I have yet to venture online but skrimishes are a blast! I just got done with an intense 80min battle that came down to the wire... And decided, Let the Steam Community know about this game! Die hard RTS players will love this to add to their library of games like SC, TA, and COH. Best thing is that this plays completely different than those games. Utilize Deck Cards and deploy units you think will be effective in warfare. Great Buy!			"

												Even though I only have about 21 hours in experience in Wargame Airland Battle, (As of the time I'm typing this) I can see that this is a very great game and a very good one for RTS lovers. It has a, ""Total War: 1985"" feeling to it, as it shares a lot of characteristics with total war, but with a higher learning curve. And not just some, ""Oh, new game. Better see what to do,"" its like dumping all of your experience in other games to adapt to this one. It is a very confusing game at first, and a lot would not get into the game at all. But for some RTS lovers, like me, it would be a strategical fiasco of combat. With so many units, and with soooo many stats for the units, its a very balanced game. You got tanks, that can be countered by airplanes, which could be countered by AA, which could be countered by infantry, which could be countered by helicopter, which could be countered by AA, which is countered by tanks. You get the gist. It has a very big, rock, paper, scissors, feel to it as you play. In the end, great game.			"

												I feel that the planes sort of brings this game back a few paces from the last game because I find that the majority of the time I am being spammed with cheap bombers that pick at my defensive/offensive line. I use AA sure, but the panes out weigh my AA and this makes me feel that the planes should be more moderated. However I do think that this adds more variation to the factions, unique units and new tactics it brings to the table but despite this it still only has a few bad maps in the selection. This is just my opinion shortly summerised. I'm sure some people will disagree but I fount it hard to continue through the game without having any fun. It's an interesting game but no real advancements in gameplay that is any more interesting than the last.6/10			"

												Get this game if you enjoy thoughtful strategy games. Where units can die from a single well aimed hit, range and vision becomes extremely important.You will have to carefully decide where and how each unit travesl to maximize their ability to kill and minimize their risk of death.In multiplayer, you get the chance to outwit your enemy by forcasting their movements. This is very different from the majority of RTSs, in that it is not so much about building up an economy and out producing the enemy to overwhelm them with a horde of units, but to out think the enemy and correctly position and micro manage units when required.With a full range of arsenal from infantry, tanks, artillery, helicopters, and aeroplanes, there are many ways to eliminate the enemy and take over their positions and lots of different mechanics and statistics to learn.

												One of the best RTS in years. Semi-realistic modern military RTS.You make a ''deck'' (more like amry roster like in tabletop miniature games) and you go battle with that roster aginst other players. There is no basebuilding, you get points in the start of the match and you call in units with those points. Game has awesome mechanics for cover, buildings and all sorts of other cool terrain features. In Airland battle there is also addtion of planes into the series.Great game if you like something like world in conflict, ground control (and even maybe some steelpanther). when you can overcome the relative ''high'' learning curve (ie. keep your tanks fueled and ammo flowing) you get a awesome RTS with high replayability. There is also an dynamic gampaing for co-op, singleplayer or versus modes, in which you battle over scandinavia.			"

												Everytime I play this series I end up angry. It's just a lot of little things that pile up. One big thing that I hate is the distribution of delopyment points. Sometimes it's good, other times not so much. Another thing is if you move two divisions into the same sector as one enemy divison, you do not get the benefit of units and deployment points from both divisions. Aparently there is no such thing as a tag team in this game, because apparently war is a fair fight.Also I've only ever played on easy mode. YES. EASY. As in the game is enough to kick your butt and make you angry on EASY MODE. Every other game I play I start at normal. I've never purposefully started on easy mode until this series. Now I have won some campaigns. But there is a difference between winning and having fun. Sometimes you put some much work into winning that it just becomes a chore. That's probably just me though. I think I would get more pleasure from playing a difficult level of Talos Principle and winning compared to this game.			"

												I like the Wargame: European escalastoin more than this, because it was simplier and more fun. I tried this game and did not like it at all, the old is better.There was too mutch new things in it, that i did not like and because it was so mutch diffrend than the old one, i dont mean the new maps, vehicles or planes those were nice new things that i wanted, but how it was confusing to get to choose/use the units and the play style didnt feel the same like the old one, so thats why i cant recommend this game.

												I bought the original Wargame 2 days after it came out, but never really played it because i didn't really get how the game worked. However, i bought Airland Battle a few days ago on offer, and decided i would stick with it. The new deck system is much better than the old one, you no-longer have to unlock units (a pain for me because i found the campaign very hard) and the new aircraft really add an extra depth to the game. However, the core gameplay is much the same, but when combined with using the units that i WANT to use, instead of what i'm stuck with, made all the difference. In the most recent game i played, Economy, there was a 40 point difference between the two sides, trying to get to 3000ish. We were both at 2700. to maintain my lead, i needed to hold an area cut off behind enemy lines, and the units were out of ammo and exhausted, plus on the most part damaged. I won the game by using a simple chinook resupply helicopter, flying from my FOB into the area and landing in a field while the battle raged on either side to deliver the supplies. With a bit of imagination, i could imagine the men running from the back of the helicopter, carrying cases of ammo, to the trees while under machine gun fire and having tanks battling it out on the other side of the treeline. And then the pilot said ""Why do i get the feeling your about to put our lives at risk?"" That skin of the teeth victory was probably the most enjoyable battle i've had in a long time on all of my games, and if i get even a few more moments like that, i'll be content. Money well spent, in my opinion!			"

												Jeez is this fun with friends, but if you're too lazy to figure out how the multiplayer works (Like me.) you need a controller to play with those friends. This is in early access, and you can easily see that. There's a lot of room for more, which is why the price might seem a little bit too high, but the fun you can have with it makes it worth it. Quite a fun game, but I have found the odd bug. One (That seems like one.) is playing with a keyboard. You can't grab with both hands and lift, only with a controller. Overall, this quite the fun game, and it isn't even finished. I'm pretty hyped for new updates, because of course there will be for at least awhile, it's early access, which might make some people not want to buy it. I thought it was worth it, but again, the price seems a little too high right now, but again; Early Access = Updates. Updates = New things.			"

												Awesome! Simply great. Probably my favorite statregy game ever (before red dragon) the complexity and scope is beuatiful, you can use actual real world military tatics to great effect. I dont like the 20 min time limit on battles, but it means you get to play more battles, and if you mess up badly it doesnt have a catstophic impact on your overall campaign. The pace is a little fast, but once you get the hang it feels natural. Its a very rewarding game, there is nothing better than watching you prefect plan unfold and smash the will and morale of the enemy. Do yourself a favor, even though red dragon is out buy this game!			"

												With such a sharp learning curve and very poor tutorial, this game is even more lacking than its predacessor. A shame because I was looking forward to having access to more aircraft.The guides I've tried looking up to get around the horribly hostile and overly offensive political community that seems like it's from â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'s /pol/ all say ""Play PACT and spam tanks.""Aircraft, which are advertized as an integral part of the game, get swatted from the skies with ease from the most basic AAA fire. Forget about SAMs, AAA rapes aircraft just as good. Plus it seems like planes don't actually want to ever shoot what you order them to target.The game is not fun, nor was its predacessor. I will not be ordering the third game.Also the community is very hostile and you can regularly enjoy watching fights in the chat as people ""discuss"" world politics.			"

												If you enjoy single player and don't wanna spend your life online getting smashed by guys that live on here, don't buy this game! I honestly feel like im back in the arcade world, where nothings fair or even close to ""realistic"". You have only 20mins no matter what you plan on doing to start, deploy and conquer the entire map, which is the complete opposite of what I thought these games and ""war"" itself were all about. On top of that the actual structure of the unit combat doesn't even make sense? You can completely lose the entire unit filled with 100's of vehicles by simply placing your command unit in the wrong place before the battle starts. The AI is also unbelievably aggressive and attacks with what seems like every unit in the game in the first 2mins. That combined with the completely ridiculous ""moral"" and ""initiative"" systems that make no sense, this game is not a realistic rts simulator anymore. I really don't know what these developers were thinking when they brutalized this into some sort of online focued only game, but its a total shame when you consider how good it couldve been.			"

												Seems like it could be a fun game, if not for a major drawback to new players, the first being that the tutorial is utter garbage. It doesn't tell you the controls or really any relevant information. It gives you directives without telling you how to complete them and on top of that even during the tutorial the enemy has overwhelming firepower and obliderates your units. Infantry seem to be about as useful as throwing snowballs at battletanks and the game doesn't tell me what anything else does. It seems to be an alright game once it becomes playable.			"

												I felt potential till this point. I was in love with the game when i first bought it. I loved the aspects like the even more detailed deck making system without penalties for new players (in ee you had to unlock all the units). I could spend more time in the decks than in the game itself just by hesitating on the best units to take in. There came the airplanes, and the mountanious, not geometrically perfect, fancy looking maps were added once again, after 4 years, like it was in R.U.S.E.. There are even more detailed vehicles, and they amount to 700-800. Everything what was realistic in european escalation, is even more realistic here. And yeah, the look of the maps has FAAAAAAAR more variety than in the previouss serie. These are the positives, and i still like them.But! I am a veteran R.U.S.E., and european escalation player, I almost played just multiplayer in these games, and won lot of rounds, and also lose at least the same amount. In airland battle I first came to multi, as the singleplayer is FAAAR from the fun in mp (I just you know played it like a tutorial not to be extremely lame). I then came up to multi, built my first deck, and started my first game. WOW i won that. I love games where I start with feeling of success. Then came the next rounds. Lost. Lost. Lost. Lost. Eh thats too. Okay, i built a more logical deck. Then lost again, and again. I stopped playing it for some days, then tried again, and nothing. I have been doing that till this article, and it SUCKS BALLS. I never had a day where I won more than I lost, and there are days where there aren't any victories! I always try to make the new decks, new tactics, and never manage to win!So I hate that almost all russian tanks have this â¥â¥â¥â¥in AT rocket. I hate the planes, because i hate ALL kinds of aircraft, as they ruin my game even if I make AA rockets, AA planes and even AA helis! I hate that you always start with a maximum of 1000 (1500?) dollars, and if you do not fear enough, you are wiped out from the map and you can do nothing in the other half of the game. I dont know, why, but i cannot win in this game.			"

												This is simply the finest RTS I have ever played. The number of units (800+!!!) and attention to detail in modeling the look and capabilities of those units is second to none. The focus on realistic warfare (w/in reason) makes it one of the few RTS's that feels every bit as tactical as the best turn based strategy games. In fact, I would say it is the most tactical wargame I have ever played. The game is very easy to control in terms of moving units around the map, but is incredibly deep when it comes to truly learning how to play the game well. I have over 150 hours in the game and am still learning the nuances.The game looks like a dream, with excellently represented units from NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Great unit detail and great special effects with the smoke and fire and explosions. Only the infantry modeling leaves a little to be desired. The scaling is also incredible. A spin of the mouse wheel will zoom you in so that a single unit fills your entire screen in wonderful detail. A spin of the wheel in the opposite direction will zoom out to the point that the entire map is visible on your screen. My only negative is that the SP campaign is absolutely byzantine and unsatisfying. Good luck figuring out how to play it. But the real value of this game is in the SP skirmish mode and MP. MP is brutal, but extremely rewarding after you learn the ropes. You will lose often, but it will never feel cheap. When you lose it is because you screwed up, when you win it is because you were the better player.Deep, user friendly, and pretty to look at, this is the best RTS on the market.			"

												I don't recmmend this game becouse there is true that there are a lot of troops and stuff but when going on detail it's just bad i mean the helicopters go down very easy meanwhile tanks abrams are the best i had 3 and win in 15 minutes. So as I say If you like company of heroes don't buy this game is too big. Oh and one more thing I hate that there are no upgrades and the troops walk in circles??? Really! And sometimes the tanks when are in the cities are somehow in the buildings?? Anyway I played World in Conflict and even though it was made in 2007 it's still better then this.			"

												This game is a plain joke. It may look quite nice (not as nice as in the screenshots however) but donÂ´t be fooled by some (blunt)bling.The tutorial is no help at all and the average player will get frustrated (just trying to beat the tut, that is) for not understanding or being made clear by said tutorial what to do and when and how. So much for ""accessible""...If you wanna waste your money however...go ahead.			"

												This is simply the finest RTS I have ever played. The number of units (800+!!!) and attention to detail in modeling the look and capabilities of those units is second to none. The focus on realistic warfare (w/in reason) makes it one of the few RTS's that feels every bit as tactical as the best turn based strategy games. In fact, I would say it is the most tactical wargame I have ever played. The game is very easy to control in terms of moving units around the map, but is incredibly deep when it comes to truly learning how to play the game well. I have over 150 hours in the game and am still learning the nuances.The game looks like a dream, with excellently represented units from NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Great unit detail and great special effects with the smoke and fire and explosions. Only the infantry modeling leaves a little to be desired. The scaling is also incredible. A spin of the mouse wheel will zoom you in so that a single unit fills your entire screen in wonderful detail. A spin of the wheel in the opposite direction will zoom out to the point that the entire map is visible on your screen. My only negative is that the SP campaign is absolutely byzantine and unsatisfying. Good luck figuring out how to play it. But the real value of this game is in the SP skirmish mode and MP. MP is brutal, but extremely rewarding after you learn the ropes. You will lose often, but it will never feel cheap. When you lose it is because you screwed up, when you win it is because you were the better player.Deep, user friendly, and pretty to look at, this is the best RTS on the market.			"

												This game blows. It is really cool in the fact that the units are realistic and it could be really cool except for one simple fact....... you don't fight the computer and you don't fight other human players. You fight against the awful interface. If you don't have nine hands and play starcraft like you're a south korean you are hopelessly doomed. How in the world is one person supposed to control a whole brigade worth of assets at the same time. The AI does nothing for you but sit there and die. If you are a micromanging master this game will appeal to you. If you want to test real strategy on a micro or macro level forget about it. I will never buy another game from this company until they make the players units do more for you. What is the point of a scout who doesn't call for fire? An anti air asset who sits behind the trees and can't shoot and won't move to a position that will. Screw this game			"

Don't worry though it's not that bad, basically it follows an ultra unique storyline where the Soviet Union declared war on the Allies. It's also an RTS, but I shouldn't tell you about the gameplay that would spoil it.

												Clunky!I cannot see why this game takes so long to download. I have had games on CD's that had better strategy on a scale of many times. I am playing the solo game only. After playing strategy games for forty years it is hard not to be convinced that people who make them now wish they were doing something else. There are some really cool little things among the battle scenes but the game just rolls on and by the time you direct troops to a building the whole board has changed and you can lose a whole region.The extension of the conditions from a battle to the strategic board is basic and I have no idea what the game is doing or why. It is like trying to knit wearing garden gloves, The battles and the scores from the battles are repetitive. There just isnt the diversity of action or outcome to even justify making a game. The tiny list of strategic actions is childlike and confusing. I guess a good strategic war game would begin to step on the toes of war planners in the real world but after games like Harpoon and others where I moved the whole middle east and fought unit to unit with full flow of bullets and beans, military police controlling busy crossroads and aircraft flying across oceans with refueling this game is a huge disappointment			"

												Do not buy this game if you intend to only play against the computer. The AI ""cheats"" massively (it knows all your units and their locations) and skirmishing against it is a hard slog that almost forces you to change your style to take advantage of AI ""gaps"". I was really looking forward to this but it's just not a lot of fun against the AI. Multiplayer seems to be much more compelling, but I've already got too many multiplayer games to add another. This one goes on the shelf. First game on Steam I would have actually asked for a refund for. Too bad. "

You can never outflank or ambush the AI since it knows where your infantry is deplyed etc. etc. Don't buy it for Single Player experience.

												I accidentally bought this game because it was on special offer and did not realise it was connected to that other trash they made European Escalation. I never buy sequel games where the previous one is horrendous. However this game showed promise with a tutorial and a campaign map that had me thinking this might just work. This might be what I was looking for from the previous game. Boy was I wrong! I started playing the first campaign on easy and you get 20 minutes to win the battle which was barely enough time to cross the map. WTF!!! Why won't they let me play and why won't they let me adopt MY strategy on the map. Instead they want to tell you how you should play the game. This game, like the last one, could have been so amazing. I think they really need to look at a game called Total War but its too late for me because I will NOT be buying any more in this horrific series. That said I do see why people like the multiplayer aspect but you should ONLY buy it for that reason as the DEVs can't for the life of them draw up a decent campaign map which I have to say looks tiny anyway. One word to summarise this game? Diabolical!!!!			"

												The game is great. Great vehicles, great packs of info for total newbies to see how armies work. But the interface is the problem. Simple buying and commanding units requires more training than guitar fingers and actual understanding of the game mechanics. I say no to this game because I like to relax while playing. You should say yes either to just see all the fancy units or if you are really ready to train yourself to do decent APM (number of Actions Per Minute) with problematic interface.P.S. Or say yes if you want to see Canada invade the world!!!			"

												The developers are largely uncaring about this game and regularly abuse its fanbase by nerfing certain factions.  The playerbase is terrible with in game chat being awful and on top of that the fanbase is generally just a bunch of pubstompers.  If you are looking for a fun game look elsewhere, this game lacks any real strategy and instead is based around bringing the overpower units of the month.I rate 2/8.			"

												The Wargame series like most of Eugen games is aimed mostly at Multiplayer and not single player. Whilst single player support does exist, it is really not that interesting. Single player campaigns tend to be short and sweet in Eugen's games and mostly balanced for multiplayer. Even Ruse suffers from this too, I would recommend Ruse over the Wargame series if your a single player fan.			"

												This game is certainly one of the most overrated  pieces of garbage I've seen on steam. Dont get me wrong I love the concept of a Cold war rts but its VERY poorly executed in this game. Let me provide examples: 1. Special Forces are completely unrealistic as  they are apparently (according to the game) Indestructable to Tanks, Napalm, Arterly, and other Infantry( with the exception of other spec ops)  2. Recon makes no sense whatsoever as the Spetsnaz VMF (a two man squad) has a higher chance of being spotted than a squad of five Razvedka division. Also on the topic of recon lets talk about the broken recon helicopter system  as the statistics make no sense whatsoever. This can be easily shown through the optics section of a units description (in this case Iâm using the Soviet mi-2 as an example) the mi-2 has optics of very good  but how is one to compute the words very good  into actually game play? I don't know,as it does not give the player a accurate sight listing (ex: optics up to 10,00 meters etc) 3. Helicopter spam: This is probably the most annoying flaw about this broken game  as this happens IN EVERY SINGLE GAME people can simply spam helicopters (and not uses any strategy while doing it)  and literally destroy everything while doing (including anti aircraft) 4. Anti Aircraft   : The aa system  algorithm in this game is surely the worst Iâve seen in my entire life as certain planes are literally untouchable by anti aircraft again let me provide more examples from the game. In a particular match I had 6 zsu-23 afghanskii which altogether have a fire rate of 5,454r/m and a Tunguska system  right beside them. then a lone f -14 tomcat comes along and take NO DAMAGE from the Tunguska and the six  afghanskis  and as to be expected this is continuous from game to game no matter what aa system I use on either pact of nato  it will rarely take down aircraft.  5. Forest Combat : fighting in a forest in this game is being realistic as it basically becomes like harry potter. Basically a squad of 40 motostrelki disappears magically from my 60 US marines, and when I do get sights back on them is says âno clear sightâ  which is absolutely ridiculous  given that the forest aren't very large in most maps. Final Verdict: Only but this game if its ion sail never pay full price for it as its utter garbage to anyone who has respect for this genre of games. As always feel free to reply to this review and install your own views on the matter by doing so. "

If you group your forces together so you can issue commands expect the enemy AI to hit you with artillery or air strikes destroying most of your force.  This was supposed to be easy mode.  The developers fix most of these mistakes in their sequel, Red Dragon.			"

												Waste of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money!  I bought this game during beta, and it will be the last game I ever pre purchase.  Everything is unlocked from the begining, gone are the command stars of Wargame: EE.  After leaving in command stars throughout the entire beta, they pulled them on release day.  Sure the game has 1000s of units, but no one uses anything except the best units.  Imagine the deck building as Magic: The Gathering with everyone having every card.  You cannot use your decks in the campaign, only the absoluteâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥decks the game lets you use.  Also, they can and will blacklist people for no other reason than calling a teammate an idiot for rushing 30 helis into AA, or having one of said idiot teammates rush infantry into your arty to make you TK them, then report you.  If I ever had the opportunity, I would kick the devs in their junk.			"

The combat system is unique and balanced, but extremely difficult. Believe me, the learning curve on this is more extreme than the learning curve on World of Tanks. I just can't get on board with it due to the complexity, however it is a good game if you enjoy watching a top down battle and using combined arms and intelligently placed ambushes to wreck your enemies.

For starters the devs probably know this game is crap because all they gave us for the game was 3D model in desc no gameplay. I have seen so many people request things but the devs couldn't care less. The camera is bad, infantry and sometimes vehicles just go through walls. And out of all the time i have played it just doesn't have that, FUN feel. I highly recommend you do NOT buy the game. The only reason you should buy it (if you are crazy enough) is because it is the only quarter-decent military RTS out there. "

												Boring. Nothing interesting. Problems with cursor in campaign mode. Cursor is disappearing and it is impossible to click right icon.Maps are constructed who first take more that one will win.Playing with computer is a real nightmare. Computer is atacking from all sides with all variety of units. When you move slowly with caution, you will loose becouse computer will grab all resources. When you rush at the beggining you will lose of computers bloody multitasking. On small scale the game is interesting, when difficulty is rising the game is begin to be more annoying and frustrating because of computer multitasking. Human is simply not able to focus on so many units on such a big maps.Doing or at least trying that, a map is on so large scale that units are barely visible and you play only on tactic map.So you never see this nice 3D graphisc.Single player sucks in my opinion.As I mentioned Boring Game. Nothing interesting.			"

												This is the hardest game to get used to I have ever played, (discounting Europa Universalis IV). It took me about 2 hours of constant defeats at the hands of the AI before I mastered the art of deck creation and unit deployment. But to be honist, they were the most fun (If frustrating) defeats I have ever had. After my humiliating defeats of the first day I managed to secure my first major victory. Very rewarding and chalenging game, not that many people online though.			"

												This is a slow RTS, you have to think methodically and realistically is a awesome game. I did not think the game needed a sequel for awhile, but then they released Red Dragon.Anyway this game releases a lot of new countries. The main issue with the UI is that they have a hard time comparing units from the game to another faction. It also is a little confusing between say infantry when one shows up as a special or you select 1979 for beginners. I have played this series and understand the dynamics and am outlining some problems you may come across. The campaign in this one is intriguing but is only in sweden which ultimately lacks the huge massive conflict of Europe, but also adds some neat Total war-esque type of ideas.The gameplay is more like a tug of war. Whoever controls the zone (which needs a little more work on capturing zones.)  has the advantage and begins to put in play more units on the board.Airland battle does have it's flaws, but the game is far superior to Red Dragon. It is way better then EE.			"

												This a great game with a fairly steep learning curve.  Luckily there are awesome game guides available for those that need/want them.  It definitely caters to those that already know a bit about the military equipment included in the game.  There are so many positives that I could list but basically its the whole game.  If you like this topic in games then this is the one to get.The one con, and one I feel could easily be fixed are the campaign objectives.  You end up with less time and diminished equipment to complete them with as each scenario moves to the next day.  I guess its realistic but there just seem to be artificial time constraints that don't equate to the actual time in a day.			"

												Amazing RTS game set in the most unstable era of mankind: The Cold War.The game features 4 campaigns, playing as each side of the conflict for 2 campaigns each.There is also a massive multiplayer element to the game, with 10v10 brawls.Alright, so lets see what i gathered:Pros- Amazing graphic detail, even at lower settings- I never witnessed any bugs whatsoever, everything played as it should- 10v10 online (you NEED to try this!)- Massive customisable 'decks' which represent the force you command, pick to be a specialised force or a generalised force before battle- Never got boring, the AI would always play unpredictably and aggressively- unlike some other strategy games, like the C&C series; the games would last about 20 minutes depending on player count, as opposed to the paltry 5 to 10 minutes max offered by C&C- Unlike other strategies, rushing is the worst early battle option, allowing for a more realistic strategy experienceHowever, i am not very good at this game at all, so my opinion may be slightly biased for my side.Cons- I dont hate the micro managing features, however they can get irritating while trying to organise a massive push, you have to regularly supply all units with fuel, ammunition, and spare parts/repairs, id rather either be the resupply guy or the combat guy- Dont expect a friendly welcome. upon the realisation they have a 'noob' on their team, many will take the opportunity to guess and mock your apparent junk size, your age, and if you get where this is going... generally noob unfriendly playerbase- There are alot of trolls on this game, who will park artillery units near you base and leech fuel and ammo en masse, leaving you with none- The AI sometimes fails to use variety, and will use only one type of unit, either all tanks, or all helicopters sometimesAnd i guess thats my review guys, look forward to seeing you on the field.

												Amazing detail and versatility!  Use a generic 'deck' to build your army, or accept limits on nationality (but get their prototype units), time period (but sticking with older units means having far more of them), or force type.  Go Armored and get more experienced tanks and more of them at the expense of infantry, or go Air Assault or Paradrop to get brilliant infantry but limit your heavy units to what can be flown in.  Yes, the initial learning curve is steep, but the payoff is awesome.			"

												It's huge, dauntingly complex, incredibly punishing, and one of the most underrated RTS games of all time. Instead of crafting mechanics and tactics for the player to use Wargame takes a [limited] handful of real-world elements and allows the playerâs tactics to evolve organically. This added responsibility lends the game an immense learning curve that, until summited, can make that game incredibly frustrating. Fortunately, the game never feels sadistic; every failure can be easily learned from and later mitigated.This game is not for everyone, but for those who accept the challenge lies an incredibly rich and rewarding strategy game.

												When I first got this game it is very intimidating because it is very complicated and requires a lot of thinking, something that every strategy game should strive for. I have a lot to learn and this review may be premature but it seems quite an amazing strategy game with a lot to it. My suggestion though if you aren't used to a game like this. Spend time with the tutorials and practice with the computer before you go head first into the multiplayer. It will make the game much more digestable and fun in the long run. For 12 dollars, it is worth the money.			"

												This game has one of the biggest learning curves in the history of history. I would say its more a ""battlefield simulator"" than a game. The controls and tactics are so in depth that your mother got lost in it. There's also a reason that there's over 800 (soon to be 1000) units. You'll need every one of these units. An interest in military history and tactics would also help a lot. ""So should I get this game?"" you ask. Well. You will get this game only if you know how to cope with losing, learning, and coordinating. If youre impatient and want a Call of Duty type of action game, you need to not be a part of this game. Also, forget about any other RTS game, because ""zerg rushing"" won't work. Best of luck, potential future commanders.			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle features marvelously executed in depth strategic and tactical gameplay. A wide array of units will keep you occupied for hours on end, even while still learning the game. But be warned, if youre not into a realistic real time strategy game that is relentless and unforgiving, this wont be for you. Also learning the game takes time and dedication to a certain degree. Many things you will only learn by making the same mistake several times until youve realized what the mistake actually was, or by reading guides and watching tutorials. There are plenty of features that arent obvious at first, but very well thought through after youve discovered and examined them.Realism is a big part of the game, and most things you would think are realistic are very likely implemented.To give some examples: Tanks cant shoot downhill, as their cannon cant turn that low in most situations. Every little house on the huge maps blocks line of sight, thus blocking shots. Every Unit has ammunition and fuel, running out of these gives you obvious problems. Soldiers standing in a field burning and being bombed WILL loose morale and run or simply die. Every unit feels different and has different characteristics, and to know them all gives you a great advantage, but is also quite the feat considering there are over 800 of them. You being able to build your own combination of units (called decks) give near endless posibilities and makes every player able to find just the combination that feels right to him.Also the Game looks gorgious considering the large scale: while you command hundreds of soldiers and dozens of tanks at a time, you can still zoom into the map the whole way and marvel at the detail of that one Apache helicopter flying over a forest.This Review was written with 25 hours on record, and today i played my first online match just to get a feeling of how good the competition is. And i was utterly destroyed. It is hard, nothing like the ""big"" rts titles, and alot of fun, especially if you buy it with a friend, you both learn at the same time and test each others skills. But i guess every game is more fun with your friends. "

												Very steep learning curve, but the depth is astounding. It is a very hard game to get into. Getting tactics correct. You don't have limitless troops and you can't call in everything right at the beginning either, so you have to pick your battles very carefully and know when it is absolutetly imperative to pull out of a losing fight and cut your losses. Manage your troops and your supplies well, position correctly and support the front line properly, and you can stand a chance. The multiplayer is really where the game shines. 10v10 epic battles. 40 minutes of just pure brain-exhausting fun. The single player is not too good right now. The ai is rather broken and has a horrible tendency to cheat right now, but nothing that can't be easily fixed by the devs. I really do recommend it, despite the rather great dedication needed and the more or less large time investment necesarry to learn all the different mechanics and the strenghts and weaknesses of your troops. You can choose what troops you can have in a battle by building a deck and depending on how you build it, you can receive very good bonuses, but the skill level required is also higher. Overall a great game, but not something for those just looking to build and rush with massive armies.			"

												This game is very good.  The game will run on XP. But you will need good amount of ram and internet capbitly in order to fully enjoy this game.There is many units and nations to pick and choose from.The graphics are very good. Although if your computer is lower spec i would recomend to lower them . Even though the game will auto configure if you let it , its harder on the computer to play the game smoothly.My only negative thoughts on the game is the sheer diffcuitly. But thats what can make it fun too.I m still learning how to master the game mechaincs. My recomendation for new players to the game [ though i still think im noob at this game too] : the tutorial although can help I think it needs some information on good deck building. I did find youtube vidoes and on the games offical fourm information about this. But I didnt know how that all worked till i learned from experince.This game is not for easy playing. It inloves allot of tactical and stragetic thinking. Its not one of the RUSH TONKS and win kind of game. It really makes you think hard about the other units to work together to win. Though I do like using tanks allot. my rating 8.9/10 important note for lower spec computer users: if your computer is low spec do not attempt to do 10 v 10 online play mode, even if your internet is fast.

												Must be the greatest RTS game I've ever played. There are a huge amount of units. Air units, tanks, infantry, artillery and much more. The battles are epic because of the BF3-looking graphics. And you got loads of possibilities due to the great amount of different strategies you can use.			"

												Wargame: European Escalation definitely touched on a lot of things R.U.S.E ( which i guess you could call a prequal ) had flawed .It brought alot of new features and it was just great. But Airland battle is a pure marvel. Sure it has its flaws but it brings a ton of new things mainly aircraft.The graphics have denfinitely been improved alot. I personaly like the new aproach on reinforcement sectors (sectors in general) rather than buildings and the limited units. It gets rid of the annoying unlimited unit and base spam.The deck and armory systems are nicely made. The resupply mechanic adds alot more strategy than just making aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of tanks with unlimited ammo and fuel and charging in. Overall i give this game a 10/10 this is a must own if you are a RTS fan			"

												The learning curve isn't terrible, but it is there. This is a real time tactical game that feels like one of the best turn based games. The real fun is the multiplayer, but i would recommend playing at least an hour or two of the single player first. The A.I. is fairly aggresive, and can be diffucult, but it does seem to know where you are when it shouldn't. The campaign is not worth completeing, but the experience will help you inthe move to the awesome....best I've played in years..... multiplayer. I would start with the 10v10 games, these games are big, so a few players being newbs doesn't kill the team. If you ever played the close combat series back in the day, this is similar, though very different. It ""feels"" realistic, though units are warped to fit the battlefield size they roam (for instance, there are artillery pieces in the game that could fire rounds for miles upon miles in real life... that in the game can fire most of the length of the battlefield, still an awesome range...if unrealistic technically) But leopard 2A4s fare against a rush of T-72s the way they you would expect (they murder them), and die to T-80Us (The soviet monsters of the field). Luck plays a factor (units have a percentage chance to hit a target for instance, and all of the stats are modified by factors like veterancy, range, terrain, etc etc) I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy, and especially if you run towards a realistic streak (even though its just a feel). If you do decide to pick up this game (a steal at its full price, I've logged over 900 hours on this game) I highly recommend the guide by Sandygunfox, but only after you are at least a few multiplayer battles deep. The things he talks about are not for the true newb, just use the tutorials and some campaign for that, but his guide is awesome (one warning is that its one true flaw is that some few units stats are adjusted in almost every update in a continus strive for the sake of balance, something welcomed by the community, but it makes sandies suggested units something one should take care with....though they mostly still stand the test of time).

												I am new to Wargame, never played EE and got this a few days after release. This game is nice, very hard to learn and must always be willing to learn from failures and never gave up trying to learn. This game after getting on sale for $20 but from the playing time and fun i had with this game the 39.99 is worth it. If you are looking for a game that has less waiting and more about combat and outsmart your opponents this game is it, if you have the money and you are tired of the AAA titles that are still broken this game is worth it. I canât wait for Wargame Red Dragon. "

												If you want to play this game let me give some tips for you. The game is hard...soul crushingly hard (also dont buy it for the single player since it is painfully obvious that SP did not revice more than 2% of the developers money and thus it is unpolished). Unlike your usual RTS this game is not about spamming the same order to a unit just 1 cm to a different direction at 300APM and more about strategy on a map wide scale with most battles taking place in a more tactical scale. The pace of the game goes back and forth you can loose the most expensive units in just a second in a single attack and your micro wont help with that but you also sit around doing nothing for the most part until that one recon you placed there behind enemy lines picks up enemy activity and the game suddenly turns into fast paced action. The game requires a different mindset and wants to show you how your army must make use of every piece of equipment and map features that is at your disposal in order to achive victory . But if you get past the learning curve that is almost as steep as the learning curve of Dwarf Fortress(okay maybe not that hard) you'll have hours of fun shooting up Tanks form the 1980s with a sneaky infantry squad that cost only 1/5th compared to that tank you just destroyed. The game has headcrushing depth and complexity and it will reward strategic thinkind and unconventional tactics that will cheer you up immensly. The controls are easy to learn for the most part the armory has an insane amount of units for both NATO and PACT from 1950 to 1990. But to learn how to use them you'll need to make use of the chatroom from time to time also a few guides. But the community is great(for the most part) and if you do ask a question it wont take more than a few seconds till you get the answer.If you do get to the end of this review all you need to know is this. There are two kinds of games: ones that bore you to a state aproaching Rigor Mortis and there are games that you'll stop playing because you just noticed that you spent a day on yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥having fun. Wargame Airland battle is in the latter category it is a truly shining example of the genre that is not about spamming tanks and going from on side of the map to the other hoping that your taget will be amongst the things that die along the way.So yes the game is good the soundtrack get a bit annoying but at least thanks to the graphics it'll run well on any PC if you updated it in 2010.

												Wargame: Airland Battle is hands down one of the best RTS games I've ever played. I never heard of it until my friend recommended it to me and begged me to try it out. So I eventually picked it up when it was on sale and I would've paid full price for this wonderous game. If you really enjoy 'modern' combat this is the RTS for you. Its very in depth, very well thought out, ACTUALLY requires strategy. I've seen Cat C decks destroy normally players because they simply out think the enemy. There are only a few really annoying units such as the Nighthawk and sometimes the BUK. But again all RTS games have that problem. 9/10, only a few balance issues I'd highly picking up the next installment when it comes out in the coming months.			"

												To be very frank with you, this game can be very anoyying unbalanced and just abosolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you play for a very large amount of time. I recommend the game if you have friends that already own the game or all of you are going to buy the game. The multiplayer is dead in this game as it is older, so you will find a larger crowd on W:RD if you are looking for one. If you are planning to buy this game just to play by yourself, please, please for the sake of your own computer, don't.The main problem with the games is the AI itself. If you are planning to buy this game to play singleplayer, please for the love of sweet baby black ribs don't. After two or 3 matches of playing against the EASY AI you will find yourself breaking your computer. There will be many more reviews talking about how the AI is bad and is a massive cheat, some of them have more detail than others, but the main point is this. The AI will find you in your home and hunt you down by spamming the top notch tanks, helicopters and planes until the end of eternity (because they have endless resources), bombing your even equal top-notch infantry that is stacked in your buildings with smoke grenades which will make themâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥their pants and hold their fire until the tanks enter that smoke and absolutely butcher them like Jck the Ripper. Then they will compterly burn your base down so you can't house any infantry and quickly rush you with a Horde of Tanks and the game will be over. AND THAT IS JUST THE EASY AI! If you are playing with friends against the AI, you have higher chances of beating them as having two minds who are micromanaging arround the same ammount of people does serve and advantage, but that still does not mean that it will not be annoying to watch your infantry not fire because a little smoke got into their house. Best to play this game like a game or two per day at most, because after that you will just find yourself tired and hating the game. To finish of the review, turn to an amazing Leader Winston Churchill describing Bernard Montgomery, one of the Head Officers of the British Army during WW2:""When he is loosing, he is invincible. When he looses, he is unbearable.""			"

												This is one of the best RTS games I've played in the past year, and its easily taken the top as my favorite RTS in recent years.  Picking up where the excellent Wargame: European Escalation left off in terms of mechanics, Wargame: Airland Battle adds aircraft, removes the command star system, and focuses on deck building.  The combat is essentially the same deep but brutal combat from European Escalation, and the addition of the 10v10 multiplayer mode brings a new level of mayhem to matches.  My only disappointment was the new dynamic campaign system, which while extremely fun, limits the player to the Scandinavian peninsula.When friends ask me if they should get this game, I generally tell them this: ""If you are looking for StarCraft or Command & Conquer, go play Starcraft or Command & Conquer.  If you want something that is different and has a different level of realism and depth to the combat, get Wargame.""			"

												If you like RTS's or are just a military buff Wargame is the game for you! It's one of the best RTS's you will find anywhere. Unlike other contenders such a Starcraft II, Wargame focuses on statagy and tatics beyond speed. The maps are huge and battles can last well over an hour depending on how you play. The learning curve is steeper than other games, but Wargame also has much more depth. With nearly 800 unites, all of which are historically accurate in both stats and appearance, a lot of your time in the beginning will be spend trying to remember what is what. The Deck system is different than most other RTS's as well. Instead of building units on the game map you create a Deck of the type and number of individual units you will be able to call on in the battle. Depending on how you build your deck bonuses will be applied to that deck. This is a link to Wargame's website which explains it better than I can. http://www.wargame-ab.com/?rub=decks    It's an amazing game and worth every penny!			"

												Very good military strategy game where no building is required. Basically, you need to create your own balanced army (called a deck) in order to counter enemy units, knowing what counters what is key to winning. Very realistic RTS with great balance and gameplay mechanics. Can be quite challenging at first until you learn the units.9/10			"

												I say 9.5/10. Its truely something amazing weather you want a Single-player military simulator or Multi-player.Wargame: Airland Battle is the thing youve been looking for its amazing, worth its price, wont fail to challenge you, this RTS is truely the new baby of other games like red alert, world in conflict and supreme commander but much much better.. to be honest you cant even say anything in comparison this is just WOW.The scale of things is truely amazing this packs a punch both Graphically and with the ability to create your own Decks (battlegroup) for a battle... Go on, go get it, battle it, win it !			"

												47 hours into this game and I am comfortable saying that this game is one of the best RTS games in the last 5 years.  It takes itself as seriously (and plays a bit like) the Close Combat series, with clean real-time tactical RTS gameplay backed by one of the best turn-based stratigic planning I have seen in a mixed strat/tact game.  During RTS play, it does seem to fall in between squad level and platoon level, and not in a well thought out way, but in an awkward way.  The UI could also use some updates, for example, there is a concept of cover, but no way to tell that a unit is covered or not.  Or your infantry comes with jeeps (or APCs, helos, etc.), but you can't control how they start, so when defending, I can lose huge amount of infantry before I can get them to evac their trucks.  I feel like a pause option would solve a lot, but only for single player.  Overall, this is a fun game for serious players.  Expect to lose quite a bit until you get an understanding of the machanics, which took me about 4-6 hours.			"

For starters the tutorial is terrible, more of a scenario thana  tutorial as they don't actually tell you anything... Seeing as Wargame is a complicated game when you first play this is very annoying, secondly the fighting was not as inense as I thouht, and merely revolves about pushing your men into a zone, finding the sceret base in said zoneand blowing it up before they do it to you... no hold the city, defend a target etc. This is one game that shall not have a victor			"

												Fantastic, dont be discouraged at first. Because you will be overwhelmed immediatly, only through experiance gained by being trampled will you know how to evade the bull. Start with multiplayer if you plan on playing competitivly, the computer is not a good teacher nore a true represenative of the multiplayer experiance! Try 10x10 so that your shortcommings are less evidant in the bigger picture. Once you are comfortable with the pacing get a friend and play 2x2's, this is the ideall and most balanced size for Airland Battle. Less hectic and more controlled, join the war games!			"

												The learning curve isn't terrible, but it is there. This is a real time tactical game that feels like one of the best turn based games. The real fun is the multiplayer, but i would recommend playing at least an hour or two of the single player first. The A.I. is fairly aggresive, and can be diffucult, but it does seem to know where you are when it shouldn't. The campaign is not worth completeing, but the experience will help you inthe move to the awesome....best I've played in years..... multiplayer. I would start with the 10v10 games, these games are big, so a few players being newbs doesn't kill the team. If you ever played the close combat series back in the day, this is similar, though very different. It ""feels"" realistic, though units are warped to fit the battlefield size they roam (for instance, there are artillery pieces in the game that could fire rounds for miles upon miles in real life... that in the game can fire most of the length of the battlefield, still an awesome range...if unrealistic technically) But leopard 2A4s fare against a rush of T-72s the way they you would expect (they murder them), and die to T-80Us (The soviet monsters of the field). Luck plays a factor (units have a percentage chance to hit a target for instance, and all of the stats are modified by factors like veterancy, range, terrain, etc etc) I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy, and especially if you run towards a realistic streak (even though its just a feel). If you do decide to pick up this game (a steal at its full price, I've logged over 900 hours on this game) I highly recommend the guide by Sandygunfox, but only after you are at least a few multiplayer battles deep. The things he talks about are not for the true newb, just use the tutorials and some campaign for that, but his guide is awesome (one warning is that its one true flaw is that some few units stats are adjusted in almost every update in a continus strive for the sake of balance, something welcomed by the community, but it makes sandies suggested units something one should take care with....though they mostly still stand the test of time).

If you are looking for a game that has less waiting and more about combat and outsmart your opponents this game is it, if you have the money and you are tired of the AAA titles that are still broken this game is worth it.

												It's hard to find a good RTS game like this, which didn't rely on 'APM' these days. Realistic graphics and gameplay, awesome-lots of real-world units, and the epic scale of battle is simply breathtaking - you can feel that you are making decisions, where a single faulty one can leads to your defeat. You have to, in the same time, take care of reconnaisance and logistics to keep your army safe and intact. Without recon you will never know where your enemies are, without supplies your tanks will run out of ammo and fuel in no time. And spamming single units will only get countered miserably - there are almost no useless units in the game, it is all depends on how you use them.The game's learning curve is steep, you gotta spend alot of time experimenting with different units and learn the way to use them well and proficiently, and trying out different combination of units to best your opponents. So patience and the will to learn and discover are essential to players of this game.			"

												The deck building alone is this game is fun for me, not sure if that makes me boring but HEY! Has a lot going for it, I love the limited ammount of troops you are able to deploy each round - after a while this helps you get better as you value your troops more than you would in other rts games where you can keep producing them.  The graphics are fantastic and runs smooth as silk - I can't wait for the next game to come out!			"

												This is how an RTS should be. It's strategy. It's not resource collection, not spamming the most medium tanks. It's about ambushes, about affecting both the front line with blunt trauma and supply lines with surgical strikes. It's about frustration and about luck...and I bloody love it.			"

The emphasis on real-life tactics necesitate a combined arms doctrine and requrire forethought  into force composition and logistics.

												This is by far the best RTS strategy game I have ever played.  It is very challenging and has a steep learning curve, but once you get it, it is so rewarding.  The game has depth too.  There are nearly 1000 different, unique units.  Like most RTS games, it's a paper, rock, sicissors match up but with Infantry, Tanks, Helos, Planes, Vehicles, Recon, logistics, and support.  Even with 500+ hours, I am still addicted to the game because of the dynamics.  There is still a pretty stong following of MP online.  Currently, there are between 400 - 1000 people playing at most times.  I personally prefer SP.  There are 4 campaigns, and skirmishes available to enjoy.  I realize I am in the minority playing SP as most people play MP skirmishes.  There is also Co-op, although I've never played it. The beauty of the game is that there are so many different ways to play.  If you prefer, you can rush with tanks, sit back and ambush with vehicals and INF, or dominate the skys with helos and planes.  I litterally can't say enough good about this game if you prefer tactical strategy games.  Buy it now!			"

												Strategy on a truly epic scale. Airland Battle features something like 800 different units spanning the NATO and Warsaw Pact nations during The Cold War. This game has quite a steep learning curve and can be quite unforgiving at times. However, it easily becoming one of my favorites. The attention to detail, the analysis of various stats and management of manpower give you a real sense of commanding an army. I could spend hours just going through the armoury staring at the units, going over the details to finely craft my fighting force. A great multiplayer experience with friends, endless strategies and stunning graphics round this out to one of my most recommended games as of late.			"

												Sim Players are passionate when it comes to driving, flying or even riding the vehicles that have either thrilled and amazed us during our childhood even still do today which is why we take time out to write great reviews .. so Iâd just like to add something to that â¦â¦Itâs always a shame to read about the disappointments that a fellow Sim Player has experienced instead of reading about their delights as they have taken the controls of their favourite consist and proudly taken passengers or goods from their chosen station, port or yard and delivered them on time having faced realistic challenges of schedules, other transport or sometimes signal failures and adverse weather conditions - that inner sense of achievement (and self-pride) is all we really seek - Yes they may be after all only simulations of real modes of transport âBUTâ¦. be it an incredible landing of a fully laden 300 ton Boeing 747-400 on a real time flight from Singapore to Heathrow - Microsoft Flight Simulator perhaps - where you take care of the Jumbo's flight deck and using the array of true to life switches, levers and dials as you descend gently down to terra firma â EGLL runway 21 to be exact to the [imagined] sounds of cheers and applause of your satisfied passengers and crew. Or that inner voice that says 'yees!' when we finally arrive at the depot and park up our Flexi-Bus for the day OMSI 2â its late, the sun has set, both outside our windows (if we care to look!) and within the Simâ¦ but we donât care.. Weâve driven with diligence and skill, weâve hit n hurt no one and managed to pick up and drop off everyone without a hitchâ¦ thatâs what matters.. Thatâs why we play these Simulators â Thatâs what Sims do for us! - They fulfil our innermost desire to be a part of something that we admire, to take control of the very vehicles that we venerate and are in awe of â Hours of our lives are spent recreating the paths taken by Road, Rail, Air and Sea in order that we may share the experience in some intangible way of that of the Driver, Pilot, Captain, Fireman, Soldier and Doctor? within us all â all this achieved speedily at the flick of a mouse button and without the arduous years of universities, specialist training and professional advice and preparation, we will not suffer any loss of limb if we make mistakes as we learn the art of take-off and landing, nor will we face litigation and inevitable imprisonment from the families of the loved ones that we lost at sea due to our lack of experience of sailing cruise ships, or even suffer from docked wages from South West Trains for continued late arrivals at London Victoriaâ¦ Friends our desire and task is a simple one â¦ to Simulate through our chosen modes â¦ without the Wind, Rain, Ice, Snow or Insurance Costs ever affecting or view of our chosen destination - To Dream the Impossible is what drives the human spirit â But to deny someone of that dream is to deny them of the very lust for life â¦.. So keep dreaming keep âSimmingâ and whether itâs by Air, Sea or Land may your journeys be filled with fun, passion and excitement â Sim on! n Smile as you go!			"

												I've played a few strategy games - namely Civ 5 and some of the Total War series... Nothing is as difficult to figure out as this game is. However, I expect it would be really fun once you have a grasp on things. Unfortunately, the players who do know the ins and outs of the game will demolish you before you have a clue what's going on. In addition, the tutorial is utterly useless. I had to restort to youtube videos to figure out the little bit I do know. Wish I could say the game is worth it because I do see a lot of great potential, but as it stands, the learning curve is just too damn difficult.			"

												For those of you who absolutely love hardcore realism games, this is more up your alley. If you are like me, you sometimes find yourself physically aroused after staring at sheet after sheet of statistics of various tanks and infantry units. Or mid battle decihpering whether those 20 extra meters of range are worth the increased fuel consumption. The game forces you out of your comfort zone quite a bit, long gone are the days of units who can go on forever in any one direction. No, now you have finite resources and must use them wisely in this Cold War gone hot. Be careful on how far armored units stray, you may not want to risk sending in soft vehicles into hotzones. Overall, this game provides much more satisfying victories and losses than the usual RTS. Yes, satisfying losses. Overall I must say, very good game. Not a whole lot to gripe about, other than the ranking system seems to be broken and online play is often dead. Multiplayer is usually fun, though RTS seems to attract the usual MLG gamers that would rather exploit the game to win rather than solid military tactics and strategy, these people often ruin games.

I have a lot to learn and this review may be premature but it seems quite an amazing strategy game with a lot to it. My suggestion though if you aren't used to a game like this. Spend time with the tutorials and practice with the computer before you go head first into the multiplayer. It will make the game much more digestable and fun in the long run. For 12 dollars, it is worth the money.			"

												A epically scaled, realistic modern RTS that rewards tactics and micromanagement - a low level unit can beat an upgraded one if used strategically. Resource management is present but you only need occupy sectors to generate points (the only type of resource, with which you send in reinforcements). The game emphasises patience and intelligent play. Like any RTS you need to learn units' strengths and weaknesses to be competant, and with 750 units AirLand Battle takes some time to become enitely familiar with. Individual games have a limit on the points you have in a ""deck"", with better units costing more points and simpler ones less. This a sophisticated, detailed and satasfying RTS with modern military hardware.			"

												Whatever you can say about Airland Battle, it certainly isn't your daddy's RTS. Gone is base building and small amounts of units. Wargame pits literally thousands of infantry and hundreds of vehicles from the Cold War period against each other on the battlefields of Europe. This title really shines when you execute a perfect strategy. SEAD planes (supression of enemy air defense) streak overhead, taking out enemy AA and paving the way for your bombers. As an enemy interceptor becomes visible on the horizon, your F15 swoops in to protect your vulnurable planes. Your artillery switches to smoke rounds, concealing the advance up a hill and into a city by your infantry in their APCs with tanks in support. As your troops swarm the first line of houses, your Napalm scatters the defenders, and the city is yours. It is moments like these that make Wargame: Airland Battle truly worth your time.			"

If you're into 'real' in-depth RTS games (not Age of Empires, Command & Conquer etc.) then you should definitely give this game a closer look.  Also, it's definitely not a FPS so be prepared.Check out some gameplay vids on YouTube to make sure this is the genre for you...and if you're on the fence, just do it!I've been playing and replaying the tutorials for the real basic stuff, which is OK to get you started, but would really recommend  looking into some of the guides to refine your game and get you paying with the best of them.This guide was v useful: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-uURrYRBWlOFHMbZRSjCE0A6p9FGj2EhKD9SjvUmeug/edit?pli=1#Injured_Digits signing-off...

												The Wargame series may not be well known, but the game is probably one of my favorite and now even the newer one Wargame: Red Dragon has added more people and additions to the game. I definately recommend the game the learning curve isn't that steep, but if you are confused I would recommend Youtube.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. It's probably the closest anyone have ever come to the experience of commanding an army, but is commanding an army really any fun? The graphics scale seamlessly from satellite view of contents to the gnatsâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥jumping out of the way of your shiny tank. Again, very realistic at every step, but does realism equal fun? If you're the kind of guy that likes to spend 3 hours in MFS flying from SMF to LAX, flipping all of the switches, landing flawlessly, this is probably your RTS. If you're a Starcraft/C&C wizard out looking for a new game, steer FAR clear from this one.The tutorials are pathetic. The game is completely devoid of humor. Well, you don't play games for humor and you don't mind spending a few hours on youtube.Runs natively on Linux? Ufck yeah, son. Thumbs UP.			"

												Wargame series established itself as the only real time strategy that allows you to play around with this high number of real military units of the late cold war era, and on this scale. The atmosphere of each battle is unique thanks to the large number of unit combinations (deck) that you can bring to the frontline to support your particular style of fighting. I miss a little the story campaigns of the previous Wargame: European Escalation, but dynamic campaign on global map of whole Scandinavian peninsula with CO-OP more than compensates for it. PvP multiplayer is core game feature that will put you way beyond 100 hour game time especially with the supported 10vs10 battles which allows for a unique RTS experience (and also very accessible to variously skilled players). In summary this is one RTS that shouldn't be missed as it really is a fresh wind to the classical RTS scene.			"

												Good modern strategy game taking place on 'cold war gone hot', multplayer is lively (27/11/2013), gameplay is nice, single and coop campaigns and skirmish with AI (wich is pretty good) and players, graphics are beautifull. There's also the armory, it lets you drool all over the game's units.Gameplay wise, you have command zones trough the map that you capture using command vehicles and they may unlock reinforcement/air corridors from where units come from. At the start you place units with your limited ammount of points and go capture sectors, as they provide you with income, killing an enemy unit also gives you its cost in points.Units have ammo, fuel and health, you recharge every one of these using supply vehicles, so its important to setup a supply line to the front lines.Deck creation allows you to greatly customize your army, as there are over 750 units, wich is awesome. Air units greatly enhance the game requiring you to make tactical decisions regarding your army, with several aircraft fitting different roles.Best of all, maps are quite big, with lots of land that aren't occupied by zones, flanking becomes a reliable and important strategy as most people tend to focus solely on the zones and leave other areas exposed.

												An excellent strategy game, encompassing all the major PACT and NATO nations of the 70's and 80's, Aswell as a large amount of their equipment. The strategy includes such things as terrain sightlines, weapon effects, and even aircraft now.The singleplayer is not really worth it, so only buy if you want to play a fairly deep multiplayer strategy game. Games last from 20-40 minutes on average.			"

												This is the definitive real time strategy(rts) game for me. I know Starcraft 2 is much more popular but imo Starcraft 2 is a pop culture than the definitive rts game. Wargame is the definitive rts game because it puts the strategy part in rts in its proper place. The game rewards superior thinking and victory doesn't depend on your fingers dexterity(your action per minute). AirLand baattle improves on its predecessor by having more countries, units and a solid variety of planes. Campaign is now dynamic though the campaign experience can feel mediocre I still prefer it than scripted campaigns in EE. More interestingly the game now allows 10 Vs10 multiplayer combat though currently only for a single map. The game shines the most in this mode though some people quit early in most of these sessions. I highly recommend this game and if you're a military buff or enthusiast or like a thinking game this game is for you. Superior thinking wins in this game.			"

												10 out of 10. Wargame is an excellent addition to any RTS fan's game library and is one of the best RTS games available today.With over 800 units to choose from, Wargame supports massive multiplayer battles without the tedious responsibility of managing an economy. Wargame is startlingly realistic but easily accessible, providing tactics and arsenals for newcomers and veterans alike. The deck system allows for a great deal of immersion and depth, and the variety units is enough to satisfy even the most insatiable digital-general's appetite. With outstanding graphics, perfectly crafted gameplay, and a wide variety of play-styles, Wargame will always keep you coming back for more. Give this game a go, and definately follow development of the next installment in the series, ""Wargame: Red Dragon"".			"

												Leave your idea of a traditional RTS at the door, this plays more like a real time version of a table top strategy game (warhammer, flames of war, etc) base building is not a thing save for placing FoBs where you can resupply units.That said, this game is fun, engaging and an utter pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to learn and master. (Play 2v2 with a bot to start, 1v1 will only make you frustrated as a new player)Play it if you like making desicsions on a large scale while managing a limited pool of units (your deck)You can customize your deck to your liking, even using limitations like only using a certain nation, era, or combined arms style (mechanized, paratrooper, marine, etc) each limitation also gives bonuses to your deck, like a free veterancy level for a type of unit, or lower costs for a type of unit.I highly recomend this game to fans of large scale strategy games, this games mechanics are solid and it looks fantastic to boot.

												Though I like W:EE more. This is more fast-tempo game because of the air units. Singleplayer is much much worse than EEÂ´s, usually they have no sence at all; enemy units spawn right next to your deployment zoneÂ´s edge, ending up in a mass carnage. DonÂ´t buy this for the singleplayer. If you like those big map and large scale online battles,  this is the right game for you. Multiplayer matches tend to be very large scale and unit losses great but in the other hand youÂ´ll get Command Points faster than in EE. Overall rating 4/5, but the singleplayer was a huge disappointment.			"

												Got myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥royally whipped just playing 1v1 against easy bots. It was depressing. It was disheartening. It made me ragequit more times than I'm willing to admit. But once I eked out that first win, everything changed. Well, not at first. I still got myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥kicked for a while, but then I started to learn. How to balance the ebb and flow of the game. How to handle a sudden assault on your flank you absolutely did not see coming. It made me realize that even if and entire group of your best tanks, infantry, and support vehicles gets wiped out, you can still consolidate your forces, set up a defense, and make the enemy pay for every inch. Hell, I've won more than a few games by pulling back into a strong defense and just reinforcing where need be as wave after wave of enemy tanks, jets, helicopters, and APCs crashed against it fruitlessly. It has an initial difficulty that honestly can be very frustrating. Read the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing guide. Yes its over a 100 pages.Yes its dense as hell.Yes it will insult your intelligence with alarming regularity.But read it all the same.It will teach you techniques that are absoloutely critical to success.For instance, did you know that even basic reserve infantry in towns can absoulutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ and Abram'sâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥six ways back to tuesday? No? Well now you do. Its information like that that's in the guide and will save you from repeatedâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥whuppings.Play vs the AI. Its a smart AI, and can and will overwhelm you, hit you where your weak, and use all the strategies you should be using. Now go out there and lead your badasses to victory!			"

												I am in now ways an expert at this awesome game, however I DO have some suggestions for the team who made this cool simulation.1. The labels for each unit or unit group. When I zoom out I can cannot even see much of the terrain. How you could remedy this is to shrink, as much as possible, the labels and give the player the option to do away with the BOX and just have text describe the unit or unit group. The text would be outlined and in the color of the owner of the unit.2. Make the ""low on fuel"", ""low on ammo"", and ""need repairs"" smaller. Otherwise, it's pretty cool.3. Give the player the option to have their unit outlined 1 pixel wide in white so the owner of that unit can actually see where it is without having to zoom in 200-300%. Of course this option would be not available to the opposing player concerning your units.4. Give the player the option to have a high visibility line that connects the information label with the actual location of the unit selected. This would dramatically increase tactical awareness.These are SMALL changes that can be implemented with little or no effort.It feels to me that I am fighting with a label maker and not units.Get rid of the green, blue and red boxes that occlude the beautifully rendered terrain and in it's place use outlined colored text in it's place.The features I LOVED about this game:1.  The faithful detail to the units of the period. They did not skimp on any details and they even have several versions of the Abrams!2. The Targeting line is pure genius. I loved how it shows you if you are in line of sight, out of range and even if it is possible for you to engage that unit with your unit's weapon.3. Not over detailing things. There are many games that put megabytes of unnecessary texturing that slows down the game and forces the player to buy a high end GPU or be doomed to play at low rez.4. Windows XP support. We who still operate this durable and reliable OS thank you.5. The way terrain effects or completely impedes movement of a vehicle realistically.6. You did not jump on the DLC bandwagon and charge us for features already in the game. Updates are free and if the game changes enough, you come out with another full feature game.Again, thank you for such an awesome game!			"

												One of the best RTS/RTT games on the market. Set during the cold war (70s) when the Soviet Union and NATO did go to war. The player makes a 'deck' from either the NATO or USSR side with an uncountable amount of real world units from many nations. Featuring realistic combat and the application of real world tactics and strategy, this game is great to spend hours on. There a few downsides, the AI can be annoying at best and the single-player campaign is broken on the difficulty side. Expect these issues to be fixed with the release of the sequal Red Dragon this year. RD will also include All nations and units from ALB with the inclusion of China, ANZACs and naval combat!			"

												Amazing game! It's a rather steep learning curve, but once you get used to the units and game styles, it's VERY fun. The deck making mechanic is awesome and suprisingly fun! However, there is ONE teeny-tiny problem I sort of have with this game, and Red Dragon (the ""sequel"" to this) as well. In European Escalation, you were collecting sort of like research points or command points or something, and using them to buy units that you could then use in your decks. That gave, at least for me, a sense of actually driving toward something every time I played, and that was researching every unit. In these last two games, there isn't any of that; it's simply ""play and have fun making decks and play and things"". I mean, the game is quite fun, but if you play too much you'll get sorta bored of it for the day. But, that's a rather small stain, if one at all.			"

												Wargame Airland BattleDescription:                   This is great real-time strategy.Wargame is set in the year 1970-1990 on the Scandinavia.Wargame is not Company of Heroes or command and conquer. It just not building strategy with action elements. In this game you have to think.Wargame developers added aircrafts and other units, in wargame is 864 units and two free dlc are available.Summary:                Wargame is a realistic strategy that requires patience. It's a little harder in the beginning to get oriented in the indication of units and on map find out where what you have. "

												Eugen Systems has found a winning formula with Wargame. Airland Battle adds to European Escolation, adding fixed wing aircraft to the player's arsenal and even more ground units. Visually appealing (albeit not spectacular) with solid gameplay, Airland Battle is a strong addition to a declining genre.What is most distinct about Airland Battle is the scale of the maps. These are full fledged warzones. Weapon ranges aren't compressed for the most part. Tanks can and will engage targets at 2000 meters. You will find situations where a 15000m range artillery piece won't have full map coverage. It allows players to be unpredictable and creative with their unit maneuvers and increases the importance of logistics and recon.Some won't like the scale- players will spend a lot of time watching their vehicles roll toward the enemy and the battles can end very quickly and decisively when they occur- but for me, the only glaring flaw in this otherwise good game is the audio- there is not much variety in sound effects.

												Fantastic game!  I generally dislike RTS games because of they are usually annoying spammy click-fests.  This game is very different, in that you have to truly use combined arms (armor/infantry/recon/air) strategy to win, not just spamming the most OP unit you have.  For every unit, there is a counter.  Based on a 1980's ""What if NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations went to war"" premise, this game delivers one of the best hands-down wargame experiences, period.  There's a slight learning curve, and at times it can ge chaotic, but overal, this is a must-buy game.  You won't be disappointed.			"

												Wargame: Airland Battle is hands down one of the best RTS games I've ever played. I never heard of it until my friend recommended it to me and begged me to try it out. So I eventually picked it up when it was on sale and I would've paid full price for this wonderous game. If you really enjoy 'modern' combat this is the RTS for you. Its very in depth, very well thought out, ACTUALLY requires strategy. I've seen Cat C decks destroy normally players because they simply out think the enemy. There are only a few really annoying units such as the Nighthawk and sometimes the BUK. But again all RTS games have that problem. 9/10, only a few balance issues I'd highly picking up the next installment when it comes out in the coming months.			"

												It's huge, dauntingly complex, incredibly punishing, and one of the most underrated RTS games of all time. Instead of crafting mechanics and tactics for the player to use Wargame takes a [limited] handful of real-world elements and allows the playerâs tactics to evolve organically. This added responsibility lends the game an immense learning curve that, until summited, can make that game incredibly frustrating. Fortunately, the game never feels sadistic; every failure can be easily learned from and later mitigated.This game is not for everyone, but for those who accept the challenge lies an incredibly rich and rewarding strategy game.

												It's hard to find a good RTS game like this, which didn't rely on 'APM' these days. Realistic graphics and gameplay, awesome-lots of real-world units, and the epic scale of battle is simply breathtaking - you can feel that you are making decisions, where a single faulty one can leads to your defeat. You have to, in the same time, take care of reconnaisance and logistics to keep your army safe and intact. Without recon you will never know where your enemies are, without supplies your tanks will run out of ammo and fuel in no time. And spamming single units will only get countered miserably - there are almost no useless units in the game, it is all depends on how you use them.The game's learning curve is steep, you gotta spend alot of time experimenting with different units and learn the way to use them well and proficiently, and trying out different combination of units to best your opponents. So patience and the will to learn and discover are essential to players of this game.			"

Singleplayer is much much worse than EEÂ´s, usually they have no sence at all; enemy units spawn right next to your deployment zoneÂ´s edge, ending up in a mass carnage. DonÂ´t buy this for the singleplayer. If you like those big map and large scale online battles,  this is the right game for you. Multiplayer matches tend to be very large scale and unit losses great but in the other hand youÂ´ll get Command Points faster than in EE.

If you're into 'real' in-depth RTS games (not Age of Empires, Command & Conquer etc.) then you should definitely give this game a closer look.  Also, it's definitely not a FPS so be prepared.Check out some gameplay vids on YouTube to make sure this is the genre for you...and if you're on the fence, just do it!I've been playing and replaying the tutorials for the real basic stuff, which is OK to get you started, but would really recommend  looking into some of the guides to refine your game and get you paying with the best of them.This guide was v useful: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-uURrYRBWlOFHMbZRSjCE0A6p9FGj2EhKD9SjvUmeug/edit?pli=1#Injured_Digits signing-off...

												47 hours into this game and I am comfortable saying that this game is one of the best RTS games in the last 5 years.  It takes itself as seriously (and plays a bit like) the Close Combat series, with clean real-time tactical RTS gameplay backed by one of the best turn-based stratigic planning I have seen in a mixed strat/tact game.  During RTS play, it does seem to fall in between squad level and platoon level, and not in a well thought out way, but in an awkward way.  The UI could also use some updates, for example, there is a concept of cover, but no way to tell that a unit is covered or not.  Or your infantry comes with jeeps (or APCs, helos, etc.), but you can't control how they start, so when defending, I can lose huge amount of infantry before I can get them to evac their trucks.  I feel like a pause option would solve a lot, but only for single player.  Overall, this is a fun game for serious players.  Expect to lose quite a bit until you get an understanding of the machanics, which took me about 4-6 hours.			"

												A fine departure from tradition clicks per second starcraft type madness.  A cerebral strategy game where intentional movement and position take priority over super fast pace. An excellent choice for the mature gamer with a  penchant for strategy.Use real-world battlefield strategies like blitzkreig, shock and awe, schwerpunkt, or the armored spearhead. The game needs more options for formations, but otherwise hits the concept of a modern warfare strategy game right on the nose. Suppress enemy air defences so your planes can move in for the kill, or build up squadrons of Main Battle Tanks to punch a hole in the lines. Bombard your enemy with punishing artillery, or cover your advances with smoke. Burn out enemy troops with napalm and flamethrowers, or bring in the Delta Force to fight in close quarters.The campain mode has been weak from the getgo, but the multiplayer makes up for its shortcomings, even though there have been improvements with recent patches.

												One of the best RTS/RTT games on the market. Set during the cold war (70s) when the Soviet Union and NATO did go to war. The player makes a 'deck' from either the NATO or USSR side with an uncountable amount of real world units from many nations. Featuring realistic combat and the application of real world tactics and strategy, this game is great to spend hours on. There a few downsides, the AI can be annoying at best and the single-player campaign is broken on the difficulty side. Expect these issues to be fixed with the release of the sequal Red Dragon this year. RD will also include All nations and units from ALB with the inclusion of China, ANZACs and naval combat!			"

												For those of you who absolutely love hardcore realism games, this is more up your alley. If you are like me, you sometimes find yourself physically aroused after staring at sheet after sheet of statistics of various tanks and infantry units. Or mid battle decihpering whether those 20 extra meters of range are worth the increased fuel consumption. The game forces you out of your comfort zone quite a bit, long gone are the days of units who can go on forever in any one direction. No, now you have finite resources and must use them wisely in this Cold War gone hot. Be careful on how far armored units stray, you may not want to risk sending in soft vehicles into hotzones. Overall, this game provides much more satisfying victories and losses than the usual RTS. Yes, satisfying losses. Overall I must say, very good game. Not a whole lot to gripe about, other than the ranking system seems to be broken and online play is often dead. Multiplayer is usually fun, though RTS seems to attract the usual MLG gamers that would rather exploit the game to win rather than solid military tactics and strategy, these people often ruin games.

												All French surrender monkey jokes aside, Eugen Systems does a good job at making RTS/RTT games. Not only that, but off the top of my head, they're one of the only modern developers in this day and age that produce FREE that's right, FREE, DLC for their products. 12 nations. 1v1. 2v2. 3v3. 4v4. 10v10. 800 units. Infantry, tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters, airplanes, and in the next game, BOATS! This game just screams autism. So if you're autistic and like semi-realistic and modern military games, then this is the right video game for you.This isn't your typical gook click 300 APM minimum required strategy game where you practice the same build orders over and over. Nothing is static, there's a myriad of factors that have an impact on gameplay. Yes, it's possible for your WW2 era T-34s to destroy modern Abrams at point blank from the right angles. If you fly a helicopter over an urban area, it's likely to get shot down by small arms fire, so you can reenact Black Hawk Down, especially since Black Hawks are an actual  ingame unit.Over all this is a great game. Don't just take my word for it though.See what others have to say:""Once again, downplays the importance of strong women who don't need no men in video games; They're not portrayed at all!"" - Anita Sarkeesian""Game is too difficult, ostracizes casuals and girl gamers."" - Kotaku""This game promotes the white cis male patriarchy's warmongering and is the sole cause of all of our woes."" - Tumblr""Armed forces around the world us this as a training simulator."" - Fox News""9/10, it's okay."" - IGN			"

												Wargame: AirLand Battle, despite its name that seems perfectly designed to mess with search engines, is an indepth strategic RTS that truly shines in multiplayer, but does rather less well in single-player games. The campaign mode is a letdown, due to poor AI and a 20 minute time limit per battle when the average length of a game is more than twice that. The number of units is truly overwhelming, over 800 from NATO and WP armies of the Cold War. What's more, with an active multiplayer base and developers who do genuinely care about consumers, the game can only get better.			"

Campaign is also very good, also putting in the mindframe in a large scale war, moving regiments to defend or to attack, with extra things like commando raids to help.

Posted: February 16, 2015
												Let me start this review by saying that I REALLY want to recommend this game. Really.As far as RTS games go, this Wargame Airland Battle has done a lot of things very right, and Iâll start by talking about these.Firstly the ability to zoom from the full scope of the map right down to see individual men running across a field really gives you a great perspective. You sit with your 12 tanks, 8 armoured personnel carriers, 4 mobile AA units, 4 tank destroyers, 40 mixed AA/AT infantry and recon team and think 'yeah, this is a nice army.' you set them up in nice defensive positions to await the rush of enemy units, maybe you even set down some artillery to cover them. Then you zoom out to see where the enemy is at and notice how rapidly the map swallows your 'nice' army until you can barely see them; little coloured specks in an otherwise insignificant woodland in a corner of the battlefield. Itâs really absolutely brilliant and I love it.Another great feature is the persistent units; units you lose in one battle stay lost for the next. If your super powerful expensive helo gets shot down, you canât call him in again, which gives you a real attachment to your units and makes you think twice before sending your recon and choppers on whatâs probably a suicide run.I also love the unit resupply mechanics, all units have ammo and fuel which need to be maintained. leaving an AA squad out in some far flung corner of the map just to be aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to your opponent only works until theyâve used their 8 missiles, after that they really are useless until you can resupply them. the resupply mechanic hasnât been overthought though, all units can repair, collect fuel and any kind of ammo just by being in the resupply radius of a unit or building, thereâs no micromanaging the carrying of 8000 different kinds of ammunition to the front lines *ahem* Men Of War *ahem*.Sadly this brings us to the negative points. Campaigns consist of a Risk board game style army movement that feels unnecessary with powers such as nukes and reinforcements that leave little impact on the actual 'board'. I was told by one mission to nuke an enemy sector before attacking it, I braced myself for the horror of what I was about to do. I was told it would be done within 24 hours (1 turn) of my order, so I gave the order and waited. And waited. And waited. Did it happen? Is it on route? If I attack now will I nuke my own men in a minute? No indication was given whatsoever that this horrific deed had been done, and itâs in touches like this that Wargame falls down.When playing a battle you are given no obvious objective, no indication of what to do, just to deploy your units here. Then the battle happens, you kill some stuff and suddenly, without any warning, the battle screen disappears and youâre told you won a major victory. Did I? I donât feel like I did. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.It seems the battles consist of just killing the enemy units faster than they kill yours, until you've killed enough that the battle ends. Whilst this is fine (ish) for multiplayer, from a solo or co-op campaign, I really want more. Just little touches like being told to hold a sector whilst VIPs evacuate or to secure a supply route, just something. it even boils down to the same main objective - hold here whilst the enemy throws units at you, but the simple addition of some kind of objective makes the whole experience more tangible and less just like a punching match.Lastly the units, whilst very varied, are gone into in far too much detail. Youâre told exactly which weapon each unit uses, whether thatâs a strela-2 or RPG-7, AK, RPK, or a bajillion others that I can't name off the top of my head, itâs not necessary. I wouldnât mind though if the game told you what kind of vehicle/squad it is, but instead you're told that it has a KONKURS, and that it has 2 AP power and 6 HE power (totally making that up, but you get the idea), the game neglects to tell you however whether this is an anti-tank launcher, an anti-air launcher, some kind of unguided rocket, a recoilless rifle, etc. etc. you can make guesses by its rate of fire and total ammo count, but Iâve been surprised on more than one occasion, and I would say I have a fair knowledge of modern firearms.Basically it gets very anal about the units you have available, but fails to tell you how good they are against other unit types.All in all then I really can't recommend this game, it provides a great platform for strategy gaming, but give you no direction or variation in your attempts to do so. The game is also impossibly difficult at times, totally without warning.Hereâs my overall rating then - + Lovely graphics+ Some great mechanics+ Wide unit variety- No direction given to player- Some not so great mechanics- No mission variety- Sporadic difficulty jumps6/10Thereâs better RTS games on the market, maybe Red Dragon improves upon these points.

												Note: Single-player onlyBought this game to play against the AI. Mistake. Should have checked the forums. Anyway, point is, the AI cheats. It seems to see all your units, even if hidden, and targets then mercilessly. It also spams units. Even on ""easy"" the game seems like a boring uphill slog to me. It's not much fun experimenting with stacks or tactics when you know you're gonna spend 30 minutes getting annihilated.			"

												Possibly the most anal real time strategy game I have ever encountered, I have only been playing for a short while so far but if you played games like the original Rome: Total War ( Not the butchered version they have now ) and areâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off about rush tactics and spamming always winning the war then this game is definitely for you.Basic logistics, terrain knowledge and scouting are all required knowledge here! It is highly recommended you go and watch a youtube tutorial or something so you can understand the basics of command vehicles and so on as you won't even be able to spawn units and capture points without them.If you read Sun Tzu's Art of War back to back and practice lots you might stand a chance against other players.

												Amazing game! It's a rather steep learning curve, but once you get used to the units and game styles, it's VERY fun. The deck making mechanic is awesome and suprisingly fun! However, there is ONE teeny-tiny problem I sort of have with this game, and Red Dragon (the ""sequel"" to this) as well. In European Escalation, you were collecting sort of like research points or command points or something, and using them to buy units that you could then use in your decks. That gave, at least for me, a sense of actually driving toward something every time I played, and that was researching every unit. In these last two games, there isn't any of that; it's simply ""play and have fun making decks and play and things"". I mean, the game is quite fun, but if you play too much you'll get sorta bored of it for the day. But, that's a rather small stain, if one at all.			"

												Well, it's pretty, that's about the only good thing I have to say.I'm TERRIBLY dissappointed in this game, I'm starting with the tutorials and they are worthless!  The tutorial dumps you in a battle field and leaves you there.  You don't get any guidance, no tips on strategies, not tips what so ever.  Just there's your objective, bye...At this point, feeling like the worst $10 I ever spent.			"

												I bought this game on sale thinking i wouldnt like it to much but its fairly cheap so ill get it. I was wrong, i found myself puting in four or so hours not even feeling like that time has passed. Great graphics and units are balinced in the price it costs to bring them in vs how effective they are in combat.The bad sideNow ive only played this game for about 5 hours so this may be the reason, but when i stared the first few hours i found it hard to manage all my units on the battlefield. I offen found myself with more micro managing to do with the units on the field then a basic attack and kill sort of command.With that being said, my background playing rts has not been limmited as i have a lot of rts games. I think in time ill come to enjoy this game much more and maybe learn how to counter the mico managing acpect of alot of units.All togather i would rate this as one of my top games for the gameplay and great map layout.9/10: great modern RTS game			"

												On balence one of the best multiplayer games out at the moment in my view.  The free DLC's and constant updates and patches from the developers is a welcome change from the lackluster support most games seem to get these days.  Its not an easy game to play, the learning curve is steep and while Singleplayer will teach you the basics it has little replayability and is dull compared to the vibrant multiplayer.What at first seems simple and even one dimentional (Pact vs NATO, everyone gets planes, tanks, infantry etc) gets ever more complex the longer you play until you find yourself building ""Decks"" (Military formations assembled before a battle) in ever more obscure and challenging combinations or swapping out units one at a time to find the ""perfect"" balence.  Want to field a balenced Pan-Nato army? Not a problem! Want to limit your force to only Pre 1975 units? and only of a certain kind? thats fine! From a certain country? No worries! and so you find you have made a 1975 Norweigan Motorised Deck with no anti air units, practically no tanks and a virtually non-existent airforce.... but you have ALOT of men with guns... and so the sillyness commences.The real joy of the game is combining the hours of fun that can be had building decks with playing with a freind.  This allows each of you to take wildly lop-sided decks that would usually get slaughtered in a 1vs1 but mean you can cover each others weaknessess in thousands of differant deck combinations.Overall its not a perfect game, the single player is lack luster, and some units need tweaking.  On the other hand the multiplayer experaince is, while complex and harsh to those getting into the game. A huge ammount of fun espechially if played with teamspeak etc 9/10.			"

												So far this game has shown how difficult it can be to make a game that has Normal AI.Issues: When playing solo campaign the AI is quick to respond to an attack, thus the game / Match ends quickly (3 minutes quickly) Disapointing.* In order to survive a campaign (Hard mode) you need to score politcial points to create counter measures before an enemy attacks ~ This helps improve the campaign losses ~ But I've found out that sending aereal raids or reconesance that a battle occurs on have no effect on the outcom of your campaign ~ being useless to even start the campaign.* Battles last less than 20 minutes if you manage to survive the enemy attacks ~ Then you suffer losses, no matter how well your strategy is. (Maybe I'm not playing correctly, but when in easy mode SAME THING HAPPENS!)Maybe adding Recon Leadership in each battle before sending troops to location might improve battle area outcome ~ BUT even if that happens, when you start winning THE GAME JUST MAKES THE ENEMY'S TANKS JUST DISAPEAR OFF THE SCREEN INSTEAD OF THE FULL LENGTH BATTLE!!! ~ This it the real rediculus part in that when you start shooting off the enemys and start winning, the computer will not show the attacks made on those units in full ~ THEY JUST DISAPEAR OFF THE SCREEN , like some code that decided to be written into it to spare the CPU for other tasks ~ like AI that knows where you are hiding.* I have enojyed this game's basic Idea of strategy, micro managing your units to attack where you need them to, but it seems that the disapearing units seems to show this game does not fully use the CPU for in depth playability, maybe I'm using a CPU that uses less of an older code written for Core - 2770 up to 3770 ~( I'm using 4770K) so maybe the coding is more written for those older CPU that newer CPU do not use any more due to more effiecnt coding methods etc.* I still like this game, I like the idea of setting up your batte areas and placing your men where needed, it's simple...but that is it, the rest is at the mercy of the AI, which seems to only use 1 core for playability and worse that it could use an older code that is more recocnized by older CPU's...so instead of being able to watch how your guys are being blasted, the Computer / Game just makes them disapear. UPDATE: I've decided to give this game a YES.Only because the strategy required to play this game can be slow (which is good if the game is to play longer) .I've learned that sending recon into a territory can improve the chances winning and gaining points.

												This is by far the best RTS strategy game I have ever played.  It is very challenging and has a steep learning curve, but once you get it, it is so rewarding.  The game has depth too.  There are nearly 1000 different, unique units.  Like most RTS games, it's a paper, rock, sicissors match up but with Infantry, Tanks, Helos, Planes, Vehicles, Recon, logistics, and support.  Even with 500+ hours, I am still addicted to the game because of the dynamics.  There is still a pretty stong following of MP online.  Currently, there are between 400 - 1000 people playing at most times.  I personally prefer SP.  There are 4 campaigns, and skirmishes available to enjoy.  I realize I am in the minority playing SP as most people play MP skirmishes.  There is also Co-op, although I've never played it. The beauty of the game is that there are so many different ways to play.  If you prefer, you can rush with tanks, sit back and ambush with vehicals and INF, or dominate the skys with helos and planes.  I litterally can't say enough good about this game if you prefer tactical strategy games.  Buy it now!			"

While it is an RTS, it is not like any other I have ever played.  It requires well-planned maneuver, and the proper application of combined arms to be successful.Battle, once the cannons and missiles let loose, can be frenetic and bloody.  You'll need to not only maintain quantities of troops and their supporting artillery and aircraft, but also munitions and fuel.  Nothing spells doom like a Pact tank charge and you without a TOW 2 to spare.If you are fan of Third World War that never happened, or you just want something more gritty than the standard RTS silliness, I highly encourage you to pick us this title.

												Best strategy game I have ever played.Its fast paced when you want it to be or you can slow it down and go on the defensiveThe array of units is staggering, over 800 of them, each having their own weaknesses and strengths.The scale of battles is truly magnificent, I havent been in awe of the raw destruction like I have in this game since i played Supreme Commander FA.This game is an absolute treasure and is completely underrated in my opinion.If you love strategy, hell if you love war games, this is a must!

												Absolutely brilliant Tactical RTS. Not based upon how many buttons you can spam at once. You have to think very hard about what balance of units you need. If you're into realistic military RTS games then this is the one for you! This game has a Punishing learning curve, you'll see what I mean when you send a squad of infantry across open ground for the first time, or use a deck with no Anti-Air and get decimated by helicopters. However this is all part of the fun, as you make the mistakes you quickly learn from them and begin to develop the perfect set up. If you are looking for your more simple APM based RTS games then this isn't for you. But if you want a game where you have to think in a realistic way, then I would HIGHLY recommend it.			"

												On balence one of the best multiplayer games out at the moment in my view.  The free DLC's and constant updates and patches from the developers is a welcome change from the lackluster support most games seem to get these days.  Its not an easy game to play, the learning curve is steep and while Singleplayer will teach you the basics it has little replayability and is dull compared to the vibrant multiplayer.What at first seems simple and even one dimentional (Pact vs NATO, everyone gets planes, tanks, infantry etc) gets ever more complex the longer you play until you find yourself building ""Decks"" (Military formations assembled before a battle) in ever more obscure and challenging combinations or swapping out units one at a time to find the ""perfect"" balence.  Want to field a balenced Pan-Nato army? Not a problem! Want to limit your force to only Pre 1975 units? and only of a certain kind? thats fine! From a certain country? No worries! and so you find you have made a 1975 Norweigan Motorised Deck with no anti air units, practically no tanks and a virtually non-existent airforce.... but you have ALOT of men with guns... and so the sillyness commences.The real joy of the game is combining the hours of fun that can be had building decks with playing with a freind.  This allows each of you to take wildly lop-sided decks that would usually get slaughtered in a 1vs1 but mean you can cover each others weaknessess in thousands of differant deck combinations.Overall its not a perfect game, the single player is lack luster, and some units need tweaking.  On the other hand the multiplayer experaince is, while complex and harsh to those getting into the game. A huge ammount of fun espechially if played with teamspeak etc 9/10.			"

												Fantastically deep, realistic and beautiful to look at.    This is to other RTS games what ARMA is to most FPS; Recon and logistics are both important here.  Charging headlong into the enemy or carelessly leaving units to run out of ammo will end in the loss of lots of costly units. Stacks and stacks of different units mean that you can experiment with lots of army configurations (decks) to make a realistic force, an army to suit your playstyle or just a crazy choice which you want to try out.Not at its best in solo campaign mode and punishingly difficult for rookies, but it's easy to learn by skirmishing easy AI (with medium AI help if you're really bad like me!).Superb.

												It's huge, dauntingly complex, incredibly punishing, and one of the most underrated RTS games of all time. Instead of crafting mechanics and tactics for the player to use Wargame takes a [limited] handful of real-world elements and allows the playerâs tactics to evolve organically. This added responsibility lends the game an immense learning curve that, until summited, can make that game incredibly frustrating. Fortunately, the game never feels sadistic; every failure can be easily learned from and later mitigated.This game is not for everyone, but for those who accept the challenge lies an incredibly rich and rewarding strategy game.

												If you've played R.U.S.E. and liked it, you'll love this game. Although it does need a slightly more powerful computer than R.U.S.E, it is still just as good. For those who haven't played this game, it is a cold-war era RTS. There aren't any buildings except for a supply depot, so your units that you call in arrive from a road somewhere on an edge of the map, depending on which sectors you own and where you place the units. RUSE used to be my favourite game of all time, but this game contests that spot. From the things this game lacks that were in RUSE, it makes up for with helicopters, more advanced commands and many more units.  9.99999999999/10. The only thing this game is missing is naval units, that are in the sequel which i am yet to purchase.Edit:To me this is one of the best RTS games ever made, alongside games like RUSE and Supcom. The only complaint i have is that none of my friends have the game. 10/10			"

												Sim Players are passionate when it comes to driving, flying or even riding the vehicles that have either thrilled and amazed us during our childhood even still do today which is why we take time out to write great reviews .. so Iâd just like to add something to that â¦â¦Itâs always a shame to read about the disappointments that a fellow Sim Player has experienced instead of reading about their delights as they have taken the controls of their favourite consist and proudly taken passengers or goods from their chosen station, port or yard and delivered them on time having faced realistic challenges of schedules, other transport or sometimes signal failures and adverse weather conditions - that inner sense of achievement (and self-pride) is all we really seek - Yes they may be after all only simulations of real modes of transport âBUTâ¦. be it an incredible landing of a fully laden 300 ton Boeing 747-400 on a real time flight from Singapore to Heathrow - Microsoft Flight Simulator perhaps - where you take care of the Jumbo's flight deck and using the array of true to life switches, levers and dials as you descend gently down to terra firma â EGLL runway 21 to be exact to the [imagined] sounds of cheers and applause of your satisfied passengers and crew. Or that inner voice that says 'yees!' when we finally arrive at the depot and park up our Flexi-Bus for the day OMSI 2â its late, the sun has set, both outside our windows (if we care to look!) and within the Simâ¦ but we donât care.. Weâve driven with diligence and skill, weâve hit n hurt no one and managed to pick up and drop off everyone without a hitchâ¦ thatâs what matters.. Thatâs why we play these Simulators â Thatâs what Sims do for us! - They fulfil our innermost desire to be a part of something that we admire, to take control of the very vehicles that we venerate and are in awe of â Hours of our lives are spent recreating the paths taken by Road, Rail, Air and Sea in order that we may share the experience in some intangible way of that of the Driver, Pilot, Captain, Fireman, Soldier and Doctor? within us all â all this achieved speedily at the flick of a mouse button and without the arduous years of universities, specialist training and professional advice and preparation, we will not suffer any loss of limb if we make mistakes as we learn the art of take-off and landing, nor will we face litigation and inevitable imprisonment from the families of the loved ones that we lost at sea due to our lack of experience of sailing cruise ships, or even suffer from docked wages from South West Trains for continued late arrivals at London Victoriaâ¦ Friends our desire and task is a simple one â¦ to Simulate through our chosen modes â¦ without the Wind, Rain, Ice, Snow or Insurance Costs ever affecting or view of our chosen destination - To Dream the Impossible is what drives the human spirit â But to deny someone of that dream is to deny them of the very lust for life â¦.. So keep dreaming keep âSimmingâ and whether itâs by Air, Sea or Land may your journeys be filled with fun, passion and excitement â Sim on! n Smile as you go!			"

												I ain't a proffesional strategist but after learning the basics you can have alot of fun with this game. Every battle ain't the same and the units are modelled after their real-life counterpart. Although there aren't many players nowadays since they moved on to other things so you gotta bring a friend. Don't play with a headache.			"

												If you've played Wargame: European Escalation, then the learning curve is not so steep. If this is your first Wargame, the learning curve is like a cliff, all the youtube vids, and strategy guides are almost useless. Once past the learning curve, the depth of this style of RTS is sheer brilliance. When you've performed a flanking maneuver on the enemy correctly, you might pee yourself with glee. Multiplayer is where the game absolutely shines, the AI in single player has flaws, as with any game. The eye-candy European Escalation was missing is here in ALB, as well as total air support. The UI, while similiar to EE, is still intuitive, and moreso with that great 'reverse' button for vehicles! Overall, Eugen topped themselves here, I look forward to my next leap to Red Dragon, with utter abandon !			"

But there are steam guides that read like actual military manuals but they explain everything. very trial and error though for learning. and its starting to go from work to super fun. I personally have not gone into a multiplayer game due to knowing that i would be (rightly) flamed for being a noob feeder. But god is it fun. Work though.

												Wargame: Airland Battle is a spectacular game, to be frank.With its selection of hundreds of units, varying from the humble infantry to the mighty tanks, a player can build a deck to combat and defend against any threat. In addition to a range of units, is the deep strategy. Its clearly evident that every weapon has its own weaknesses and strengths, and these need to be exploited! Vehicles all have a complex damage system too, some stronger at the front and weak at the back. Multiplayer is a little strange, but still fun. Participate in small 1v1 skirmishes or rediculous 10v10 wars! Either way, its a cluster of joy and frustration as you take and lose territory!Single player is... disappointing. Thats really all I can say.In terms of graphics, this game is absolutely spectatular! Units are clean and crisp when zoomed in. The landscape however is a little, ""mushy"", but none the less still good looking. Particle effects are also amazing, especially when dropping a huge payload of bombs.I would recommend this to anyone whom like a deep strategy game and a modern vibe to warfare!9/10			"

												This very realistic RTS sure has a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it provides fast-paced, pedal-to-the-metal action covering a time-period a bit less touched by other games out there (the Cold War). Punishing to those who get lazy or too greedy with their strategies, the game keeps you at the edge of your seat, no matter who you are up against (including a surprisingly efficient AI). Many games end within 30-40 minutes, but that's more than enough adrenaline-pumping time to keep any gamer satisfied.Even with Wargame: Red Dragon already in my library, ALB still maintains its own flair, and is something I will continue playing for a long, long time...

A leisurely romp compared to a lot of micro management style games.Cons; Had to buy a new video card to play it, my old GTX9800 was fine as far as performance was concerned (didn't seem too taxed) but resulted in serious ""random"" crashes in game after 10 minutes.

												Best RTS game I've played in years, so I felt compelled to write a short review. This game reminds me of Close Combat, and maybe it could be argued that the Wargame series is the spritual successor of the Close Combat series. Battles are ultra realistic and involve balancing your forces with infantry, tanks, anti-air and air support, artillery, and etc... The scale and scope is huge. Maps are huge relative to the units, and yet you can zoom in to see the fighting up close.The graphics are amazing, gamplay is amazing, and to top it all off, this game runs very well on low end systems too. I'm playing this game on a dell laptop that has an integrated graphics card.If you love RTS games that require more depth and strategy, this is your game.			"

												The best RTS I've put my hands on in years. WG:ALB, like his predecessor, brings an huge variety of tactical and strategic decisions to be made, an almost inifinite replayability, an accurate reproduction of the weaponry of the times (1965ca-1990) and a real focus on the players' capability to plan, invent and react. Everyone who is searching for a game that can be called without doubt smart and deep should buy this game. The game shines in multiplayer, and offers very little in single player. Also, the first learning curve could be steep due to the amount of units (and how do they work) the player has to memorize before getting a real hand of them on the battlefield.Score? This is a clear 9.5/10 for me.			"

The AI beats the shoot out of me, so I never go online to play against other people. Still, I enjoy the game a lot, and lately I found out that if I reduce the game speed (with CheatEngine) I have actually enough time to make decisions, and it's not a click fest!Anyway, after finishing European Escalation, I am working my way now through Airland Battle and I am having a blast.

												After playing EE and ALB, I can easily say Eugen system engine is broken. This is never addressed, and it seemed it never will be. When they released RUSE the AI had the same problems. This is lazy design, by the devs. Do not say they need to add cheats for the AI, because its possible to give an AI, a neural net. Some games already do this. Also realistically the USSR did have a lot of high end units. They were mainly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ T34-72. NATO reflects this with the usage of crappy tanks, but in mass. The people defending this game are often people who plays this way toooooooo much. Anyone outside the ""hardcore"" base, will see its a horribly designed game. Playing with humans is much easier, ironically. The AI just loves to zerg rush with unlimited resources. 1/10, stay away from Eugen system, until they hire a compentent software engineer in machine learning.			"

Recon, mechanized assualts, artillery, helicopter gunships, and jets that make the world go boom.  Combined arms, cover and line of sight  are key elements to game on top of having to balance logistics and air support.  Great game for single player and especially for multiplayer.  It has a good learning curve, but there's ton's of youtube videos to learn from.  You're good to go once you get the basic mechanics down.			"

Balanced RTS/Battlefield simulation with up 20 players in multiplayer, with capability to view from bird's eye or zoom down to the level of the individual soldier or tank and watch the carnage of battle unfold. Visuals are fantastic. Has some optimization problems, especially with computers older than a  year or two or lacking at least a $120 video card (lower cards of high tier tend to perform okay)A new version of this game will be for sale in mid 2014 and I expect expansions and DLC to grow to nothing at this point in preperation and support for the new game.

I have had some awesome  moments in this game such as an exellent veiw of an F-35 Harrier zooming over at super sonic speeds and fires a Mavrick missile into an enemy armor column devistating it. The game is highly satisfying and again i highly recommend buying it though it is a bit pricey.			"

												I like this game for turning  alternate history into a playable version of history. I like the real military branches and their actual equipment. (The vehicles,weapons,etc.) are real equipment the military branches of the nations use everyday. I also like the events that happen alongside playing to show the turn (i.e. United Kingdom starts major offensive against IRA) to help affect gameplay. The cities and locations are real as well. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes realistic wartime gameplay set in the cold war theme.			"

												The attention to detail is just incredible. You spend most of your time zoomed right out so each vehicle is barely more than an icon, and yet when you do zoom in the details is amazing. And they even bothered with engine shutting down sounds in the armoury.Buy it. Play it. But ignore the campaign.			"

												For those who are looking for an RTS like Starcraft, C&C or AoE, this game probably isn't for you. While this game does keep pace like C&C or Starcraft, there is no building element outside of your FOB (Foward Operating Bas), the main goal is to push back either the NATO or the PACT forces. You can call in things such as infantry, armor, helos, jets, etc (No water vehicles yet). The replay value in this game is not in the SP, but in the MP portion, as you get to test your skills against others, and every battle is seemingly different.  This game holds up well graphically and can be run on a majority of computers. This game is not for the inexperienced as it is fast, and too many slip ups could cost you the game. This game is not for casuals! (Just kidding! Although the learning curb on this game can be pretty steep.) I highly recommend this to any serious RTS player who is looking for something new, or just something that is fast paced, this game is for you.			"

												This game has one of the biggest learning curves in the history of history. I would say its more a ""battlefield simulator"" than a game. The controls and tactics are so in depth that your mother got lost in it. There's also a reason that there's over 800 (soon to be 1000) units. You'll need every one of these units. An interest in military history and tactics would also help a lot. ""So should I get this game?"" you ask. Well. You will get this game only if you know how to cope with losing, learning, and coordinating. If youre impatient and want a Call of Duty type of action game, you need to not be a part of this game. Also, forget about any other RTS game, because ""zerg rushing"" won't work. Best of luck, potential future commanders.			"

												The multiplayer is perfect.  The single player is a different story...First off, the AI cheats.  I am talking about a ""zero fog of war"" senario for the AI.  It may not be able to blind fire on your units, but it will send a worthless one point truck out towards one of your hidden units.  This will occur seemingly without fail.  While I can accept this happening every once in a while due to blind luck, this happens EVERY TIME I try to send spec ops. behind enemy lines.  That thenpaves the way for every aircraft in the pact's arsenal to drop half the planet's stockpile of bombs on my units. Next, the AI spams.  As in, it will spam T-55s and BTR by the hundreds, while I, if I were playing pact, would be unable to field 20.  My units only have so much ammo and can only fire so fast.  They will almost always get overrun just by sheer numbers.  When playing the AI, it becomes less of an RTS and more of a tower defense, ""Spam everything you've got,"" game.  Then there is the lack of intelligent AI in your own units.  I want to be maing strategic plays, not frantically telling every radar guided AA gun to turn off its radar to avoid being destroyed by a SEED (suppression of enemy air defense) aircraft, or telling an unarmed recon hellicopter to get its a-- out of a Tungustka's (Russian made AA gun) range.  For the enemy AI though, its a different story.  After all, when you can make 3.7 billion computations a second, its pretty easy to micromanage every unit.As said above, when you are playing multiplayer, its a differnt story.  Yes, unfortunatly you do still have to micromanage every unit you have.  But so does your opponent.  And they are not micromanageing unitsat a rate of 3.7 billion a second.  This game has an unparalleled level of depth for a ""game"" RTS (i.e. not Command.)  Armored Vehlicals (Steam really needs spell check :)) have varying armor thicknesses based on where a shot hits.  (Front, side rear, top.)  Infantry can hide in forests and towns, making ambushes a snap.  Fuel and ammo is limited with logistic vehlicals (once again, I need spell check) resupplying your units.  You have full control over your aircraft while they are over the battlefield, if you tell them otherwise, they will NOT fly a straight line to thier target (not recommended as AA will likely shoot them down.)  Your units are irreplacable.  Although you can reinforce, your reinforcements are not unlimited.  There are so many features in this game that I would likely need to type five pages to list all the features in this game.Would I recommend this game?  That depends.  Single player: HELL NO.  This is an exercise in frustration with the amount of AI cheating present.Multiplayer: Absoultly.  This is a well made RTS game that, IMO should be just as famous as Starcraft or C&C.			"

Defs top 5 in my RTS games list however, its just confusing at first, heaps fun though once you get used to the setting and environment. Although it gets boring at times, i would recommend this game to anyone simply because once you get used to the environment its heaps fun!			"

												A epically scaled, realistic modern RTS that rewards tactics and micromanagement - a low level unit can beat an upgraded one if used strategically. Resource management is present but you only need occupy sectors to generate points (the only type of resource, with which you send in reinforcements). The game emphasises patience and intelligent play. Like any RTS you need to learn units' strengths and weaknesses to be competant, and with 750 units AirLand Battle takes some time to become enitely familiar with. Individual games have a limit on the points you have in a ""deck"", with better units costing more points and simpler ones less. This a sophisticated, detailed and satasfying RTS with modern military hardware.			"

												Whatever you can say about Airland Battle, it certainly isn't your daddy's RTS. Gone is base building and small amounts of units. Wargame pits literally thousands of infantry and hundreds of vehicles from the Cold War period against each other on the battlefields of Europe. This title really shines when you execute a perfect strategy. SEAD planes (supression of enemy air defense) streak overhead, taking out enemy AA and paving the way for your bombers. As an enemy interceptor becomes visible on the horizon, your F15 swoops in to protect your vulnurable planes. Your artillery switches to smoke rounds, concealing the advance up a hill and into a city by your infantry in their APCs with tanks in support. As your troops swarm the first line of houses, your Napalm scatters the defenders, and the city is yours. It is moments like these that make Wargame: Airland Battle truly worth your time.			"

												This game is the epitomy of what a RTS should be. No need to gather resources here folks, instead you have to control objective zones to gain points to bring in reinforcements. So basically if you have taken some objectives, you get rewarded with being able to call in more troops. Be aware that there is a bit of learning curve associated with the game, but after 15-20 matches you'll be able to begin making strategic maneuvers towards winning.Also, you have to love the deck system the game implements. There are well over a 1000 units you can utilize, some specifically tied to one of the 8 NATO or 4 PACT countries. You can use an open multinational deck to get access to a variety of units. Or you can limit yourself to a doctrine and/or country to really boost the amount of troops you have available to you.All in all, highly recommend this game.			"

												Amazing detail and versatility!  Use a generic 'deck' to build your army, or accept limits on nationality (but get their prototype units), time period (but sticking with older units means having far more of them), or force type.  Go Armored and get more experienced tanks and more of them at the expense of infantry, or go Air Assault or Paradrop to get brilliant infantry but limit your heavy units to what can be flown in.  Yes, the initial learning curve is steep, but the payoff is awesome.			"

												Leave your idea of a traditional RTS at the door, this plays more like a real time version of a table top strategy game (warhammer, flames of war, etc) base building is not a thing save for placing FoBs where you can resupply units.That said, this game is fun, engaging and an utter pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to learn and master. (Play 2v2 with a bot to start, 1v1 will only make you frustrated as a new player)Play it if you like making desicsions on a large scale while managing a limited pool of units (your deck)You can customize your deck to your liking, even using limitations like only using a certain nation, era, or combined arms style (mechanized, paratrooper, marine, etc) each limitation also gives bonuses to your deck, like a free veterancy level for a type of unit, or lower costs for a type of unit.I highly recomend this game to fans of large scale strategy games, this games mechanics are solid and it looks fantastic to boot.

												This game is an RTS. It is about as close to realistic as an RTS can get without it being counter intuitive and confusing to new players. Effectively you play as either NATO or Warsaw Pact in a hyperthetical WW3 scenario, you build an army from varying factions and/or branches of the military and fight each other. Primarily this is a game for multiplayer or skirmish mode like BF:BC2 was, although the single player Total War style campaign had some nice ideas, it just isn't satisfying to play. I love the attention to detail present here as well as the sense of scope and scale, it just nails everything just right for me.Although I will admit I have been a massive fan of Eugen Studio's output since RUSE and I'm glad that they've smoothed things out so it's not longer quite so Rock Paper Scissors as it was there. All in all excellent good looking game with an absolutely boatload of units for each nationality and well worth a punt if you see it on sale.			"

												lets be honest here there are plenty of RTS games out there and many series that have dominated the genra for many years. age of empires, total war are a couple. but after playing those series for many years even great games can grow a little ... stale? yes that seems ot fit. but when i aquired wargame airlandbattle it just blew me away i had not played an RTS with such joy for a good many years. the huge array of units, the well made maps, the whole game is just 10/10 i could probably give roughly 2 things i dont like about this game and neither are very important (mostly pertaining to FOB's) this game is a must have for any RTS fan hands down and should you be aible to aquire the previous game european escilation i would recomend that one aswell and i move forward with high hopes for red dragon. this series is going strong and from the looks of it is here to stay. hue hue move over AGE i think you got some competition.10 out of 10 must buy ;)			"

												Probably the most unforgiving and most difficult ""game"" I have ever played! And its well worth it!! This title is clearly for those that take their real-time strategy games seriously with a side order of frustration and gamer rage! The units, from what I know of their real life counterparts, are well represented in this game and the game's play system of using ""decks"" of units that are used in each round makes for a very challenging experience. This in turn makes wins that much more satisfying. Choosing which units to use for each scenario plays a huge factor in your overall success during each round. If you're playing a campaign, choose wisely as you won't readily receive replacement units if you screw up too badly! I've not used the multiplayer fuction of this game yet as I'm still pretty bad against the AI which even in ""easy"" mode provides quite a challenge. From what I understand, however, multiplayer is where this game really shines. This is a title for serious strategists only! Casual strategy gamers will find this title very frustrating. The only way to find a more challenging experience would be to actually enlist in the armed forces!			"

												Though I like W:EE more. This is more fast-tempo game because of the air units. Singleplayer is much much worse than EEÂ´s, usually they have no sence at all; enemy units spawn right next to your deployment zoneÂ´s edge, ending up in a mass carnage. DonÂ´t buy this for the singleplayer. If you like those big map and large scale online battles,  this is the right game for you. Multiplayer matches tend to be very large scale and unit losses great but in the other hand youÂ´ll get Command Points faster than in EE. Overall rating 4/5, but the singleplayer was a huge disappointment.			"

												To write a review of this, I have to start out with one thing in particular.  Forget all the screenshots you see in the store page.  You NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT.  If you zoom in closely enough and manipulate the camera enough you might, but you never want to do it.  This game takes place on a large scale, and to be able to play it effectively you have to be zoomed way out to see the big picture.  Units never appear as anything other than a collection of a few pixels.  You recognize and select units by clicking on their labels.That being said, it is also an extremely difficult game at first for someone accustomed to playing other standard RTS games.  For instance I've been a big fan of Supreme Commander and also have played a bit of Company of Heroes.  This game is NOT like either of them.  It is a curious attempt at realism, for although some things are changed to make things work over a battle lasting 20 minutes, there's a lot of detail in here, and a lot of micro management.  Everything can run out of fuel and ammo.  Even defenders have to be resupplied otherwise they run out of ammo, especially for missile based units, and that resupply vehicle has to be manually sent every time and is vulnerable to attack as well.I still am not particularly capable at playing it so far, it's just too different from everything I've played before, none of my approaches work.  It is also very much a ""rock paper scissors"" kind of game, an approach I usually hate, but in this case it works because the strengths and weaknesses make sense.  Attack helicopters are extremely useful at taking out enemy armor but are in turn quite vulnerable to anti air defenses.  They're too vulnerable to enemy fighters but that's perhaps nitpicking, in reality it's difficult for an enemy fighter to even detect a slow moving helicopter.  I should also mention that they carry exactly the number of anti tank missiles that they should.  Tanks are perhaps the king of the open battlefield, with the exception that they are quite vulnerable to anti tank missiles fired from long range (but only if you have recon to enable the missile launchers to see them), but in cities they get wiped out by missile armed troops hiding in buildings.It is also a game with a variety of ways of being played.  It's just that none of mine work.  I've normally faced off against AI that uses primarily ground based attacks, but I once faced nothing but helicopters.  Attack helicopters and troop transports.  That was brutal, I didn't have near enough anti air defenses.  But you can bus in troops via anything from hummer to fully armed assault helicopter, depending upon what faction you're playing.There's one other thing I should say about this, and that's how scoring works.  It is a game where you are given X amount of points to invest in units, and you pick any combo you want from what you have available to you.  Your score is the value of the number of enemy units that you kill.  If the enemy kills a lot of your valuable units and you can't get a greater score from them, you lose.  There is a very mild resource gathering element, but it's secondary to the heavy focus on strategy and force balance.Or, for the TLDR version of this review, the name is entirely appropriate, it is a wargame.  The positioning of your units matters.  Units are slowed down moving through forests but they are also hidden.  Grouped units can be vulnerable.  Line of sight matters.  Sight range matters.  Supplies matter.  That super expensive M1A1 American tank that you sunk the last of your resources into can be taken out by cheap Soviet infantry and earn the enemy all of those points if you're not careful with it.

												If you want to play this game let me give some tips for you. The game is hard...soul crushingly hard (also dont buy it for the single player since it is painfully obvious that SP did not revice more than 2% of the developers money and thus it is unpolished). Unlike your usual RTS this game is not about spamming the same order to a unit just 1 cm to a different direction at 300APM and more about strategy on a map wide scale with most battles taking place in a more tactical scale. The pace of the game goes back and forth you can loose the most expensive units in just a second in a single attack and your micro wont help with that but you also sit around doing nothing for the most part until that one recon you placed there behind enemy lines picks up enemy activity and the game suddenly turns into fast paced action. The game requires a different mindset and wants to show you how your army must make use of every piece of equipment and map features that is at your disposal in order to achive victory . But if you get past the learning curve that is almost as steep as the learning curve of Dwarf Fortress(okay maybe not that hard) you'll have hours of fun shooting up Tanks form the 1980s with a sneaky infantry squad that cost only 1/5th compared to that tank you just destroyed. The game has headcrushing depth and complexity and it will reward strategic thinkind and unconventional tactics that will cheer you up immensly. The controls are easy to learn for the most part the armory has an insane amount of units for both NATO and PACT from 1950 to 1990. But to learn how to use them you'll need to make use of the chatroom from time to time also a few guides. But the community is great(for the most part) and if you do ask a question it wont take more than a few seconds till you get the answer.If you do get to the end of this review all you need to know is this. There are two kinds of games: ones that bore you to a state aproaching Rigor Mortis and there are games that you'll stop playing because you just noticed that you spent a day on yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥having fun. Wargame Airland battle is in the latter category it is a truly shining example of the genre that is not about spamming tanks and going from on side of the map to the other hoping that your taget will be amongst the things that die along the way.So yes the game is good the soundtrack get a bit annoying but at least thanks to the graphics it'll run well on any PC if you updated it in 2010.

Epic battles between two massive armies clashing in farmer's fields or even suburbs, all using cold war-era technology and TONS OF EXPLOSHUNZ!!!!!!!DEFINATELY Recommended.

												Best RTS I have ever played, puts you in the mindframe of a real general. Its multiple aspects of war makes it very intense, and it is also a game of counters. If you have it, it can die somehow, even the heavist tanks. Campaign is also very good, also putting in the mindframe in a large scale war, moving regiments to defend or to attack, with extra things like commando raids to help. Overall - 8.4 out of ten, lacking a easier learning curve, the graphics are good, and the gameplay is pretty good, so is the campaign.			"

												This is the game for large scale RTS. If you like games such as Blitzkreig then this will be up your alley. Keep in mind the learning curve is steep and it's not at all like AoE or StarCraft. Being good at micro will do you no good here.			"

												Airland battle Is the best Wargame to date, With many Improvements over European Escalation such as Ai, Vehicles, Graphical updates and giant maps, And I'm talking HUGE maps, This game Includes everything a strategy game should, Cooperative Campaign, Skirmish, And multiplayer which can also be played with Ai If you are like me who does not enjoy playing real people all the time. But If you are the type of person who likes playing against Ai with a friend then this Is your game, The Ai has Improved since EE and will give you a tough fight, My friends and I have found ourselves sometimes fighting tooth and nail for objectives and sometimes defending our base from overwhelming Ai attacks, And with the option to fill real player slots In mp with Ai, It will give you the option to create one huge chaotic game with your friends, Gameplay goes both ways, You can find yourself dominating the other team and winning, But If you don't play your cards right and conserve units you will find yourself In a bad position, Running out of reinforcements In airland battle can cost you and your allies greatly especially early on, Losing valuable units such as Air, Armor or Anti-Air can lose the game within a split second. Your army marches on supply and supply lines, Which Is vital to success on the Battlefield, Units can and will run out of fuel/ammo and will need to be sometimes repaired after a fight, Keeping your supply routes safe for trucks Is VERY Important especially on the large maps, There are also supply helicopters to use but they will need to be protected also, Units for use range from, Jets, Helicopters, Tanks, Jeeps, Trucks, Artillery, Infantry and others, Hundreds of types of units are at your disposal from different NATO countries such as the U.S, U.K, Germany, France aswell as all the participating countries of the Warsaw Pact and many others, There's a selection of units for everybody and a great selection of maps and free dlc, Game runs like a dream and the developers have nailed It dead on with performance, If you like strategy games you will love this title, I know I do.Best Strategy game I have ever played hands down. 10/10			"

												A Very tactical RTS game. No mindless production of units and use of swarm tactics here, you ease through each level with careful thought hoping for minimal loss. I recommend this game for those who want a change of pace and really want to emerse themselves into the experience.			"

												If you are in to war machines and RTS... this game is for you. I cant stop playing. Nothing beats hearing the gun on an a-10 as is strafes a group of enemy tanks right infront of friendly infantry. Very technical game. Strategy is everything, as well as picking good units. I feel the campange mode is not much fun.Great multi player. Any way, Love Wargame Airland Battle.			"

												For someone who has no interest in multiplayer but loves Cold War era tech, this game is a fantastic toy box and suprised me with how well the interface works and how satisfying a the air units mix in with the ground units.Super satisfying just to hear the BRRRT of A-10s at they knock out super valuable T-72s or T-80s!

												An interesting, dynamic strategy/tactical game. Heavy focus on logistical superiority and punishing if you don't keep up on your macro. Plays like a more realistic, larger scale (and slower paced for the most part) World in Conflict. Jets add a new dynamic to WGEE that cannot be understated.			"

												This is a great game for all you RTS lovers out there, like myself. It takes commitment, skill, and a good strategic thinker. The battles can range from small skirmishes, to map-wide fighting. It's very action packed, has a tough campaign, and epic battles against AI opponents. If you're new to this game, I suggest practicing against the AI first before diving right into the campaign. That's what I did, 'cause the campaign is pretty challenging. It takes those Cold War fears and brings them to life. Minus the nuclear armageddon, conventional war only. But anyway, amazing game, and I highly recommend this for anyone who is into RTS games. You won't regret getting this, it just takes some time to get comfy with the battles and the AI. But like I said, completely worth the money. Great game. Rate: 10/10.			"

												Its a fairly addictive game. Learning curve is steep especially for new comers to the series. I have fun making different Armies which focus on different styles of gameplay.			"

												If you enjoy R.U.S.E. then you will enjoy this game. It's more or less like R.U.S.E but gets rid of the R.U.S.E. cards and adds in more depth to units. (ammo, fuel, mindset/morale of units)			"

												I haven't play the game a lot to give a review about it's worth.What I can say right now is that this game is optimized. My XFX6870 died (waiting for the new one to arrived_. I expected this game to be unplayable due to the onboard graphics but found out that the auto optimization works great. I'm playing it with the Intel3000 from my 2500K (clocked at 4.6Ghz) no lag or frame drops the graphics look great. Of course this isnt at high resolutions dont remember correctly the resolution it's running right now but I would have to guess its by 720. About the game there are various stats for each unit which makes it really strategic. You cant just rush various units to attack because you will fail miserably.			"

												This is hands down one of the best strategy games i`ve ever played. Realism paired with hundrets of units and pretty graphics. If you liked SuddenStrike or WiC, buy this. Everyone else who is into RTS, buy it too.			"
