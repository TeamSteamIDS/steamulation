												I've been playing this game for a little over 3 years now and have finally decided to write a review... Most games- if you play them long enough- get boring and tiresome. The people I play with weekly and most of the time daily, have played totals of thousands of hours and yet continue to play weekly/daily. This is because there really can't ever be a round in ND thats the same as another. Each team won't ever be exactly the same, the commanders won't usually be the same, and how the players play in each map will always be different so that you really aren't just going through the motions after hours and hours of gameplay. I know that myself and at least 100-150 other dedicated core players feel the same way. The other reviews of this game that I see are from people who really havent played it all that much and have just taken their first look FPS and RTS aspects. A lot of what they say is correct.. There are definitely areas of ND that need work, and since theres no real developer working on it not much can change. However, even though there is no actual developer, ND is constantly being improved and tweaked to make gameplay better. This is because of server managers and testers in the community itself who have fixed glitches, improved team balancing, made mods, and have organized ND soooooo much in the past 2 years. Nuclear Dawn was on a downswing and playercounts were at an all time low, but now that there are scheduled events, groups, and stats, things are getting better fast! So to people who say Nuclear Dawn is dying: It WAS dying, now its only getting better little by little. I highly recommend this game and encourage people to give it a fair chance. Join the group ""ND Battles"" for scheduled formal and casual events. I truly love this game and will never stop playing it!			"

												First thing's first: I am a passionate lover of FPSRTS genre, having played both Savage and Natural Selection (1&2) for many many hours. So bear that in mind.So what's Nuclear Dawn? It is a representative of a very rare breed of video games, which combine classic FPS action as a foot soldier and Top Down RTS style commander role. Two teams fight for dominance over critical locations on the map with commanders providing support in form of abilities and buildings which allow forward psawning of reinforcements, ammo/hp regen and defences.The game itself is fast paced, with several classes to choose from: classic Assault with powerful weaponry, able to take a few hits before going down and iconic thermal vision which negates invisibility, EXO with tons of health and deadly weapons, most effective against buildings, Stealth for general sneaking about, either with knives which can backstab unsuspecing players to sniper and unique sabateur with remote bombs, and lastly a trusty support with lightning-fast firing SMGs, shotgun or a freaking flame thrower. Everyone will find something fun to choose from.Unofrtunately the game does not have a massive following but there is a good server or two, one in US one in Germany to choose from.As always remember: there is no middle ground when it comes to FPSRTS matches. You either get a complete stomp of a match, which thankfully does not last too long or you get a very fun and amazing experience, which will keep you coming back for more, day after day.			"

												This game deserves much more attention than it's getting. It's an amazing concept, and it works really well. It has all of the aspects of the best FPS games, like requiring a balance of different classes (not everyone can run and gun) and communication to win. Matches can completely change over just a few minutes. It's got incredible potential if they make another and perhaps polish it, but I would definitely support this game. Not very expensive for a lot of potential play time.			"

												Recommend? Yes. It is a really good game. Solid with no bugs. If you are into the genre of FPS/RTS go for it.The problem? Depending on where you are, you will not find servers at all. If you found them, the level between players is to big to have fun...Why I like it? Because you can play with friends via LAN. Yep, get a good group of friends and you can rock it! If you are a loner, this is not a game for you.			"

												I really used to like this game. The way how the is balanced, how it requires a good team cooperation to win, how nicely it blends FPS and RTS... everything is just perfect.However. I've stopped playing it, because of the toxic community. Everyone knows better all the time. Let me give you a few examples:You want to start a new server? Nah, dont bother - a bunch of minions will go there, starts ruining the matches, spamming the chat (""YOU SHOULD GO TO THE OTHER SERVER IT IS MUCH BETTER""), crashing it by using exploits, shaming it in a discussion forums, how can they do much better... you name it.You reach the developer (which otherwise doesnt exist anymore) and help with releasing a patch fixing a critical issues? Nah, dont bother - they already know these issues before, and have the (crippling) patches for themselves for a long time already, so ""this is not a contribution whatsover"". Hello? Releasing an official patch fixing gameplay? Well, whatever.You release a few plugins for fixing some other issues? Nah, your code is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they know better. If you'll let them improve the code, they'll break it, so it stop working... which proves their point, that your code is♥♥♥♥♥♥ So... dont bother.Now, if you'll read the other reviews, you'll read a lot of ""the community is dead"". If you want to know the real reason why it is, it's because the community is toxic af. I spoke to a dozen of people who played 1000+ hours of this game, and the reason why they left is always the same. So I'll just leave it here.			"

												I purchased this game on a fluke and it ended up my favorite game of all time. I've been playing Nuclear Dawn since the beginning. The game had a surge in popularity, the participation died off dramatically, and saw another surge in popularity again. This is bacause there is no actual game developer, and the Nuclear Dawn community has taken the task of fixing in-game glitches, improved balancing experienced and new players at map startup, created mods, and create gaming events that have brought all the core fans back to the fore.Nuclear Dawn is a fast-paced Real Time Strategy (RTS) and a First Person Shooter (FPS) game combined in one. One person elects to be the ""Commander"", enters the team HQ and the view becomes an RTS, for all other players its an FPS. Other temmates are respinsible for capturing tertiary points that bring in income to the Commander to build supply stations, ammunition, turrets and new spawn points. The main challenges for the Commander are: power management, strategic placement of forward structures, and resource management.The main challenge for the other teammates are: capturing tertiary poins, maintining control of those tertiary points and defending the forward structures and power grid the commander builds up. This is accomplished by the teammates evenly dividing themselves into one of four soldier classes: Stealth, Assault, Exo, and Support. All classes have critical strengths and one achilles heel against one type of class. For example: Charge in with all heavy eight Exo gunners, three cloaked Stealth scouts can kill them all with one stab in the back. So a balanced team with all four classes is crucial for success.On that last point is the game's greatest triumph and greatest failure. Your quality gaming experience depends on how well your team cooperates with the commander and with each other. If a commander has a disorganized team, the team refuses to take orders from the commander, or simply the entire team goes ranged scouts with sniper rifles (has happened to me several times)...the game is doomed for that team, and makes for an emotionally intense, grueling, and demoralizing 20-45 minutes of ""turtle-ing"" at the base accompanied with teammates pointing fingers of blame, general freaking out and some verbal abuse. But...if the team is quick to respond to the commander's requests, has an even distribution of class types, whether win or loose, it makes for the most memorable, magical, endorphin-rush-to-the-brain-gaming experiences you could experience. That is what keeps players returning to this game. That is also why fans of this game are so incredibly loyal.That being said...the less desirable, grueling gaming experiences have driven off many players. When I used to play hardcore 4 hours a day there were anywhere from 10 to 15 servers active with 12-35 players on at any given time around the world. Today there are only two servers with 3-10 active players plus bots at on high traffic hours of the day. The only times there are high numbers are when ND parties are organized and that usually happens twice a month.Requirements for pleasant gameplay:1. GET A MICROPHONE!!!! - Nobody can play in a fast paced environment without team chat. Teammates or the Commander may request favors, give orders, ask for tactical support, or may need status updates...typing responses is out of the question. Typing is so laborious that all non-microphone players eventually stop typing all together, killing the tactial advantage of communication within the team.2. COOPERATE WITH TEAMMATES AND THE COMMANDER - This is not a one person game. It's solely dependent on how well the team can act as a unit.3. EVENLY DIVIDE THE CLASSES YOU PICK - Your about to respawn and there's no medic on your team? Man up, stop being a Scout with a sniper rifle missing all your head shots and support the heavy Exos.4. LEARN HOW TO BE AN EFFECTIVE COMMANDER - This can only be learned with experience and my video tutorials at: www.YouTube.com/NuclearDawnHelpNote these tutorials are very old, but the core strategies remain effective. Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Would you be playing this game often with other users? At the current rate of participation, unless you have a few friends that don't mind giving ND a shot with you, probably not.			"

												DO NOT BUYdead community, abusive admins deliberately crashing servers (stickz aka vertex) and forcing others offline, cheaters with aim/trigger bots, unfinished/exploitable maps, many commanding glitches still not fixed, abandoned development...So why did I play the game so much?2014 was the golden year but from 2015 with the closure of the development studio, all went to hell and the community is now toxic with the majority of vets leaving.

												Nuclear Dawn is Real Time Strategy/First Person Shooter...yes a RTS/FPS I know right?!?!?!  I never had so much fun dying before.  But it lacks in certain elements this offline play isn't that much fun because the AI for the bots is horrible bots get stuck don't listen to commands that well.  But the offline play is good to get a better feel of the Commander Position.  So the breakdown of the game is one of the players gets designated commander.  The commander is the most important position he is in charge of the the RTS side of the game building structures and telling the FPS players where to go.  A great commander will make or break the game.  The online play is FANTASIC. I would of loved to see this game in its heyday because not a lot of people are playing online but it is still so much fun. You can normally find one server with a few people online.  The downside is they have been playing for awhile and its hard to level up your character.  But keep at it and you will get there I almost have my EXO (heavy weapons/heavy armor) to level 10 to get an upgrade.  There are four classes of soldiers, Assault, EXO, Support, and Stealth.  Each class has its unique abilities for the game stealth you can cloak and back-stab for the kill or become a sniper.  Assault just like the name says but you also get the thermal vision so you can see the stealth soldiers cloaked.  The EXO is great for starting out a character in my opinion because of the heavy armor.  Support is paramount to any good game with abilities to fix structures heal players, and resupply them.  This game is well worth it $9.99 price tag and is sure to provide you with plenty of hours of fun.			"

												Great game, If you dont mind working with people and shooting others along the way this is a game for you. Small group of core supporters with a love for ND. The game in alot of ways is so simple but thats what makes it so fun. When iyou have to equal teams time flies by and you love every minute of it. In the end how well you work with your team will get you the win rather than just having more bulletsUpdate 11/23/16: Use to be a good 2 servers worth of people on, anymore its maybe 16 people... Natural selection 2 is similer and still getting updates.			"

												I woke up this morning alive. I suited up in my Consortium regulation support medic armor and headed out from base. Word had come down from the brass that morning that some filthy Empire scum had set up camp in the north end of the ruins, and were trying to take control of several key resource deposits. Another beautiful day in the Consortium!For maybe 30 seconds, everybody wildly fired at each other to practice their aim. Like clockwork, before every battle, we fought each other. A couple died in the melee, only to return to the class selection menu. They were good men. They were good soldiers.We set out from base towards the primary objective immediately. As we approached the dilapidated building, a monument to Golden Age human engineering, it was quiet. I watched our six - just so I could sneak some hypospray for myself before the storm. There's nothing quite like a hit of high quality government issue painkillers right before a gunfight, all on the Consortium's dollar.As we rounded the last corner out into the courtyard where our target lay, I saw an all too familiar sight. A swarm of rockets whizzed down the hallway. Fortunately, my nano skin hadn't worn off yet and I was preserved from the rocket blast. My squad, however, was none so lucky, buried underneath a pile of rubble. And then I heard them - the Empire knew of our attack, and had set an embush! Surly Russian voices cried out what I had come to understand as ""attack!"", and I set off running back the way I came. I took another hypospray just to be ready for anything. I ran back outside, and took a full shotgun blast to the face from a crafty assault trooper who managed to get behind me! Broken and battered, I lifted my machine gun and let out a blast at his head and killed him. Okay, okay, I know it's unbelievable, but that nanoskin is good stuff for guys like us. As I scanned the perimeter, I saw them - the rocket trails of Consortium exo troopers laying siege at the far end of the primary structure. Wounded, I ran along the walls of the buildings in the street until I could rendezvous with the big guns. Back behind my own lines, I threw a medkit on the floor which somehow managed to heal all our wounds just by laying there. It was a good day.			"

												I've seen this game when it was on sale for 2,49€, and since I found the fps/rts hybrid idea interesting I thought I would give it a try, wouldn't lose much money anyways if it would be bad. What a great decision!It turns out this is an amazing and well designed co-op game, it is definitely not what one would expect from a 2€ game, it is rather a 20€ game.The gameplay provides a lot of room for in-depth teamwork with a variety of classes and weapon kits, all suited for different situations, and it is decently balanced. Playing this with friends and good communicating commanders on both teams gives quite an intense outcome. You will be fighting for key positions and pushing back of waves of enemies with commander support, you will get behind enemy lines and assasinate their commander or sabotage their power-grid so your fellow players can rush their positions, you will be going after resource points with your squad to ensure your commander gets resources, ...Each match is different and highly dynamic, depending on what strategy the commanders and soldiers choose. Playing on the same map is never the same thing!Which brings me to another point: maps. I can't stop getting surprised at how well the maps are designed in this game. They are full of detail, full of alternative paths, full of hidden places you can use to get an advantage, and the atmosphere is just awesome.The only problem of this game is its small player base. Most of the time there are one or two full servers of 32 players each, and steamgraph says there are 100 players at peak times/evenings.If you like the idea of fps/rts hybrid games then you should definitely check this out! It goes on sale very often, and even for 9€ the price is still a joke considering what you get. If you watch the store videos and you think it could be cool, don't hesitate! The game is so much better than it appears in those videos!It is a shame that this game does not get more attention. Only you can change that! Grab your friends and get Nuclear Dawn! NOW!			"

												Nuclear Dawn has some novel ideas and some solid gameplay, but lacks balance and longevity.I like the idea behind the game... one commander building structures and trying to direct the flow of chaos from within a fortified bunker.  I don't like RTS's because I don't like splitting my attention between resources, structures, and every single unit out there.  Nuclear Dawn puts direction of the troops in the hands of the troops themselves.  Beautiful!  With that out of the way, the RTS commander gameplay is actually nice.On the field are the grunts of varying classes.  Classes I originally felt played off each other like rock paper scissors with their advantages and disadvantages.  As I played longer, I realized how lopsided things were.To it's credit, Nuclear Dawn presents 4 general classes, with subclasses within them, allowing for some role overlap but retaining unique perks.  You end up with things like infantry marksmen, stealth sharpshooters, heavy weapons, fire support, mechanical engineers, medics, assassins, etc.  It works well.  Mostly.  Some particular subclasses, like the saboteur, aren't provided enough perks to make them useful.  Same goes for most engineers.Weapons are a mixed bag, and most of them don't feel robust and exciting.  Sniper rifles are extremely jittery, Assault rifle recoil is insane, and grenades are incredibly overpowered.  The big huge armored guys carrying structure destroying weapons are either a rocket launcher that feels like its shooting needles or a big huge square tube that fizzles out a thin beam of blue energy that reminds me of a bug zapper, not a devastator.  The stealth class armblades just whiff through the air even when hitting someone.. no gusto, no grit.  And pistols, my god the pistols.. everyone carries one and every single one is like a sniper rifle.. it seems a common skill to get a headshot from long range with it and it's pretty much an instant kill unless you're heavily armored.People move quickly.  Circle strafe fights are everywhere, and it all amounts to who can land a headshot first because without it, killing anyone takes forever.  I've played games where my stealth ninja class was chasing a huge lumbering Exo-armored enemy... and I had to run full speed just to keep pace with him.  What the hell is that??  Exo is supposed to be slow and vulnerable.  As assault you have a vision mode that reveals cloaked stealths, but even when you can see them a mile off coming straight at you, sidestepping is so fast that it's hard to draw a bead on him before he runs right up to you and stabs you to death.  It feels like a bad Monty Python and the Holy Grail moment.The push-pull feel of games is good, but is heavily reliant on team-oriented players.  People who can work towards a goal.  People who can hold a line of defense, even if the kill count could be higher elsewhere.  Eventually the game will tip heavily in favor of one team or another.  From this point, it can take 15-20 minutes before the game actually ends, all while the losing side gets spawn-killed repeatedly.  This is stupid.  The designers smartly added a surrender option, but only the commander can issue it, and most either don't know or don't care because while their team is spawning and dying in droves, they are in their bunker watching it all fall apart, trying to get turret kills until finally the bunker is destroyed.Nuclear Dawn can also use bots.  Either in a single-player-esque mode, or to fill out online servers.  Unfortunately they are stupid.  I mean stand in place doing nothing stupid.  I mean won't follow basic commander directions stupid.  I mean don't react to bullets stupid.  I mean 10 years ago Perfect Dark Zero stupid.Servers are scattered and few.  Players all cluster on one server.  Due to the XP and levelling system, veterans will have an advantage over newcomers in quite a drastic way.  That makes getting into the game harder.  I think it's accurate to say this is a dying game in it's twilight years.  Devs have stopped working on it.The graphics aren't bad, the ideas aren't bad, it kind of comes close to being good.  But it isn't.  It's a shame because with proper care, this could have introduced a seriously fresh way to play both FPS and RTS.  I really wanted to enjoy this more, but it simply can't deliver any sustainable enjoyment, only disappointment and frustration.Don't play this.  In a short while, the farmer will come out to shoot this lame horse.			"

												Its big feature that draws people to it is that it is an FPS and RTS in one game. Yeah, it's an FPS-RTS hybrid...for one person on each team, who then tend to hog the position. For everyone else, it's just a plain old FPS.But any points someone could make on this game are pointless because it has almost no playerbase.Lesson learned: don't buy multiplayer-only games unless they are mass marketed. Even mass marketed multiplayer-only games tend to dwindle in players and become useless after awhile, but an indie game that basically had no marketing at all? Never stood a chance.			"

												This is my long due recomendation. ND is a deep and a simply fantastic FPS + RTS hybrid. Each and every single class has a deliberate strategic purpose to it. There isn't a huge community any longer but you can usually find a full-ish server or 2 in the evening and have a load of fun, even if your team is getting steam-rolled there is fun to be had going stealth and backstabbing enemy soldiers while they're trying to take out your emplacements. IMO its all around a much better game than NS2 with a less punishing learning curve.			"

												Have you ever found babysitting your micromanagement-intensive units in RTS annoying, one moment of distraction causing heavy fatalities due to dumbass-AI controlling your units? That's basically the idea behind Nuclear Dawn; As Commander, you play the round from a RTS-perspective. You are building structures, expanding your base, gathering resources.All other players of your team play the game from a first-person perspective; using a wide range of customizable weaponry (15+ attachments), from Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, to Snipers, Flamethrowers, Rocket and Grenade Launchers; utilizing gadgets like healing and repair tools, proximity mines, grenades, cloaking devices and mobile radar devices (...).The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy buildings and protect your own while your commander establishes foward outposts and expands, eventually building into the enemy base. What makes this game so great and fun to play, however, is how commander and soldiers have to work together in order to achieve victory. It's kind of comparable to Natural Selection 2, but Nuclear Dawn is less stressfull to play and takes a more traditional approach on the FPS part. The maps are big and open, Battlefield 2 fans will feel right at home.  The community is very friendly and mature and there are always 1-2 full servers online.Highly recommended "

												Nuclear Dawn is one of the best mash ups of FPS and RST currently available on Steam.  It is my impression that the only contender in thei genre on steam is Natural Selection 2, so i will do a little compare/contrast at the end of this.The good:-Excelent RTS gameplay.  UI is basic, and at times a little clunky, but in general it gets the job done for both macro and micro management of building, upgrades, and resources.  The biggest problem is relying on your soldiers to defend your structures and get you resources.-Decent FPS class based combat.  Each class has thier strengths, and thier weaknesses.  Weapons are well balanced across classes and teams. Certian mechanics can be difficult if you are used to more FPS centric games, and getting used to having to rely on someone to get you better weapons and spawn points can be tough, but in gerneral the FPS gameplay is rewarding. -A Great community.  The people who play this game LOVE it.  They set up events on popular severs, help out new people, and are very communicative.The bad:-Small base of players. Time has taken its toll on the number of active players.  At peak times there is often a server of 30 players or so, but other than that there are very few people playing.-Small selection of maps.  Although the community has done thier best to make a wider selection of maps, there are still a very limited amount compared to FPS centeric and RTS centeric games.***Natural Selection 2 vs. Nuclear Dawn***Natural Selection 2 has 2 radically different sides.  Although this creates some more variety, thier strengths are appearant at different points throughout a match, which makes the game much more difficult to balance.  At this point in time I would say that for balancing reasons alone Nuclear Dawn is the better game.Nuclear Dawn has considerably larger maps than Natural Selection 2.  This allows for more strategy for each commander, expecially when compared to Natural Selection's closed corridors and small rooms.Both games have equivilent FPS gameplay, with the exception that NS2 is only class based for one of the teams.  The other team can custimize thier loadouts (shotguns midgame, grenade launchers/flamethrowers late game, exo suits end game), but thier overall stats are the same.Nuclear Dawn blows the pants off NS2 when it comes to RTS UI.  Because the 2 sides have very similar buildings, the developers were able to keep the key bindings for each side's buildings the same, so it is very easy to play as commander for either side.  This is not the case for NS2.Overall, if you like FPS, or RTS this game is worth a try.  Make sure to sign up with the community groups so you know when everyone else is playing.A final note:  This game, like many team based FPS, really requires a mic.  You can still be an effective team member if you don't (there are in-game voice commands), but I can assure you that at least once every game you will wish you had it to call out enemy locations accuratly, or request supplies in a very specivic spot.  For the RTS element a mic is a must.			"

												I got this game on the 26th from a friend. I played 2 hours that night in single player... I made the mistake the next day of playing multiplayer. 11 hours later I looked up to see that It was almost 10 PM and I'd lost my entire day... There is up to around 3 servers with a respectable amount of people at any given time, so it's not hugely popular, but the sale is bringing in more and more people.ABOUT THE GAMEDifficulty- It's fairly confusing if you're new to real time strategies to play as the commander, but the tutorials are very helpful. As a troop it's fairly easy to pick up as it's basically counter strike or a newer call of duty game. Technically this fits in the category I guess- the bots are beyond stupid. Half of them just try to jump up to unreachable places until they are shot. This, however, is hilarious.Variation- The classes are amazing. You can't switch weapons like in call of duty, you use whatever ones come with your class. While some find this annoying, I think it levels out the game and makes it better. There are currently four types of troops with up to three or four classes for each. Changing even just a class can change how you play, or if your team wins or not. And if you get bored of just shooting people, apply to be the commander and play it like a tower defence.Level of fun- OOOVVEEEERRRRR 9000!!!!!!!!! (sorry not sorry ;D)Some other pros- There are people who use voice chat to be tactical, and awesome and stuff. I have so far only found one annoying person. The weapons as I said are balanced well. Most servers don't allow friendly fire, but it is an option.Overall this is an amazing game. How I've been describing it is as a super tactical version of counter strike (YOU CAN BE A FRIKKIN INVISIBLE NINJA) but that doesn't do it justice. Nuclear Dawn is so far my favorite FPS (I like being a drone not the leader personally). It's not just I shot Bob, Bob grenaded me, I knifed George, Jeff shot me... You can be a sneaky ninja, you can be an engineer and repair the buildings, you can flame thrower the crap out of people, you can snipe; you can use a rocket launcher, or a pistol; you can just be a soldier or you can lead an army.10/10 Wasted my whole day and many more to come.P.S. Devastator196 is brother so if you see him make sure you get a head shot on that fool. ;D			"

												When certain players join it makes my palms sweaty. Nuclear Dawn is multiplayer only comparable to Team Fortress with a commander who builds things. This does not play like Command and Conquer or Halo. It has similar aspect with Natural Selection if comparisons are being made.PROS: •Small community, most people know each other and are very welcoming to new people. Seriously, you can be part of a special cult. We have fabulous kool-aid.• Complex, even though this is my most played game in steam I still feel amateurish. Figuring out how to play against other commanders and player styles is it's own learning curve. • You don't have to be the best shot to have a measurable effect on the game. This game is best played when people understand the needs of the team and switch classes appropriately. • Simple to get into, you don't even need a tutorial to get started. CONS:• Small community, game is not always active. If you're new it may seem like a dead game. Best time is Weekends.• Requires patience, this game while easy to pick up takes to time to develop the game logic.• Leveling up system seems unnecessary when confronted with a server full of level 80s• Seemingly one server in which to play on. Ahem...Redstone and the permanent spectators.All that said, I love this game and will play it till the Apocalypse or probably until whoever owns the Redstone server decides to end it.			"

												This game is a combination between RTS (Commander) and FPS (Foot soldiers) that features two factions, multiple classes with multiple layouts which lead to different playstyles, leveling (upgrades), an incredible amount of huge maps with multiple layers and nice little details and many more features. For the commander it's a RTS. He can build stuff, e.g. walls to protect his comrades from bullets or turrets that support them on the battlefield.The goal for both teams is to secure points of interest that generate resources for the team and ultimately lead to the destruction of the enemy base.I could go on and on, but I know that nobody will ever read this, so ...I highly recommend this game. It's a shame I've never heard about this awesome game until a few weeks ago. It's one of the best Multiplayer/Tactical-FPS I've ever played, competiting only with Natural Selection 2 I guess.			"

												I was a little fooled by this... saw it in a humble bundle and then the ""RTS"" tag... thought i wanted to get myself a new RTS game...well turns out to be an FPS for me.I kinda like it, only actively played the Stealth class so far.Let's start of with stuff i don't really like:- Hit markers are somewhat off sometimes.  Shooting right on the body but no hit? seems legit.- Turrets... Turrets everywhere!- Rockets...grenades... ♥♥♥♥ my life!- Servers are...empty?!  i usually only se one server with a lot of people, the rest is emptyOn the good side:- Heavy siege battles- People don't trashtalk on ingame voice (at least i havent experienced that so far)- Good positioning (as sniper that is) gets rewarded - sniper shots usually don't oneshot (except for against snipers^^)  but can be set up fairly quickly and the stealth part gives you nice possibilities in duels			"

												A good mix of FPS and RTS, built on the Source engine. You get to play either as NATO like Consortium, or Warsaw pact like Empire (or blue team vs OpForce, as I like to call them). Game is really well balanced, with 4 different classes with different traits, and various different weapons and kits for each class.Community is great, once you get to know them, and there are weekly events to keep the servers busy. (join ND Battles for the WIN)Also, +1 for linux release.This is one of my favourite games, and I'm sure I'll be playing this in years to come.... until Nuclear Dawn 2 comes ;)			"

												There were very few games like ""Nuclear Dawn"" prior to its release; only the original ""Natural Selection"" and one (maybe two) other games fit in the same black sheep category of FPS/RTS. There was ample fun to be had in the game's myriad roles: you could sit in your team's bunker as the commander and spread buildings deliberately towards the enemy base in a game of chess, supplying and defending your pawns; you could play as the hulking siege, crushing the other team's build-out; you could suit up as the the equivalent of the heavy in ""Team Fortress 2"" to lock down valuable resource points; you could slip through enemy lines as the stealth, literally turning invisible until you were ready to stab sieges, snipers, or even commanders in the back; you could play as a support, healing teammates, repairing the commander's buildings, or wielding flamethrowers and gas grenades; or you could be an ""assault"" to hunt down spies with your thermal vision and protect all of the other classes around the map.Ultimately, the game wasn't just about kill-death ratios, the FPS's typical ""gold star"" award; it was about cooperating with a commander who linked power plants, relays, spawn points, and supply stations across the map to feed you ammo, while you grabbed and defended resource points to help him or her build these structures. Sometimes the matches were over in an instant, with expert commanders extending a few relays right to another commander's base while veteran players held down resource points. Other times, matches turned into classic trench warfare as expert teams clashed, or new players stumbled. Sometimes, commanders were demoted, either because they couldn't get the job done or their teammates didn't understand how to do the job for them. There was little room for goofing off, but plenty of room for brilliantly-executed plans.The game always suffered from a lack of buy-in; it was rare to find all of the servers filled to capacity, and tournament organization was difficult. However, this was counterbalanced by an incredibly close-knit community which simply had fun together, as well as working on mods and Steam Workshop additions. Even as the developer's support waned and server populations dwindled further, the community remained for some time. While the subsequently released ""Natural Selection 2"" was graphically astonishing, I found it to be incredibly demanding on my sub-par rig when it came out. This is still a plus over what some might consider previous-gen graphics in the case of ND, although the innovative gameplay more than made up for the graphical shortcomings. The gameplay styles in ND and NS2 were also incredibly different, with NS2 being incredibly fast-paced; the learning curve in NS2 was nearly impossible if, like me, you had no experience jumping into the game. Again, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing, just a difference. The units in ND's two different factions were somewhat unique, although some of these differences were not as big as they could have been - particularly when one looks at the ""aliens vs. marines"" dynamic of NS2.However, these comparisons aren't really fair. On it's own - and for its time - ND was a fantastic blast, and still could be. If you can still find a server to play on, it's absolutely worth a shot. For $10, it's not much of a risk at any rate, particularly if a sale happens along.			"

												Very short review this time, if I went for a longform review, it'd get heated and more biased than I personally wish to keep it.Pros:- Cool mechanics of either controlling the battlefield as an RTS commander in building buildings, researching a VERY tiny array of technologies and upgrades, and using strategy to outmaneuver the enemy commander, or by using tactics as an FPS soldier where your reflexes, aim and reaction skills are more important.- Nicely implemented point capture system where soldiers must capture points on the map to generate resources the Commander uses for literally everything.- Maps are very varied, and have a usually large area to play in, having plenty of side paths to flank the enemy with in a few maps.- Each class has a sub-class archetype, and you can unlock little boosts as you level up your account or classes which can further make your class more versatile, such as a shield at a high account level which ignores a shot but refreshes slowly, and more damage or ammo.Cons.- AI seems utterly barebones. Every single map usually has one or two ways one or two AI can get stuck on the environment. AI commonly get stuck in corners on their way to something, with no scripts to avoid getting stuck walking and then jumping into a corner. AI commonly get stuck inside buildings, and they then get literally stuck IN buildings while they're constructing.AI sometimes don't even fire at enemies, while the other team's AI is fast to start shooting at all enemy targets.AI almost never attacks buildings, if they do, 9/10 times they hit a building, they're shooting at an enemy soldier.- No way to instruct AI to be a specific arrangement of classes/subclasses in a player-empty multiplayer server.- AI Commanders aren't a thing, making singleplayer matches, or player-empty multiplayer games only you are in... pathetically easy to play as a commander.- The most I've seen in a single multiplayer server in the last couple of weeks, is only aronud 4-6 players. Out of around 10 servers, only one ever has players, not including two ""players"" whom are only just bots in spectate mode (I can only imagine).All problems with AI mean nothing in a full multiplayer game, however I'm certain that won't happen anymore.- AKA: Not enough people playing the game period.- Building placement is often arbitrary in every map. Sometimes you can't put buildings down in some open places, while you can put buildings inside of some level geometry, like walls, railings, and even poles.- Buildings like to teleport or randomly spawn on some servers or maps, placing inside other buildings, and sometimes even in walls of the level.OTher than those things, the game is fairly decent. It literally just needs more players to play more often.Note: I do realize that it is Summer, but my points still stand either way. Those who play video games, will play them still. The fact that they work, or go to school, doesn't really influence it all that much, not really IMO.As it stands, the game is sort of dead. There are atleast 4 daily players, but still. This is a game designed for full 32 player games, and I've never seen that happen in this game in the entire time I've played it.I still recommend this game however, as... if more people own the game and play it consistently, then honestly the game is a total and complete blast.

												It's unfortunate to see Nuclear Dawn suffer from simple errors, as underneath these flaws is an above-average game with some new, interesting ideas at its core. If you're playing with friends or get lucky with a random server, it can be a lot of fun - but often that's not the case and as a result Nuclear Dawn doesn't quite earn the recommendation it's otherwise capable of receiving.It could do with a practice mode or some proper tutorials to introduce newcomers to the commander mode, but if you're up for a challenge or find a decent server, Nuclear Dawn is an exciting take on a genre that's usually lacking new ideas.Nuclear Dawn is a game that can reach great things if it was put together more coherently.

I can only ever find games that are so one-sided (despite the lobbies being tagged ""Rookie Friendly""), that the true essence of the game is lost. I end up just playing the Skirmish mode against bots (that ""more CoD than CoD"" game mode), at least then I know what's going on and can play for more than ten seconds at a time (it's not even a ""git gud"" matter, I don't think).BRING LIFE BACK TO THIS GAME!!

												Fantastic game! I would have never thought of buying a game like this until I played it. I'm not in to FPS very much and this game is amazing. When I saw FPS/RTS I expected it to be like the commander missions in CoD Black Ops II but after playing it, I feel ashamed that I compared such an amazing game to a piece of garbage like CoD. Now for a more thorough review. PROS:♦ Team based combat. None of that I-have-a-better-gun-so-I-win bull. This game takes strategy from all levels. Not just the commander but from the infantry as well.♦ The classes are fairly even. Obviously people are going to be more skillful than others at classes, but the classes have a great way of creating a ""checks and balance"" system. The Assault class is good versus stealth, but not against Exo's. Stealth is good against Exo's but not against Assault's, and Exo's are good against Assault's but not against Stealth. (I haven't figured out where Support goes but I believe they are kind of at a disadvantage with combat due to their huge advantage at team help.)♦ For those who actually care, graphics aren't too bad. The buildings that are placed in commander mode have nice animations of being built and don't just appear.♦ Commander mode is something that is required. You are likely to fail if you do not have a decent commander or no commander at all. I hate FPS's that are filled with people who want fast-paced combat, since I'm more of a stratigizing thinker. Though this is more of an opinion than factual, I thought it'd be worth noting.CONS:♦ The tutorial mission's are slightly glitchy. You still get the basics you need but you don't always go more in depth.♦ The multiplayer is mostly dead. I would love to start up some games though if anyone is interested!♦ Offline mode isn't challenging after a while since bots will not become commanders. Makes it almost uninteresting. Though it is a good way to get a feel for both the game and the maps.I hope you found this helpful. If you do end up purchasing this game, shoot me a message and maybe we could play a game!			"

												I've put a lot of hours in this game and it surprises me that I still enjoy every mach I play and every hour I put into this game. Yes, there are some minor problems, like that there are only players on specific hours of the day. But once you know when your friend are on, It's always a pleasure to play.What really blows my mind is that InterWave studios did a really good job on combining fps and rts in one cheap package. This game is underrated and should be played by way more people.Please, to anyone who reads this, buy this piece of art. 10/10And I will see you soon, on the battlefield.			"

												Imagine TF2, but instead of cartoony and funny it is serious and set in a post apocalyptic universe. Teamwork is very important in this game as the flow of the game chages as well as the current objectives change too (such as defend this area, capture this resourse point etc). Probably more teamwork is involved in this game than tf2, but if you really feel like it you can just run around and kill people like other FPS games. It also has the commander role, the one person who builds all the buildings for your team and plays on an overview map. The commander role ist like playing a RTS but all the units are actual players. It is the unique blend of FPS and RTS that make this game just a blast to play and every time you play it is different than the last. It is a very unique and fun game that I highly reccomend.			"

												I have to say it saddens me to see a very small player base in such a magnificent game. The hybrid RTS/FPS style of the game is truly unique and its major selling point. The classes are quite balanced and you are forced to switch to a team composition according to changing RTS conditions. Although there is a limited amount of maps, this is a good thing. Every game is unique because every commander has a personal approach as to how expand his base, and intimate map knowledge is required to counter the strategy of the commander.+ Commander and FPS equally satisfying and really merged with each other in a smooth gameplay experience.+ Classes balanced and designed to be able to respond to changing tactical needs.+ Game doesn’t grow stale because of good level design and the way the commanders fill the maps.  +/- [updated: as of april 2016] there are still consistently one to two full servers, depending on prime time (I always had a game to play)- This is a call for increasing the player base. Reviewers can moan that this game is a dead horse, but I do not concur. Even if you don't want to take the 10 euro risk, buy it as soon as it is on sale, because your missing out on a great experience!o7			"

												An excellent hybrid of a first person shooter and a real time strategy. I remember receiving this game as a gift back in 2012 and not expecting much of it, when I got in game with a couple of friends I was pretty impressed. Pretty nice map design and 4 different classes to choose from. It's a game that encourages teamwork and it all works in a simple manner that feels very enjoyable. It's a shame that playing offline is quite obviously not one of the game's strong points, since the A.I. is weak. If you're able to grab some friends and play it for a nice amount of time it is a fabulous game to pass the time. 7.7/10.0 "

It is also important to comunicate and to work in groups because this game is no ""Counter-Strike"" where you just shoot poeple.This game is mainly baesed and strategy and you need a good commander to win a round.

												Bought this game awhile ago and for whatever reason, never played until now.A brief summary of the game is it's like a mixture of Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike with a RTS elemet mixed in as well. Pros  Unique game style, RTS/FPS combo. Easy learning curve. Exciting and engaging gameplay. Good RTS mechanics. Fun, balanced classes. Diverse and interesting maps. Cons  Extremely small playerbase. Maximum number I've seen online at once was 14. Bots aren't very smart.  They run into walls or directly into turrets because they have direct and predictable paths.  Also when telling them to capture a point they just cluster on the spot you clicked and don't capture the point. Camera as the commander during the topdown RTS view is kinda derpy.  going over buildings causes to camera to go completely black instead of just zooming out. Rocket turrets are OPOverall this game is really good but the thing that kills it is the playerbase.  Very few people, for whatever reason, play this game so the game fills the positions with Bots who are predicatble and buggy.  They are a few other annoying things but that's the main issue.  If the game had a bigger playerbase it would be great but until then you just have to deal with Bots constantly running into turrets.			"

Nuclear Dawn is a good game, is a FPS and RTS Hybrid just like Natural Selection, and Empires mod, this game really relies on the commender and the team,The gameplay is a bit clunky, because that's how source games are,The main point of this game is the commender, as a commender you can give orders to your team and build bases, building bases helps your team, such as giving ammo and building spawn base to help them push on to the enemies base, as for ground squads there four classes to choose from, and you can customize your weapon gear, some gear has effects on your weapon, Overall it's a good game i highly recommend this game :)			"

												Ignore all these folks saying that this game is dead. It's seen darker days yeah but the game's getting a steady stream of players back again. Not in the ammounts of a AAA game title but enough to fill a server every so often.Pros:Fast paced FPS/RTS hybrid: You'll always have something to do as a footsoldier and a commander no matter what.Easy to adapt: You'll get used to the methods and strats fairly quickly so you'll know what to do within a few hours of playing.No two game is the same: Buildings can be placed in a varible places that'll deter your team's victory/defeat.Non repetitive: You won't be doing the same thing over and over even though your objective states otherwise, opposing players will be adapting to the situations you put them in which means you'll be doing the same.Cons:The better Gizmos are unlocked at higher levels which means you'll be at a disadvantage for the first few hours of gameplay but going supportive classes and rushing primary buildings as a sieger will fix that in no time.The tutorial is broken btw, look up how to spawn items for it.Stacking is common problem in most servers and it will tend to lead to defeat but by jingo it feels good when you kick them back in their place.As for the cheater problem in all my hours of playing I've only seen one and they were gone within minutes.TL:DR Amazing game, commuinity is slowly growing again, a few set backs when you first load in but with a few hours of patience you'll be kicking asses and taking resource points (well you better be PTFO or your commander will be shoving his/her foot up your rear end)I'll be waiting for you in the front lines recruit.

												When I first bought this game I thought it was RTS mixed in with FPS... meaning you could go from a RTS view point to being a single guy as an FPS view... again wasn't it but slightly similar. There is one designated commander (RTS) player while the rest have to take the role as infantry (FPS). If you've played natural selection, it's slightly similar to this. You start a game needing to be either a commander or a player (the nice thing about this game that yes you can play against the computer). The commander builds outposts to either provide more weapons, turrets, armory, health and upgrade stations. The players themselves attack and attempt to move forward and gain tactical advantage. The FPS portion of the game is actually quite fluid and visually appealing. I also have to give it to them, they put grenades into the game! Any game that does this I have to give them props. Having more options as a gamer is always welcomed, but the basic of a gun and a grenade I believe in a necessity. Zooming in is also possible with most weapons. Although being a good FPS player will advance most of your team, if the other team has a damn good commander, you may be out of luck. A strong commander is definitely needed for a victory. I should also mention there are different classes to choose from such as stealth assassin or sniper, assault marksmen, riflemen, and grenadier, support engineer, medic or BBQ (I'll leave this for you to explore), and exos which are almost like a super class. The visuals from and FPS and even an RTS stand point is rock solid. Although the game is not that old, it's buffering abilities and graphics on either view is still phenomenal. From an RTS stand point, everything is nicely laid out and easy to manage. There is a grid view system in place to help the commander put buildings in place. HUD on either perspective/view is really easy on the eyes and are another fluid design in my opinion. Passing by these buildings that are being put up in FPS mode is absolutely a beautiful design. Sounds are neat and although not extremely diverse, you won't be hearing the same boom's or gun shots over and over. I will give it a high rating as it attempts to be a hybrid and pushes the gaming genre boundaries.RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B- "

												It's pretty cool to play with an experienced team and commander. So make sure to find a team or clan for you. Sometimes you can get angry because your team play badly and you constanly die trying to win. In such moments you need to relax and don't try to win, find a spot where you can hide and  destroy structures or kill enemies. Even in a situation when your team will surely loose you can have much fun killing enemy Heavies (EXOs) with armblades (invisible guy) or sniper rifle. I'm not a good RTS player, so it's hard for me to be a commander. Besides maps are very complex and detailed, there are so many pathes and ways to build in every map that I get lost. RTS gamers will probably be interested in playing as a commander, but for me it's hard. It's also inconvenient for me to use RTS camera, I can't see what's happening on the map. Updated 2014.12.03The game has some issues which make it less fun to play: - performance problems. Frame rate drops significantly (from 100+ fps to 25 fps)  when there are 32 players and lots of structures on map. - sounds bugs. when looping sounds are bugged. for each looped sound there are 3 sounds playing, and even if structure is removed the sound remains. Can be worked around by deleting looped sounds from game's installation - misc little bugs here and there. Like structure teleportation, server crashes etc- Stuckable points. You can stuck in static props and buildings. - The annoying sound when hit by explosion. Can't be turned off. And it can sometimes become permanent. snd_restart removes permanent- Annoying effects of blood all over the screen when took damage. Can't be turned off. - The FPS part is generally not very fun. I think it's because they wanted to make it Call of Duty(COD) like but added too much HP for most classes. So in COD you have fun killing enemies with 2 bullets, but here you have to use 2 mags. E.g. EXO needs 7 head shots to be killed. For me the most annoying thing is the frame rate drops.In spite of these drawbacks this game is currently the best FPS+RTS game on the market as for me.			"

												Play as a hardcore veteran military commander sitting in a bunker that is easily accessible to anyone with feet and command people who will not listen to you to do things of little relevance. Capture points yourself in FPS mode by going out into the field because your team will not listen to your commands. Blaze your way to victory in a fight of unparalleled patience as you encourage other people to try commanding because for the love of god you just want to play the FPS side for a while. Destroy your enemies with such intimidating weaponry as the repair tool, the daisy cutter and the fearsome portable radar.11/10 would have fun making a final, incredible stand before losing due to incompetent teams again and again and again - the fun just keeps on coming and god I don't know why this game has infinite replay valueDon't miss out!

												This game combines a solid FPS shooter with great RTS mechanics. There's one RTS commander which is either naturally endowed with leadership or elected by other players, who can fight alongside teamates to take resource points or hop in the command bunker to use the accumulated resources to build new power infrastructure, spawn points, weapon upgrades, and turrets.There are four FPS classes each having 3 different configurations, making teamplay imperative for the FPS squads. The gunplay feels good and the combat would be satisfying even without the tactical level of the game.The gameplay has a problem with not explaining how important it is to have anti-material munitions to new players, and the user interface for the commander mode is very difficult to use. These drawbacks go away with experience.The only thing I don't like after playing this game is the fact that the community is so small. I loved this game after it first went on sale and there were multiple servers with people of proper skill levels. I'm recommending the game for its gameplay and design - the good times were some of the best multiplayer I've ever had, so I hope the community rallies behind this game again someday.			"

												High recommended. Solid FPS and RTS elements, with a lower learning curve than say NS2 (which is also great). The lower learning curve DOES NOT mean that it is easy to win or dumbed down in anyway. If anything there are more options to choose from (each of the four classes has three different specialisations (Exo/Heavy has two), with unique abilities & tools to choose from), which complement different strategies well. There is also a degree of persistent levelling which allow new gadgets/'perks' to be unlocked as players progress. Maps are pretty big with different play styles associated with each (some of CQB heavy, others more open sniper maps), all of which still require considerable team work in order to succeed. Given Nuclear Dawn is built on the Source engine, the graphics are great and really add to the feel of battling it out in a post apocolyptic environment, with many buildings being able to be entered.If you're looking for something different from the faster paced CS / BF / CoD one-man-army bullet fest, with a bit more strategic depth and a great community to boot, I would highly recommend Nuclear Dawn. One of the best games I've played in a while.			"

												I don't undertstand how 85 people have reviewed this game but whenever I go and play there is between 0 and 10 people playing?! I love this game! I suck at being a Commander and playing it as an RTS but it's done so well! Blending in two distinct genres, RTS and FPS, is hard thing to do, and Nuclear Dawn accomplished it! You actually have to work as a team to win and if you just go off on your own it's not worth anything. You actually have to think as a team about what to do next and what positions to hold, as well as what the Commander tells you to do. I wish more people played this game so that it would actually get more recognition it deserves and continues to be updated with more content. When trading cards were added I was hopeful that that may kickstart the game again, but that didn't seem to happen. I would like to see this up and runnign with more player again. Also just a side note, I found the community has been great, more friendly than others, and more ""mature"" players is how I'd describe it I guess. 7.5/10			"

												This game is AWESOME! I had to restrain myself from using curse words there...but this game is really awesome. You are either a commander, which plays like, say...star wars empire at war? I'm not well versed in poular video games...Basically you decide what to build, and where. Or you are the guys on the field, like any other shooter. You can go do incredible things as a field guy...I almost don't want to ruin it. There are all kinds of classes etc. Each have a really cool power. I mean, you can probably guess that the stealth class can go invisible...it's not like video games have made revolutionary breakthroughs in the last, decade...*sob*Anyway, the changes the commander makes appear on the battlefield in front of your eyes, you've got turrets...teleport stations...I kind of wish they had helicopter/air support...meh whatever, the game is awesome as is. It's really close to being as awesome as CoD Modern, it's just going to take more thinking and planning, along the lines of Arma. The downside is no one plays. So sad. I think it's because they stopped developing the game. Why? Who knows? It's really awesome. So come play, get in on the ground floor man! It's TOTALLY worth 10 bucks "

												An excellent combo of RTS and FPS. The foot-soldiers use a great rock-paper-scissors-support structure that can be escaped with skill, and the RTS portion feels slower than a standard RTS, but has the same tension as you have to direct people where to go. Has some minor bugs, but overall a great game. Sometimes suffers from low player count.9/10			"

												Where to start with this one...Maybe let's take a look at the engine. Source engine means serious work. Using the L4D2/Portal 2 branch, graphics and such are up there.Gameplay, very different. While you have real humans fighting it out on the battlefield, you can sit in your seat and place structures in a RTS environment. Maybe you will even experience the pain of someone stabbing you in the back when you sit in the command structure. Yes, it does happen often.Shame the funding and support started to dry up, this game will always be one that I can't turn down to someone. The title has sort of ""come and gone"" so to say. But here I am, going to give it a rating. There's no real purpose in playing unless you can find servers that aren't full (3 or so) and don't have bots.7/10 "

												Oh lord, I do love this game. It's a bit of a shame, on account of the fact that it never really took off, and finding a sever with even 10 people is nothing short of a christmas miracle. But if you can find one (usually happens on odd times during the weekends) this game is an absolute joy to play. Different classes (which owe quite  bit to TF2,) a fun light-dystopian scifi, and some pretty fantastic maps really make this one a keeper. Planetside never really rang my bell, and NS2 is just too hardware intense for my machine (not to mention I'm not as fond of the asymmetry of it.)Love it. Can't recommend it enough. Worth buying on the next sale (if there is ever another one) and getting enough copies for your friends.			"

												This is an excellent and under-rated game! I wish this would be ported to Linux. It runs flawlessly in my Linux under WINE but I'd prefer it running natively.This is a game that is maybe similar to Unreal Tournament when you must hold flags. Graphics are very smooth and the game has one added dimension. One player can act as the commanded and build defense items from a top-down view. So cross UT with Supreme Commander and that's your game. Excellent!			"

												You can go and take the Assault class to capture minor objectives in a run & gun fashion and a few minutes later you save a comrades life with the Med Kit of the support class. Moments later you sit as a sniper at the edge of the battlefield securing the area or you break up the defensive lines of your enemies as a human tank. Though it takes a few hours, until you understand what is happening on the battlefield and how you can support your team the game keeps getting better and it's worth the effort.

												I love this game!  I've never played anything like it.  A very fun mixture of FPS and RTS.  Two commanders handle the RTS part, the rest play FPS, however, it is up to the FPS players to defend and repair the assets that the commander deploys for them as they work their way to the enemy base.Attacking players can tactically and strategically decide which assets to take out first:  Power relay, turrets, spawn points, supply stations.  In addition to destoying enemy assets and defending your own, you must fight over resource points.The infiltrator has a cloak, and there's lots of fun to be had there.  The backstab is very rewarding, and you can also cloak to the enemy base and assassinate the commanderr in his bunker, and then hang out on the base and delay his commander efforts.Each class has a special ability, and each primary weapon choice alters your secondary gear as well.  Each major weapon can utilize a Gizmo, which enhances the weapon.  If you like challenges, this game requires a lot of play time to work up the ranks and unlock various enhancements.Lots of fun to be had here with a unique experience.  Don't miss out!  You definitely want to be able to say you played this one, and if you're a developer, you can use this for inspiration to make a new game in this genre.			"

												Great cooperative game. Ingame you have the option to choose your class and specialization(infantry ,stealth,heavy,support each with 3 specializations), and a squad to belong to. The grand strategic decisions are made by a commander, who usuallly pings the area to attack and builds+researches to unlock extra turrets or specializations. A good commander can change the tide of battle very quickly. All in all, a highly underrated game, great fun if you land in a  player populated server.			"

												Nuclear Dawn did combine FPS and RTS seamlessly, but...something's missing...The game is pretty cool with the ability to switch from being in the heat of the fight to watching events unfold, but it seems like  the one person who has the ability to use the RTS part of the game in each match is just going to spam defenses. As is expected, it is difficult to force people to work together in the field, because everyone will just run and gun.For me, matches seemed to drag on and not really go anywhere until I fortified the whole map, and my guys just had to run into the enemy base shooting. It's a good idea for a game, but players need more motivation to collaborate.			"

												I will keep this one short. Nuclear Dawn is RTS/FPS mixture, similar to: Natural Selection 2, Savage 2:Tortured Souls. Regarding graphics/sound game is made using source engine therefore you will not find flaws there.On the other hand gameplay has much space for improvement:If you plan playing this game as commander, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. Reason is simple, commander gameplay is boring for following reasons: 1. You main job is to build structures and repair, which requires resources. 2. You can affect other players by using powers which are limited and expensive (heal, poison, pure dmg, place barricades which are useless), or by using turrets/artillery which is also expensive. From my experience commanding is building, begging players to cap/defend/attack and if that goes well you push your base forward until you zerg enemies base with turrets (missile and close range-sonic/fire) which can be done only if u control almost all resources on map and that is usually the finishing move. Chances of you being comm are low, and if players or you ""suck"" that game round is waste of time. Like NS2 and S2TS commander heavily depends on FPS players and is pointless to play game in that mode. If the genre would introduce diff design like: comm making BOT AI soldiers which can be possessed by FPS players, comm could instruct BOT AI to follow his orders, and FPS players could have the role of ""Heroes"", either it is just my humble opinion.Gameplay as FPS player is quite fun. You have many classes/subclasses, and if you combine your gameplay with other players you are in for a fun ride. If you plan on going solo around the map, you could do that with stealth class but that would be a downfall with low player count match. Game round from FPS perspective is: spawn, capture resource points, die defending it, respawn. Beg commander to place new spawn gates closer to fighting area. Regarding FPS aspect of game I RECOMMEND IT.As the game launched it was big hit. At the moment of writing this review there are 4 servers active, 2 in NA and 2 in Europe. Game still has some players playing, but not as nearly as much as it had at launch date. Many clans have left ND (like TAW), and if you are new player you will mostly play against hard core veterans (lvl 80). I myself am 74th level, Level diff won't affect gameplay. All that matters is your skill and knowledge, luck and good teammates.All in all it was a fun game, still is. If you are willing to give it a chance try it you are welcome to increase playerbase :D.			"

												Nuclear Dawn totally reminds me of Battlefield (classic-ol) 2, without the annoying OP vehicles (teleporters that the commander puts down are served to get around the map instead). Probably only gripe I have with it is that there are  only a few maps, and I kinda wish the devs update this game with more maps. Maybe something that isn't so Industrial? Maybe it could be light-hearted and futuristic? It still has that brown and gray color scheme in there unfortunately.Overall, I found this game fun and EASIER to grasp with than Natural Selection 2 (Almost no one wants to play as aliens anyway).

												What I love, the fast pace action that seems like it will never stop, matches last for a good bit. What I hate, some matches it seriously takes FOREVER for someone to play as the Commander. Other than that, this game makes me feel like I did some trippy acid and then put call of duty and halo together with some RTS and played it. BRAIN MELTER. Fun though.			"

												Fun RTS/FPS hybrid - think of it like Natural Selection mixed with Battlefield.Nuclear Dawn really feels well polished, and there's a lot of cool weapons, classes, and play-styles to keep you occupied. Not only that, but the workshop support means there's lots more maps to play and even some singleplayer-built maps.It's a really cool game for fans of both RTS and FPS. Even if you're still not so good at RTS play, this game is still great perfectly fun to play as a FPS soldier. This makes the game very noob-friendly.Although the game has reduced community numbers, you can usually find a populated server. Even then, if you can't find a server, the game has offline play modes and working bots/AI as well as a lot of singleplayer maps available on the workshop. This gives it a lot of value even now.			"

Like Interstellar Marines, but with more classes...BUT with the Commander feature from Natural Selection 2 added.Here's the thing, this game is actually fun if you manage to join on a day/time** that there's an active server with 16+ players. I love trying the different classes & I found the community to be nice so far, from what I've experienced.Every class has a special ability that you use with the 'f' key. And within each class you pick 1 of 3 specializations (although some have to be unlocked through leveling before you can pick them.)And within each specialization, you pick a 'gizmo' (attachment). Still not sure how you unlock all these, but I assume it's through research. (Research: assuming this means for each match, you only have access to what your team/commander is able to research)edit: Originally posted by balek jae: ...The gizmos are unlocked by leveling up. There are also class specific levels and gizmos. Anyway, I'd pick this game up on sale if you see it for $5 or less. I got mine in a bundle & was pleasantly surprised at how unique and tactical this FPS is. also, it has bots, so you don't have to wait forever for players to join. :)- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**I usually hop on on the weekends, evening time (EST time zone) & I always find one active server with at least 4 players (remember there's always bots to fill out the teams), so I'm pretty happy about that.edit1 [02-29-2016]: added the footnote just above :P just for your informational goodness.

There is so much potential here. Edit: The game has advanced since I wrote this review. I am learning more and am seeing tactics that are still new to some. The game is evolving as the players become more creative. 8/10 For the $2.79 you pay now, the game will pay for itself in the first few matches. Some aspects that were fixed, graphics for various items, sale of flame and sonic turret, and a few other adjustments.			"

												This is probably one of my most favorite games on steam. Two teams, and each team has a player controlled captain that can place buildings such as turrets, supplies, teleporters, flamethrowers, and need to have power supplies. The captain has to aid his teammates to help concuer the whole map. Even though there is only 4 classes with a small choice in weapons and upgrades, it has tons of playing styles to choose from. This game provides non-stop entertainment, and can have games that last a whole hour. I highly suggest this game to anyone, even if you don't prefer FPS.			"

												The closest game i can compare ""Nuclear Dawn"" to it is a mixture of battlefield, halo, and planetside 2. Nuclear Dawn is a post-apocalyptic first-person shooter real-time strategy hybrid video game. It was originally announced in February 2006 as an amateur mod for the Source engine, but in April 2009 was revealed to have become a commercial project, still using Source, aimed at Windows PCs and Mac OS X. It was released on September 26, 2011. Nuclear Dawn is a nice collection for your fun and for your library.			"

												The game is great, however, there are some things that need to be worked on and content to be added.i.e : A customizable loadout, there are 'kits' that provide different types of weapons and special items that can be used, but at times it's just better to have a custom loadout, or the select weapons you get are very undesirable.The offline practice only sets up the number of matches you play, the map, and the time limit. There is no AI configuration. Therefore, the AI can instantly aim at you and have pinpoint accuracy while being dumb at times.Online Matchmaking could be fun and great, if the game had a community. That's one of the low parts of this game, there is barely anyone on. At most I've seen is 3 - 7 but I've also had friends come on and we play this together.I wouldn't recommend the game if it wasn't fun. It only needs a few updates to add more options and a bigger community. "

												Excellent game! A currently small but active community of players. There are always people on line when I log in after work in the evenings. If RTS/FPS blends interest you at all, pick this one up. Sitting in the commanders chair, leading your team through the big picture, giving them the at-location support they need to overwhelm the enemy lines... Or securing resources for your commander to use, gunning down opposing exos to keep your structures safe, or protecting your own exos from snipers and assassins, this game delivers on both aspects.Definitely not a k/d focused game at all. Great if you want a good cooperative experience. Veterans are usually very willing to teach and give feedback to rookie commanders, and make suggestions for improving your play as any class on the ground.There a few bugs, but nothing too severe in my experience. I can't say enough good things about this game. BUY IT! Right meow!			"

												Do you like Natural Selection? Alien Swarm? Counter-Strike? Team Fortress Classic? Hogging the commander seat to help push your team forward? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then get this game as it takes a bit from each and mashes it into a great RTS (for two commanders) and well balanced FPS for everyone else.UPDATE! - While this game WAS much fun, it's best to avoid now as elements in the community destroyed it and the developers have effectively abandoned it. There are only a handful of servers left with some games happening, but the community is so small that it's probably not worth the effort unless someone else picks up development.Given that it's multiplayer-only, unless you pay less than it costs for a single beer you're wasting your money on a game that won't play for you.

												Fun RTS/FPS team conquest multiplayer game where controlling resources and defending territory is key - the unlocks you acquire as you rank up will keep you coming back for more.  All of the classes can balance each other out, but only if they are used to their fullest potential.  Without a good commander, a team's fate is determined.One caveat however:  the game suffers from a small-ish fan base.  Mind you, you'll often find at least 1 server that is full or nearly full every night.  During other times, you may have to go to out-of-country servers where your ping may be a bit high (still playable for the most part)			"

												Some people say that this FPS (with a tactical RTS element for one player per side) has no story. So I've added my own story and it's true, storyline makes a huge difference. Since I added a story, this game has become much more fun. If you find you need a storyline for this game, feel free to use mine. Here is the story: The red side hates the blue side, because the blue side wins at everything. This war has no end in sight, because red will never give up until they win, but blue refuses to lose. With each loss, red gets a little better and the next battle is a little closer... Will red ever win?This story has added hours of replay value to my game. Gameplay:Each side has four classes, each with 2 or more weapon loadouts -Stealth: hides so he can shank, sabotage or snipe you. Huh, all ""S"" for stealth.-Exo/Heavy/Demo: a tank with legs, he fire missiles or rivers of bullets.-Vanilla: He's great at running, so he can get to the combat and die faster.-The Handyman: Part doctor, part mechanic, he can probably resurrect your dog too. Also has the BBQ mode, where he wields a flamethrower.Commanders:Each side has a commander and this is what sets this apart from other games of this type. The commander manages all the RTS elements. He must build spawn points, power stations, resupply points, artillery and of course, turrets. Lots and lots of turrets. Heavies will kill them, stealth will slip past and handymen fix yours while vanilla runs around and gets eaten. To counter this, the commander can build a special station that allows them three godlike powers. The smiting power, where enemies within a small circle all die, a circle of life power, where your minions heal within a small circle and the ""I'll help you out"" power, where enemies are poisoned within a small circle. They don't die, they're just weaker for your minions to kill.Overall, great game. I'd buy it for $15.			"

												ONLY RECOMMENDING THIS GAME IF YOU CAN HAVE OTHER PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH.REST OF REVIEW IS CONDEMNING IT FOR LACK OF PLAYERS (CONS)with a tiny bit of good (pros) at the endlike any other online multiplayer based game, it all comes down to if theres actually people playing.I rarely find people on this game anymore.  it's come and gone like the old greats of its timebattlefield 2142 :*(  and basically any other online shooter as well.Ever heard of Orion:Prelude?  probably have.  it's not as refined a shooter in comparison to this game.But it has lasted a number of years as well.  It gives you the most bang for literally, your buck. ($0.99 us, and sometimes on sale for even less!)  Whereas this game is always on sale once in a while for $2.49.  almost the price of a 4 pack of several other, maybe not as great, but at least populated games.I highly recommend this game if you and 1000 other people suddenly decide to purchase this game.If it's just you?  maybe purchase it on a sale day, and hope theres actually people still playing this lovely gem of a game.if you're lucky, and it's on sale?  look up nuclear dawn multiplayer servers. hopefully it'll give you results of 1-10 servers active with 1-20 people on them.  Because, like a dead horse, and our ancestors. this game is as good as dead.ok. bad stuff aside. gameplay? great! class stuffs? awesome! maps? a bit of variety!in game tutorial? an actually useful one!

												This Game doesn't have enough attention it is a very good core game! there are however alot of things wrong with this game dont get me wrong i like this game and recommend it but i cant say that it is perfect. this Game is a FPS-RTS Hybrid it combines the elements of both genres really well there is one commander per team who directs up to 32 soldiers and builds buildings, turrets and researches upgrades. there are four main classes each with subclasses each sharing a class ability with different loadouts to adapt to different situations. the soldiers main job is to destroy the enemy base and capture recource nodes. and thats the jist of it.Now onto the negatives;one class is completely useless and that is the sabatour class he gets 3 c4 like explosives that do almost no damage to structers in fact the only class that can destroy/damage any buildings is the exo class with the rocket launcher. and even then it takes a bunch of them to do it quickly and by quicly i mean in a minute or two. so unless you have a squad of 32 players that follow the commanders orders you are doomed to have an hour long game. the weapons of the game are so varied you cant pick wich is worse form ultra recoil from assault rifles to the jittery sniper rifles to the bug zapping bazooka and of course the ultra sniping godly pistol. all the weapons feel and sound horrible and are broken.But now for the positives;the two teams have different unit models and different buildings and building trees so it adds a diverse feel to the game this is one of the reasons i recommend it. the empire have long range power relays but they need line of sight where as the consortion have wireless but shorter range that require no line of sight.the models of soldiers are really good and different depending on what side your are on and you can easily tell them apart from a distance. and the classes are played like a game of rock paper scissors. assualt beats scout. scout beats exo and exo beats assualt. engineer is support.all in all i give this game a 7/10 this game is good despite the problems with it.

												Some people say that this FPS (with a tactical RTS element for one player per side) has no story. So I've added my own story and it's true, storyline makes a huge difference. Since I added a story, this game has become much more fun. If you find you need a storyline for this game, feel free to use mine. Here is the story: The red side hates the blue side, because the blue side wins at everything. This war has no end in sight, because red will never give up until they win, but blue refuses to lose. With each loss, red gets a little better and the next battle is a little closer... Will red ever win?This story has added hours of replay value to my game. Gameplay:Each side has four classes, each with 2 or more weapon loadouts -Stealth: hides so he can shank, sabotage or snipe you. Huh, all ""S"" for stealth.-Exo/Heavy/Demo: a tank with legs, he fire missiles or rivers of bullets.-Vanilla: He's great at running, so he can get to the combat and die faster.-The Handyman: Part doctor, part mechanic, he can probably resurrect your dog too. Also has the BBQ mode, where he wields a flamethrower.Commanders:Each side has a commander and this is what sets this apart from other games of this type. The commander manages all the RTS elements. He must build spawn points, power stations, resupply points, artillery and of course, turrets. Lots and lots of turrets. Heavies will kill them, stealth will slip past and handymen fix yours while vanilla runs around and gets eaten. To counter this, the commander can build a special station that allows them three godlike powers. The smiting power, where enemies within a small circle all die, a circle of life power, where your minions heal within a small circle and the ""I'll help you out"" power, where enemies are poisoned within a small circle. They don't die, they're just weaker for your minions to kill.Overall, great game. I'd buy it for $15.			"

												I got this game for like $3 dollars on sale and all I can say is that it has been the best $3 I have spent in a game. The game keeps you entertained for hours and hours and I love the concept of been able to command a team to win a game using the RTS mode. Also you can play in FPS mode and is well balanced and well thought, from weapons, abilities and classes. I only wish more people played this game since recently most servers are empty (5-8 players). Playing against bots can be fun and challenging but it doens't compares when playing against humans. Theres some people complaining that only one person can command at a time but that will not keep you from commanding on the next game, theres also a system where you can vote to remove the current commander in case he isn't doing good and be the new command. In any case YES!!! I will recommend this game.			"

												This is easily the most involved multiplayer shooter I've ever played. You're never simply running around just killing people; winning requires some of the most intricate teamwork and strategy I've ever seen in a videogame. The entire premise of the game is just so well designed that my words can't do justice to it. The commander position provides RTS fans with a whole different dimension of play and a chance to put their strategic skills to the test with real players as their army, the classes have good balance, the maps are interesting and complex enough to facilitate efficient use of all gameplay elements and weapons, and not to mention, the art direction is superb.I was completely blown away when I decided to give this game a chance, and I'm hard-pressed to find anything wrong with it (barring some things which they've already fixed). If you're big on real-time strategy or love team-oriented shooters, Nuclear Dawn is a must-have.			"

												Ok so Nuclear Dawn is a great game, hours of fun, got a fanbase that will most likely maintain. This game is a RTS/FPS with the game being FPS and RTS being the commander. It is multiplayer only but thats why its a cheap budget so its a good price for hours of fun.The Gameplay is very good and is a lot of fun but there are still bugs for everything, while the music is awesome, I gotta admit it is fun, you can make bases only if your commander, and all that. The graphics and this game maxed out has audio being the best while it looks so good, not good as BF3 but very good for a team that has only made one game and is a modding team. There are a few bugs but the team Interwave are working very good on fixing those bugs, they are releasing patches every fort night with a long list.Pros:- Very addictive and hours of fun- Great Supporting Development Team- Friendly People- Its just good lol no more to explainCons:- A bit to many bugs for the release9/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												Nuclear Dawn is a fun little FPS that reminds me immediately of games like Timesplitters, TF2, Dirty Bomb, Insurgency, and ESPECIALLY Unreal Tournament. It's a class-based shooter with various abilities available as you level up your character. There are initially four different classes, and each team has a Commander (with various upgrades including armor, ammo, etc). Each class has three drastically different loadout sets with various weapons in each one. This is where the TF2 influence shines clear through. I mentioned Unreal Tournament, as well. Unreal Tournament is one of the most well-respected shooters released, and when I compare this game to it, I feel the need to explain myself. The pacing of both games is identical, with a mad dash to objectives resulting in very short life spans with quick spawn times. This allows you to filter in and out of combat with ease, allowing for you to change classes or weapons as needed during combat. Really fun game in segments, but if it has a weakness, it would be in map structure. Nothing really sticks out in any of the maps, and they mostly seem to be several small rooms loosely connected to eachother, for the most part. Granted, this can be said of most multiplayer FPS games. Regardless, I don't think it's enough of a weakness to merit a poor review, so I'll say wait for a sale, or grab it right now in the Humble Bundle (Feb 25th, 2016)!			"

												9/10 This is a really fun game. As soon as I mstarted playing I felt that this was a great game. It is a nice casual shooter, easy to pick up, has a great balance combination of an FPS and RTS, and has a role for every play-style. The game is faily banaced and each round is unique. Playing both the commander and infantry roles are a lotr of fun, and they act as almost two different games and play-styles, but come togetther for a really unique expirence. My only critique is that I wish that the classes were more customizable (Support can only run with a shotgun, I would rather have a rifle or smg).  Despite having a small player base, it is still a great expience. If we can get a community going and get a larger player base, and the game gets developed further, this could be one of the best games available on steam. It is defintally worth the purchase. Come and join me, I'll be playing this a lot more often.			"

												When I first bought this game back in 2011 when it came out, this game was a blast for me. This multiplayer community was huge back then, this game is interesting because you can play as the commander for either two different armies, and real players will be fighting as you command and build up to help your team win against the others, graphics are a 6/10 for me, sometimes the game can be glitchy and have bugs on it but those are only minor, the main issue I would have to put out about this game is that hitting targets is a bit challenging since the models are very thin and move clunky. Over the years the multiplayer has shrunk significant numbers, you will be lucky to find maybe 4 or 6 servers open.			"

												A cool FPS/RTS hybrid with an Uprising vibe but with a commander twist.Fast gameplay with the ever-tense atmosphere of RTS games makes it really amusing to play.While one of you gets to play the team commander as building various turrets,teleport stations,power plants,supply stations and such,the others get to play one of the 4 classes that divide in to more classes in the game.The game has freaking ZERO balance issues and is as smooth as it could ever get.Turrets are not just obstacles you trample over,spend 3 seconds in the face of an MG turret and youre full of holes and on the ground and its even worse for other turrets.The 4 classes are EXO,Assault,Support and Stealth.Exo are the tough guys,they lock themsevels down on the ground and become living turrets with maximum precision they can get.They are also the ones to deal with the buildings.They use chaingun,rocket/beam.Assault is really self explanatory,but boy are they powerful.They even get to play as Grenadiers with grenade launchers or take up the sniper duty.Support is a straight up medic.A medic that can wield a flamethrower.A medic that can wield a flamethrower that can repair stuff.They are cool.Stealth is...stealth.You cloak yourself and go stab people in the face OR you can just unload the whole mag on the enemy if you feel unorthodox.More points if you use the sticky grenades.Buy this game,try this game,love this game.Really deserves the money.

												This game by far is an excellent FPS/RTS hybrid I have played. If playing on FPS, you can become one of the soldiers involved in the conflict. If playing on RTS, you can be any of the class and be nominated as a commander. The roles of these personnel from both factions, Consortium and Empire, are played by both tactics and strategy. The story's genre is science fiction, which I truly admire.For the pro's and con's:PRO'S1. A challenging FPS/RTS hybrid game to test the mettle of the players.2. Teamwork can be utilized in many aspects of the game. Such as VoIP, teamchat and covert preplanning.3. The achievements are cool. Which is why, players are motivated to take them on.4. Most importantly, the graphics kick my back. They are way too awesome.CON'S1. Uncooperative players are nuisance. Try to play on your style, maybe you might persuade them of the team's     condition.2. Partial controller support. Could I play as a commander via controller? Insanely fun?3. Multiplayer guarantees lag. A guide from one of community sure helps with this one.Nonetheless, this game is worth countless enjoyments. The sale is a maple syrup to my pancakes. "

												This is great game with a lot of scope for fun, a good old 'kill and die' spawn fest fun session on steroids. Under good command this game delivers. A tip of the hat to the legendary Comms, (Gay_for_Ellis, [TAU] Black Cat, Muon, Tea, Coeffus, The_Bolt, MitchellJames and JHolman to name but a few) for showing good team handling, sound strategies and outstanding patience while guiding us to glory (or defeat, but there can be only one..). The method of matched classes makes for good even play with each class having nuances worthy of investigation. For aussies, this game is always played on US or European servers so your ping will be high - from Victoria I average 250 in the USA and 350 in Europe, but this is no obstacle to those dedicated to enjoying good team-based gameplay. The sessions, when full, are complex and engaging where changing class quickly can win or lose the match. There is a small problem with inexperienced comms taking the helm but a good soldier follows orders and I'm here to help the team win. 3 thumbs up to the devs - not many flaws here...I wanted to write a good review and a bad review but I can only do one so ... this is the bad one underneath..DO NOT BUY THIS GAME Nuclear Dawn WAS a great game - pity it turned to sh*t when the Beta finished. Back during the Beta, people that got the game were interested in game play but a few days after, Cowardice took most of the players' ego and then never let go. Exo-whoring; the propensity for the more gutless to gang up in armour - pity that meant most of the teams. Team-stacking; The choice of champions - where everyone with high rank stacked on the same team totally outclassing the lower ranked with persistent perks. The devs tried over and over to create a way to balance the play but weasels will always find a way to cheat - cowardly weasels anyway. This could have been a great game and I am sorry for the development team as they tried really hard to get something together only to have it ruined by gutless idiots that were not good enough for Black ops but not so bad at working out the easiest ways to overcome the balancing aspects. Three cheers to the guys that destroyed the game; you'll find that they are the lords of it but they now just use exo-whoring and team-stacking to pwn noobs - after the Beta finished there was no chance for noobs to learn and so develop good strategic game-play because of the giant egos of cowards that wanted pwnage over the uninitiated. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME; totally populated with tw*ts - should change it's name to ""Cowardly Pwn""			"

												Pretty challenging game and the commander mode that feels a little bit like C&C is a nice feature that raises Nuclear Dawn above the typical first-person-shooters. Not a 10/10 game but definitely worth playing and definitely worth the 10$.			"

												If you liked tremulous or natural selection, this game is both similar and works. Usually genre-crossers like this are either unbalanced or just have plain boring combat. Playing as commander, playing as various specialized classes, working with random teammates or even better with friends on voice, it's all very fun from the start.			"

												This game has a very sensitive player base.  If you get this, make sure you join the ND Battle Society.  There aren't that many who play, but they do organize games so everyone's on at the same time.Aside from that, the game is a great hybrid of FPS/RTS gameplay.  It's very fluid, the interface is well done, frame rate is excellent, equipment is balanced, the level up system works... it's just great overall.I only wish there were more people who played so the community could thrive.

AddictiveEveryone always has that one game that you can't help coming back to, either you love something about the game or everything about it in general. To me the graphics, community and gameplay is just addictive once you play for a while and learn the game mechanics. Another big positive is that it supports all three major OSes that really helps out a ton for Mac/Linux users to play with their friends. Though it's not as populated as compared to another FPS but you'll always find matches at the time being so it's not really a big worry.			"

However, there are very few people playing this game at any given time and with very little insentive to go back its highly unlikely this is going to get better over time.

												Seems to be one server with people in the UK.  I think Chicago server fills up on Friday nights as well.  The rest are usually completely empty.  Game-play itself is pretty fun, great concept and a few years ago it was probably a great game.  If not for the extreme lack of players this would be good.  The multi-player is the only thing this game has going as well, the AI in single-player is worthless.  Sadly, it's a dead game, which is the only reason I don't recommend it.			"

												Nuclear Dawn. Online mostly don't have bots unless you can find a server with some. Anyways The game itself is a whole lot based on teamwork, building etc IT LITERALLY IS A hybrid of Real Time Strategy and First Person Shooter. The Commander is a hard job compared to that of being a lowly soldier. You may die a lot easier than usual It's like Battlefield meeting Command and Conquer. If you are a good commander then teammates need you to build the turrets and other useful stuff such as teleporters but you need them to get some good resources in order to further your reasearch. So this is the literal one game where Teamwork is a must and a key to win the Wars of the game. I'd recommend getting the game with the price it still is for the moment or wait for another discount deal to get the game.			"

												This is an excellent idea, but could use a little more work. My friends and I played this game for a while, and our main problem was team balance. You have to have the entire team coming in with their A game, or you'll fail. Which isn't that bad, but the major problem is the balance within the teams. The commander is overpowered, and most of the time is the primary force carrying the team through the game. It should be the other way around, with the team taking over the map and the commander supporting them and defending what's already been taken. However, whenever we played we would see one of two high-level players as the commander on the opposite team, and they would do all of the work and decimate us and spawn camp us with an unending barrage of the strongest turrets. If the commanders were nerfed, my friends and I would probably still be playing this game.			"

												This game has a lot of potential - the mechanics are well done, it's quite fun when the match is even, there are not many games out there like this, plus FPS-RTS is a great genre crossover. So for that, I recommend it.BUT..... it has one very major flaw: lack of proper team balancing. They have some sort of auto-balancing in place but half the time it just makes the situation worse. There are times when I can  predict with pretty high accuracy which team will win as soon as the game starts - just look for which team is mega-stacked, and if it's not yours, prepare for swift annihilation.

												Absolutely fantastic title, whole game derseves props for what it brings to the table. Unfortunately the community tends to enjoy stomping and raging at new players rather than help them learn. More often than not there is a massive experience gap between the two teams on any given server of any population (they are indeed rare now..) and new players can look forward to loss after loss without as much as a hint on what they're doing incorrectly.HOWEVER, someone willing to do the legwork and learn this game can reap so much enjoyment out of it that despite not being a persistent world style FPS or an arena shooter, it holds the right length of match to take the best of both worlds and give you an experience that more companies should be looking into evolving into a more prevalent style of team based shooter.

Its pretty well balanced and theres different classes to play like kinda like the class system in TF2.I will actually rate this  10/10.

												A very fun FPS/RTS game. Your team commander uses a birds-eye view to issue attack/defend orders and build infrastructure (auto turrets, ammo points, forward spawns, etc) while the rest of the team slays bodies and captures objectives. Theres a very strong team focus, unlike most shooters where everyone just runs around like the wild west. It's even better if you can bring a group of friends and form a squad, and work with your commander to take/defend points (which give your commander more money to spend). The game doesn't have a huge player-base, which is a shame, but there's enough activity to play full matches now and then.			"

												This game is amazing! It is truely a unique. The RTS aspects of the game is very well done and only takes a few minutes to get the hang of it. The shooting feels very natural and has a very nice class system to it. Playing as the commander (Or RTS mode) is VERY fun even though you are not blowing someone's head off. Without the commander the team is hopeless and can't get basic assets. The commander will build Flame, Machinegun, and rocket sentries to defend the command bunker. They are also in charge of creating health and ammo stations as well as providing all the buildings with power. The goal is for ground units to capture resource collectors to assist in building and expanding the base to help dominate the battlefield. As the round goes on you and your team must destroy the enemy team's command bunker and win the game. The game has four classes which are divided into subclasses based on rank and weaponry. There is Exo (Heavy weapons/Explosives), Assault (Snipers, scouts, infantry), Steath (Spies/Assassins), And Support (Chemical Warfare, Engineers, Medics). This is overall a VERY rich game that is WAY worth the five dollars to buy it. The only thing this game needs are players. The community is still active and we need people to create and populate servers. So grab that Exo suit, and your favorite play style and have a blast!			"

												Should be renamed to ""Turret Wars: Autopilot""It doesn't help having only one class which stands a chance against the turret manslaughter,or finding out that the entirety of your team is composed of bots who'd love to think they can jump their way through walls.The game is dull, players are scanty for a completely online game, perhaps Nuclear Dawn had its days back in 2011...

												It's a nice FPS/RTS hybrid. Team Commander plays RTS, others play team-based FPS with classes and kits, kind of like Battlefield. I really enjoyed it.However, its multiplayer is dead. Good luck finding a game. I had to stop playing it because it was becoming more and more difficult to find a server up to a point where I couldn't find any this side of the globe.I would very much like more people to pour in to form a playerbase. It's unlikely it will happen, however.			"

												Yo homies of all shapes and sizes listen up. Dis is my first review and I declare this game is Da BOMB DIGGITY. Not just a bomb, or Da Bomb, but the BOMB DIGGITY! (Put Emphasis on Bomb and DIggity).Seriously though omg, I just got this game on sale and I love it. I came looking for some kind of war-like tower defense, but I found something better. A perfect combination RTS and FPS. I bought it on sale and its the best 3 dollars I ever spent, I would have definetly bought it for full price, or more.  First day I punched in 5 hours. I'm actually surprised by the small community you might find. This game has VERY LITTLE bugs,  and glitches of the sort. Find yourself as a soldier on the ground with variety of assault, exo (heavy), stealth and support. Or, if your confident enough, you can be the commander, which is no easy job! Having to keep track of objectives, planting towers, and guiding your soldiers and assisting them throughout battle. So many ways to strategize your attack, or defense. As an FPS itself aside as a strategy based game, it is amazing as well. It has something much different to offer than any COD or CounterStrike style. It is certainly more strategy that one much pick a class that goes along with the effect on the battlefield. Need to take objectives, Assualt. Need to defend or need for tank, or towers that need to be taken care of, Exo. Is there a tank bothering you, Stealth. Soldiers dying in the field, or towers needing repair, Support, (Medic or Engineer). It isnt the mostly mindless Run and Gun one would find among other FPS. If you are starting to hate that style, this is the game for you. If one could get some friends together to play this game would be amazing too, because when one plays with cooperation, the true potential of this game is unlocked as you struggle through the tough battles ranging fro  m, 30-60 minutes long. All in all, I cant wait to plug in tons of more hours and if you're deciding, you should join me. WOLF OUT DAWG!			"

Overall I wouldn't recommend buying this unless it was on sale of at least 75% off but if you enjoy both RTSs and FPSs and don't mind some flaws such as graphics and horrible interface on RTS side then buy it anyway.

												Nuclear Dawn is another approach of combining RTS and FPS, like the HL2: Empires mod or Natural Selection 2.My brief impression of the game...It looks and feels like a Half Life 2 mod. The early to mid game is much fun, but the mid to end game is tedious.All games i played ended in a turret spam, where one team struggled to survive with no chance to advance. The other team just kept spamming turrets into the enemy lines. FYI: Turrets are hard to kill and require demolition equipment like rocket launchers. And this goes on ... forever.In addition to that, the playerbase consist of 1 1/2 30 Slots Servers in Europe while the game is on sale.Sadly, I can't recommend you this game. It's has a tedious end game, plus there is no playerbase/it's dieing.			"

												I have always been into FPS games and RTS games, and the thought of mixing the two I was a little fickle about, but i have to hand it to the developers, they really put it in a way where i can play this game for hours straight and not get bored. First i should go over the pros of this game, and trust me there are plenty.Now this game treats the RTS and the FPS as two completly corresponding things. You need your Commander (The one player who has the RTS view) and he needs you. As a normal FPS player, you go around accomplishing objectives and killing the enemy team when possible. However if the Commander feels there is something you should all focus on, he may simply issue a comand, and you can see a position in which he wants to defend or attack. The commander also is responsible for building important structures, such as Teleporters, Supply Stations, Armorys and Artilery cannons, and better yet the Artilery cannons have the option for the commander to own them entirley, or for his troops to be able to call in for some support. This adds yet another unique combination of RTS and FPS.A couple of things I found slightly discouraging were the fact that some kits are locked until the commander forks over the resources to reasearch them for your team, and once he does, then you can acess them, but until then you will just have to stare at that Rocket launcer, or grenade launcher until your commander decides he wants you to have it. Another things i find distasteful is the lack of weapon kits, 3 per class(Including the one you need to unlock), yet all of them seem fitting so its not actually too much of a problem. an upside to this is a new player will have the acess to the same weapons as any veteran, which I enjoy, because in many FPS games I have played, veterans usually have an advantage with far better weapons than new players.All in all I would completly recommend Nuclear Dawn to anyone who likes FPS games and RTS games. It beautifully mixs the two and deserves far more fame than it has, I feel if the developers had added more guns and structures this game would be all the rage same as games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, but that is just my opinion, so i will leave it to you to form your own opinion of this game.

												It's a great game for the value, and very enjoyable.

The last one I encountered crashed my game, yet steam thought the program was still running. So I couldn't close steam, but the game wasn't running at all. It took a complete restart to fix it.CONCLUSION: Good for a budget game, but be warned; it's very buggy and not that polished.			"

												At first I thought this game would be quite complex, but turns out this is one of the easiest FPS games you could find and a really good one at it too.The FPS part has multiple classes who balance themselves very well, Some have high health and are slow heavy weaponed and others have low health but are extremely fast and can cloak themselves to be invisible.You start the game, join a server and there you go. The game has a RTS element meaning there is a player playing the role of  a Commander who gives you orders and sets points to spawn and supply units and all needed support.So if you don't want to run around not knowing what to do, or feel like learning a lot of strategy, this will help you at playing if you follow orders and help others.The RTS part is even better, being a commander you can communicate orders that people might or might not follow. You set up a network of power units, supply units and spawnpoints, those are bought with credits you get by your team capturing points. It's not too complicated but can take some time getting a winning strategy and depends hugely on the players playing.Overall it's surely is one of my favorite games, favorite FPS and is the one I play when I don't want to think too much, just sit back and follow orders and contribute my part to the team.

												No idea how they made it work, but they did. they managed to merge MMORTS with MMOFPS. Basically as the commander you get to build structures to help the team protect resource points like turrets, dispensers and so on and they can be various classes specialised in many differthing ways. 4 main classes, but each of those has 3 selections to their abilities (except the exo who has only 2).A enjoyable game and a lot of fun trying to outthink the enemy commander and get into his base. Team work is the best for this game as you will need to focus your abilities to outsmart the enemy and then win the game. Definantly worth a look at.			"

OR winning the round! mSince anyone with half a brain can add something to the team I'm ending a round with high-hundrends of exp which means I'm somewhat getting somewhere!A REALLY solid shooter shooter element blends with a balance of Skill VS 'Strategy' means you shouldn't expect to own the entire battlefield... thats why:THIS GAME OOZES GOLDEN GAME PLAY!!!

												This is an absolutely impecable FPS game that when you play you can tell the devs worked really hard. Fantastic weapons, well thought out classes, tactical maps, and overall a pretty essensial game for only £6.99. I would maybe like to see a few more maps, maybe another class or two, and possibly a bit more weapon customization (there are multiple loadouts for each class which kind-of makes up for it). The only real problem I have is that there is only one game mode (as far as I am aware). This is fun as long as you play different tactics and switch commander (a team leader who builds spawn points, turrets, power stations, supplies etc.) every now and again.			"

												SUMMARY: DOUBLE AWESOME BUT DEAD.Once I asked my friend: we got shooters, we got RTS. Why doesn't someone create a game which combines these two genres? Why don't infantry units of RTS can't be alive people who see the game as a shooter? And he answered: there is such a game.And then he sent me this as a gift.First start was very tough. I got to the battefiled unprepared and wasn't able to run more than 2 meters and shot a single bullet without being get killed. Then I left the game and played all the tutorials - learning many things about game goal, controls and abilities of the infantry classes.Second start was much better - I was aware of things happened but still had to learn what teamwork is. First I was running all over the map a a stealh - thinking that I do good just but having fun with backstabbing. Then I had started to enjoy playing assault grenadier. But any choice in a long term wasn't good either for me or my team. Why?... the only thing every ND player should understand is the TEAMWORK. ...it's not just killing more enemies for you team......it's not shooting the same target with other players...It's understanding NEEDS OF YOU TEAM AT THE MOMENT - destroying enemy structures, repairing and protecting building of your team, capturing resources, providing supplies. Everything requires you to master all the classes and react to every situation, changing tactics and following orders of the commander (who sees a game as RTS). You can have favorite classes, you can be very good with them - but when the time comes you should be ready to swich. If you have enemy at you door, sniping hardly will help your team if no one repairs stuff. If enemy bunker is almost down, your assault riffle is useless unless you defend exos from stealths. If you need to capture resources quickly, you would hardly do that with exo unless you have a spawnpoint nearby. Being medic is useless unless there are some players around to be healed. Should I continue? Anyway, after understanding those I fell in love with this game.THE ONLY PROBLEM IT IS DEAD. ACTIVE POPULATION IS HAS DROPPED TO CRITICAL LIMIT. SERVERS ARE FILLED WITH BOTS OR SPECTATING FAKE PLAYERS.GOOD BYE ND, I DID LOVE YOU. R.I.P.			"

												Not gonna lie to you, right now the game is dying. Which is a shame, because it has a lot of potential and is a good amount of fun even at the moment of writing this. It's a RTS/FPS mixup game and the mixing up works quite well. The game has some issues like matches dragging on forever even though the losing team is pushed back to their base with no chance of coming back or using an XP-System that lets you level up soooo slowly without giving you any real bonus for actually doing so. The main problem is the lack of a playerbase, usually there is one server that is populated and one that is half-populated. If you like iron-sighty multiplayer shooties but you are bored of the same BF/COD all over again, give this unrefined gem a chance.			"

												A deep, team based shooter with a full RTS commander experience. Team play is as important as twitch reflexes in this game and battles range from the slow, steady and methodical war of attrition to the down right hectic and crazy firefights. It just recieved its biggest free content update yet aiming to lower the steep learning curve, and its free to play this weekend! Give it a try then pick it up for cheap ;)			"

												The best surprise in years. I'd put this game next to Team Fortress 2, regardless of some minor bugs. The gameplay gets a bit stagnant after a while, and servers are not so full nowadays, but its a very good experience even if you are playing alone. Definitely worth a try, just check if there are any servers left!			"

												Not gonna lie to you, right now the game is dying. Which is a shame, because it has a lot of potential and is a good amount of fun even at the moment of writing this. It's a RTS/FPS mixup game and the mixing up works quite well. The game has some issues like matches dragging on forever even though the losing team is pushed back to their base with no chance of coming back or using an XP-System that lets you level up soooo slowly without giving you any real bonus for actually doing so. The main problem is the lack of a playerbase, usually there is one server that is populated and one that is half-populated. If you like iron-sighty multiplayer shooties but you are bored of the same BF/COD all over again, give this unrefined gem a chance.			"

												You MUST own this game.  Intricately balanced and full of 100's of open team strategies that allow almost infinite variations of tactics.  A completely different take on Real Time Strategy games where live players are at your Command.  For those FPS players, this offers everything that is missing in team based FPS.			"

												I honestly can't believe this is a Source engine based game--it's so polished! I'm really enjoying the concept on this one. Each team elects a single commander who controls all the RTS game elements like placing turrets and other typical support structures. The rest of the team fights FPS style and carries out objectives laid out by the commander with class based characters. It really plays well if you have two teams with expert commanders. A good mix of character skills make this quite a fun experience.This is quite possibly the best integration of Real Time Strategy with First Person Shooting that I have played. Highly recommend.			"

Call of Duty and Command and Conquer. the mix feels great and is very team based. if you like the realistic part from the quick deaths like in ral life, rainbow 6 seige is a good game, but if you like call of duty or Command and Conquer the 6$ price tag is worth it. a small glitch here and there but nothing game breaking. the weapons are very ballenced which alot FPS games have problems with, the victory comes down to skill and teamwork, not over powerd weapons. i have currently only played a little under 2 hours but im already hooked and love this game.

												The idea of an FPS with an RTS commander isn't necessarily new, and it even seems rather silly in some ways (real people don't blindly run where you tell them, right?) but Nuclear War is an extremely satisfying hybrid. The Commander position is extremely intense and satisfying when you realize the people you're commanding are just that. Realizing that just makes you want to keep them alive.The FPS benefits from the Commander as well. Knowing you're not blindly running around and that someone with a bird's eye view of the battle is leaning you adds a wonderful humanity to the genre. Suddenly you're fighting to make your Commander proud instead of just win. It's great to have someone to trust in the madness.			"

												Nuclear Dawn is basically a rip-off of Command & Conquer - Renegade and Battlezone II: Combat Commder built on the Source engine but without AI and vehicles (from what I have seen thus far).It looks awesome though and the city designs are simply amasing, but like if they won't add any vehicle or some spawnable AI like in the forementioned, I doubt I will play this much.The game is currently in Beta testing fase, so there will be changes, but from what I understand the developers have limited the so called RTS experience to the building of structures (turrets, research, power stations, that kinda stuff).And Steam, seriously, don't say RTS - FPS is a new concept in gaming, it seriously isn't. Most companies just didn't burn want to burn their hands on it, so there are only 2 others (as far as I know), 1 of which I think is older than Half Life...yeah...not Half Life 2, Counterstrike, or any other form, the absolute 1st Half Life...Worth a try though, when its on discount...

Five years since it's release and most days people flood to RedStone(A Popular Server); Most days the server has players(though some days can be quite).This Mod has been well refined, though not all bugs have been ironed out. However, none of the bugs are severe enough to have an inpact on your expience when playing Nuclear Dawn.Battles are immense; with typically 30 players fighting side by side against the opposing team. The gameplay is dynamic, and a well thought out team based stategy is key to playing this game well.You can never really determine how a game will pan out, as just when you're at the peak of victory, the enermy team gets a foothold and the table turns against you as your enermy formulise a new strategy.

Солдаты видят невидимых разведчиков (что вообще делает этот класс бесполезным) и охотятся на инженеров. Грустные инженеры кидают аптечки в толпу, чинят здания, которые строит командир и стараются не умереть. Как играть за разведчиков я вообще не представляю. За командира играть интересно, нужно осваивать тактику. Игру определенно нужно доводить до ума, но потенциал у нее есть.			"

I rly liked the idea of the game but it would have got more advertised and see what people like and update it like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is done nowadays by Valve. I ended borrowing Call of Duty 4 from my friend and played that for few dozens of hours.

												Avoid. Feels more like an unfinished mod than a commercial game.Poorly balanced. Maps generally favour 1 side over the other. Too many unavoidable insta-kills (commander-ability? wtf?).  ""Structure under attack"" spammed every 10 seconds. No REAL way to destroy buildings, takes a large group of a specific class to do any meaningful damage to them. A lot of guns are useless and do♥♥♥♥♥♥poor damage. The most annoying HUD you will ever see. Squads have no functionality (no orders, spawning), they're just there for the hell of it.Worst of all, the endgame pretty much consists of a drawn-out 5-10 minute spawncamp. Spawn, die. Spawn, die.

												I bought this game with high expectations. Some may judge me for this. However, with the amount of advertising that once flooded the internet for this game, I thought that the extra advertising effort displayed how much work was put into the game.I am a huge fan of both RTS and FPS games. I had even dreamed of designing a hybrid one day. Then this game came along and offered both. Of course I had to buy it... only to be disappointed. The first of the problems was in choosing the engine; the Source engine is dated and ugly. Things that had potential to look awesome simply didn't. The menu and interface is ugly. The textures are blurry and the lighting is lousy. Not a pretty game. But many agree that graphics are not the most important aspect. Okay, granted. Let's throw graphics completey out. How does the game play? There are lots of tactical decisions made, and I appreciated how the game was less ""Go out and kill people"" and more ""Follow the orders of the person who can see what's happening"". But what if the person who was elected commander is actually an idiot? Well... too bad. You are definitely going to lose. Playing as soldiers isn't much better; the assasin's blade is supposed to be able to back-stab in one hit, similar to the Spy in Team Fortress 2. A slight miss means betraying your position and unsuccesfully killing the enemy, even if the hit still hits the guy in the back: this glitch irritated me no end.But people will always be idiots in public matches. So you want to play alone. How does that do? In a word: terrible. Even worse, in fact. When in commander mode (since AI refuses to be a commander for either team) you face an unmotivated enemy that does not desire to expand their base and spams non-stop uncoordinated attacks at you. If you took the helm as a commander, giving orders only pains you as you watch your teammate's miserable pathfinding get them all stuck before they reach your designated target. After a long, gruelling match you may wind up in victory after expanding your base all the way to the door of the enemy's base. But it won't be FUN. Isn't that what's important? After finally destroying the pitiful structures the enemy thinks is a base, you will sit back and ask, ""Did I actually enjoy any of that??""The game shows potential, but unfortunately not much else. If you managed to find 9 other buddies to do a LAN party, then maybe it might be kinda enjoyable. But at its current price range, it is not worth the buy. Maybe if it went free2play with cosmetic upgrades, or maybe sank sub-$5 range, it would be more worth your time.4/10. Avoid.			"

You can have fun with this game sure, that is if you quit before the spawn killing begins and the whole game breaks down like physics in a blackhole. If you're still curious wait for a sale, I'm glad I did.I can pull another few hours out of this game before I get bored with the routine.Really this isn't the game for me, it's just glorified spawn killing with a system of gameplay that is pretty bland.Worth it if there is a sale, otherwise stay away.

												I'm sorry, I just can't recommend the game. There's a great deal of glaring problems that haven't been fixed since the 2011 release date.The 'Human turret' feature of the exo is bad. A very limited FOM and quick turning speed. It should be 180 degrees turning but with a speed reduction.The EXO is overpowered. You can destroy people at close range and long range with ease.Choice of weapons is extremely limited, By which I mean you get about less than 20 in the whole game.Stealth is just a silly class. You can uncloak instantly and then shoot somebody or stab them, Then go invisible again. It doesn't even OHK on a backstab.The length of the cloak on the stealth is too long.Assault shouldn't have constant thermal vision. Have it so that you flick it on sometimes just to give the place a check over.Weapons take FAR too long to kill. I have 30 bullets in my MP7 but I can't kill one person with that? Give me some slack.Give us health regen. Like 1 health a second or maybe 1 health per 2 seconds. It's so rare to find a medic or a supply station.Iron sights on all the guns are disgusting. I'd like to track my enemy's head without them hiding behind my own damn gun.Engineers should be able to construct buildings. Commanders don't often put them in tactical positions.Grenades are clunky. You throw them too quickly and they hardly kill.These are just the problems I spotted in my first hour of gameplay. All in all, I just don't see myself playing much of this game.			"

												If you'd like to hear my full thoughts on Nuclear Dawn, you can listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]Nuclear Dawn pits two teams against each other as they vie for control points and try to push their offensive into the other team's base. One player on each team takes the role of the commander and views the battlefield from an overhead view, effectively playing the game as an RTS. The commander groups players into squads, issues orders, constructs buildings, and lends battlefield assistance. Meanwhile other players can choose between four classes: assault, exo (i.e. heavy), support, and stealth. Within each class there are also different loadouts available.What makes Nuclear Dawn great is that it really does play well as both a shooter and a strategy game. No team can succeed without both the commander and the other players doing a good job and working together. I was surprised by how much being a commander actually felt like playing an RTS.On the negative side of things, the whole aesthetic of the game is fairly generic and uninteresting. It's basically all just slightly futuristic war-torn gray/brown cities and cookie cutter soldiers without that well-defined of a setting. I found that it made it a bit difficult to learn the map layouts since everything just looked so similar.Also problematic is that building very often get in the way of the commander's view and I wish that they would have been made transparent for the commander. It often means that you have to do a fair bit of manipulating the camera to see the action.Overall, Nuclear Dawn is a great competitive online experience. While the game is a bit old, I could still always find at least one server with a fair number of players, so it's still worth getting for that. If you want a game to play online that takes some time to get into and does something a little more interesting than your typical team deathmatch, I can definitely recommend Nuclear Dawn.			"

												Being short and brief, this is a multiplayer focused game ! but ! there is no player base! It's like a car with no gas at the moment so even if you think that getting it for two or three dollar's is a bargain then go ahead, prove your doubts.(I know, I did)Finally I'll say dev's did a good job, no 'monie stealez', 'big bad bugz'(the tutorial was a big messed up but I survived), just a simple game on the platter. Sadly it's feels more extinct than a dodo right now.And from here on the TL:DR section or my 'rant' starts.I was lucky enough to have access to battle zone II, if you know the game then it saves me the trouble of explaining how 'similar' or 'different' it was to Nuclear Dawn  but if not. It was and still is very 'similar' but 'different' to Nuclear Dawn. Google the game if you're interested.Amazing concept plus theory combined with a fluid-ish game mechanics make's this one hell of a decent competetor on steam for a low hardware spec game. The only problem is that the mechanics of the commander/RTS are overshadowed by the Shooter/fps. Now all this jargon is for the time when the game has a player base.At the moment of writing this review, umm... give or take two minute's. I literally counted 7 player's including me, the 6 on a new york server and I starring in horror, remembering the previous reviews about the game.An honest message to the devs/owner's. This IP of your's is near death, I payed, played and finally I'm praying that I can get my measely two dollars refunded. It might seem like a really penny pinching move and honestly I won't argue. It is one, though I stand by my thoughts that this game is at the moment broken. Not by design, code or bugs but by ergonomic means.All work and no praise make's dev really grinchy, especially the one's who turned this idea into a reality. A really good idea for the record so kudos for that.I'll end this rant on the note that by no means after getting through the tutorial I felt the urge to rip open the ethernet cable to open the 'Internetz' rift and finding the devs and tickle torture them. I honestly feel sad that this game is in such a remorseful state.I'd buy this game on it's full price if it was still 'alive'. Oh, for reading till here I have an advice for devs. Make the game f2p.I know I know, just a penny pinching move by a broke♥♥♥♥♥guy but I'd say it's words of a 'wise' broke♥♥♥♥♥guy telling you to throw a Final Hail Mary.Revive the player base and to make money introduce DLC with different game mode's. Hell charge player's to be able to play as the commander. Introduce skins to make profits or recoup the losses. The game is there, it's either that or just shelve this IP and move on if it's not worth the while.That's all folks-fin			"

												This was a nice game when it had enough players. Not anymore. Playing as a commander of bots is ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating - bots just get stuck in the ground by a whole team and you pray god some enemy kills them so they could respawn. Struggling with getting your bot team actually moving anywhere is suddenly disrupted when your mouse cursor just disappears. Something just gets lock in your controls and you can't do nothing to repair your structures or help your team. It's ♥♥♥♥ing raw, so raw I can't believe it, especially after these years of development.			"

												Nuclear Dawn is at the end of its life. Even though there are many servers that are running, only one of them seems to be active with human players at any time. The problem with that server is that it's located in Europe, and the ping is around 200 or higher for me. The maps and environments look great. The futuristic science fiction aesthetic works really well with the weapons and special abilities. Each of the four classes offer a varied and atypical approach to combat. The unlocks also seem to help you through the battles, even though it takes a while to get them through the experience system. In addition, there are many weapon kit loadouts available to all classes; making gameplay very different through the combination of classes, loadouts, and unlocks. Resource capturing can be extremely fun while trying to dodge bullets from enemy fire, and if you have a good commander, you will be in an excellent position to push forward against the enemy's main base. Speaking of the commander feature, this can also make or break your enjoyment of Nuclear Dawn. Commanders require experience and know-how of the game. From extensive knowledge of map locations, to the much needed in-depth tactical familiarity required at different times throughout the match, and the placement of necessary strategic structures around the map. Even though the game allows for players to start a mutiny vote against the commander, finding a good player to fill that role can sometimes be problematic. The commander must also be caring, as she or he should not approach the job as a one person show. This commander mechanic is very similar to the one found in Natural Selection 2. While all of these features sound as though they meld together an amazing, thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience, the sad fact that the multiplayer community is basically dead defeats all chances of greatness and playability. Unless you are specifically in Europe, Nuclear Dawn simply cannot be enjoyed to its full potential. Its solitary European populated server whose ping is well in the 200s makes this game completely unplayable for me. Even if you are in Europe, there will be many times that you will join the one server, and it will only have three or four people playing. This is a multiplayer online only game without a community. Maybe the upcoming update that will supposedly also add native Linux support will help.Nuclear Dawn is okay.			"

												Nuclear Dawn is a very interesting game powered by Source Engine. Gameplay is original and fresh, visuals are beautiful. However, playerbase is almost non-existent. Multiplayer is basically dead and occupied by bots. Final chapter of Tutorial is glitched and impossible to finish. I wouldn't recommend buying the game at full price, maybe 2.5$ would be a fair price if you catch it from a sale.It's a mediocre title on its own, however the reason I can hardly recommend it to anyone is because there is no multiplayer activity.

												Nuclear Dawn is, as it's name tells, a game at the dawn of a nuclear war. If it, mostly an FPS but there are a few different ways to play the game :1- You're a simple soldier, on the field. Like in most of the other FPSs, you target an enemy and shoot him down (or he does it). You can choose to have either a shotgun, a sniper or an assault rifle and can detect enemy camos.2- You're an assassin, on the field. You can make yourself invisible (become a camo) and stab your enemies from behind OR you just shoot them down with a sniper OR you use some bombs, kinda C4s ('cause you can activate them from a long distance).3- You are a BADASS tank with either a BADASS machine-gun or a SUPER BADASS rocket launcher. And like most of the heavy tanks' infantry, you're slow as ****.4- You are THE man of the game. You're the commander. You build stuff, as if you were a player of some of the tower defense games but, also, you choose either to upgrade your team, help them while on the field or just go with them.Just seeing this, you (should) guess it's not an FPS like all the others. This one is a mix between Call Of Duty and tower defense's games such as World Of Empire or Plant VS Zombies while being much better.Now, let's check out the good and bad things of this game...GOOD- multiplayer and solo player available,- not bad graphics,- an easy controllable shooter, even with a keyboard,- a simple but helpful tutorial (to learn of to really play, even though I never even dated to finish it),- no stupid players, just a few games entirely made of bots,- the online games are never (well, since I started playing) full.BAD- some online games can be so long and, sometimes, start to get you bored,- some commanders can't make your team win and the online servers don't have so much players,- you need to know how to really play an FPS.So, yeah. You really need to learn how to play on FPSs ;)			"

												This game is a lot of fun. That being said, it needs a lot of work. First and most important is gamepad support. I'm using the Logitec F710 Gamepad. If you're not familiar, it's the gamepad you see in the Controller Support badges on some game's store page. There's no way to operate as commander (rts mode), switch weapons, or select commands for your team with my gamepad. Operating the menu is nearly impossible and you cannot play through the tutorials without using your keyboard. Very annoying. Server selection is moderate at best. Normally there are 2 or 3 servers which have 20-32 players, 2 or 3 with under 10, and the rest are empty. I'm currently running Ubuntu 14.04. The following problem may be isolated to Linux, but it's worth mentioning. After I play 2-3 matches this game freaks out. It starts lagging in the menu (and in game) so bad that I have to close the application from the desktop. The 'quit' button doesn't even work. I'm glad I got this game for $2, otherwise I would feel ripped off.			"

												It's not a bad idea, just a poorly executed one. Basically, you won't notice the difference between a normal fps and this hybrid. If the game had a competitive scene, it would be a lot better, but sadly it doesn't. The Commander simply doesn't have enough influence on the game.As the commander you are mostly doing a monotonous job: place turrets everywhere. It's a lot of busywork. If the simple soldier thinks the commander's idea is good, he does what the commander tells him. If not, he won't. So at the end of the day it all comes down to how good you are at fps games in general, because everyone on your team is an idiot either way.			"

												So far, I can only rate this game based on the infantry training section. I'll revise later if I'm somehow to blame for the lack of information provided.Now, in training, the assault class is straightforward enough to not be a problem. Point and shoot, use goggles for seeing stealth. Straight to the point, no questions, no confusion.Exo training is where things started getting vague. I'm told that I'm heavy, with a lack of mobility, and am told to use the minigun to eliminate some targets, followed by the class special with lockdown. Right after this, I'm told about a siege weapon, and told to destroy the target using an M95. BUT the problem is that there's NO EXPLANATION about which button to press to get to the M95, or whether I need to change kits, or how to change kits. Nothing is given whatsoever, so I was left to using the chaingun to destroy the remaining structures. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the interface somewhere or whether there's no option to customize as a level 0, but either way, it's literally impossible that I should or could know this information. They need to specify what the hell I need to do and what button or section does it.Stealth again was straightforward as far as the training, but I can speak as to the difficulty of the class regarding any of the kits since they don't train you with anything but the generic first kit. Which is also frustrating, since I would like to test out each of the sub classes. THAT'S WHAT TRAINING IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR.Lastly, support training, which seems like it should be pretty easy to learn, if it weren't for not being able to find how to change kits. I'm told to drop a health kit, then to destroy an enemy supply station with my torch, followed by repairing a friendly one. The problem is that I'm put into the medic kit, then not told how to change to the engineer kit. Effectively making my tutorial an impossible cockblock that can't be bypassed.So, in summary, more explanation is needed in the training, as well as a more in depth tutorial on kits and at least basics of how to switch between them. Especially in the training sections, where we're learning how to play the damn game for the first time.			"

												Played during the Winter steam holiday achievement sale of 2011. There were no controls for team griefing, and the game played like a less popular TF2. Hardly any servers were full, and although novel, the commander RTS role was too important and the competence of said commander always determined which team would win.It was disappointing, but understandable that it was a MP only game. The description of the game led me to this inaccurate conclusion (""within a single gameplay model""), but I could have trivially verified this by looking on the side of the page.As a result of the MP only model, the game has a limited life.

												4.9/10 - One of the best games no one plays!Everything about this game smells like a winner. The graphics are good and the combat feels like a polished FPS game. There are some RTS elements that make this game unique too. I've played with bots twice, and that sucks the life from this game and makes me not want to play it. Edit: I've played several times now. There is 1 server going at night and 1 during the day. It's not consistent enough to overturn the not recommended though.Worth $1 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Very cool concept of hybrid multiplayer RTS-FPS, but it becomes very dependent on your team and commander. It is FRUSTRATING taking out enemy infantry in waves, only to have to enemy building materialize around you, and you realize your inability to do anything to take them out.  It only ends with you being spawn trapped as it rains down turrets of machineguns, rockets and flamethrowers as you realize there is a mad god out there that hates you. The Starcraft Brood War Opening Cinematic honestly describes it perfectly, your the marine though : 


YouTube™ Video: Starcraft: Brood War Opening 

			Views: 793,009		

			StarCraft : Brood War is a real-time strategy game in which players control any of three different species battling for domination.		

 An AI commander might be pretty interesting and the addition of vehicles could be really neat, but at the moment there isn't a worthwhile community or reason to play this regularly. It is fun so it's a shame that it isn't going on as strong, but I think the core gameplay concepts are worth further development.			"

												It's similar to Battlefield 2142 (future soldier style game). The FPS side of the game is fun but the fact that servers are mostly empty or full of bots and when you do find a populated server with human players the RTS side of the game plays a to big of a role and if your team has no commander or your team has a terrible commander the game becomes frustrating because you get easily overwhelmed by the other team and that is just no fun.

												I wanted this to be good long ago. I bought a four pack for some friends, none of them even gave it a chance because they hated it so quickly. Played it myself and the community is... okay. They are not toxic but they're definitely anti-every-FPS-ever-made. It also has an RTS perspective for the commander, but it isn't as good as Natural Selection 2. Everything is lacking, all except the concept. The concept is great. The concept and the visual's style are good. That's all that remains for positives, unfortunately.			"

												First let me clear,This is an online-only game. I didn't realize that when I bought thinking it would be a fun RTS to mess around with. You can play bot matches but it's mainly only for online.I've owned this game for a while but was put off by it. I felt that I should give it a solid chance and so I played the tutorial and a couple games before writing this. Nuclear Dawn has a cool idea. I loved that you had a nice blend of RTS and as well as some FPS qualities. Unfortunately you can tell everything is messy and just plain hard to see from the get go. I was playing on high settings as well. I've seen N64 games more visually appealing than this. There's no story or memorable soundtrack, people don't even bother joining squads. When I tried to apply to be a commander. First it told me that I couldn't, I assumed because we had one already. Turns out we didn't, so I tried applying. It told me to spawn first as I'm running around trying my best to snipe and clearly already spawned and so my entire team ran without a commander and lost miserably.This game was just a disgusting experience and If I could, I would demand my 5 dollars be refunded.

												I like the concept of the game, but it feels very unpolished. The camera feels uncooperative and the tutorial has a section where the game moves the camera for you, and it's very painful to look at because of how jarring it is. In the EXO tutorial, you either couldn't switch to seige or it never told you how to do so, which is ridiculous. I would definitely reccomend to the devs that they fix their tutorial, as it is the first thing that the players experience, and is one of the most fundamental parts of a game.			"

Posted: July 26, 2015
												UPDATE: I just wanted to say to the people who have down voted my review, can you honestly tell me you prefer Source over Unreal or idTech?  Can you name a single thing that Source does better than other engines?  I ask because the only reason I can see to down vote my review is my stance on Source (which has such a cult following it'd make Taylor Swift jealous - and it's equally lackluster compared to its competition).  Nothing else I said here is really debatable.  The tutorial IS broken, the achievement IS unobtainable, and the crouch/sniper issues remain.  Even if this was done in Unreal it'd still get a negative review from me.  Of course, then I doubt these issues would happen in the first place.  Anyhow, onward to my review for anyone who still cares to read it...This is yet another game held back by the Source Engine.  Yes, you read that right.  I said it.The truth is that the Source Engine - much beloved by (nearly) all - is an outdated relic that gained a sterling reputation in 2004 as a good engine - and then nobody ever through to question that again.  Meanwhile, Unreal Enginer 3 (or really even UE2), idTech 4/5, or something like Unity are now far superior in every measurable way to Source Engine.If this game has been on Unreal Engine 2 (or better yet, 3) I wouldn't be uninstalling it right now.  But yeah, the engine ruins the game here.  If anyone wants specific notations, here ya go:The FPS/RTS hybrid model works brilliantly in this game.  I have played actual RTS games that weren't this good even on the RTS side, the the FPS is your standard near-future military shooter.However, this is where source starts to rear its ugly head.  Unlike every other FPS engine in existance, you cannot stop walking mid-step.  This makes for awkward movement that feels like you're controlling a 9 legged elephant rather than a human, and makes taking any semblence of aim while your character is moving impossible.  This movement is just like TF2, another Source Engine title, and I can't stand it there either.The sniper rifles lack variable zoom.  While not terribly uncommon for sniper rifles in modern FPS games to lack variable zoom, this is still a mark against it, and once again this is made worse by the use of Source Engine.  Whereas other games might allow you to crouch and stay there, Source forces you to constantly hold the crouch key to remain crouched.  And unlike other engines where this is the case, the game lacks even an option to make crouch a toggle.  This means you're stuck quickscoping everything, or else not playing a sniper, because the standard Assault Rifle is accurate, when hip-fired, to almost the same range as your sniper rifle is zoomed.  Since you can't really crouch and you have the lowest health, you are left 100% dependant on your cloak just to survive at all with the stealth kit - and it takes 3x as long to recharge as it does to discharge.  Which would be fine, if you could more easily crouch behind cover...which you can't, because Source.The tutorial is broken.  While the RTS tutorial works fine, there are two points in the FPS tutorial where the game is supposed to forcibly change your loadout for you...and it doesn't.  The first time you are playing the ""heavy"" class and it's supposed to change your chaingun for a rocket launcher, but you can reload about a dozen times and still complete that section with the chaingun.  The last tutorial, for the support class, is supposed to equip a repair torch.  Unlike the other bug, there is no way around this and so players who try to get every achievement need to take note - THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR COMPLETING THE SECOND TUTORIAL IS UNOBTAINABLE.  Frankly, once again, I'm blaming this on Source, though in this case I am not 100% sure it's an engine-related issue.All in all, great concept, and very good execution DESPITE the source engine.  I'm still not gonna play it any more though, because the problems and quirks of Source bug me too much to enjoy the game itself.			"

												Nuclear Dawn is similar to Natural Selection 2. They both offer a fight mode and a commander mode. Unlike natural selection 2, both of the teams are human and use guns. The game was fun, but it was a fairly unremarkable FPS. Other than the commander mode, I can't think of much that sets it apart from many other modern shooters. I don't think I'd recommend picking it up unless you can get it real cheap. Possibly in a bundle. There are just other shooters that do it better for the same price.I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.			"

												This game has depth, but it only leaves me hungry for Natural Selection 2.Definitely learn to command in this game. It's where the fun is truly at and will help you understand what you need to do as a typical soldier on the ground.The game is still glitchy at times, with show-stopping bugs that can keep an entire team from getting access to ""advanced kits"", which is kind of a keystone to making sure an entire group of game-players can have a ghost of a chance at putting up a fight against their opponents.I think the EXO is overpowered in pub play, making their minigun a veritable sniper rifle in spite of the presence of cloakers who can 1 shot backstab anything. This isn't a bad game, it's just a game that quite honestly is slowly pacing its ideas and came out years after its countdown website hype to launch with something rather generic.			"

												One of the games I regret buying most this year! It fails so hard in its main point, the RTS/building part. Only one guy per team is able to build things. That means the outcome of a round mainly is decided by the skills of 2 overpowered guys setting up their turrets. This makes all others feel somehow unreliant.  I definately prefer OP CoD Rambo-style over this. Much more fun and better gfx!			"

The commander doesn't get much to do, the maps are either too big to accurately command or too small to build in, some of the classes are useless, and it lacks innovation. Multiplayer is pretty much dead as well. Save your money for Natural Selection II, a game that takes the RTS/FPS concept and does it in a more unique, intresting, and well executed way.			"

												I played this during a free weekend a long while back. Unfortunately the claim that it doesn't cripple or dilute either side of the FPS/RTS gameplay is quite wrong as far as the RTS side goes. As an RTS fan I can tell you that being the commander in this game is not at all like playing an RTS. Construction of buidlings is slow and limited, orders are pretty much just always ignored, and its rare that you actually get to do something useful. Very boring. I wonder when developers of FPS/RTS hybrids are going to realize that in an RTS you need to have units to control, not just a bunch of human players who will run around doing whatever they want and ignore you?My larger gripe as far as the game overall goes is that it takes a very long time to complete a match, yet the outcome is almost always clear within the first few minutes. You always know who's going to win in spite of a few minor pushes back and forth and virtually the entire match is just a matter of the obvious losers doing everything in their power to delay the inevitable. Very frustrating and boring regardless of which side you're on.			"

												This game has potential, but not enough to warrant a pricetag.At most, there's only ever 1 server with a substantial number of players on it, probably due to the fact that this game is 3 years old and still costs money. It's okay. The mix of real-time-strategy and first-person-shooter is a combination that I did not expect would work, but it blends reasonably well. The combat mechanics are okay, the weapons customization is okay, the class system is okay, and it's pretty cool to see your efforts on the ground visibly pay of as your commander builds things around you.I rate this game as ""okay"", though I think more people would play it if it were free to play.

												Nuclear Dawn is the first game to offer a full FPS and RTS experience, within a single gameplay model, without crippling or diluting either side of the game. As a soldier, explore war-torn post-apocalyptic landscapes, modelled on modern cities, and take the fight to your enemies as armoured, assault or stealth infantry, using various weapons across ten distinct load-outs to accomplish your objectives. The first person shooter action in Nuclear Dawn is hard, fast and unforgiving, with weapons that rely on skill and tactics more than on twitch reflexes and map memorization. Then, take Nuclear Dawn above the action, and play as the commander. Organize your fellow players in squads, and assign them to tactical objectives. Plan the resource routes for your army, and production of your structures for forward deployment. Exploit the terrain and resource point locations to block your enemies’ advance, and crush their plans in an iron fist. Research and implement new technologies to give your soldiers the edge on the battlefield, and set up forward bases to lead the assault on your enemies, with a full complement of defensive and offensive structures to choose from, to build your perfect fortress.

If you're in really bad states, the enemy can then just camp your spawn, and endlessly kill you, because... well, ♥♥♥♥ you.Edit: There are other bugs too, but they're minor and don't completely lock down your experience playing it.

												Biggest Crap i ever played in my life.I bought it for 1.99Euros and it's not worth it. I would buy myself rather some sweets instead this game.The Soldiers are useless in this game. If someone puts 3-4 turrets it's over. You can sit and wait. Unless it's fun for you to shot at one turret 10-15min.The game feels cheap, i mean really cheap. It feels like not finished at all. There is no leave button when you press ""ESC"", you can't set ""Hold to ADS"". I thought Call of Duty was bad. But this game is basicly comander vs comander. Soldiers make totaly no sense in this game. Bots are locking on your face and you can jump try to dodge but they still hit all bullets. So movement makes no sense.If the turrets had some ""limited"" turn around speed so you could somehow dodge them or not instant shooting just something like 1s to track on you. Would be nice.They would need to take a group of players that actualy play alot of games and make a plan for this game. The IDEA is amazing. Maps look worse than from a Browser Game. The Menu ingame is crap, you can't switch classes ingame. If yes, i don't know how. There is no ""tutorial"" how to play a game like this. You can't add anything special to this game.I tested the ADS (Aiming) on this game, i aimed at the wall and start shooting. NO bullet #NO! bullet hit that point where i was aiming. All bullets flew 1-5cm next to the place where i was aiming at. So yeah.That game needs some serious ""upgrade"".			"

												I got the game as a gift in the Steam Christmas Sale 2011 and played it for the first time about half a year later, because I really didn't know what I would get.Nuclear Dawn combines the elements of a squad-based shooter like Battlefield with the elements of an RTS: One player of each team becomes the commander, who can build defensive and offensive structures like turrets or power stations, while his teammates have to control ressource points and exterminate the opposing team.The mechanis work great if you are lucky to be in a good team - if not, you're doomed.The balancing on each map is outstanding and the leveling system with new perks is rewarding, but you have to put a lot of effort in it before it pays off; maybe a bit too much regarding the small rewards.But it's fun for a quick battle and the graphics look good, too.

												This game is a Team Fortress 2-like game. Nuclear Dawn is full of tasks and different classes. This game is indeed a very modern day and realistic looking graphics version of TF2. Keep in mind it does not have as many classes as TF2, but it still has more, less, or the same excitement. That is your choice to make, but I recommend it.			"

												Excellent.If you like RTS you'll enjoy sitting in the commander's chair and having your soldiers be your eyes and ears. If you like shooters, you'll love the lfd2 engine fps-action you get as you go around securing resources for your commander and killing anyone who dares tread in your team's territory.That said, it's a team game and so -- to better serve your commander and team -- you should join a squad and team up with some folks to accomplish particular objectives. The game doesn't enforce joining a squad which has been the only negative I've seen (other than getting stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commander; which isn't too big of a problem since you can demote him and get him replaced with relative ease).

												I picked up this FPS on sale on another site, and it is really is a good time. The game is a FPS with persistant player stats, deployable structes, c&h objectives, seige objectives, a class system, and an array of perks and weapons. And it is a package done on the whole in a very unique manner. On each side one person will enter a command both, and play the game as a RTS overlay, while the rest of the team plays as a fps. The comander will deploy structures, can issue orders (which generate xp for the ground troops when followed), research tech, and so on. A lot of a good round depends on having a good comander... thankfully, there are voting tools that let a team have control over who is running the show. The FPS action can be fast and intense, and is often a good time. The only real weakness of the game is the fairly small player pool at this time. Not to worry, there are games going on all the time, but it would be nice to see more severs with player numbers posted.  "

Solid gameplay, interesting play since the Commander (RTS player) and the Soldiers (FPS players) need to communicate well to get eachother what they need (Commander sends in supply drops for Soldiers, Soldiers capture resource points for Commander). Other than that, straight-forward ""Charge the enemy base and mess them up!"" kind of play.A solid 8.5/10 I say.			"

												This game has a lot of potential.  The one major thing it's missing right now is enough servers.  Luckily if it catches on to people how good the game is the dedicated server is free and runs on very little hardware efficiently.  Graphics are very good and the network game play is solid.  Well worth every penny of the $9.99 price tag.  Do yourself a favor and pick it up right now while it's 75% off.  Heck pick up the 4 pack and toss a copy to some friends like I did.  This is as close to Battle Field 3 that you're going to get on Linux for some time so if you run Linux like I do this is a MUST have!			"

												Nuclear Dawn is vicious. As in Brink, the team work and class choices as vital to win the game. But in this case, there is a commander in the game, who plays it as a real time strategy game, building the base to provide protection and supplys to the team, who plays the game as a first person shooter.Mind to take control of the resource points of the map, and keep it from the enemy to take it, so you commander can build stuff to help you and your team to kill the enemy team and take down their base, or use your commander overview of the scene to provide all help you can to your team.simply vicious!!!

												This game is a hidden gem. It's probably one of the best strategy-shooters on the market. Playing as either the commander or a soldier feeds a strong sense of urgency and duty, and an adrenaline rush either way. There's nothing like trying to coordinate between com orders and where your dense allies are going. Seriously, it's a great game. Opening up achievements and perks over time that actually let you define your play (scope, silencer, specialized ammo, etc.) really gives you a sense of contributing. Mad props to people who play the /much needed/ medic or engineer.Favorite part: swearing at a commander who refuses to put down any supply stations. 10/10			"

												With a unique HUD system and very interesting twist of adding RTS elements to the FPS genre, Nuclear Dawn is quite the showpiece! There is also a nicely done rank-up system that allows you to gain spending tokens to use on upgrades and abilities, similar to Borderlands or Diablo. And it's got quite a few things to unlock, so it'll keep you busy for awhile.HOWEVERI do feel like the leveling-up system is a two-edged sword as I have come across players who are so far in that they survived a direct headshot from the sniper rifle. Barely, but they did nonetheless. So be ready for anything to happen once you pull the trigger. The game seems to play very fast paced, frantic, and is a heckuva lotta fun! But it lacks once really critical aspect that makes any online experience a good one:PLAYERS.....			"

												A year after release, and a near-dear community doesn't stop this ball from rolling. Nuclear Dawn is an FPS/RTS hybrid, akin to Natural Selection. The gameplay feels like Battlefield 2142 mixed with Command & Conquer. This is a game that is worth the cash, and unlike BF games, there's a lesser learning curve, as simple as playing the tutorials gets you the foundation of how to play this genius game. Running on the Source engine, it's also a spectacle. When you aren't looking at the brown that has preluded and infiltrated this game, you see some vivid graphics, curtousy of Interwave's incredible map designers. There's a way for everyone to play, and all you need to do is try it.This game may be empty, but Interwave is dedicated, and they plan a BIG patch for their anniversary. I recommend you buy it and see for yourself.			"

												This is on of the best Multi-player FPS that (almost) no one plays. Only one working server that I found - too bad !This is a different FPS for the best - you need to gain control on a map, gather resources and kill the opposition. Each squad has a commander that uses the gathered resources to build facitilies as spawn points, recharge (ammo+health) etc. , and he has a totally different role - he sees the map overhead and guides the troopres across to defend bases and to attack enemy targets, which are tottaly destructible (as on your side). Therefore, it is best to play it, with earphones+mic.The game has the standards 4 classes, but it has a unique twist - you gain abilities in between games and different one within the game itself (better class weapons, better health, better ammo).The graphics are good and the sound is good too, what makes you wanna ask:How come it's a total miss by the gaming community ???

												One of the most unique games I've every played. Combines Real Time Strategy gameplay where you get to be the commander of an entire faction, to First-Person-Shooter where you work with your squad to take enemy troops and structures out.What's awesome is the numerous ways you can play and win the battle, from 4 distinct classes of soldiers to unique weponry and structures of each faction.Graphics is good, and uses Source Engine. The sound effects get repetitive, and there are a few balance issues where a few classes tend to get overpowered once they get their tier2 weapons researched. However, I've just played closed Beta and the actual game may differ. There's an in-game voice chat and support for any 3rd party voice provider too. It's awesome when you get your friends together and get 16 vs 16 battles going!			"

												A very intense multiplayer experience. The game is currently in its ""Vanilla"" version and there is still some balancing/tweaking/polishing to be done. That doesn't mean, however, that this isn't a quality product. Far from it. First of all, it feels very ""unique"". I haven't played any other FPS/RTS hybrid in the past, i have tried however most multiplayer shooters that have come out in the last 4-5 years and this one feels much more intense. Even if you prefer a lone-wolf approach in multiplayer games this game will make you want to get involved with the team to hold out that capture point for 30s longer, to siege that turret and EMP their spawns, leaving you with an adrenaline rush and a great sense of satisfaction, knowing that you won that battle fighting tooth and nail against the opponent. Dev support is also a big plus for this one. All in all a VERY recommended purchase.			"

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!  it's filled with bugs that provent even the most skilled player from funtioning.teams are stacked doed  to the team balancer. it haz snipers, armed with BB guns, it haz BBQ with extreme high damage points, server admins  who are putting up do's and don'ts., bots that get stuck in spawns or won't follow commands, but shoot with a way to high accuracy.... it was a brutal game when it started, but got killed by to many update's. Don't waste your money, Don't waste your time. Despite all the time i've putt in and despite the guide's i have made for this game, i will not change my opinion as long as the game remains this way.

												If you happen to have played Savage or Natural Selection, you'll feel right at home. The graphics are suprisingly good for a 2011 game - I was stunned by some of the interiors. There are some flaws though. The guns feel weird (in a bad way) and movement is floaty. The inclusion of ironsights irks me to no end. In terms of size the community is completely dead by my standards (2 servers at the best of times), although at least what remains is friendly. The amount of commander buildings/research is roughly on par with Natural Selection 1 - whch has always been too little IMO. The potental for massive turnarounds is quite low past the first 5-10 minutes, which often leads to drawn out, rather pointless games. With all that said, I am able to still recommend the game, but mostly to people who are already fans of the genre (FPS-RTS hybrid).			"

Well balanced gameplay, maybe even too balanced? some games end in stalemate, then many times ends with complete domination. This game will take some good time to get used to, recommended for advanced players, A really good expeirence with some good ideas, and awesome style.UPDATE: Now that Ive gotten to level 70, it opens up way more at this point. The perks come with lots and lots of playtime. But for some reason, it is always fun! Theres always a counter to an opponents strategy. Playing smart has never been more vital in a a game. On top of that, The level design is just top notch. My absolute favorite shooter.			"

												[Re-edit]:[TL;DR: Nuclear Dawn is fun but lacks frequent playerbase to keep it fun and AI is backwards.]Nuclear Dawn is certainly a well paced shooter with the means of having a RTS side if that was more of your thing. It's not the prettiest graphics wise as it does show a certain amount of age but I do like what it was attempting. The FPS side of things are fairly simple to understand and RTS side, it's not too hard to understand. But now onto the problems that I found with the game.First of all, the AI. It was a few patches ago that they introduced the AI System and while it mean you can play by yourself, the game originally was designed for Player vs Player interactions. And as such, the AI opponent will never build any buildings and will just simply run endlessly at your base, guns blazing and probably would only win if you decide to quit. Your AI teammates are just as thick and one time while I was stuck in my command chair, I ordered my underlings to capture a crucial point that was 5 feet away from the spawner. They gave me the affirmmative and I waited until they moved into the point. Now it takes three to capture this crucial location and there were five of them that had used the spawner. Only one of the bots made it into the capture range. The rest stopped against a knee high fence and stared at their lonely comrade with maybe a longing glance. And nothing I did afterwards could make them move and the enemy AI was pressumably doing the same thing somewhere else as they were notably absent.The maps are fun enough, albeit a bit small feeling if you're a seasoned RTS player. FPS wise, the indoor areas are great for firefights but when it comes to fighting outside, things can be a bit one sided if the enemy commander can just hail nukes on you and insta-kill you from the get-go. It's a good game, don't take things the wrong way, but the AI do need some improvements. At least they don't complain that you're hacking when you headshot dominate them the whole game.

												I came to enjoy this game a lot. It plays similar to Savage 1 & 2, Natural Selection and Empires, only less emphasis on melee as in Savage and NS. It does feel more like a highly polished mod, but the rarity of these types of RTS/FPS hybrids makes it worth owning as far as I'm concerned. If you're into any of the above listed games, then this is a must own for you. It's also another game that has a community which uses voice chat for coordination and teamwork. Not many of those kinds of games come along these days.			"

												A great game for multiplayer with a nice twist with the commanding. You can be a soldier (one out of 11 classes)  and if you want, you can apply to command the team in that game. The soldiers fight on the battlefield like a normal team deathmatch + capture points. But the real twist is the commander, who builds turrets, spawn points, supply stashes, researches more advanced bulidlings and improvements for the team, and watched the battle in a strategy-like view from above. It's pretty awesome to communicate over ingame voice chat with your commander (or your team, depending if you are the commander), who then builds a turret nearby to help you out of a tricky situation, activates the artillery to provide covering fire, or builds a barrier wall to allow you to shoot from cover. This game is really fun and I would love more people to buy it so there are more active servers to play on,  which is the only downside, only several servers are populated at a time. All in all it is a great game and deffinetly worth your money. With the new steam refund system there is nothing preventing you from giving it a go for a day or two and see if you like it. Hope to see you soon!			"

												I traded for this game a few years ago in TF2... I played less than a hour or so before.. Hated it. Now in 2015; with only a fraction of players left online -- I discovered it's actually pretty good; you just gotta give it time. Where to start.. Each class is balanced, the maps are creative and fun to play (plenty of routes to flank your enemies) and it's got a unique feature where each team can have a commander who'll create buildings to help your team move closer to the enemy base.. Really creative; this game needs more exposure! Only thing that might be unbalanced when you first start is the perk system.. Basically with every few levels you unlock perks; some of these can be VERY powerfull (e.g. suppressor) if used correctly and new players may be a bit discouraged until they get their levels up. The closest thing I can compare it to? A mix between MW2+C&C Renegade.. I recommend it :) Looking forward to playing alongside/against you!			"

It's all about how good your commander and players work together.  Assault is good at spotting Stealth.  Stealth is good at assassinating Exos.  Exos are good at killing Assault.  And then you have Engineers/Medics which play support roles, excellent at destroying/repairing structures, and keeping groups of players alive.			"

It lacks in having any popular Australian servers, but that seems to be in global as well, with only two or three popular American servers at the best of times.Still, even with a lowly ping of 230, the game is still great to play. Just be careful going Commander for the first time when playing online. You will not win, not unless your enemy is incapacitated or equally inept.

It is a great game with no super pay-to-win concept or someone who has paid for everything or someone with privalges in charge of your team, it is the entire teams choice and if people don't like what they see in a commander then they decide what to do. As for the FPS side of it a variety of classes with a variety of sub-classes. What else can you say a great in-depth game for the price of a cheap,old game.			"

Come Back to this Really Fun RTS HybridAs hybrid RTS games are generally mediocre at best, I wasn't expecting much when I spent $2.50 on this few years' old game, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥- this is a lot of fun. There aren't many servers, but there really should be. I've got 1000+ hours into TF2 and I could see spending that much time in this Nuclear Dawn if it had a more active community. The replayability is huge, and with mods there's really no ceiling to how immersive this game could grow to be. Why? Because it appeals to a broader base and it's excitingly multi-dimensional. It's a great shooter, but if you aren't in the mood for gunfighting, you can command, and commanding people instead of sprites adds a whole different dimension. If you care about your soldiers as a commander, you can support one another's goals to huge success. Though I consider it an extremely desireable feature, the Achilles' Heel of this game is its dependence on leadership. Even more than the Battlefield series, not having a commander, or following an ineffective one, greatly undermines the team's chances to win. The soldiers rely on the commander providing upgrades, transport, and supplies they need to stay competitive.On the ground, gameplay feels a lot like Battlefield built over the Source engine, which is essentially what it is. Also a bonus, IMO. Squads, lots of adaptations to classes and unlocks, and pretty enjoyable from a lot of angles. If you're a purist in any one area, this may not be your bag. It's  not perfect at anything, but it's really good at almost everything. I'd love to see Nuclear Dawn make a comeback. I think this game really deserves a second look.  "

The replayability is huge, and with mods there's really no ceiling to how immersive this game could grow to be. Why? Because it appeals to a broader base and it's excitingly multi-dimensional. It's a great shooter, but if you aren't in the mood for gunfighting, you can command, and commanding people instead of sprites adds a whole different dimension. If you care about your soldiers as a commander, you can support one another's goals to huge success. Though I consider it an extremely desireable feature, the Achilles' Heel of this game is its dependence on leadership. Even more than the Battlefield series, not having a commander, or following an ineffective one, greatly undermines the team's chances to win. The soldiers rely on the commander providing upgrades, transport, and supplies they need to stay competitive.On the ground, gameplay feels a lot like Battlefield built over the Source engine, which is essentially what it is. Also a bonus, IMO. Squads, lots of adaptations to classes and unlocks, and pretty enjoyable from a lot of angles. If you're a purist in any one area, this may not be your bag. It's  not perfect at anything, but it's really good at almost everything. I'd love to see Nuclear Dawn make a comeback. I think this game really deserves a second look.  "

												I got the game as a gift in the Steam Christmas Sale 2011 and played it for the first time about half a year later, because I really didn't know what I would get.Nuclear Dawn combines the elements of a squad-based shooter like Battlefield with the elements of an RTS: One player of each team becomes the commander, who can build defensive and offensive structures like turrets or power stations, while his teammates have to control ressource points and exterminate the opposing team.The mechanis work great if you are lucky to be in a good team - if not, you're doomed.The balancing on each map is outstanding and the leveling system with new perks is rewarding, but you have to put a lot of effort in it before it pays off; maybe a bit too much regarding the small rewards.But it's fun for a quick battle and the graphics look good, too.

												It's an FPS, with some classes that resemble those from TF2, also, huge maps and mechanics that resemble those from Battlefield. There are no vehicles, this is because each team has a ""Commander"" who builds structures and researches upgrades for the team whilst playing the game Real Time Strategy style. Teamwork is absolutely required to win, which leads to genuine gratification. The maps are urban and very detailed, definitely some of the best and most memorable source maps I've ever seen. The game developers claim they are the biggest source maps ever. They did a great job on it and I not going to lie to you, this game makes my dong hard.			"

												Being a solid PC multiplayer shooter that rewards good aiming and quick reaction (no cover system, no auto regeneration, fast kills)  it is a game about map control, ressource points and the clever use of those resourcepoints by the commander of the team. Dont expect a highly polished RTS part on the commanders side, though it is deep enough to promote strategical decisions.Depending on class, the pace is very fast (Stealth Class) to medium (Exo Class). Spawntimes are about 10sec and spawnpoints are dynamically build by the commander or destroyed by the enemy. Map design could be better, leaving you confused about blocked entries or dead areas, but overall it is getting the job done of creating main chokepoints and sideway entries where the balance of power can easily shift between the 2 teams, requiring each team to adapt to the new situation created by the enemy commander, like a newly placed missile turret or healing station.

												A game for teamwork, Really fun and rewarding with time spent playing and dedicating to it. Well balanced gameplay, maybe even too balanced? some games end in stalemate, then many times ends with complete domination. This game will take some good time to get used to, recommended for advanced players, A really good expeirence with some good ideas, and awesome style.UPDATE: Now that Ive gotten to level 70, it opens up way more at this point. The perks come with lots and lots of playtime. But for some reason, it is always fun! Theres always a counter to an opponents strategy. Playing smart has never been more vital in a a game. On top of that, The level design is just top notch. My absolute favorite shooter.			"

												Nuclear Dawn blends elements of FPS and RTS games in an interesting and unique way. The primary goal is to destroy the enemy's command bunker, where their commander sits and gives orders to his team and builds structures.In order to accomplish that goal, your team needs to capture resource points. There are three types of resource point: primary, secondary, and tertiary. There is only one primary (or ""prime"") resource point in a map, which is hotly contested by both teams. There are a few secondary points and many tertiary points. The bigger the point, the more resources it gathers for the team. Commanders use resources to unlock new technologies and to build new structures.Each team has a single commander, which is voted in. It's an interesting game, but it's a shame that so few people play it.			"

I tried commander out once, but I was stuck with a low level team with them all being below level 5, and suffice to say, they didn't listen to orders. But I still had fun past their ignoring, so that offers some more points to the game. As for the peon aspect, that is fun too. You can go around caping points, helping out teammates, or mess with the other team by killing their commander repeatedly. (i had a lot of fun doing that). So it offers a lot of ways for you to play, even if you aren't the one barking out orders.			"

												Very interesting game overall.  Love the industry trend of blending RTS and FPS, which Nuclear Dawn continues quite well.  However, the game does not handle multiple displays, resulting in mouse panning in the wrong direction (that of the extended display) leaving the game window and scrolling to the edge of the game map within the game.  Sure this can be avoided by reconfiguring ones displays before launching the game, but no one should have to do that.  Any game that uses mouse panning should prevent the mouse from leaving the game screen, especially when run full screen.			"

												Pretty fun game if you liked games like Savage 1/2. The community is here and there, some are rude♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and others are good people who are a bit fun to chat with. I tried commander out once, but I was stuck with a low level team with them all being below level 5, and suffice to say, they didn't listen to orders. But I still had fun past their ignoring, so that offers some more points to the game. As for the peon aspect, that is fun too. You can go around caping points, helping out teammates, or mess with the other team by killing their commander repeatedly. (i had a lot of fun doing that). So it offers a lot of ways for you to play, even if you aren't the one barking out orders.			"

												Nuclear Dawn blends elements of FPS and RTS games in an interesting and unique way. The primary goal is to destroy the enemy's command bunker, where their commander sits and gives orders to his team and builds structures.In order to accomplish that goal, your team needs to capture resource points. There are three types of resource point: primary, secondary, and tertiary. There is only one primary (or ""prime"") resource point in a map, which is hotly contested by both teams. There are a few secondary points and many tertiary points. The bigger the point, the more resources it gathers for the team. Commanders use resources to unlock new technologies and to build new structures.Each team has a single commander, which is voted in. It's an interesting game, but it's a shame that so few people play it.			"

												Great, solid game, though minor bugs that will most likely be fixed in updates. Little glitches like random choppiness or some problems with spawns, but that's more the commander's fault for spawning soldiers into walls and things. Plays like a combination of Quake and Battlefield, with the possibility to make or break a game with good leadership. Fantastic. I highly reccomend it.			"

												Awesome premise! One player is an RTS commander, and everyone else takes orders and works as the soldiers. In practice, the shooter elements are a bit unpolished (reminds me a bit of the original Team Fortress), and the control afforded in RTS mode is sloppier than most games put out 10 years ago. Still fun, but not the cleanest game on the market.			"

												+ Fantastic contemporary & industrial aesthetics, with gritty, post-apocalyptic overtones and a dose of sci-fi. Settings are well-realised, with great overall detail - the game world in itself is a joy to experience.+ Exceptional urban level design (series like Call of Duty and Battlefield should take note)! Stages seem to have a geat variety of ranges, yet never feel TOO open or claustrophobic... the layouts are complex, but never overwhelming. Their large expanses and multi-building, multi-story designs give them a huge amount of variation, and they rarely feel repetitive.+ AI players are present, so the game is still fully playable when real players are absent.- There's basically NOBODY playing this game. Generally when I hop on, there's fewer than 10 people online across the game's many barren servers. It could be timezone issue, but it's an issue nontheless.- Bizarre acceleration on both mouse AND keyboard... both look and movement can be nauseating, and hard to control precisely.- The AI, whilst functional, is nowhere near on par an experience as the human vs. human interaction.- The UX could do with some work, as the game's interface is not simple to navigate.

												I purchased me and my brother this game and it happens to be one of the most interesting RTS\FPS's out there. This concept originally invented in the 1990's and rarely ever seen again is amongst one of the most exciting for those who want a fun shooter without having only objective points to worry about. The classes are well balanced with the assault class having the ability to decloak enemies, the stealth class is able to sneak around turrets and players assuming they have no radar, the engineer has the ability to destroy enemy structures fast, and oh yeah the exo, my favorite class, has the ability to shoot a high powered gatling gun with the ability to lock down and become a turret, or you can upgrade him and shoot magical fairy dust (guass cannon, dont think you werent thinking the same thing). That is just the tip of the iceburg as each class has customizeable features such as armor piercing and along with that comes  the ability to change to up to 2 other weapons sets. It's a great adaptation of a great gaming concept. being a rts fan this is quite simply the most enjoyable to play as. instead of AI or a group of units you get to kill the other team one by one personally and hear their rage from the other side of the room (as my brother always picks the opposite team). it's not grouped units, no. it's a whole server of enemy players coming at you battlefield 3 style and you get to stick a turret into their faces. Now of course they balance out he RTS and FPS by forcing you to wait for recources captured by the allies. Also once a commander you can easily leave that position and go fight yourself, or demote yourself and let someone else have a try. Overall this game makes you feeling good in the end because you cant camp with a m249 behind  a concrete wall. you have to actively dictate what you want to do and how you want to accomplish it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you're going to sit around with a sniper rifle in a corner of the game. the levels are too well designed and too well thought out to let some jerk sit there and have his camping spree. but absolutely BUY THIS GAME if the standard point and click isn't doing enough for you and you want a real challenge.I'd buy this game again any day. and for the sale right now it was a no brainer. literally turned to my brother and said ""will you play it? `cuz im buying it"". Great game and great concept. addicting and exciting.PS imagineawesome is my brother. if you find him in game. kill him for me ;)			"

												This is a unique blend of RTS and FPS action. Each team has one commander that plays the RTS role. They build turrets, extend their range, drop supplies, open up waypoints. All the fun stuff, but are still a FPS player sitting in a base. On the other side of things, as a player on the ground, you are in FPS mode as one of four classes, killing the enemy and taking over resources. The more resources you have, the more things your commander can build. It's like currency. They can't build if the FPS players can't get the points captured, but they need the help from the RTS guy, too. This game is amazing with some really unique playstyles. Each class has multiple roles it can play and different ways to ultilize them with different upgrade gizmos. If you're at all a fan of FPS or even RTS, give this game a try!			"

												A year after release, and a near-dear community doesn't stop this ball from rolling. Nuclear Dawn is an FPS/RTS hybrid, akin to Natural Selection. The gameplay feels like Battlefield 2142 mixed with Command & Conquer. This is a game that is worth the cash, and unlike BF games, there's a lesser learning curve, as simple as playing the tutorials gets you the foundation of how to play this genius game. Running on the Source engine, it's also a spectacle. When you aren't looking at the brown that has preluded and infiltrated this game, you see some vivid graphics, curtousy of Interwave's incredible map designers. There's a way for everyone to play, and all you need to do is try it.This game may be empty, but Interwave is dedicated, and they plan a BIG patch for their anniversary. I recommend you buy it and see for yourself.			"

												A very intense multiplayer experience. The game is currently in its ""Vanilla"" version and there is still some balancing/tweaking/polishing to be done. That doesn't mean, however, that this isn't a quality product. Far from it. First of all, it feels very ""unique"". I haven't played any other FPS/RTS hybrid in the past, i have tried however most multiplayer shooters that have come out in the last 4-5 years and this one feels much more intense. Even if you prefer a lone-wolf approach in multiplayer games this game will make you want to get involved with the team to hold out that capture point for 30s longer, to siege that turret and EMP their spawns, leaving you with an adrenaline rush and a great sense of satisfaction, knowing that you won that battle fighting tooth and nail against the opponent. Dev support is also a big plus for this one. All in all a VERY recommended purchase.			"

												This game had very severe issues with the two Empires being imbalanced and having some weapon inequalities that would offset the match in the first 5 minutes and the outcome would be pre-determined from there and just took a long, arduous 45 minutes to get to with no surprises.However, the dev team have been working hard to fix the balance of the game. It plays wonderfully, looks slick, and is just insanely fun to play with a good team.This along with Dino D-Day is probably my favorite co-op game of 2011. Get it right this moment.			"

It's all about how good your commander and players work together.  Assault is good at spotting Stealth.  Stealth is good at assassinating Exos.  Exos are good at killing Assault.  And then you have Engineers/Medics which play support roles, excellent at destroying/repairing structures, and keeping groups of players alive.			"

												This game had very severe issues with the two Empires being imbalanced and having some weapon inequalities that would offset the match in the first 5 minutes and the outcome would be pre-determined from there and just took a long, arduous 45 minutes to get to with no surprises.However, the dev team have been working hard to fix the balance of the game. It plays wonderfully, looks slick, and is just insanely fun to play with a good team.This along with Dino D-Day is probably my favorite co-op game of 2011. Get it right this moment.			"

												Nuclear Dawn won't give you glitzy graphics but it does delivery on solid FPS gameplay with a teamplay aspect that makes the title unique. If you like RTS action you can play as the team Commander and lay down structures, upgrades, and send commands directing the actual FPS players. As the title goes on sale fairly often, it's an easy choice with a lot of bang for your buck action.			"

												This game is a Team Fortress 2-like game. Nuclear Dawn is full of tasks and different classes. This game is indeed a very modern day and realistic looking graphics version of TF2. Keep in mind it does not have as many classes as TF2, but it still has more, less, or the same excitement. That is your choice to make, but I recommend it.			"

												Ah yes, Nuclear Dawn. Interesting game. Personally, I have enjoyed the moments of this game of which I have played. I do plan to play more of this. Good things? Servers work, good price, four different classes, many different maps, different textures, different guns. Problem? Only seems to be one. When taking over a command stop, it is nearly impossible to get your teammates to do what they are supposed to, even if you are a commander. I'd rate it 9.5/10.			"

												It's an FPS, with some classes that resemble those from TF2, also, huge maps and mechanics that resemble those from Battlefield. There are no vehicles, this is because each team has a ""Commander"" who builds structures and researches upgrades for the team whilst playing the game Real Time Strategy style. Teamwork is absolutely required to win, which leads to genuine gratification. The maps are urban and very detailed, definitely some of the best and most memorable source maps I've ever seen. The game developers claim they are the biggest source maps ever. They did a great job on it and I not going to lie to you, this game makes my dong hard.			"

												This game is a hidden gem. It's probably one of the best strategy-shooters on the market. Playing as either the commander or a soldier feeds a strong sense of urgency and duty, and an adrenaline rush either way. There's nothing like trying to coordinate between com orders and where your dense allies are going. Seriously, it's a great game. Opening up achievements and perks over time that actually let you define your play (scope, silencer, specialized ammo, etc.) really gives you a sense of contributing. Mad props to people who play the /much needed/ medic or engineer.Favorite part: swearing at a commander who refuses to put down any supply stations. 10/10			"

Come Back to this Really Fun RTS HybridAs hybrid RTS games are generally mediocre at best, I wasn't expecting much when I spent $2.50 on this few years' old game, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥- this is a lot of fun. There aren't many servers, but there really should be. I've got 1000+ hours into TF2 and I could see spending that much time in this Nuclear Dawn if it had a more active community. The replayability is huge, and with mods there's really no ceiling to how immersive this game could grow to be. Why? Because it appeals to a broader base and it's excitingly multi-dimensional. It's a great shooter, but if you aren't in the mood for gunfighting, you can command, and commanding people instead of sprites adds a whole different dimension. If you care about your soldiers as a commander, you can support one another's goals to huge success. Though I consider it an extremely desireable feature, the Achilles' Heel of this game is its dependence on leadership. Even more than the Battlefield series, not having a commander, or following an ineffective one, greatly undermines the team's chances to win. The soldiers rely on the commander providing upgrades, transport, and supplies they need to stay competitive.On the ground, gameplay feels a lot like Battlefield built over the Source engine, which is essentially what it is. Also a bonus, IMO. Squads, lots of adaptations to classes and unlocks, and pretty enjoyable from a lot of angles. If you're a purist in any one area, this may not be your bag. It's  not perfect at anything, but it's really good at almost everything. I'd love to see Nuclear Dawn make a comeback. I think this game really deserves a second look.  "

Also happy to report it runs very well (I am pretty sure it runs off of Source) but it also looks pretty good, I have no complaints about it. The only con I can think of really is the lack of players, but the devs did nothing wrong there and hopefully the sale this weekend will help it out alot.			"

												An incredibly intriguing game. From someone that comes from Battlefield and loved being commander there, this just blows it all out of the water. This is top-nocht, high strategy, and incredibly fun. It takes all of what infantry combat should have been in a true battlefield game (no health regen, limited supplies, dependancy on a team, many different roles and classes, each unique and well distinguished) and perfects it. Too bad it has no vehicle warfare, but the variety of situations that will arise every game is just staggering otherwise. Excellent map design, with a lot of verticality involved.

												I feel like I've only scratched the surface of this one but the surface sure is fun.Had the pleasure of a few good games where teamwork really won the day, and when your commander has a headset, and uses it, oh boy! It's times like that that you wish more people played this game. It deserves a lot more credit than it has gotten. A bad rap I suppose from people who tried it and didn't quite give enough of themselves to it. You see this game isn't balanced in any particular way. If a tactic becomes dominant in a match then rather than whine to the developers to fix it (or nerf it) so you can play the way you want to, it's better in this game to figure out how to counter said tactic amongst the players on your team.For example an early rush of players as heavy building destroyers (called seige exo's) gunning straight for your base and ending the match in mere minutes can be avoided if there enough support players planting listening devices as early warning systems. It's possiblities like this, and the warm feeling you get when a plan comes together; whether you ordered it from the skies or executed it on the ground; that make this game one I hope to be playing for a good long while...... If only more people showed up to play ;-)			"

												I feel like I've only scratched the surface of this one but the surface sure is fun.Had the pleasure of a few good games where teamwork really won the day, and when your commander has a headset, and uses it, oh boy! It's times like that that you wish more people played this game. It deserves a lot more credit than it has gotten. A bad rap I suppose from people who tried it and didn't quite give enough of themselves to it. You see this game isn't balanced in any particular way. If a tactic becomes dominant in a match then rather than whine to the developers to fix it (or nerf it) so you can play the way you want to, it's better in this game to figure out how to counter said tactic amongst the players on your team.For example an early rush of players as heavy building destroyers (called seige exo's) gunning straight for your base and ending the match in mere minutes can be avoided if there enough support players planting listening devices as early warning systems. It's possiblities like this, and the warm feeling you get when a plan comes together; whether you ordered it from the skies or executed it on the ground; that make this game one I hope to be playing for a good long while...... If only more people showed up to play ;-)			"

												Nuclear Dawn would be a decent standalone FPS, and a decent standalone RTS. The combination of the two elements is brilliant. Ground combat in Nuclear dawn is difficult to compare to other FPS games, because the combat is more strategic than tactical. If you have a good commander in the bunker, it can be one of the best cooperative gaming experiences you can have. Nuclear Dawn has a really good community. Voice chat is functional, and rarely ever abused. Between the hybrid game mechanic and the quality multiplay experience, Nuclear Dawn is worth every penny.			"

												The Good: Mixes RTS and FPS in a smart way, classes are fun to use, lots of people playing online, tug-of-war action during matches is addictiveThe Bad: No campaign, no bots, looks pretty average, ugly menus, 99% of the time you won't be playing the RTS part, a few balancing issuesMixing RTS (Real Time Strategy; Shogun 2, StarCraft) with FPS (First Person Shooter; Call of Duty, Quake) sounds like trying to hammer a nail with a banana, but it works here despite not seeing the RTS part too often. Unlike other games that poorly implemented RTS (Brutal Legend) into another genre, Nuclear Dawn does it right. The person doing the RTSing is the Commander and only he can do it. This is an online only game (boo!) so the Commander must be voted in, but usually that's the host and rarely will he ever get booted.The game uses standard RTS elements like building buildings that give your men on the ground more powerful ammo for their weapons (the FPS part is the men on the ground). You have to kill the Commander to win the game, but also capturing energy sources is also key for respawn points. Everyone knows an online FPS needs respawn points so that's the Commander's job by making sure there are plenty. The RTS elements are light and not very complicated, but you have the constant fear of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the guys down below and voting you off if you don't manage your resources right and build useful structures and give them frequent upgrades.As the guys on the ground you are doing all the work capturing resource points and killing that freaking Commander. You get to choose four different classes that have unique powers such as a tank that uses a minigun and can plant it and act like a human turret, or you can use alternate classes for each class like the tank using an energy type grenade launcher to knock out structures. You have a stealth class that can turn invisible for a while and knife people from behind. Plus you get the typical sniper and foot soldier roles that have various sub-classes. The shooting mechanics are simple if a little dated and the whole game is rough around the edges.Not that the isn't any fun because fragging with other players is loads of fun because this game has a back and forth kind of like Team Fortress 2 and a game can go on for over an hour. Once a team starting knocking out your resources you can make a come back and it's just like a tug-of-war. This can be loads of fun since you can switch classes after each death and use it to deal with a problem like people camping in a small room or snipers that no one can spot.Nuclear Dawn does not have a single player campaign or even offline bots so this is strictly online only. I really don't like that and it could use a campaign to get you better at playing it. Mainly because 99% of the time you won't be the Commander so you get almost no experience in the RTS part outside the tutorial. The menus are also pretty ugly and the whole game feels almost like a mod more than a full-fledged game, bu the unique mix of genres is worth a purchase for the low price anyways. The graphics aren't anything to write home about because they are pretty average and will run on any average computer. This game is strictly for hardcore online players only, but pick it up if you want something new.~Score: 8/10			"

												When I had first heard of this game, I was excited for it. The concept was kind of neat, but I had my doubts about how well the execution would come about.It wouldn't be for a few months that i'd hear about this game again, but happened to see it reviewed on Gamespot. In being a fan of 2142, I was hooked on the theme and the idea of commanding.I've accumulated over 70 play hours in less than a week and a half, which some may (and should) argue is far too much, but stands as a testament to how truly addictive this game is.

												I like a lot FPS/RTS hybrid and I played as commander too. So if you are like me, you'll like this game.Ok right now don't have alot of people which previously had... either way is a good game with a lot of entertainment. Is not dev fault, so stop wailing about that, and stop bad rating.... tell your friends to play, host servers, and stop kicking new players... and as recomendation spread the game as I do with all my friends.If your are thinking to buy, go head but buy a few copies with friends.

												If you like RTS games, it's very fun. Keeps you thinking constantly. Or, if you like FPS, it's great too, just make sure you've built resupply stations where you plan to fight. The FPS combat is very unforgiving if you've got nowhere to resupply. I've got no complaints about this game at all. Anyone who likes FPS or RTS games should really buy this game. Or buy it for a friend. Spread the gift of gaming my friends, this game is truly a worthwhile investment.			"

Usually I can only find one server on the public listings, if I am lucky, and even then it usually only has about 12 people on it. It's a really fun game but they should pull it off steam because it is online only (no single player) and like I said there is never any online servers.			"

												Really good game. A mix between good old mix of an RTS and a FPS. If you liked Natural Selection I would play this if you feel like a good human vs human action. Ok with a few players, awesome with lots!Currently, it seems that the game has barely any players which is a major problem. I would recommend against buying it unless you plan on playing with a ton of friends.			"
