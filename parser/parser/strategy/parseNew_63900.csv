												OK... even though it's one of the more difficult war-strategy games i've played, i'm still going to recommend it because it really does do everything right, it's just frustrating sometimes when a group of orc riders come out of the fog-of-war, pinpoint your captain and end the game in one turn...... *sigh*.....Pros:-Dialog boxes have (cool role-played) speech.-Tutorial doesn't just tell you to do a bunch of stuff while you fumble with the controls, it shows you how to do it, explains it, then lets you have a turn doing it yourself.-lots of cutscenes.-control and watch from far way with one-man icons or zoom in to see the whole troop and detailed (but simple) fight scenes with each battle.-Magic is powerful but limited.-Gives an ""estimated outcome"" of each battle before you commit to them so you know what to expect.  Similar to Advance Wars in this and many other respects.Cons:-It's difficult, even on easy mode expect to die and restart at least once per level either from a surprise attack or from being outnumbered and/or unlucky.-The healing system is frustrating, yet still tactical.  Heal your wounded for free but it takes a full turn, and if you're close to any enemy units you won't heal as much.  Units dont heal when in a friendly town.-Friendly cities do not generate gold.  In fact, i have yet to find a way to continuously generate gold except ""find it"" in newly taken towns.  This often mean that the units you start a level with are all you get, though you can build up and buy new units with the limited ""found"" money.  This makes the game very offensive-based by nature as there is no point to waiting around to build-up resources that don't exist.  This isn't really a bad thing, but i personally am not used to it.  Experementing with a powerful unit basically ends with ""Ok, now i know not to do THAT.... restart...."" because you cant rebuild resource and get another one.-AND A BIG ONE- When your captain dies, level's over, regardless of how powerful/large your army is.  You're done.  Restart.  This wouldn't be that big of a problem normally, but 90% of the time your captain is your most powerful unit and if you leave him back to protect him there's a good chance you'll lose from lack of power.  But if you bring him the AI makes him the #1 target.  Frustrating.All in all:A REALLY good fantasy, turn-based strategy game.  Frustrating, but rewarding and still good.8/10 stars  Worth buying, worth wasting 30+ hours on.			"

												Fantasy Wars is a game with very good tactical turn-based battles. Nothing more nothing less.The basic idea is this. You command a few heroes and other military units. You fight a lot of enemies and achieve some goal such as conquering a city. Then you move on to a new mission and do the same kind of thing. This is a lot of fun. Why? Because the tactical battles themselves are really good. For example thee are terrain bonuses that differ between military units and make perfect sense, e.g. elven archers may gain defence if hiding in the forest while knights will have a reduced charge attack score. Add to this a large number of different kinds of units to command, many of which are upgradable, several different heroes with unique skills and different skills to choose from for each type of unit when it levels up. Together it adds up to a challenging and fun to play turn based strategy game.The story is the weakest element of the game. I cannot even remember what it was about and i just finished the game. But it doesn't really matter. This is not a game you play for the story anyway.The interface is well designed and easy to understand and to use. There are three different campaigns, one of which is unlocked after you have beaten the other two (in either order). You can choose one of three difficulty level separately for each mission and there are also three different victory types depending on how quickly you finish the mission. This adds some replay value to what is already a long game.Graphics are fairly good but nothing exceptional. Voice acting is okay, not bad but could have been better, although as with the story it doesn't make a big difference.All in all I would highly recommend this to fans of turn-based strategy, but not really to anyone else. It offers great tactial turn-based battles if you like that. If you don't there is probably not really anything in it for you.			"

												7.5/10 Surprisingly solid.It's a Russian TBS in a fantasy setting. the 3 different campaigns have enough variety of units to keep you thinking, while the hex-based missions are refreshingly difficult. Story is, let's be generous and say ""Familiar"" to most fantasy fans and the voice acting doesn't really shine. The graphics are a little dated, but still do a good job of conveying atmosphere.All in all, think HOMM in russian, and at quite a good price. worth it at full price, must-have in a sale.			"

												This is a good game and in its own right is a complete experience. Story is good. Feels balanced. That said, I think this game could have been a great game with more work. Ultimately the units are expendable with only limited rewards for keeping them alive.  I spent the whole first campaign painstakingly choosing my units lives over timed quest rewards, which the rewards are valuable later while once the units maxed out, swap leveling up other units from the researve. Ultimately saving your units to me feels to no gain. The units max out very quickly at level 5. The heros contenue to grow and level, which makes it more appealing to use them for the slaughters. By the time you really finish the campaign, which seems to come after 10 missions or so you lose all of them to start a new campaign. In the end, you will have access to them in the alliance campaign again where all your surviving units and heroes will be of service again with all the artifacts you discovered.  Hoping they make a second game with more missions, more story, and more custom units with higher level caps.			"

												One of the many things which are awful about getting old is that most old people  are expected to and do play mind♥♥♥♥ingly  dreary, boring, games. Lament about the passing of  dos,wonder why Sid's Alpha Centuri wont  run on their computers  and fiddle about tryng to get  Age of Rifles and Steel Panthers up and running.....                                           But its really  neat when something like Fantasy Wars turns up. It's cheap, its certainly hard,lots of pretty serious wargames don't have half this much detail,it seems to have no bugs,looks good, music is fine  but best is that its great fun to play.Yep good old fashioned fun...Ok I  managed to last only  2 hours before  I got wiped out. The AI wasn't cheating I just wasn't playing smart enough, this is a tough clever wargame.I will do better next time.  This is  a very good game its certainly fun and a bit of a toughie even on the easiest setting,Thats good as someone said the harder the struggle the greater the victory- 10 out 10 for Fantasy Wars a hard struggle.....

												For its current price of 4,99e a must buy for anyone wanting to play a tactical TBS in a fantasy setting. The story isn't much to go by and voice acting is, well.. Doesn't earn an Oscar. But the gameplay is solid. It very likely took inspiration from Fantasy General, which is a TBS classic from 1990's. Challenging scenarios, lots of different units and different classes of units with differing strenghts which gain in strength as they gain xp levels. The graphics are somewhat dated but I wouldn't say they hurt the experience. They're still nice to look at. Slightly cartoonish whereas I would prefer a more darker approach, but they do their job.The TBS genre is pretty small these days, so if you're looking for a TBS fix, I can recommend this.			"

												This game is a classic turn based strategy game with rpg elements. It reminds me a lot of Heroes of Might and Magic just on a pure battle focused scale.Whats good:- Battle mechanics are fairly well cut and have understandable feedback (you know why u loose when you do)- Unit diversity is hight and they are nonetheless well (enough) balanced some units are a tad bit too strong - Heroes add a good boost in terms of motivation- Challanging if you want it to (3 different difficulty settings)- Taking your units with you and upgrading them with exp, perks, gold and items is fairly motivatingWhats bad:- Extremly short with low replay value - if any at all- Exploration is a bit blocked (due to the timelimit to get gold victorys on levels, although this actually adds a bit spice to the difficulty to split your army so...mh)- There are no real choices in term of the story, its a straight line with no diversions- Its all 100% Combat, no Base or anything else.- Some units can become 100% useless in some missions (for example slow units in a breakthrough mission) - so if you leveld the wrong units or chosen the wrong perks, these levels can be very hard...- Setting and story are decent at best, often they are fairly predicable and without major surprises - sometimes even uninsired.Too long; didn't read:If you like turn based fantasy combat and you are thirsting for a new game - try this one. Its not a must have but its nice for in-between. Its not as big as Civ or Endless as it has no base building, but it has a good pace, difficulty and the game mechanics work well :)			"

												Fantasy Wars is a typical turn-based game which looks similar to Blizzard's Warcraft 3 graphics, it has a nice background music.This tactic warfare isn't suited for the new era as it uses old mechanics, you have to play to understand what I mean, it's hard to place it in words, I would say it's like the old warfare board game style. There's a time limit as well so it requires more concentration and organization to get things done, you can't just rush things out and have to rely on having the enemy engage first to gain advantages.There're 3 flaws that I found. One major flaw I noticed is that the exp system is weird, your army level up based on number of engages instead of army strength or damage done or enemy strength as in tier. The 2nd flaw is that some of the descriptions of the perk upgrades of your units are kinda awkward. And lastly, a tiny flaw is that the units' user interface is a little broken, most likely due to translation issues, as you'll be looking at programming language tags instead of actual description.Are you in for some headache, frustration, sense of achievement? Then you should check this strategy game out.Overall a decent game for its price, would highly recommend warfare board game users to give it a go!			"

												Regretfully this one misses the mark.   The English translation is poor.  The developers didn't even bother checking the dialogs - you get buttons without proper labels like ""UIOpt_Antialiasing"".   They didn't even populate some of the warning dialogs. It's a simple TBS, graphics are a bit dated but work well enough in 4K.  Alt+Tab causes an error, so their window management code is bad.  Runglish translation sadly murders the storyline.You'll be doing yourself a favour just picking up any of the Total War games during a sale.    There's not enough motivation to spend $5 on this.			"

												I'll recommend this game, but honestly just barely.  I had to force myself to play it as much as I did, and looking back I don't feel like I was all that entertained.  I suppose I'm more of a squad turn based fan than a grand strategy turn based fan.  That's not really true though, this game just wasn't fun after a while, not enough gimmicks to keep me and I shudder thinking about playing it again.So yeah, I'm recommending because I dumped some hours into it and paid less than the alternative of seeing a movie.

												Despite what may be the most generic-sounding title ever conceived, Fantasy Wars is a quietly brilliant little strategy game.  Each of the three factions has dozens of different units, upgrades, abilities, heros, and items to use, and the different terrain types and river crossings ensure that you will need to use all of these features to win.  What I really like here is that many different army compositions are viable and no units types feel superior; you must use everything you have to win.  The story is nonsense, but who cares?			"

												Fantasy wars is an underrated gem for those who like the genre.This is pure turn based, strategic combat. This game is difficult, and especially in the later scenarios there is no shame in turning the difficulty down if it's too much (it can get brutal).Good tactics are rewarded and the turn timer puts pressure on you and forces you to take chances. The progression system is actually surprisingly deep and if you try to play this iron man style - you'll find some of the less appealing abilities suddenly become far more useful (especially vision range).Protecting your high level units while still making a gold level victory can be really intense, and if you pull it off, very satisfying.My suggestion is - don't save scum. Play it straight up and give your brain a little exercise.			"

												I bought this out of nostlgic memories of Fantasy General as it is a very similar game (if not a direct fan-made remake).  Much nicer game graphics but lacking the beautiful artwork and musical score that made Fantasy General stand out for me.  In terms of the gameplay I would say this game is one of the most frustrating strategy games I have ever played.  The (unecessary) time contraints mean that I had to be constantly overextending which got me punished by the AI 9 times out of 10.  I probably spent more time reloading/restarting more than playing - I think the last mission of the Human campaign (I haven't bothered with the others) took me about 12 hours and 4 restarts.  I felt quite traumatized by the end.The twists to the quests that occur at the end meant that thought I had finished the mission only to find I then had to unexpectedly get a particular hero to a specific location to win - this guy might be on the other side of the map depending on how I split my troops up at the start; so time to restart again...   Similarly if I place all my units down at the start I might suddenly find that I need to defend somewhere on the other side of the map and realize that I should have reserved some units for this and needed to restart.

												Like orge battle but without anyone play testing it.   I got up to one level where I had about 3 turns to make it to a castle or else I lose the level.   I couldn't make it within 3 turns so I turned the game play down to easy.   It made the board harder.    Also you do not get enough gold to replace units so I was doing A LOT of reloading saves.    Lastly the enemy units regenerate all their health after one turn it seems.   So if you wanted to kill anything you had to do it all in one turn.   Pretty bad game.    I got it in a bundle and I wasted a few hours playing it.   Would not suggest wasting your time with this.			"

												In a word, Lame.  Well that is the first thought that came in mind after playing a few missions.   The combat isn't particularly engaging and each scenerio has a very limited turn limit.  It is not enemy units that will defeat you, but the clock.   There is no reason for this mechanic.  If you don't conquer the fort at the other end of the map in 10 turns, you lose.  It is simple as that.  The AI is terrible.While it is not to hard to beat the each mission, that mechanic is annoying, especially if you wish to explore the maps and do side quests.  In any case this game deserves its low meta-critic score.  I do not remember buying this title; I might have gotten it in some pack along with other games.			"

RPGWatch's recommendation doesn't mean squat - the game has hacked AI to keep things going, its slow as molasses, and uses a friggin timer to determine wether you've met your goals.  It's just about THE most useless piece of programming I've ever seen.  How many times can you see a full strength unit assault a broken unit and have the broken unit not only survive but come back into the battle? - so far I have seen that scenario no less than 4 times in one mission.If you like bamboo jammed under your fingernails, then this game was made for you...otherwise don't waste your time.

												A Poorly done version of a fantasy Civ 3.  Not fun, poorly done, and just felt weak in everything.			"

												La pulsie, al chile la pulsie. Pero no, no funca.Es combate tactico sobre un mapa y las unidades aprenden y se mejoran. Suena bien, pero apenas se vuelven decentes aparece una mejor version que hay que comprar con la plata que acabo de gastar mejorando las obsoletas. Pa que?Todo el juego tiene varas asi, como que lo castigan a uno por esforzarse. Si gana el mapa en gold, la dificultad sube, tons olvidese de volver a sacar gold. A los enemigos no les importa ganar el combate, les importa ceñirse contra la unidad mas tuanis y cara que ud tenga hasta que la palmen.Me aguevas.			"

												I attempted to play this game based on the fun I had with another from the same developer.  The game itself is not all that bad.  It looks very dated, but I don't consider graphics an important part of a grid based strategy, as long as there is a consistent art style.  The story seems fairly generic for this style of game, but I did not progress very far to get that much depth from it.The rules and game play are fairly straight forward, and it does offer some strategic depth, however, the game is not nearly as enjoyable or as polished as a game in this field needs to be to fully enjoy it.The primary reason I do not recommend this game is because of the control scheme.  When selecting a unit, you use the left mouse button.  To move the unit, left mouse button.  To attack an enemy, left mouse button.  To select varying abilities, left mouse button.  Everything revolves around the left mouse button, which, in a 3-D hexagonal strategy game, often means you will be selecting or attack the wrong thing unless you've managed to position the camera perfectly for that encounter, something that takes some time if you need to complete it several times a turn.If you are on steam for the sole purpose of playing and mastering every grid-based strategy, go for it, you will find something enjoyable here once you get past the difficult camera and controls, otherwise, skip this title.

												I remember buying this game for my birthday when it was released, I thought what I was getting myself into would've been Great, instead; it turned out to be a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ it wasn't entertaining and it didn't do anything that any turn-based game hasn't covered, this is not worth the 14.99, my advice? Walk away from this game now and act like you never knew it existed.			"
